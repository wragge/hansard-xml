<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. A petition of the undersigned citizens, residents within the Federal electorate of Barton, respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> Our dismay at the reductions in the total expenditure implemented in 1980 and proposed for 1981 and in particular on government schools and colleges.</PARA>
<PARA> Our concern at the immediate and long-term effects such reductions are having, and will have, upon the educational needs and welfare of the children and students within public schools, Technical and Further Education Colleges, Colleges of Advanced Education and Universities.</PARA>
<PARA> Our further concern that education, which is a major element in the public sector of the Australian economy, has been consistently down-graded from a position of importance in the development of the national economy as a whole.</PARA>

<TITLE>Australian Capital Territory: Deregulation of Trading Hours</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned respectively showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. That we wish to express our strongest opposition to any deregulation of trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Past performances have proven that longer trading hours do not lead to increased sales. However, they do increase costs, because shops have to be staffed for longer periods. To cover these increased costs, retailers are forced to increase prices and reduce staff levels. This means that longer trading hours increase both prices and unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. There is no real consumer demand for longer trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The deregulation of trading hours would force small Retail Companies out of business.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Extended trading hours would gravely disrupt weekend recreation and family life of shop assistants.</PARA>
<PARA> Your Petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should:</PARA>
<PARA> Stop the deregulation of retail trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory by disallowing the Ordinance which amends the Trading Hours Ordinance, 1962.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications. In view of the dependence on the telephone of certain groups in society, including invalids, in the event of emergency or hospital needs, and because of the increasing difficulties associated with the use of the telephone system, can the Minister advise the Senate what measures, if any, the Government will take to prevent a complete collapse of the telephone system?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What it will take to prevent a collapse of the system is, of course, an early resolution of the dispute on fair and just terms, and the Government is trying to do its part to facilitate that. However, the honourable senator asked a particular question concerning the capacity of those who depend upon such communications, particularly invalids, hospitals and others. I think within the last week I indicated, in referring to this matter in answer to a question, that the unions had made it clear that the life and limb provision was one they wished to cover. I think all Australians would want to see that those who are dependent upon telecommunications in a particular way, the kind of people Senator Watson has referred to, are not disadvantaged by any union action.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Minister for National Development and Energy that, when Senator Button asked him on 14 May to account for the far more optimistic Rundle assessment in his Press release of 2 February than appeared in the National Energy Advisory Committee report which that Press release accompanied, he said it was due to a typographical error. Later he supported that claim by quoting from a letter written to the Australian Financial Review by his departmental head. Was his departmental head present on 2 February when he, that is Senator Carrick, gave this different and conflicting explanation? Senator Carrick, in reply to a question asked at the Press conference, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I don't think there is any significant difference between us-moderate to good and good are of a reasonable judgment, a reasonable parallel of judgment. What we do know is that the Rundle developers say that they will-and they are people who-and that is the partners and Exxon, say they will produce 18 to 20 thousand barrels a day by 1984 and that they hope to produce 240 thousand barrels a day by 1988 so that's 8 to 10 years on our calculation is a reasonable one.</PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, backs up the Press statement and not the NEAC report. Also, I observe in passing, that conflicts with the International Energy Agency draft report which had been prepared several months before. If Senator Carrick's departmental head was present, why did he not draw Senator Carrick's attention to what both he-the departmental head-and Senator Carrick now claim was a typographical error and instead allow Senator Carrick to continue misleading the Press and the Stock Exchange about the Rundle project?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If, indeed, Senator Walsh continues to interject in this place, I have the opportunity to decide not to give him an answer. If he wants a factual answer, he will treat the Senate with courtesy, because when answering questions I propose to treat him in a manner consistent with his own courtesy. I mean that quite clearly. Having said that, I will proceed. The fact of the matter is that the departmental head has said that what happened was that in a table attached to a document which was handed out a typographical error occurred in the Department. I do not think that anyone will say that is an inaccuracy. I take it that people accept the departmental head's situation. It so happens that neither he nor I had looked to check the fact. We just assumed that the typist or the officer concerned had repeated the table. Of course, it certainly was not obvious to me upon that occasion. Why this matter is persisted with I do not know, because it sadly draws attention to what can happen to any human being in the Public Service-that is, a public servant, like any other person, is capable of making an error. If Senator Walsh wants to do that, be that upon him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the International Energy Agency report, we will wait until it comes out to see what it says about shale. I have the instinct that the IEA is likely to draw attention to oil from shale as being one of the most cost effective ways of getting alternative fuels for the future. But we will wait and we will see about that. The continual repetition by Senator Walsh about my having talked up share prices may be interesting rhetoric for him, but it will again cause me to remind the public, him and the Senate of these facts: The shares in the Rundle partnership have been shown in Hansard to have halved in value between October-November of last year and the time immediately prior to my going to Rundle. In fact it was quite clear that the people who held shares had views that the Rundle shares ought not to be valued at that price. The shares were going down, and halved in value. The effect of my going to Rundle was fractional.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walsh fails to understand that the Australian Financial Review ran an article, resulting from a speech by me in this place, saying that I was very cautious, or indeed offering a cautious warning on Rundle. How honourable senators can say that a Minister, who was quoted in the Australian Financial Review as urging caution on Rundle, is talking up shares defeats me. Also the indications were quite otherwise. I am asked why the permanent head did not draw my attention to the error at that time. I take it that he did not do so because he had made the same assumption as I, that is, that in the typing the transposition was of the table from the NEAC report. I must say one fundamental thing when the question is asked why my Department and I took a cautiously more optimistic view than NEAC. The NEAC report had been prepared some four or five months before. In the intervening four or five months, circumstances in terms of available energy changed and we made our assessment on that basis.</PARA></TALK.START>

Although the British Defence Minister says that Ark Royal will be completed as planned, speculation continues about the ship being converted to serve other purposes, mothballed or even scrapped. Does the Minister not foresee a similar controversial destiny for the Australian aircraft carrier now planned, because of the increasingly obsolescent nature of this class of vessel? In what way can a single aircraft carrier adequately protect the Australian coastline while at the same time requiring considerable periods out of duty for maintenance and refit? Why is the Government persisting with plans for this largely useless vessel, at a cost of at least $700m, when that sum could provide a complete flotilla of modern attack craft, such as the United States Pegasus class vessels, which are hydrofoil vessels, which can attack at 60 miles an hour and which have the very considerable strike capability of eight Harpoon missiles to each vessel?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The cost to each individual will be $500. Would the Minister agree that this advertisement, in soliciting a total of $200,000 as payment for tax avoidance advice, would be in breach of the new Act and also constitute an incitement to others to break the new Act once it becomes law?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not, but I think it is important to know about the matter because in the near future we will debate some very important laws on this subject. I think it is probably as well for us to understand the sort of people with whom the Government and the Parliament are contending when dealing with this tax avoidance industry that has mushroomed in recent years. I hesitate to put Mr Clyne in the same category as a number of the people who are in the tax avoidance industry because he seems to have embarked upon an altogether more serious and heinous form of campaign. Nevertheless, it is a serious matter that we should bear in mind in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the wider issue, Senator Young asked me a question about some other statements which Mr Clyne made the other day. Senator Young's question is much the same as the question asked by Senator Walters. The answer that I would give would be much the same as I gave to Senator Young. I pointed out then that although there is a technical legal distinction between artificial schemes of tax avoidance and out and out tax evasion, nevertheless, the distinction, even as a legal distinction, is becoming pretty blurred. Certainly morally it is completely blurred. As I have said, a new word has been coined which represents it much more accurately, namely, tax evoision. Of course this is a problem that the Government has tackled and tackled vigorously. The new laws that have been proposed to the Parliament to deal with it will, we believe, have a very major impact in rectifying this very serious state of affairs which has arisen.</PARA>
<PARA> I point out to anybody who is contemplating taking the sort of advice that Mr Clyne or others may give, that he has to bear in mind that if that advice proves to be incorrect and the schemes are struck down under the new laws, there will be some very heavy penalties that the taxpayer will have to face. However, Senator Walters asks a wider question about what can be done in relation to somebody such as Mr Clyne and the sorts of advertisements that he has made. The President has quite rightly pointed out to me that that would be seeking a legal opinion, but more particularly I think it is not an appropriate matter for me-on the basis of an advertisement-to express any opinion without giving the matter further consideration. I propose to do so.</PARA>

There are a number of areas which are regarded as unsatisfactory and on which there have been some discussions.

<PARA> Australia continues to maintain a very high level of home ownership, notwithstanding the difficulties of obtaining finance in a period of high interest rates. I can confirm that, relative to the rest of the world, Australia is doing extremely well in this area. This, of course, is a function of the very successful financial and fiscal management of the Fraser Government in relation to inflation and the control of interest rates over a long period. Consequently, this Government's chief concern in the area of housing is to ensure that more and more people have the opportunity to get their own home. It will be the goal of this Government to ensure that that very high level of home ownership which Senator Lajovic mentions, relative to the rest of the world, is maintained.</PARA>

I would be grateful if the honourable senator could make available to me in due course the precise figures, as they will help me. I am aware, as other honourable senators will be aware, that many of the infections-the trachoma and some of the infections in the middle ear-are due to infection by organisms of the chlamydia group. The honourable senator should also be aware from the work of the trachoma study that what is required to overcome some of these problems is not only medical treatment with drugs but also measures to improve public health, including the availability of water supplies, sewage disposal, clean food preparation areas and appropriate sleeping areas for people. I think bedding that is 'elevated, ventilated and separated' is Professor Hollows's formula.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am also aware, and I think the honourable senator would know, of the work of Dr Michael Gracey from Western Australia. He had an article recently in the Medical Journal of Australia indicating that Aboriginal health in Western Australia is following two different courses; there has been some improvement in the metropolitan area in Perth and there continues to be unsatisfactory features in the north-west. It is in this context and trying to aim towards an improvement in these figures and in the health of Aboriginal people that we announced last week the funding of a number of public health projects which will be directed specifically to the provision of better water supplies, sewerage works and major works to try to overcome the very features which lead to the unsatisfactory conditions set out by the senator from Western Australia.</PARA>

As far as the views of Mr Peacock as a former Minister for the Army are concerned, I am unable to reconcile those with present facts and the decision made by the Government.

Does the report state that a separate multicultural operation would be inefficient and an absurd waste of resources in a developing area of extreme demand on expenditure and communications and, further, that an enlarged SBS could effectively be incorporated in the Commission's network? Do these recommendations mean that the Government has accepted recommendations 2 and 3 of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts on the Independent and Multicultural Broadcasting Commission legislation, which sought to have the matter of multicultural television referred to the Dix Committee for inclusion in its study of the ABC?

Senator Davidson has had a considerable input on this subject during his time in the Senate and not least through his chairmanship of the Senate standing committee to which he has referred.

I live in the city of Sydney and have had an opportunity, as have many other Sydney people, to see multicultural television actually operating. It has been very welcome to have a new channel and to be able to turn to it for programs of quality and depth. I make the point that multicultural television, certainly as it operates on Channel 0/28, is in fact a way into Australian society for a whole lot of people. Because of its sub-titling, because it can be understood by anyone who speaks English and because it provides communication to certain language groups, it is a means of breaking down the barriers and of increasing communication between ethnic groups. It is one of the ways to make our program of multiculturalism work and to allow more people to enter Australian society. It is the kind of initiative which will break down ghettos, not create them. I will seek information with regard to the particular matters raised by the honourable senator.</PARA>

Information comes to the departments from a variety of sources. The departments have the information provided by the claimant. Sometimes information is provided in other ways. I am not aware of what precise policy the Commonwealth Employment Service would have with regard to information that it believes is required for files that it keeps. The matter referred to about the individual in this case indicates information that may be relevant to his claim for unemployment benefit and identifying him as a person who assists in some of the local work that may be done by groups of people involved with those who are unemployed. Perhaps that information was provided by the person himself. I am not aware of the circumstances surrounding this matter. A lot of information can accumulate in the files of the departments which are dealing with individuals who over a period have different experiences that need to be identified.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. It follows a question by Senator Colston. Now that the report of the Administrative Review Council on social security appeals has been tabled and there has been some media commentary already, would the Minister be able to give us an idea of the intentions of the Government with regard to the implementation of that report?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2612" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Administrative Review Council was tabled recently. It has given rise to some comments in this place and more particularly in the media. I welcome the report. I think it touches on matters which are of importance to a great number of Australians. It is probably true that matters of administrative review are more significant to the lives of most Australians than are matters of judicial review. So, the matters which are raised by the Administrative Review Council are of very great importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The attention of the media has tended to focus on what are seen as the criticisms of the existing systems of administrative appeals within the Department of Social Security. I acknowledge that there are criticisms which require the careful attention of the Government so that we can ensure that the appeal system operates as well as possible. I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that, as I noticed was acknowledged in this morning's leading article in the Sydney Morning Herald, the system is better than it was. In other words, over the last 12 months various steps have been taken which pick up some of the points which were expressed as being of concern to the Administrative Review Council. I ask honourable senators to bear those changes in mind when they are looking at the sorts of recommendations that have been put forward.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the important changes which have been made is that the range of departmental decisions which are now appealable matches that which has been recommended by the Council. In addition, recommendation is made by the Council that as far as possible interviewing officers should record facts in the words used by the person concerned-the pensioner or the beneficiary. That has been implemented as a departmental instruction. Other matters are currently undergoing study. For example, there is a recommendation about the operation of a review officer system. That may well be something which could be implemented by the Department.</PARA>
<PARA> Probably the most substantial change, however, is that there is now a very broad right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. That is, of course, a central part of the recommendation of the Council, which is concerned to have appeal procedures which are totally independent of the Department itself. Whilst the Department still has in place the Social Security Appeals Tribunals, which are internal mechanisms which simply make recommendations to the Director-General, the fact is that anybody who is not satisfied with the operation of those committees may now proceed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The view which has been strongly put by the Council is that the whole appeal system should be independent and that the bodies which are set up to hear appeals should be able to make decisions and not merely recommendations. They are matters which I can assure you, Mr President, will receive the very careful attention of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to say two other things with respect to the matters raised by the honourable senator. The first is that I think it is useful if honourable senators who have a particular interest in this area make known to me and to the Department their views on changes which they think are necessary and any comments they have to make on the Council's report. The second thing is that I think there is something of a dilemma in this area which has to be faced, whatever system of appeals is adopted within the Department. That dilemma is the choice between quick informal procedures, which people want for social security beneficiaries, and procedures which at the same time provide the full protection of independence and strict legal decision-making. The sorts of procedures which are quick and informal very often have the deficiency that they do not always have the strict, legal qualities of a more elaborate tribunal. I think that, whatever final pattern is achieved in appeals in social security matters, it will be important to ensure that there are quick informal mechanisms available to appellants, as well as the more complex legal arrangements in respect of which appellants can be absolutely certain that the rule of law applies and that the entitlements that they receive are a matter of legal determination. I do not think that, even though we have had a very valuable report from the Council, the matter is without difficulty. I undertake that the matter will be given the most careful consideration by the Government.</PARA>

There exist today three bodies, each of them separate and each of them able to pursue its subjective and special interests and submit its reports separately to the Tertiary Education Commission.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wonder again whether Senator Keeffe is under a misunderstanding. The Tertiary Education Commission in its report drew attention to the fact that in Australia there are now some 30 individual colleges of advanced education-most of them being single purpose teacher training colleges which were small and which, for various reasons, were moving towards non-viability-and stated that they should be rationalised. This refers to 30 individual institutions. The rationalisation suggestion is that they may be absorbed into administrative groups with, say, three or four colleges coming together in the one group, or in some cases a college and a university coming under an overall umbrella administration. The Commonwealth Government accepted the recommendation of the Review of Commonwealth Functions committee that such a rationalisation, in line with the report of the Tertiary Education Commission, should take place. But it is not my understanding at all that this will affect in any way the structure of the Tertiary Education Commission. If it is specific as to the James Cook University and the CAE in Townsville, I would be happy to obtain an answer in relation to that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some information from the Minister in regard to this matter. The proposal which was outlined-I think Senator Lewis mentioned Captain Noble-in the Bulletin last week is similar to but not identical with the Westernport-Devonport option considered by the Bureau of Transport Economics in its report 'Demand For Sea Passenger Transport Between Tasmania And The Australian Mainland'. The Bureau concluded that the best option for providing sea passenger services between the mainland and Tasmania was to use two vessels which would each carry 200 passengers and 75 accompanied vehicles between Westernport and Burnie. This service would carry passengers by day and cargo at night. It is conceived as being a low crewing, no frills type of operation. The Minister has obtained the views of ship operators on the Bureau's conclusions, but ANL has advised the Minister that it considers the Westernport-Burnie option not yet commercially viable. Consequently he indicates that the savings, which Senator Lewis implied in his question, would not be available.</PARA></TALK.START>

The matter is not settled. It is not the practice of government to outline specific Budget provisions prior to the presentation of the documents to the Parliament in August.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday last, 2 June 1981, a number of women, some accompanied by children, demonstrated in King's Hall. Due to their behaviour, the Speaker and I gave instructions for the police to be called into the building in sufficient number to remove the demonstrators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Later that day, Senator Georges and Senator Melzer questioned me concerning the matter. As I have already stated, our decision to order their removal was not taken lightly, but was made after careful consideration of the circumstances, and was only implemented after four requests over approximately one hour for the demonstrators to leave the building and choose a deputation to put their case by seeking interviews with senators and members.</PARA>
<PARA> The Security Co-ordinator has reported to me that just prior to the police moving in, the demonstrators, who were seated on the floor, formed themselves into a block. At this stage the majority of the women with children left the building. When the police moved in they attemped to pick up individuals to remove them. Most of those struggled violently. As a result of the struggling, a number of the women could not be picked up and were dragged across King's Hall to the stairs. Some suffered falls on the stairs.</PARA>
<PARA> The Security Co-ordinator reports that excessive force was not used by the police. He considers that in the circumstances they were most restrained in the face of some very severe provocation and that they carried out their duties in a manner which reflected great credit upon them.</PARA>
<PARA> When the demonstrators were cleared from the front of the House people who had legitimate business in the House were permitted to enter. Included amongst these were a number of school children, and people who had tickets to the galleries. I am informed that the Security Co-ordinator gave instructions that such people were to be admitted, and that demonstrators were to be kept out. Due to the pressure of the occasion or some misunderstanding, some people who sought entry were not admitted to the House. It appears that appropriate contact was not made between the attendants and the office they sought to visit. Inquiries are being made into this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> In response to the other question raised later in the day by Senator Georges when speaking on the report of the Australian Federal Police, I advice that the Security Co-ordinator is responsible for othe administration of security in Parliament House and for the development of security policy proposals for submission to the Presiding Officers. He is senior to the Usher of the Black Rod and the Serjeant-at-Arms. However, he is required to consult Black Rod and the Serjeant-at-Arms prior to the submission of policy proposals. I have, of course, kept under review the appropriateness of these arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to Senator Georges's remarks concerning Black Rod protecting the senator's rights, I am informed that at Senator Georges's request, Black Rod did remind the senior police officer present of the orders of the Presiding Officers to use only such force as was considered necessary to remove the demonstrators. Black Rod formed the impression that Senator Georges was satisfied with that intervention.</PARA>

<PARA> All officers in the Security Section were invited to participate in the training courses.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Melzer also sought information on the effectiveness of the courses and of current security measures.</PARA>
<PARA> The training courses were arranged to give group instruction by Federal Police, security advisers and professional officers in the proper performance of the functions allocated to the Security Section.

<PARA> I am concerned about some of the statements that have been made. In your statement you say that you have been advised by the Secretary of the Joint House Department, in response to my question of the other day as to whether any threat was made to the people who attended the meeting concerning the matter in question, that no such threat was made. You state:</PARA>
<PARA> Officers of the Security Section have been informed that if any difficulties arise with their conditions of employment, it is expected that they will be raised and endeavoured to be settled within the Department before being referred to their union. They have also been informed that the raising of problems involving Departmental administration and organisation with individual Members or Senators was not acceptable; and that departures from those procedures would attract disciplinary action. </PARA>
<PARA>In the opening words of that paragraph the Secretary of the Joint House Department has said that no such threat was made and that if any member of the Joint House Department approached a member or senator it would not be acceptable and departures from procedures laid down would attract disciplinary action. I ask honourable senators: If that is not a threat, what is? The statement adds:</PARA>
<PARA> Any officer who considers he has been disadvantaged has the opportunity to raise that grievance through prescribed Departmental procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not dwell on that because now that your statement has been noted, Mr President, it will go on to the Notice Paper and the responsible union will have the opportunity to read it. No doubt some discussions will be held, if not with you with the person who takes over your duties as President, and also with the Secretary of the Joint House Department. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that this problem of the Secretary of the Joint House Department taking it upon himself to say that disciplinary action will be taken against people who work in this place if they approach a senator or a member will be quickly ironed out. In my view, every citizen of Australia has the right to approach a member of parliament if he has a problem. That is what we are paid for by the taxpayers. I think that for any person such as the Secretary of the Joint House Department to take it upon himself to say that any employees of this Parliament will attract disciplinary action if they go to their member of parliament is a matter of grave concern to all of us. I will be having more to say about that in the Budget session. I know that Senator Melzer wants to make some remarks in relation to the matter. As I have said, I hope that when we come back for the Budget session this matter will be brought on for full debate so that we can do all we can, as you have done in the time you have been here, Mr President, to protect the interests of people who work in this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator McLaren that this statement is very disturbing. I do not know how we can accept a statement which purports to say that no threats have or will be made, but finishes up by pointing out that if attendants in this building take certain steps and speak to a member or a senator then disciplinary action will be taken. If that is not a threat, I do not know what is. The implied threat that matters must be raised with the Department before being referred to the union must, I believe, cut across International Labour Organisation conventions which have been accepted in Australia and other parts of the world for a very long time. I cannot understand how we can be expected to accept that people who work in this place are different from people who work outside in the way they should approach members of parliament. All who sit in this place would have spent a considerable amount of time listening to the complaints and worries of public servants and people in private industry about their place of employment, their conditions of employment and the sort of relationship they have with their employers. Does this statement mean that the attendants who work in this place and who are citizens of the Australian Capital Territory are different in some way and must not approach senators or members from the Australian Capital Territory for assistance or advice? That can certainly be inferred from this statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of whether the permanent attendants in this place were invited to take part in the security training courses, and whether they could then gain promotion, this statement is less than satisfactory. When I asked whether permanent officers were given the opportunity to attend the training courses the answer was given that they were all invited to participate. However, this statement contains no material on how many participated or how they fared with the course. I am not terribly interested in whether the courses were favourably commented upon by the participants, but I am a little concerned about the material in the training course. Part of the statement says that the officers are taught to identify persons entering non-public areas et cetera. One of the extraordinary things about this place since we have had security officers on all the doors is that the only people in this place who do not know the members and senators appear to be the security officers. If ever a member or senator is pulled up and asked where they are going, it is sure to be done by one of the people with grey ties who, I am led to believe, are security officers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or a policeman who pushes one to one side. The courses may be favourably commented upon but from my observations I am not so sure that the result is as good as we would be led to believe. I would like to know how many of the permanent attendants in this place were accepted into the courses and so were able to gain some sort of promotion. From my observations there have not been many. Those of us who have been here for even a little time get to know the permanent staff, and none of them appear to have been promoted to those positions. I must say that what worries me about this whole security area, and has done so from the beginning, is that it appears to be quite outside our control and our understanding. We do not appear to be given a great deal of information about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know, and have never met, this grey eminence who is the security supervisor. His name is not quite known to me. Yet he appears to have tremendous power. I give as an instance of the sort of thing that I am afraid might be happening in this place that yesterday at the beginning of the lunch break I met a person in the corridor whom I had met in connection with a committee which met last week in this place. He was very agitated. He said that he had a pass to come back and sit in the President's Gallery during the afternoon session of the Senate. He said he had been working in Parliament House with people all morning and that he wanted to go out and change his clothes so that he could come back showing proper respect for the Senate. He had gone to the Senate side door and had been told by the security officer that he could go out but that he would not get back in. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, he had a pass and an invitation to your Gallery, Mr President. When he asked why he would not be allowed back in he was told: 'Because your sort are not getting back in here'. So I went to the door and asked the attendant why this person would not be allowed back in. He said: 'As long as he has a pass he can come in'. I said: 'Why did you tell him that he could not come back?' He said: 'Because he will come back with other scruffy people'. I said: 'He has a pass; he has an invitation, and I suggest that when he gets back to this door you let him in or you advise me, for instance, that he is there and give me some reason why he should not be allowed in'. If that person had not met someone he knew in the corridor, presumably he would have gone out the door and he would not have come back. Who would have made a decision? It would have been some little attendant standing at the door. It seems to me to be extraordinary that we are getting to the position where these strange grey people in this place, on their say-so, have the sort of power to prevent people coming in. It worries me that this sort of power is presumably being given to people in the Joint House Department or that people in the Joint House Department are taking that sort of power. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr President, I find it extraordinary that the first statement you put down today was put to one side. Some comments were made in relation to that statement. I could have spoken to those comments. However, in doing so, I might have related my remarks to the statement and that would have been out of order. I wish to refer to a section of that statement only to make a personal explanation. The last paragraph states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to Senator Georges's remarks concerning Black Rod protecting senator's rights, I am informed that at Senator Georges's request, Black Rod did remind the senior police officer present of the order of the Presiding Officers to use only such force as was considered necessary to remove the demonstrators. Black Rod formed the impression that Senator Georges was satisfied what that intervention. </PARA>
<PARA>My personal explanation is that I was satisfied only with that part which protected my rights and which had nothing to do with the subsequent and continuing behaviour of police. If that is the impression that was given, I want to correct it. My only satisfaction was that when I was being pushed to one side by the police, the Usher of the Black Rod came to my assistance and for that reason I was satisfied with his intervention. The role of the Black Rod should be subjected to considerable debate. That follows from some of the matters Senator Melzer and Senator McLaren raised but to remark on it would be going beyond making a personal explanation. I wish to make perfectly clear the level and the extent of my satisfaction. I was satisfied only that Black Rod protected my rights when those rights were being interfered with by the police. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the other events, the comments I made yesterday about undue violence stand and I add: The explanation given by the Security Co-ordinator in this place reminds me of the explanations that are made by the Commissioner of Police in Brisbane every time his police are involved in violent incidents. He protects the police. The Security Co-ordinator, I do not doubt, would be so inclined to do. He was previously Commissioner of Police in the Northern Territory. His sympathies would be with the police, as they always have been. Perhaps that is his right. I make it clear that I think Black Rod did his duty to protect my rights but he was not able to do anything about protecting the rights of the people in King's Hall because someone else had the authority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the information of honourable senators I present the third annual report of the Department of the Parliamentary Library for the calendar year 1980. The report makes it clear that this Parliament has library and research services which serve it in an excellent manner and which rank amongst the best of their kind to be found anywhere. Much attention is given by the Library to forward planning, taking into account the need of modern democratic institutions for reliable, accurate and prompt information services, free of bias or partisan views, and accessible beyond the limits of this building, the proposed new building or even this city.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently, other parliamentary libraries have started to explore with our Library ways in which they could share resources through computerised network systems. Such an arrangement would benefit all participants and greatly enhance the amount of relevant information available.

I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak to that motion because otherwise no opportunity is available to speak briefly about that report. Honourable senators can see that it is extraordinary that this morning three important statements were made by the President and we are limited by the advice of the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) as to time because of the pressure of legislation. When speaking to this report we could have debated the possibility that the Parliamentary Library may be moved out of this building during the parliamentary recess. It seems to me that this report ought to be brought forward for debate before the sitting concludes. It seems to me that certain powers have been taken by a variety of people and even by the Presiding Officers without reference to and debate in the Parliament or consideration of the wishes of the Parliament. The Library report is important because of that very strong suggestion that substantial sections of the Library be moved from Parliament House to the annexes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite a number of members here have a contrary view and would like to express that contrary view. For that reason, I am speaking to the motion. The motion is, of course, that it be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting. In speaking to the motion, I am suggesting that 'the next day of sitting' should be the next day of sitting and that we should not follow the form which we usually follow which means that the item goes on to the bottom of the Notice Paper. We will not debate it until we come back in the next session. In the meantime the Presiding Officers may have taken certain irreversible decisions. I do not think those decisions ought to be taken without the Parliament-members and senators-debating it. I suggest to the Minister that in this case 'the next day of sitting' should be one of the days in this session, before we get up next Friday, which I think is the intended date. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the motion, I think that you, Mr President, will concede there has been some apprehension about the future of the Parliamentary Library. A number of questions have been asked from both sides of the Parliament in both Houses about the future of the Library. Concern has been expressed that, when the Parliament is no longer in session, some action may be taken which would drastically alter the existing arrangements, which provide for the use of the services of the Library and which are very germane to the efficient functioning of the Parliament. When some of these matters were raised during the Estimates Committee hearing on 27 April and answers were given by Mr Jorgensen, the Secretary of the Joint House Department and Mr Weir, the Parliamentary Librarian, concern and fear were expressed that, when the Parliament went into recess, members and senators would not have the opportunity of making any comments about how the Parliament conceived the role that the Library should play in the building, having regard to the accommodation problems that exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I had prepared a question, which I did not raise today as I was intending to raise it tomorrow. In that question I am seeking from you, Mr President, an assurance that no action would be taken during the parliamentary recess to make any substantial change to the Parliamentary Library. I refer specifically to the problems that would develop if unilateral action was taken. The Opposition has been saying, in relation to the two matters that you have raised today, Mr President-the security of the building and the handling of citizens in King's Hall-that an appreciation has developed by the Presiding Officers that they are in charge of the Parliament as a building. But they also have an obligation to the Executive and to the Parliament. Whilst I do not want to canvass the difficulties that developed here on Tuesday, it seems to me that decisions are being taken which reflect upon the responsibilities, as we see them on this side of the House, to the Parliament as distinct from the Government and the Executive. After all, this is Parliament House; it is not Government House. As such, the Parliament ought to be consulted more than it is. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate that, from the point of view of day to day administration of the Parliament, the Presiding Officers have assumed an air of responsibility. In some cases they have been delegated that responsibility. Nevertheless, the way in which that responsibility is carried out, especially if it ignores the views of the Parliament-I think we are in an area of distinction and differentiation-must mean that the Parliament has from time to time to assert its views on those matters. That is why I believe that the view that has been expressed by Senator Georges is a correct one. It recognises that, although we are in the dying days of the Autumn session, that does not remove from us our responsibilities to assert our rights as members of parliament. It does not, therefore, leave to the Presiding Officers a belief that they are acting on our behalf, no matter how well intentioned they may be in taking on those responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is important, in respect of the very unsatisfactory arrangements that developed, the unsatisfactory actions that took place on Tuesday, and even in relation to the matters that Senator Melzer and Senator McLaren referred to as well as the Library, to realise that the Parliament is being by-passed and is not being consulted. It is being treated with a certain amount of disrespect. It may not be wilful on your part, Mr President, but in practice the Parliament is not being given an opportunity to make decisions. The reason for that is that legislative indigestion is upon us. We have too much to discuss. I do not know whose fault that is, but I certainly know that it is not the fault of the Opposition. It is the fault of the Government if it has left its legislative program to be completed in the last week or two of this session. But that ought not to be the excuse or the reason why the Parliament cannot discuss these three related matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I would not want to put any particular emphasis on which issues are important because I believe all three of them are. On our side of the House, there is certainly concern about the role which the Joint House Department takes upon itself. If it acts properly, as it believes it is, that ought to be a matter for discussion by the Parliament. If the Presiding Officers are acting, as they believe, in the best interests of the Parliament, that is a matter that ought to be discussed by the Parliament. We have extraordinary circumstances in respect of the Library and your position, Mr President, as a retiring senator after a distinguished career in the Senate. Will you be able to exercise the sort of protection and jurisdiction that needs to be exercised in respect of this matter of the Library or will a unilateral decision be taken by other persons allegedly acting on our behalf, without our having an opportunity to express that point of view? This has been discussed in our Party room and I know that it has been discussed in the lobbies. I know that there is concern felt about this matter in all sectors of the Parliament. I think Senator Georges is correct in suggesting that time ought to be set aside to examine these matters unless, of course, Mr President, you are able to give us an assurance that we will be consulted, that no decisions will be taken between the end of next week and 18 August, when we resume, that will take away the rights of the Parliament. I see the Presiding Officers, the Joint House Department, the Library and all the security co-ordinators as servants of the Parliament and as acting on our behalf. These are matters that ought to be--</PARA>

If that assurance is unable to be given, I suggest that the motion should be that the next day of sitting be the next day of sitting and not the procedural motion, which we know puts it at the bottom of the Notice Paper, so that it may never be discussed by the Parliament. Let us face it: We are dealing with an interpretation of the words 'the next day of sitting'. They could be interpreted to mean that this issue will never be discussed by the Parliament. I do not believe that the Parliament should be placed in that secondary role. Therefore, I am asking you, Mr President, whether you can give me an assurance that that will not be the case. If you cannot, will you negotiate with the Government about ensuring that these matters will be more adequately debated during the next four or five sitting days?</PARA></TALK.START>

There is a strong rumour about that the Library and the Parliamentary Reporting Staff are to be brought under the control and supervision of the Joint House Department. I hope that those matters can be debated as early as possible. As Senator Gietzelt has said, the Senate will be rising shortly. Those sorts of matters could be accomplished in the next two months without the Parliament being considered.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish briefly to supplement the remarks of Senator Gietzelt and Senator Melzer. I wish only to say that the Senate will be going into a sort of limbo for a period. I appreciate that, in some of its field activities, a task force of which Senators Melzer, Chipp and Young were members and which looked at the broad aspect of administration felt that there was a considerable amount of authoritarianism in the House of Representatives section on the part of one or two people whom I am not prepared to name at the moment. It can be said that the Senate's task force resisted the attitude of such people who believed that they should not be questioned. To put it in blunt terms, part of our exercise was to protect the Parliamentary Library to ensure that we continue to get maximum use from it. We felt that if there had to be sacrifices concerning space other targets could well be handled and disposed of. I will not say any more on the matter. I think it can be said that there is considerable evidence of a Rip Van Winkle attitude being adopted by people on the other side of King's Hall. As Senator Melzer has said, it is regrettable that there may be an attempt to execute a coup d'etat. I think members of the community should, in the words of Hugh Gaitskell, fight and fight again to resist that coup d'etat.</PARA></TALK.START>

In 1977, recognising the need for a thoroughgoing investigation of domestic aviation policy, the Government commissioned the Domestic Air Transport Policy Review. Following the release of the report in 1978 the Government indicated its acceptance of the basic thrust of the recommendations, that is, the maintenance of the two-airline policy and the introduction of measures designed to increase competition within the industry. There is a substantial number of other recommendations which are being implemented separately from this legislative package. The Government's decision to continue the two airline policy was undoubtedly a contributing factor to the two major operators' decision to re-equip with new modern equipment. These initiatives have been followed by other operators at regional and commuter level. </PARA>
<PARA> Just prior to the Parliament rising in September 1980 a Bill directed towards making the Australian National Airlines Commission more commercial was introduced into the House of Representatives. The Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) then took the opportunity to outline some aspects of the Government's new airline policy. At that stage a new airlines agreement was signed. However, before seeking to enact the agreement, the amendments to the Australian National Airlines Act, which it was not possible to pass through the previous Parliament, and other related legislation, it was decided to await the receipt of the Holcroft report. The Holcroft inquiry had been established by the Government to investigate competing claims which were being made about the equity between long and short distance fares. </PARA>
<PARA> On 1 April the Government's decisions on the Holcroft recommendations were announced. The Government accepted a number of the principles contained in the inquiry's recommendations, namely: Continuation of a cost based, nationally consistent approach to air fares by the use of an air fare formula comprising a flagfall and a distance rate for the national jet network; endorsement of the inquiry's view on the approach to be taken to social discount fares; and support for as wide a range of discounts as possible without increasing the burden on the full fare paying passengers. Approval of a new fare formula was announced which significantly increased the flagfall to $40. This formula was derived to meet the thrust of the Holcroft report recommendations and after an initial examination of the inquiry's cost allocation methodology, with the specific intention of minimising cross-subsidisation. Further Government initiatives in the area of domestic air transport policy were also announced including the setting up of an independent authority with powers to make decisions on proposals for changes to air fares and an in principle decision to establish Trans-Australia Airlines as a public company. </PARA>
<PARA> The latter step has the advantages of further freeing TAA from the many constraints resulting from its statutory authority status and, as such, goes further than was contemplated by the September 1980 proposed amendments to the Australian National Airlines Act. Obviously this step does not exempt TAA from the normal government involvement in the aviation industry. As announced, the Government will initially hold all the shares in the new TAA company. However, the Government is commissioning consultants to examine the practicalities of selling shares in TAA, including how this might be done in the light of domestic air transport policy, including the new 1981 airlines agreement. The consultant's report is expected in about 12 month's time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided to establish an inquiry to undertake an objective assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of deregulating the domestic aviation environment. This inquiry is also to take account of the developments of different fleets by the two major operators including the introduction of wide-bodied aircraft. It is intended that the inquiry's report will be available for consideration and decision by the government before the completion of the minimum five-year term of the 1981 agreement. As soon as the inquiry has reported, the Government will ensure that there is a full parliamentary debate on its report. Should the inquiry make recommendations supporting deregulation for the domestic aviation industry, and the Government accept those recommendations, the Government would then move immediately at the end of the five-year period of this agreement to give three years' notice to terminate the two airlines agreement in accordance with its provisions for termination. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning now to the airlines agreement itself, this is directed towards maintaining the two airlines policy but with the objective of increasing the level of competition within the industry in a rational and orderly manner. The two-airline policy has served Australia well. On the trunk routes we have benefited greatly from the existing B727 and DC9 jet operations. As indicated earlier we are now progressing into a new era of fleet development with the two major operators acquiring different equipment. Over the next few months TAA will begin to introduce the wide-bodied airbus, the first wide body to be used in domestic service in Australia. At much the same time Ansett Airlines of Australia will start to introduce its new B737-200s as a replacement for its DC9s. The B737-200 has the advantage of having the same fuselage size as B727. Ansett of course plans to introduce B767 wide-bodied aircraft. Ansett will be one of the first to introduce this new generation aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now deal with the new agreement and relate it to the Government's domestic air transport policy, especially the objective of creating increased competition in an orderly manner. The first is that the Government, in accordance with the domestic air transport policy review, has removed freight from the two-airline policy. The Government has already taken a number of steps in this direction in approving the operation of small time critical freight operations. A number of specialised operators are seeking to import jet aircraft and other large cargo carrying aircraft to exploit the freight market. This will be possible under the new policy, subject of course to establishing that there is demand for the proposed services and the operator providing certain undertakings to ensure that jet aircraft will not be used for passenger operation. An application has already been received which, if approved, would be the first to take advantage of the new arrangements. In the past air cargo has tended to be dominated by the two major carriers where cargo services have been characterised by a heavy dependence on passenger aircraft. These factors have restricted the development of specialised cargo services. However, we can expect the major operators to show an increasing interest in this segment of the market with the opportunities for freight carriage in their new aircraft, especially the wide bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> Changes have also been made to the aircraft import policy. The previous restrictions on aircraft above 5,700 kilograms maximum all up weight limit have been removed and replaced by limits which greatly expand the range of aircraft types which may be imported under the new general consent. In addition, action is being taken to introduce a new supplementary airline licence to give formal recognition to the third level segments of the industry. In order to complement the introduction of this licence my Department has been actively reviewing the operating standards presently applying to commuter services. Considerable progress has been made. The dividing line between an airline licence and a supplementary airline licence will be based upon the certificated passenger carrying capacity and maximum pay load of the aircraft to be operated under the licences. This will also be the new limit for import under the general consent. </PARA>
<PARA> Import permits will not normally be granted for types of aircraft having a certificated capacity of more than 30 passengers or a maximum pay load of more than 3,500 kilograms except:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Aircraft purchased by the Commonwealth or by Australian operators holding an airline licence, but not a supplementary airline licence;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Aircraft in a special aerial work category, such as aerial survey;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Certain aircraft to be used exclusively for freight operations subject to satisfactory information substantiating the demand of the proposed service;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Replacement aircraft purchased by charter licence holders of an equivalent type to that currently operated; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Aircraft to be used in genuine private operations provided that satisfactory evidence substantiating the use of the aircraft, is furnished to the Secretary to the Department of Transport. </PARA>
<PARA> The passenger capacity limits may need to be reviewed in the near future to take account of recent aircraft developments. I turn now to the provisions of the new agreement. The parties have agreed that the agreement should not come into effect until the Commonwealth Parliament has approved the agreement and enacted the necessary legislation to introduce amendments to the Airlines Equipment Act, the Customs (Prohibited Import) Regulations and the Independent Air Fares Committee Bill. In respect of the latter Bill the agreement provides a 90-day period in which the Commission and the company may examine the Act and determine whether they wish to withdraw from the agreement. Should either party withdraw, the status quo would continue and the existing airlines agreements continue in force. Both TAA and Ansett have given assurances that this provision will not be invoked unless the Independent Air Fares Committee Act materially differs from their understanding of the provisions relating to trunk routes that the Government intended to incorporate into the Bill that is introduced into Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 6 provides extensive definitions of the role of the trunk airlines and of other operators. This clause for the first time defines Australia's trunk route network as consisting of routes linking any two centres that currently receive pure jet services from TAA and Ansett Airlines of Australia with the provision to add, but only by agreement between the parties, and subject to parliamentary disallowance as provided in the Act, other centres as the jet network expands. The enabling Act requires the Minister to table in Parliament any proposed agreement to add to the list of trunk route centres. The proposed addition to this list is subject to disallowance within 15 sitting days. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement provides that TAA and Ansett shall be the only two operators of scheduled domestic passenger services over these routes-but with most important exceptions. </PARA>
<PARA> The first exception is that other operators can provide services over prescribed routes which includes successive prescribed routes combined to provide a service between two trunk route centres. A number of prescribed routes are trunk routes. Let me explain. A prescribed route is defined as one that is intrastate, intraterritory or between a regional centre and any other place in Australia and also a route over which an operator other than TAA and Ansett provided a scheduled domestic passenger service as at 1 July 1980. Let me emphasise that a route between a regional centre and any other place in Australia includes capital cities. I would like it placed on the record that if this agreement had been in operation over the last decade East West, the major independent regional operator, would not have been precluded from operating any of the services it now operates. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision is also made that should TAA and Ansett decline to provide a satisfactory passenger service over a trunk route not currently operated by them then other operators will be able to serve that route as a prescribed route. It is up to regional operators to respond to this challenge. To give an example, it would be possible for an operator, other than TAA or Ansett, to put forward proposals to operate between say Brisbane-Alice Springs-Perth. If TAA and Ansett were not prepared to operate a satisfactory service on that route, then the Minister could approve the other operator's proposal. That route would then become a prescribed route for the life of the agreement. As was envisaged by the Domestic Air Transport Policy Review report, successive prescribed routes can be combined such as Sydney-Albury-Melbourne to enable operators to further increase the extent of outside competition, subject to the requirement that the principal purpose is carriage of passengers over the individual prescribed routes and not for the purpose of carriage of passengers between two trunk route centres, such as in the example just mentioned. Finally specialist scheduled passenger services of a type not adequately catered for by TAA and Ansett may be provided over trunk routes by other operators if TAA and Ansett decline to do so when requested by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been claimed that the most restrictive part of the existing agreement is the rationalisation provisions. These provisions have had the effect of stifling initiative and fare innovation within the industry. Under the old rationalisation provisions should the airlines fail to agree on a particular matter, the matter could then be referred by either airline to a rationalisation committee, comprising airline representatives and a co-ordinator nominated by the Minister. If required, the co-ordinator takes a decision on the matter and, should either of the airlines disagree with that decision, an arbitrator is appointed to give a final and binding decision. Let me give the example of the dispute over the Perth-Port Hedland-Darwin services. TAA was first granted a licence to operate over the route in February 1974. Objections by Ansett came before the co-ordinator, then the Arbitrator, followed by the High Court and then finally the Arbitrator again. This resulted in delays in the introduction of TAA's first weekly DC9 service on the route by 3 1/2 years. In its submission to the public hearings of the Holcroft Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares in Port Hedland, TAA claimed that, between November 1977, when the DC9 services com- menced, and August 1980, 41,168 passengers had used the DC9 services. These had paid some $1.5m less for their travel than if they had used F28 services. A saving of over $25 for each passenger'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now recognised that these rationalisation provisions have outlived their usefulness and are now excessive. However, after careful consideration of all the issues and detailed discussions with the airlines, it has been decided not to entirely delete the old rationalisation provisions. We are satisfied that there are some aspects of the rationalisation provisions which continue to benefit the community. Some of these arrangements enable the airlines to contain costs and thus fares. Accordingly we have sought to develop new provisions which maintain and improve the advantages of the rationalisation provisions but minimise their disadvantages. The consultative arrangements embodied in the new agreement do that. They provide for three main areas:</PARA>
<PARA> The 'may consult' group where the airlines can discuss issues and may reach agreement, but are not obliged to reach agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The 'must consult' group, restricted to only the most important issues such as aircraft utilisation and industry load factors, which have similar conditions to the old rationalisation provisions. However the role of the co-ordinator has been removed. Any disagreement that either airline wishes to pursue is referred directly to an arbitrator who is able to have regard to submissions by the Secretary to the Department of Transport and such other persons as he considers appropriate. Reductions of the steps in the appeal process will reduce delays in resolving issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Fares, where all consultations must be in the presence of a member or representative of the Independent Air Fares Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>The airlines are obliged to consult on core fares and may only consult on discount fares at the direction of the Fares Committee. Each airline is to make individual submissions on air fare variations and it is no longer necessary for them to try to reach agreement on the level of increases to be sought. </PARA>
<PARA> The new provisions included relating to import controls involve requiring the Secretary to the Department of Transport to have regard to the agreement in exercising his power to approve the importation of aircraft under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. The Commonwealth has given an undertaking in the agreement that the conditions I outlined earlier governing the use by other operators of turbojet aircraft will be incorporated into the Airlines Equipment Act. These arrangements will be explained in greater detail when amendments to the Airlines Equipment Act are introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been made in recent times of the definition in clause 15 of the agreement of the respective roles of Qantas Airways Ltd and the domestic airlines. In order that there was a clear understanding, incorporated in this agreement, between the Government and the domestics these roles as they now apply were defined. The Government has also made certain commitments on the manner by which these roles could be varied. This will lead to greater clarity and to the need for a consistent approach on decision making on any changes in the role for Australian operators. The agreement contains provision that the parties acknowledge the Commonwealth will consult Qantas on any changes in roles that affect it. I can assure honourable senators that it is the Government's clear intention and commitment to consult with the Qantas board on any negotiations to be undertaken on a change in roles of the three airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> These provisions do not in any way whatsoever prevent the chartering of each others' equipment by Qantas and the domestics. It is on a similar basis that East-West Airlines has been operating Qantas's Norfolk Island-Auckland entitlement for over six months and that Ansett and TAA have been providing B727 services on the Hobart-Christchurch service. On the other hand there has not been progress on the utilisation of Qantas excess capacity by domestic carriers on the long haul domestic routes. There are quite significant problems involved in such arrangements but you may be assured I will continue to press the airlines to explore this matter further and for the Commonwealth to see what progress can be made in resolving the facilitation difficulties involved. Substantially increased reporting obligations have been placed on the airlines by this agreement. Clauses 7, 13 and 23 particularly refer. Annual reports must be made on the use of the consultation arrangements, each airline's trunk route and total airlines' financial performance and on the operation of the agreement. These reports will of course be provided to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Some changes have been made to the cost recovery provisions in the agreement. No longer will the Commonwealth be restricted to annual increases in air navigation charges. We have formalised current practice of including fuel excise paid by the airlines in cost recovery calculations and that cost recovery in regard to trunk route services will not, allowing for minor variations between years, exceed 100 percent. </PARA>
<PARA> Revised arrangements have been introduced to ensure stability of airline services to rural routes. The previous agreement required the airlines to remain on a route unless revenue on the route was less than the direct operating costs. New arrangements provide for withdrawal after consultation with the Secretary to the Department of Transport on a replacement operator. An operator is able to withdraw at three months notice if revenue does not exceed total costs over a six month period. Information supporting this is required to be provided to the Secretary who may reject the proposal if he is not satisfied that the information justifies withdrawal. Should the operator still wish to cease the service arbitration provisions are included. </PARA>
<PARA> It is recognised that the provisions of clause 12 of the agreement are the cause of concern especially to those members and senators representing the State of Queensland. However it should not be assumed that TAA's services will necessarily be curtailed. However in the event of an application being made for the cessation of the services the Government in the first instance will endeavour to negotiate with other carriers to ascertain if they are prepared to operate services to the people in the remote areas of Queensland and other rural areas of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is well aware of the interest of East-West in some of the regional routes that are operated by the domestic carriers. Indeed some discussions have already taken place between East-West and TAA in regard to some of TAA's existing services. As the Senate would know both Ansett and TAA have already negotiated satisfactory commercial arrangements with Bush Pilots Airways Ltd to take over some of the services that they were operating in Queensland. It is possible that BPA might also be prepared to take over other routes that either TAA or Ansett wished to vacate. The three-month period between any such notice to terminate services at least gives the Government an opportunity to either assist in promoting commercial negotiations between operators or discussing with the State Government alternative arrangements that may be necessary to ensure that people living in Queensland are not left without adequate air services. </PARA>
<PARA> The airmail provisions of the old agreement had been dropped. Australia Post will under the new arrangements have the flexibility to develop its own commercial arrangements with the operators. The other provisions of the agreement substantially repeal those contained in the current agreement. These relate to equal access to Government business, application of the agreement to subsidiaries of Ansett Transport Industries and TAA, compliance with curfew requirements and the Air Navigation Act, consultation on departmental infrastructure programs, use of Ansett and TAA facilities in an emergency and non-discrimination against Ansett or TAA. </PARA>
<PARA> Criticism has been levelled against the new agreement because, from the date of commencement of the agreement, it has an effective minimum life of eight years. It is not widely appreciated that the current agreement can only be terminated after five years' notice. Since the Government made a firm commitment to the two-airline policy before its re-election to office last year, the earliest one could expect that notice of termination of the current agreement could be served is after the next election, due in 1983. Such notice would have to specify a termination date of at least five years from then, say the beginning of 1989, or eight years from now. The Government made a commitment in respect to the termination of this agreement five years hence should certain circumstances occur. In deciding upon such arrangements there was concern to allow a reasonable period of operations under these new arrangements before contemplating further amendments particularly bearing in mind the massive investment of some $800m made by TAA and Ansett to acquire new fuel efficient aircraft to maintain their high standards of service. No doubt every minute of the eight year period of agreement will be needed. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1952-1970 agreement has provided a good back drop against which air transport has developed in Australia over the last 30 years. The new airlines agreement incorporates significant changes to many areas, some new provisions and deletes some existing provisions. It forms the cornerstone for the orderly development of the industry in the years ahead in a manner consistent with the Government's policy and prospective developments in air transport. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to establish an Independent Air Fares Committee to conduct reviews and determine domestic air fares for all regular public transport domestic passenger operators. Arrangements relating to the setting of Australia's air fares were extensively examined by the Holcroft committee and it was after the Government's consideration of that report, though not directly recommended by the committee, that the decision to establish a separate body to determine air fares was taken. </PARA>
<PARA> This decision was announced in Parliament on 1 April when the Government's initial decisions on the Holcroft recommendations were announced by the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt). The Government has accepted the following principles: First, we will adopt a cost based, nationally consistent approach by use of an air fare formula comprising a flagfall and distance rate for the national jet network. We endorse the inquiry's view on the approach to be taken to discount fares. The Government supports as wide a range of discount fares as possible without increasing the burden on the full fare paying passenger. Discounts for the aged and provision of tour basing fares are to be considered further with the airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister also indicated the Government's concern that special innovative discounts which are negotiated by the airlines on the basis of their commercial viability must stand the test of public scrutiny. These and further decisions on the Holcroft recommendations are reflected in this Bill. There are, however, some areas of difference. The Government has decided that all fares for regular public transport operators should be set by the Committee. This decision was taken in order to minimise if not eliminate cross subsidisation between fare types and to ensure the integrity of the national trunk route formula is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to specific provisions, the Committee is to comprise a chairman and two members, to be all part time appointments. Members may hold office for periods specified on their appointment, not exceeding five years, and are eligible for re-appointment. Their terms and conditions of appointment, except for a judge, are as determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. Clause 9 makes provision for the disclosure of any interest, pecuniary or otherwise, of any member of the Committee that could conflict with the proper performance of his functions and outlines actions the Chairman may take when he becomes aware of such an interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Functions of the Committee and conduct of reviews by the Committee are specified by guidelines in Part III of the Bill. The functions of the Committee are, for all regular public transport passenger operators, to conduct cost allocation reviews to determine the attribution of costs to the flag-fall component and the distance component of the air fare formula as well as the amount, expressed as a percentage of the economy fare, by which first class fares will exceed economy fares; conduct major air fares reviews and minor air fares reviews to determine as appropriate a formula for fares; approve proposed discount air fares. A member of the Committee or a representative of the Committee is to be present at consultations between Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans-Australia Airlines on fares in accordance with the provisions of the airlines agreement legislation. Clause 12 specifies the limitations of the Committee's functions regarding fares on intrastate routes to accord with the Commonwealth's constitutional responsibilities in regard to corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 13 provides that the Committee shall undertake cost allocation reviews in relation to a passenger operator or operators at the request of the Minister for Transport. The Minister shall request a review in relation to trunk route operators before the expiration of three years after the commencement of this legislation with subsequent reviews to commence between two to three years after the preceding review is completed. Cost allocation reviews for Ansett and TAA in relation to trunk and associated F27 routes shall be held concurrently. As other operators were not considered by the Holcroft inquiry the first cost allocation review shall occur as soon as practicable after commencement of this Act, with subsequent reviews occurring at least three years after the completion of the previous review. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Minister requests the Committee to undertake a cost allocation review in relation to a passenger operator, or passenger operators, the Chairman will notify the relevant operators inviting submissions. A notice in the Australian Government Gazette will invite submissions from the public. At the time of a cost allocation review a passenger operator shall advise the Committee of the terms of any air fare concessions that the operator provides, or proposes to provide, in respect of existing social discount fares and these will also be published in the Gazette. The Committee will not have a role in the determination of social discount fares. </PARA>
<PARA> During any cost allocation review the Minister may request the Committee to take into account, in conducting the review and in making a determination after completion of the review, the need to ensure that: Air services are operated on an efficient and economic basis; air services are provided over trunk routes by two economically viable passenger operators; and domestic air services are, as far as possible, operated on a competitive basis. In conducting a cost allocation review, and making determinations, after such a review, clause 14 specifies that the Committee shall have regard to the need to ensure that air fares charged by operators over routes with similar characteristics, where similar equipment is used by those operators are determined on a consistent basis; the need to ensure that fares are, as closely as practicable, related to costs of providing the service, the need to ensure that air services are operated on an efficient and economic basis; the effect of the level of fares on demand for those services for which the fares are charged; the need to ensure that air fares charged by trunk operators over trunk routes are able to be determined on a consistent basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 15 provides that an operator may request the Committee to undertake a major air fares review and determine the economy air fares to be offered on specified routes. The Committee may initiate a review in respect of an operator provided at least six months has elapsed since completion of the previous review in regard to that operator in respect of those routes. Where Ansett, TAA or the Committee initiate a review in respect of all routes or related routes the Committee shall conduct reviews in respect to both operators over those routes. Determinations in relation to services by Ansett and TAA over trunk routes are to be the same for both operators. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee shall maintain, in relation to each class of passenger operators, a list specifying the information that is to be provided by the operator to enable the Committee to complete a major air fares review. After a review is initiated, either by an operator or the Committee, the operator shall provide the specified information within seven days. The Committee shall undertake such reviews in private and determine the economy air fares that are the subject of the review within 35 days of the operators request or 28 days of the provision of the required information, whichever is the sooner. In conducting a major air fares review and determining economy air fares the Committee shall have regard to: The costs involved in the provision of air services by that passenger operator; any estimates made by that passenger operator of the effect on costs and revenue of expected traffic over any route during any future period; if a previous review has been conducted, the effect on the costs and revenue of any estimates referred to above made for the purposes of that review proving to be inaccurate; the need to ensure that air services are operated on an efficient and economic basis; the need to ensure that air services are provided over trunk routes by two economically viable passenger operators; the need to ensure that economy air fares over trunk routes are on a consistent basis; the need to ensure that air services over trunk routes are operated as far as possible on a competitive basis; determinations of cost allocation reviews relevant to that operator; the effect that availability of first class and existing concession fares have on costs and revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 16 of the Bill provides for the Committee to conduct minor air fares reviews at the request of operators where the proposed fare increase would not result in an economy fare that is more than 5 per cent greater than the economy fare determined at the previous major air fare review for that operator. As for the major air fares review, the operator for which the review is being conducted shall provide to the Committee specified information for the Committee to undertake a review within seven days. These reviews are to be conducted in private and completed within 21 days of receipt of the application or within 14 days of the provision of the information whichever is the sooner. The Committee shall conduct minor reviews for Ansett and TAA services in respect of all or trunk and associated F27 routes jointly and determine the same trunk route fares for both operators. </PARA>
<PARA> In conducting a minor air fares review the committee shall have regard to increases in costs relating to wages, being approved by any body having functions in relation to conciliation and arbitration matters, fuel and air navigation charges; the need to ensure that air services are operated on an efficient and economic basis; the need to ensure that air services are provided over trunk routes by two economically viable passenger operators; the need to ensure that economy air fares over trunk routes are made on a consistent basis; in any determination made by the committee at the completion of the last cost allocation review relevant to that operator. </PARA>
<PARA> The approval of discount fares is another function of the Committee. Under the provisions of clause 17 of the Bill operators may submit to the Committee proposed discount fares, setting out the level of discount and the conditions attached to the fare. If the Committee is satisfied that the provision of the discount fare is likely to improve the profitability of the operator, the conditions associated with the fare are reasonable and, where appropriate, are unlikely to increase economy fares on trunk routes, the fare shall be approved. A decision must be made within seven days of the operators application. The requirement for the Committee to publish its decisions will ensure there is public knowledge of the range and conditions of discount fares that are available. Under the provisions of this Bill, all fares proposed to be offered on trunk routes by operators other than Ansett or TAA will be considered against the criteria relating to discount fares before the Committee approves them. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 17 also provides for the Committee, if it thinks fit, or at the request of any operator, to conduct a review concerning the availability of previously approved discount fares. The review is to be completed within 14 days. Unless the Committee is satisfied about the profitability, the conditions associated with the continued provision of that fare and, where relevant, the effect in economy fares on trunk routes, the approval of that fare may be revoked. These provisions ensure that once a discount fare has been approved the operators and the Committee have the opportunity to reassess the availability of such a fare, should circumstances so warrant. </PARA>
<PARA> When conducting its reviews, the Committee shall have regard to the guidelines described, which provide for cost based fares, including a nationally consistent fare formula for two economically viable operators providing services on trunk routes on a competitive basis. It should be noted that where a fare is approved for one operator in respect of a route any other operator on that route may also offer that fare. Decisions and determinations of the Committee, including interim determinations, in relation to all reviews shall be notified to the relevant operators and made public within seven days of the making of those decisions and determinations. Evidence and material to support the findings of the Committee together with a statement of reasons shall also be made available. Determinations shall remain in force until the notification of a further determination. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the Chairman to direct the arrangements of the Committee for the purposes of reviews. With respect to cost allocation reviews this includes the ability for the Committee to decide, apart from the operators involved, who shall be entitled to be a party to the review, give evidence, call witnesses and make submissions to the Committee. Under clause 21, if it thinks fit, or is requested by a party to a cost allocation review in regard to information which would adversely prejudice its commercial operations, the Committee may direct that part of the proceedings to be held in private. The Committee may give directions prohibiting or restricting publication of evidence or documents given to the Committee at any proceedings. This will allow the operators to be quite frank and open to the Committee, and provide information which would otherwise not be divulged in a public forum. The Committee also has the power to obtain all information necessary to undertake its tasks. Clause 25 of the Bill allows operators to request the Committee, in respect of intrastate and intraterritory routes subject to State or Territory government fare approval, to amend a determined fare to equal that fare approved by the State or Territory government. </PARA>
<PARA> Part IV of the Bill provides for the enforcement provisions currently contained in regulation 106 of the Air Navigation Regulations to continue to apply. Under clause 26 the Minister may direct the withdrawal of the use of any aerodrome or any air route facility maintained and operated by the Minister in pursuance of ANR 82 to any operator whilst advertising, charging or collecting air fares not determined and approved by the Committee. Penalties are provided for contravention of the Minister's directions under this clause. I stress that this is an enforcement provision only and does not allow the Minister to affect in any way the Committee's approval or determination of any fare. The provisions of ANR 106 relating to the Minister for Transport's power to approve air fares are to be repealed upon the commencement of this Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The final part of the Bill contains various penalty provisions for not complying with the Committee's directions. Protection and immunity to members of the Committee and persons summoned to appear before the Committee are the same as afforded in proceedings in the High Court. The Committee is required to report annually, through the Minister, to Parliament. With the establishment of a specialist body to undertake one specialist task we have been concerned to ensure that the body does not grow into a monster. Whilst staff from the Public Service will be attached to the Committee, it is our very clear intention to ensure that the secretariat, whilst adequate for the task, is not of a size that will seek involvement in areas outside the Committee's charter. </PARA>
<PARA> Our very approach to government involvement in industry makes the introduction of the new airlines agreement an appropriate time to transfer the fare setting function from the Minister to such a compact specialised body in a manner that will further the Government's objective of increasing the level of competition within the industry whilst reducing the level of government involvement. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Airlines Equipment Act to accord with the Government's decisions to remove freight from the ambit of the two-airline policy and to revise the policy controls over the import of the aircraft by operators other than Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans-Australia Airlines. Under the Airlines Equipment Act 1958 the Minister for Transport determines the aircraft capacity requirements of Ansett and TAA for specified periods and the airlines are obliged not to provide capacity in excess of that determined in each period. Clause 6 of the Bill revises the arrangements for the determination of the overall aircraft capacity for TAA and Ansett and as a consequence provides for the exclusion of air cargo from the calculation of the Ansett and TAA capacity consequently the two-airline policy will apply only in respect of passenger services. </PARA>
<PARA> Under clause 9 of the Bill operators other than Ansett and TAA may come within the provisions of the Airlines Equipment Act as amended. The Act provides that before the Secretary to the Department of Transport consents to the importation, other than by TAA, Ansett and Qantas, of turbo jet aircraft in excess of 3,500 kilograms payload or exceeding a capacity of 30 passengers, the operator will undertake to comply with the obligations set out in the Act. The obligations on the regional operator are not to provide aircraft capacity in excess of that determined under the Act by the Minister in accordance with the definition of the function of regional operators and the estimated demand and to provide the determined capacity over defined routes. In the event a regional operator is deemed to have excess capacity he will be under an obligation to dispose of sufficient capacity so as to comply with the Minister's determination. </PARA>
<PARA> Cargo operators will be required to undertake not to uplift passengers on their designated turbo jet cargo aircraft and, when the aircraft is to be sold, either to sell overseas or obtain an undertaking from the Australian buyer to comply with the obligations. These amendments will permit operators access to modern, efficient aircraft for passenger or cargo operations while still providing the means to afford a measure of security to the two major operators which operate services over the whole of the trunk route. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision accords with the role of the regional operator specified in the 1981 airlines agreement, as the provision of services over combinations of prescribed routes to provide a service over a trunk route and the provision of specialised services over trunk routes when these are not adequately provided by Ansett or TAA. The provsions of this Bill do not apply to application for the importation of turbo jet aircraft below the payload or capacity levels specified or for turbo prop aircraft. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of this Bill is a further step by the Government to ensure that Trans-Australia Airlines operates as a competitive, commercially oriented airline. This will be of benefit to the Australian people. The establishment of TAA as a public company will remove the additional obligations of consultating with government bodies, with which TAA complied in accordance with its statutory responsibilities under the Australian National Airlines Act. The Government intends that the new company be fully commerical with the powers of the Government restricted to rights of shareholders to appoint directors. In this way, TAA will be able to participate more fully in the competitive environment established by the Government's aviation policy. No changes are envisaged in regard to safety and operational requirements. Our intention is to repeal the Australian National Airlines Act thus leading to the abolition of the Australian National Airlines Commission. All the Commission's assets, liabilities, agreements and arrangements will be transferred to an appropriate public company in which the Commonwealth is the beneficial owner of all issued capital. </PARA>
<PARA> In more detail, clause 2 of the Bill provides that there will be a commencing day to be fixed by proclamation on which the assets and liabilities of TAA will be transferred to the new company, provided that all the issued share capital is beneficially owned by the Commonwealth. The Australian National Airlines Act will also be repealed on the commencing day, as provided by clause 3. Before the transfer, the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) will be required by clause 5 to notify in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette the public company, incorporated in the Australian Capital Territory to which all the assets and liabilities of the Commission will be transferred. The bulk of the transfer of the Commission's rights, property and assets as well as debts, liabilities and obligations is provided by clause 6. However, the following are not trans- ferred under this clause. Firstly, liabilities or obligations to existing Commission staff are dealt with by clause 9. Secondly, any Commission liability to pay dividends to the Commonwealth under section 30A (1) of the Australian National Airlines Act, are dealt with under clause 12. Thirdly, in keeping with our aim of freeing the new company of unnecessary controls, obligations under the Australian National Airlines Act are similarly not transferred. Clause 6 also deals with some matters relating to superannuation, which I will describe in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 8 extends the transfer on the commencing day to any contract, agreement or arrangement entered by the Commission and in force on the commencing day. As should be noted, specific reference to the airlines agreements is made in this section. Under clause 10, the company will also be substituted on the commencing day for the Commission in any proceedings before a court or tribunal, where the Commission was a party. As I mentioned, provisions relating to the transfer of staff are made in clause 9. Under this clause, on the commencing day, each and every current staff member of the Commission becomes an employee of the new company. The staff shall be employed on the commencing day under the same terms and conditions as they were employed on the day before by the Commission. All accrued rights and benefits will also be preserved. </PARA>
<PARA> This provision is not to be affected by the operation of any State or Territory law or determination, unless such laws render the terms and conditions more favourable. Under such circumstances, those more favourable conditions will apply. The Bill includes the preservation of the rights of those TAA staff with rights under the repealed Officers' Rights Declaration Act or Part IV of the Public Service Act 1922. However rights cannot be preserved, under this or other legislation, beyond the time when, or if, the Commonwealth does not have a controlling interest in the company. I would point out that because accrued rights are preserved provision is also made that additional benefits which would otherwise arise solely out of the transfer, are prevented by the legislation. Thus, under sub-clauses 9 (7) and 9 (11), severance payments concerning long service leave and superannuation which would otherwise be made upon abolition of the Commission, are not to be payable to staff who transfer to the new company. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to superannuation, provision has been made to preserve the terms, conditions and accrued benefits of superannuation for all transferring TAA employees, including those in the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. To do this, transfer provisions have been made as flex- ible as possible. The company is free to seek approved authority status for the purposes of the Superannuation Act, whereby those in the Commonwealth superannuation scheme can continue their membership. Alternatively sub-clause 9 (4) requires the new company to develop its own superannuation schemes providing equivalent benefits to any superannuation schemes involving Commission staff in which the company does not wish to participate. On the matter of the superannuation liabilities of the Commission and the company, I draw attention to sub-clauses 6 (5) and 6 (6) of the Bill and to the Government's decision to place the new company as far as possible on a truly commercial footing. These two sub-clauses transfer to the new company any outstanding liabilities of the Commission under the Superannuation Acts of 1922 or 1976. Moreover, these two sub-clauses, as well as the provision in clause 8 of the Bill transferring all Commission contracts to the company, mean that the Government is able to make an agreement with TAA at any time before the commencing day to resolve the outstanding superannuation issues. The Bill allows the Government to assist with this aspect regardless of whether or not the company seeks to be an approved authority, or whether subsequently it does not have that status. The transfers of TAA's operation to the company, under clause 11, will not attact stamp duty. </PARA>
<PARA> Under clause 12, the Commission will continue in existence for a time after the commencing day to fulfil certain obligations relating to the Commission's shareholdings and overseas contracts, assets and liabilities. This will enable the Commission to hold so much of the property and assets as have not been transferred in the first instance to the company, as well as meeting certain outstanding debts, liabilities or obligations. Under this clause, the Commission will be required to provide annual reports and pay dividends for the period ending with the commencing day. The company will be required to provide such staff and other assistance to the Commission as is necessary for it to meet these obligations and the Commission may delegate its powers to the staff seconded under this arrangement. The Minister, when satisfied that the Commission has fulfilled its obligations under this clause, will notify in the Gazette that the Commission shall cease to exist. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Government's intention to facilitate the transfer wherever it can. Thus clause 13 provides that the Treasurer, on behalf of the Commonwealth, may, at the request of the company, provide loan guarantees for borrowing arrangements entered into by, and liabilities of, the Commission before the commencing day. The Treasurer shall table the details of such guarantees in the Parliament within 15 sitting days after the guarantee is given. These guarantees can be provided to cover TAA's borrowings from the staff superannuation reserves as well as its overseas borrowings. To complete the transfer, the Bill, in clause 14, will facilitate the transfer to the new company of the Commission's taxation benefits and obligations. These include the right to income tax deductions for any unrecouped losses and in relation to Commission property vested in the company, any depreciation allowances, investment allowances and trading stock values as if the Commission had continued in operation. The last clause in the Bill, clause 15, provides for compensation to be paid by the Commonwealth in certain circumstances to any person whose property is acquired. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister indicated on 13 May the Government will engage consultants to examine the practicality of selling some or all of the shares in TAA, including how this might be done in the light of the Government's domestic aviation policies. The consultants will be asked to report on what measures should be taken to ensure the independent ownership of Australia's trunk airlines in the event of a decision that any part of the equity in TAA be sold. The consultant's report is expected to be completed in about 12 months time. I should emphasise that, at this stage, the Government has not made a decision on the long term ownership of TAA. If the Government does decide to sell any portion of TAA to the private sector after receiving the consultant's report, a full statement will be made to Parliament at that time. The Parliament will then have the opportunity to debate the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will by now have had the opportunity to consider the changes to the structure of TAA provided by this Bill. They give the airline the opportunity to contribute to the future progress of the industry. The greater incentives to compete together with reduced government involvement will ensure that the travelling public will be served well by both our major domestic airlines, operating in a competitive environment. Before I finish I want to reaffirm the Government's intention to look after the interests of all TAA staff during the transfer. A number of provisions of the Bill are directed to this most important objective. I now want to acknowledge the contribution of the Australian National Airlines Commission to the development of aviation since its establishment in 1946. TAA is an airline with a great reputation. This is due to its management and staff, the people who have made and are making it a great airline. I firmly believe that by making it a public company and freeing it of many bureaucratic controls that it will go from strength to strength. In its new form as a public company, the Government confidently looks forward to TAA's continued expansion in the new era of competition in domestic aviation in Australia. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the proclamation by the Governor-General dated 5 April 1979 made pursuant to sub-section 7 (2) of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975. In paragraph (b) of Part 1 of the Schedule to the proclamation an area commonly known as the Koongarra special mineral lease application was excluded from the Kakadu National Park declared in that proclamation. This Bill provides that a new area be substituted for the Koongarra special mineral lease application area. Honourable senators will be aware that, from the total area of about 5,700 square kilometres comprising the Kakadu National Park, the above proclamation excluded six parcels of land from the park, including the Koongarra special mineral lease application area. The total area of these parcels, which includes mining and commercial interests, is about 15.7 square kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1976 Noranda Australia Ltd applied for a special mineral lease of approximately 12.5 square kilometres which was then considered appropriate for the total project requirements. The particular area excluded for the proposed Koongarra project by the proclamation of 5 April 1979 is the same as that applied for by Noranda in 1976 as a special mineral lease. The exclusion of this area from the park, together with the exclusion of other mining and commercial areas, was made in accordance with the provisions of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975. The exclusions were consistent with the view of the Ranger inquiry that areas leased for mining purposes should be excluded from the national park for the period of mining. The Government announced in August 1977 that areas associated with Ranger, Jabiluka and Koongarra would be excluded from the park to accommodate mining activities. </PARA>
<PARA> In November 1977 the then Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development directed Noranda Australia Ltd, pursuant to the administrative procedures under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, to prepare and submit to him an environmental impact statement for the development of the proposed mining project. In order to prepare this statement the company carried out extensive investigations into the topography, soils, surface and groundwater and other environmental aspects over a wide area surrounding the ore body. Noranda, in the draft environmental impact statement indicated that it had reviewed the original concept and detailed a proposal requiring an adjusted area. The draft statement was made available for public comment and subsequently, a final environmental impact statement was prepared for examination by the then Department of Science and the Environment according to the provisions of the administrative procedures under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important feature of the new mining plan outlined in the impact statement is that it provides for a system of water management which has a no release objective. Honourable senators will be aware that the Ranger inquiry expressed concern about the possible damage to wetlands down-stream from mining sites. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to draw the attention of the Senate to the comprehensive analysis which the proposed Koongarra project has undergone as a result of the requirements of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. The proposed variation to the project area boundaries is basic to the Department's assessment that the overall physical consequences of the proposal will fall within acceptable and manageable limits. To accommodate the situation the Government has decided, consistent with the recommendations of the Ranger inquiry and its announcements in 1977, to adjust the boundaries of the Kakadu National Park so as to exclude the revised project area. The effect of this is to increase park values in that the revised project area is smaller than the area now excluded from the park and the area to be added to the park will include an environmentally important area adjacent to the Nourlangie Rock-Mt Brockman massif. I am sure all those familiar with this part of Australia will welcome this addition to the park of the Nourlangie escarpment. </PARA>
<PARA> The means by which it is proposed to make these adjustments in the Bill is simply to replace the description of the special mineral lease application area as set out in paragraph (b) of Part 1 of the Schedule to the proclamation of 5 April 1979, with the description of a project area consistent with that described in the environmental impact statement. This is achieved by sub-clause 3 (1) of the Bill. The same sub-clause also incorporates the area no longer required into the park. Sub-clauses 3 (2) and 3 (3) of the Bill are technical provisions to ensure that the original proclamation establishing the Kakadu National Park is not affected by the proposed changes. </PARA>
<PARA> In outlining the requirement to alter the boundaries of the Koongarra project area I wish to assure the Senate that the status of the land as Aboriginal land is not affected. All the land involved is held by the Kakadu Aboriginal Land Trust in fee simple. The interests of the Aboriginal owners are fully protected by the commencement provision contained in sub-clause 2 (2) of the Bill which recognises the rights of the Aboriginal people to determine whether mining should proceed. The provision specifies that the proposed changes will not take place unless Aboriginal consent to the project is forthcoming. This provision is quite unequivocal. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment and definition of the Koongarra project area provided for in this Bill does not imply approval for mining. This is, of course, a matter for my colleague the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony). Approval for the Koongarra project can be given only after consideration by the Government following the completion of the necessary environmental procedures, compliance with our foreign investment policy and the conclusion of satisfactory arrangements with the Aboriginal people. No decision has yet been taken by the Government to permit the development of the Koongarra deposit. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Housing Assistance Bill 1981 is another example of an inadequate piece of legislation, a rushed piece of legislation, legislation which changes existing procedures insofar as we have moved from a three-year housing agreement to a five-year housing agreement. Clearly, faced with the probability of losing the next Federal election, the Fraser Government is setting about-in respect of airlines, roads and housing-putting a government that will be elected in 1983 into a position where it will not be able to tackle the problems of housing, transport and roads, issues which are of vital importance to the Australian people. The legislation will do almost nothing for the 80,000 people whose names now appear on the housing authorities lists in the various States of our Commonwealth. It will do almost nothing for 150,000 homeless people who, as so many welfare housing organisations have pointed out, need to be regarded in that category. It will certainly do nothing to solve the incredible exploitation that is taking place where 250,000 of our citizens are living in temporary, caravan-type dwellings-unsuitable dwellings-in our country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The most disgusting state of this Government is its capacity to place legislation before the Parliament which seeks to reduce the amount of funds available for the public housing sector. Of course this legislation shows that there has been a decline in total payments in money terms. Certain hypocritical senators in this chamber-those who constitute the temporary majority in this place-claim that during 1972-75 this was a House of Review and a house concerned with the rights of the States. As a result of a party decision this chamber is giving assent to legislation, unless it agrees to the amendment which I will subsequently move, that reduces the amount of funds to each and every State in our Commonwealth by a substantial amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of honourable senators to the fact that in 1977-78 the New South Wales allocation of funds for its public housing was reduced from $133,929,000 to $92,289,000 in the current agreement provided in the Budget Paper of 1980-81. Overall we see a reduction from $405m to $276m for the whole of Australia. We only have to look at Budget Paper No. 7, page 60, to see that every State has suffered a substantial reduction in the allocation of housing funds. This has occurred in a period when the Government claims to have done something about inflation, but it fails to recognise and acknowledge that in the question of housing and land the rate of inflation varies in Australia, State by State. It is true that in some States the rate of inflation varies between 10 to 15 per cent per annum while in other States it varies between 25 to 33 per cent per annum. Housing costs in this country are rising by an average of about 25 per cent per annum. So when we talk about controlling inflation we ignore the fact that a house is the most expensive single item that any person can provide for himself. </PARA>
<PARA> Housing costs are rising by about 20 to 25 per cent each year. This is way in excess of the so-called 10 per cent inflation rate which this Government claims to have achieved so far as the consumer price index is concerned. Of course the consequence of this is that more and more people are unable to provide for their own housing accommodation needs and are forced more and more to rely upon public sector housing for the meagre assistance that this legislation will provide. For example, in the last six years that the Fraser-Anthony Government has been in office, the Australian people have been subjected to a propaganda campaign about inflation, the 35-hour week and small government, but they have never been told the real truth about the Government's housing policy. So in a true sense the campaign has been one from a corrupt, deceitful, bankrupt and ideological government because it has not told the Australian people the real facts that are provided for us by the building industry-both employer and employee groups-social welfare groups and the evidence that is available to us from Ministers in the various States of our Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> More and more this Government is being seen as a deceitful government because it thinks that it can deceive the Australian community into believing that the Government is concerned about housing. If we look at this housing agreement, which will now be a five-year housing agreement, we can see how the Government year by year-even from its first and second years in office-has reduced the amount of funds available for housing. We can see that this bankrupt government is prepared in its Budget documents to make thousands of millions of dollars available each year to the corporate sector in the false belief that that will do something about regenerating our society. Of course, that money should have been made available to the States to provide adequate housing for Australia's homeless. The Government's ideological position also needs to be condemned because it tries to draw an ideological veil over its activities, or its lack of action, in respect of these matters by engaging in a cynical exercise such as a razor gang to try to con its supporters, who are losing confidence in it, and the Australian community, into believing that it has policies and ideas for cleaning up the mess that exists within our society. </PARA>
<PARA> Since this Government came to office it has sought consistently to slash the amount of money available to the States. Apart from the year 1977-78 it has slashed funds for welfare housing in money terms as well as in real terms. In a reply to a question in the House of Representatives this Government conceded that in the last four years the rate of inflation has increased by in excess of 47 per cent. Yet that is not reflected in the amount of money that is to be made available to the States in respect of public housing. While the Government pretends that it is interested in the rights of people, the whole thrust of its policies on the money supply, on federalism, on the resources boom and on the so-called fight against inflation has been, in practical terms, to disadvantage the home buyer, and now, as a result of this legislation, to disadvantage even the home renter. </PARA>
<PARA> I have explained before when we have debated issues relating to housing how using interest rates to restrict growth in the money supply-a growth due to the Government's open door policies on foreign investment-makes it even more impossible day by day for those wanting accommodation to enter the home owning area. It is forcing thousands of would-be buyers out of the market and giving massive profits to the banks, as a result of allowing them to dictate the terms through the market forces, which then promptly use that rapid accumulation of capital which is now so apparent in our banking system to engage in anti-competitive mergers. The attitude taken by our Treasurer, Mr Howard, is so weak-kneed that even members of the Government in this place have expressed concern in questions to Government Ministers about the way in which this Government is preparing to allow those mergers to take place-increasing the power of money, increasing the power of banks and increasing the rate of interest as a result of that concentration which it is so apparent will take place in our country probably during the recess of the Parliament. This is not sound economic policy. It is an insane policy. It is policy that shows that the Fraser Government is locking us into policies which are going to be even more disastrous than they have been over the last four or five years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition concedes that some sectors of the Australian community are booming but they are not booming for the growing numbers of people who are unable to enter the housing area, to look after their own needs as a result of their own independent action or to be assisted as a result of State housing programs. We also have the new federalism-that neat trick which was coined by Senator Carrick as part of his explanation of the attitude taken by him and his forces in this place in 1975 when an elected government was destroyed. He coined the phrase 'Federalism-co-operative relationships with the States'. He was even appointed as Minister assisting the Prime Minister on the matter of Commonwealth-State relations. What is the plain reality? It is that whether it be on roads, whether it be on welfare payments, whether it be on housing or whether it be on health, the States are being squeezed; they are being put in an impossible position. They are being forced to put into effect the second and third stages of the Fraser-Carrick federalism which was to force the State governments, whatever their political complexion, to introduce a new form of taxation-a process which was rejected unanimously by all the State Premiers; they were not going to be put in that position as a result of the pressures being applied by the Fraser Government. In 1981 we are seeing many of the policies of this Government beginning to be understood by the State Premiers as well as by the electors. They are starting to bear a horrible, rotten fruit so far as increasing numbers of Australian people are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The renewal of the Commonwealth-State housing agreement-the topic of this Bill-is just another example of the incorrect economic policies being followed by the Government. The agreement is due now to last five years on current trends-five crucial years when housing inflation will be double the general rate of inflation, even on the terms expressed by this Government. If honourable senators have any doubts about that they should look at the various reports which have come in from the housing authorities about the rate. In Sydney, for example, housing values have doubled in the last three years. The same upward increase is now being experienced in Queensland and in Western Australia and, I am led to believe, there is noticeable upward trend even in respect of what was previously a fairly stable position in Victoria. Of course we can write South Australia off because it has the most hopeless Liberal government it has ever had. I suspect that the State governments will be conned again into accepting these new arrangements as they were at the last Premiers Conference. One can imagine what sort of a Premiers Conference it will be on 19 June when the Parliament is in recess and when the Premiers are forced to come back into conference with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and Mr Howard. </PARA>
<PARA> What is crucial to any proper debate of this agreement is the fact that cuts in funding, severe though they are, may not necessarily be the key issue in this legislation. The ideological muscles-or, should I say, the bones-flexed by the razor gang will be put to work again. It is certain that the funding structures will be altered drastically. What the Government is seeking to do in this respect has not been a matter of great public debate. Not only is it reducing the amount of available funds, but also it is taking other alternatives to which I will refer shortly. As usual, these alterations will help the well off-the banks and the finance companies-but they will put the poor, the disadvantaged and the homeless in the worst position they have ever been in as a result of the inadequate leadership of a national government in regard to solving the basic problems of housing in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely it has to be conceded that housing in this country is in a hopeless mess, that housing for a greater and greater number of people is no longer within their reach. Yet this Governent accepts no responsibility for that state of affairs. Surely it would not have the gall to suggest that the three years of Labor Government in 1972-75 did anything to create those sorts of conditions. In fact, we all remember-if honourable senators opposite will only be honest-that the Labor Government allocated considerably greater sums of money to the States for the purpose of housing in those three years. But, of course, it is not the citizens of our country, it is not the housing advisory committees and it is not the States trying to grapple with the problems of housing, who have the ear of this Government. Those who have the clout, who have the Prime Minister's ear are in the corporate sector of our society and they are quite happy to see his ideological posturing which will get him the great praise and support of the Agnews, the Abeles, the Murdochs and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> One aspect of this ideology has been this Government's so-called welfarist ancestry. The original concept of these housing agreements was that money was to flow to assist those who could not afford home ownership and those who could, but who chose not to take up the option. Public housing should be made available to both categories of people. What we are concerned about is that, as a proportion of total Federal revenue, funds for welfare housing are considerably reduced. Paradoxically to that problem, what has to be recognised is that due to the maturation of housing stock which has caused an ideological crisis for conservative politicians, the public housing authorities are now able to reap the benefit of their post-war housing programs. As their houses are paid off, rents need not rise in accordance with inflation or interest rates. Building and loan costs were earlier paid by the early tenants. Current tenants can and should benefit in the way in which middle-aged owner occupiers do. However, public renting is very attractive and efficient. Now we have a Federal government which is ideologically opposed to public housing. It is joined in that respect by the Victorian Housing Commission which, virtually in the last week or so, in large-scale advertisements, indicated that it will adopt a different position from all the other State housing authorities and will move out of the area of Commonwealth housing arrangements which have operated for the whole of the post-war period. The reason, it says, is that this Government is forcing State housing authorities -this legislation seeks to do just that-to charge market or so-called fair rents. These pressures are on other States too and the Commonwealth will force them to charge more than they need to do to fund their programs to fight off the maturation crisis. This is a crisis for conservative politicians with conservative housing policies. It is not a weakness of public cost renting. If we had a rational policy, it would not be a crisis but for the States a maturation housing bonanza. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to what some of these conservative housing policies mean in practice. I ask honourable senators to look at the case of the Hollandia Group in South Australia. We must never forget that real people are behind every company name. They are probably what this Government would call 'free enterprise'. They are the kinds of people who put pressure on the Government and back the Government. Originally a mining company in the late 1960s, Hollandia blossomed into a speculative conglomerate. It has links, through its directors, to Mitsubishi Australia Ltd and Mitsubishi Japan. In 1979, this company, through misleading advertising, sold homes to low income earners in Adelaide. The development area had no shops, schools, health centres, public phones or post boxes, and the homes were small and over-priced. Instead of paying the $50 or $60 a week that they were told by this company would be the rent, soon they were paying up to double that rate. Soon after, families began defaulting, the owners got together to confront Hollandia, and organised. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of this action, the company collapsed and its finance company, General Credits Ltd, stepped in. Of course, General Credits, as we all remember, is a subsidiary of the Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd which we recognise is already taking some other steps. The buyers organised a rent strike to renegotiate mortgages, and families were forced out onto the street by General Credits. The lesson of this is not the greed and deceit of Hollandia; it is the result of the market forces which this Government blindly follows. One orthodox economist stated:</PARA>
<PARA> An . . . increase in demand for State Bank loans from 1974 caused a temporary disequilibrium credit rationing solution and in turn demand for bridging finance was genera- ted . . . In response to long waiting periods, other financial institutions offered temporary loans. Thus market solution evoked to overcome the problem. </PARA>
<PARA>The market solution was high interest, and the result of these unfettered market forces is misery for those people affected by what happened. Yet this Government religiously, dogmatically and blindly follows policies that market forces alone should determine all these issues of accommodation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at this scandalous housing agreement. It is a coercive agreement. It is one to be imposed upon the States. It is another blow to the public housing sector that could and has served Australia well in the past, dependent always, of course, upon the amount of Federal funds made available by the Commonwealth Government. As usual, the Government, in spouting its rhetoric about free enterprise, in fact is beginning to destroy the whole concept of public housing in Australia as part of its coddling, inefficient and badly run private rental market. Funds for rental housing have been slashed, as I wish to demonstrate. I seek leave for the following table, prepared by the Parliamentary Library, to be incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I mentioned earlier, we have before us an opportunity to take advantage of our earlier public housing program not by increasing rents but by reducing them as a result of the early post-war development of public housing. But what does this Bill do? It does not assist that. It does not enable rents to be stabilised if the Government does not want to reduce them. It in fact requires the States to raise the rents. It will boost them from being market-related as they are now to being par market rents-that is, on a level with current private rents. We know what hardship that will cause to the many hundreds of thousands of people who currently are living in public housing. This is a totally irrational, unfair impost upon the tenants and an imposition-without any consultation with the States-placed upon the States if they are to get the funds that are inherent in this legislation. Undoubtedly the financial situation of tenants will worsen and difficulties will be created for State governments if the Commonwealth Government has its way. But of course, it will satisfy the Government's ideological blood lust for private enterprise and thereby will strike another blow at the whole concept of public enterprise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I could make many other points about this Bill. The agreement provides the same amount of funding for each of the five years. It does not take into account the rate of inflation. This means that, under the proposed new agreement, the real value of Commonwealth assistance will decline even further. The Australian Labor Party views this agreement as a disgrace. Despite the fact that it is a 5-year agreement designed to tie the hands of a Labor government that will be elected in 1980, we make the promise that, when we gain office at the next election, one of our highest priorities will be to renegotiate an agreement with the States that will restore public housing to its rightful place as a source of secure and cheap housing. To that extent, the Australian Labor Party proposes the following amendment. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even though I have heard Senator Gietzelt make the same speech often I still find it quite novel, especially since obviously he has not read the documents and what he has said really does not relate in any way to the facts set out in the Bill. However, I feel that I must refer to one or two of his comments. The honourable senator has been very critical of the five-year term provided, but apparently does not know that for many years the States have requested such longer period. In short, the five-year provision has been included in the Bill at their request.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again, the honourable senator spoke at length of how bad was the delay in granting applications for rental accommodation. The last table that I have on the subject, one which gives the position as at 31 December 1980, shows that there were then about 85,000 on the waiting list. The honourable senator overlooked the fact that as at 30 June 1975 there were 104,000 on the waiting list and since then the number has diminished considerably. Currently it is about 20,000 lower. I need not remind honourable senators of which government was in office at the time. The honourable senator claimed that the Labor Government did a good job in regard to housing but the figures do not really bear that out. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator referred also to the amount of money to be provided and the terms of such provision but did not mention that the public sector provides only about 9 or 10 per cent of total housing funds; that in the last year or two, in both money terms and housing numbers, the input of public and private capital has been higher than ever. Indeed, the input of Federal funds represents an almost insignificant part of the total. What is important is that whereas formerly a greater proportion of housing funds was provided by the taxpayers, the private sector now finds that it is capable of operating largely on its own. It has been possible to reduce the input of taxpayers' money for housing simply because the private sector has been able to participate more widely itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator said that it was terribly difficult for young people to buy houses, but Australia still has a home ownership rate of about 72 per cent. Not many countries could claim anything like so advantageous a rate of home ownership. The honourable senator also went to great trouble to say how terrible it was that people living in government houses should not receive bonuses which reflected rental interest. Although he espoused the fixing of very low rentals he did not read the rest of the story in the legislation, which states that, although there should be a market-oriented rent, in the words of clause 34 (1) of Schedule 1:</PARA>
<PARA> Rental rebates are to be granted to tenants who are not able to afford to pay the rent determined in accordance with clause 33. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 34 (2) further provides:</PARA>
<PARA> A uniform rental rebate policy shall be developed by the Commonwealth and the States and shall be applied by each State for the calculation of rental rebates. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, that means that people with the capacity to pay will be asked to pay and that those who are unable to do so will be granted a rebate on an Australia-wide basis, so that it will be fair to everybody. Also, the honourable senator referred repeatedly to ideological posturing. Perhaps even Senator Gietzelt would be happy to admit that, in any debate in which I have taken part in this chamber, he would have to be rated very highly in regard to ideological posturing. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement is a natural extension of the 1978 agreement, which, in itself, represented a major breakthrough and change of attitude between the Commonwealth and the States. The new agreement is generous and progressive. The interest rates of 4 1/2 per cent, by any standard, can be regarded as highly advantageous and the forward commitment of five years will also be of great benefit to the States in regard to forward planning. Senator Geitzelt referred to the reduction of base level funding to $200m. Had he read the information that was available he would have found, as I reminded him last night in respect of the Road Grants Bill, that that amount is preliminary in nature and subject to an annual topping up. That is clearly stated in the documents. To say that the amount is being reduced is in fact totally incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of rental accommodation is clearly emphasised in the Bill. Part X of Schedule 1 lists many items on which, it is suggested, funds may be expended in an effort to encourage rental development. I shall cite but a few of these: To meet the cost of, and associated with, the acquisition, planning and development of land; to pay for the construction or acquisition of housing; to repay the principal of, and pay interest on, loan assistance; to provide funds to such voluntary, non-profit, charitable bodies as may be necessary; to enable housing to be let to such charitable bodies as is required; to engage in urban renewal activities; to allocate funds to local government bodies; to make payments, or provide bridging finance for open space landscaping; to undertake research and policy development in relation to matters not funded by the Australian Research Council; to undertake and participate in joint ventures, co-operative enterprises and so on; to lease housing; to provide housing advisory services; and to provide rental subsidies. That permits a very wide use of money. State housing departments will find it quite possible to use those and other means to extend the stock of rental houses. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement provides an excellent basis for what is a genuine Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. It provides for matching requirements, and in a joint agreement that is only right. The agreement may be said to come down to a matter of money, but in housing the use of the money provided counts far more. The States which have been well endowed with money have in many cases not used it to best advantage. Some of the States that have been given less money have done better than those that have had more. Lest I seem to be critical of what the States, or even some of them, are doing I say that I respect the rights of all States to do exactly as they wish within the realm of this agreement. If they wish to run their programs efficiently it is up to them. If they wish to run them inefficiently, it is still up to them. If they wish to gain the benefits to be derived from an efficient program they can, but if they do not they can take the consequences. We need to see how Federal money can best be spent. If the States choose to use their money in a way that does not provide the optimum housing stock, they cannot expect the Commonwealth to keep funding inefficency. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill makes that matter even clearer. It provides a whole new range of flexibilities. It means that the States will be given more responsibilities. There will be more State decisions and, as a result, there will be fewer areas in which the States can kick the Government in Canberra. The sorts of things that the Bill provides with regard to home ownership include greater involvement of the private sector in the rental market. It will enable housing departments to buy and rent individual houses. It will allow them to buy instead of building and to provide such things as interest or rental subsidies. That is now up to the States, and they can use the agreement to get the best advantage possible from the funds involved. </PARA>
<PARA> With all that in mind, we have to remember that the public sector still provides only about 9 per cent of total housing. Over 90 per cent is provided by the private sector. As a result, the public sector must make sure that its proportion is used as efficiently as possible and that it goes to the people who need it most. At present the various States get varying amounts of money. The amounts vary from as little as $15.19 per capita in Queensland to as much as $37 per capita in Tasmania, which is an average of $19.15 per head. That much difference between the top and bottom States should indicate clearly either that Tasmania should now be in the best position in Australia or that it must have been in by far the worst position and in the greatest need. I think we have to consider whether it really does not do much more than demonstrate that Tasmania has had enough money that it has never really had to be careful about its use-certainly not as careful as some of the other States. I would not like to think that Tasmania fell within the category of what is usually referred to as operating within the limits of maximum inefficiency. Recently I received from the Tasmanian Minister for Housing, Mr Baldock, a letter raising various funding problems. I subsequently answered that letter. I have checked with the Opposition Whip and, in the interests of time, I now seek leave to incorporate a copy of my reply in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>14 May 1981 The Hon. D. J. Baldock, M.H.A.,</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Housing,</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA>Hobart, Tasmania 7000</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for your letter of 30 April and a subsequent amendment of 5th May. </PARA>
<PARA> As you are aware I have for many years taken a keen interest in the management and operation of the Tasmanian Housing Department and as your files show I have made many suggestions over a period of years on how you could prepare for such an eventuality as that which you now face. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, may I say that I totally respect the rights of each and every State to spend their money in the manner they see fit and it is entirely up to them to adopt what ever policies they like and to make their own arrangements as to what is appropriate I think politically or economically as they see fit. </PARA>
<PARA> If you check my file I think you will find that from time to time I have commented on several areas but as I don't have my file before me I will have to rely on my memory. </PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, market related rent</PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania has been slower than other States to bring their Housing Department rental housing in line with the market. This has the result of providing bonuses to many people who are not in the welfare class. It has also resulted in houses being occupied by people who had they been paying a reasonable rental would have moved out into the private sector rental housing or would have bought one of your houses or bought a house on the open market and owned, any of those contingencies would have provided additional housing for people who needed it. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, land supply</PARA>
<PARA> By any standards the stocks of land held by your Department in various parts of Tasmania are grossly excessive for any reasonable needs and while I respect the rights of the State to put their money into land instead of housing if it is their wish, they cannot complain about not having money simply because they tie it up in ways that fail to provide houses. </PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly, increased house sales</PARA>
<PARA> There has been no real effort by the Tasmanian Housing Department to instigate an increase in sales of permanently occupied houses to the occupants as a means of giving the transference of money to new people. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very clear to me that the only way we can increase the number of new houses is by selling off some of the old ones to the occupants. For myself I can see no difference in the housing stock of selling a house on the one hand and having it occupied by a life-time tenant on the other. I believe that it is the throughput that is important and the present policy does nothing to assist that. </PARA>
<PARA>Fourthly, old persons and other welfare housing</PARA>
<PARA> It is my opinion that far greater use should be made of co-operation with local welfare and welfare groups and other organisations who are prepared to participate in housing the aged on the basis that a proportion of Government funding and a proportion of donations and owner/donor situations does very much more to house people than having 100 per cent Government funds. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of maintenance and so forth, costs of handling by your Departmental officers is also of great consequence when the money could be better used if it were allowed to be handled by groups. </PARA>
<PARA>Fifthly</PARA>
<PARA> The most economical use of money in Australia today is through the co-operative building societies. If more money were passed through them and they are extremely low management rates, more use could be made by people who could make some contribution in their own right; many more people would be housed. This is an irrefutable fact in every State and I would suggest that it is another area where you have failed to get the best use of money available. </PARA>
<PARA>Interest subsidies</PARA>
<PARA> Some States have found that the most economical use of limited funds is in providing subsidies on interest rates to augment existing housing financing bodies. A little amount by way of interest subsidy will house a lot of people. The scheme in Western Australia and Victoria is well-known and operating very satisfactory. I can only comment that if you are concerned about the number of people being housed that you consider this scheme as one of the ways to make your money go further. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been very conscious for many years that Tasmania's allocation which currently runs at $37 per capita against say Queensland at $15.19 an Australian average of $19.15 would be brought into question by those States which have made very substantial efforts to obtain maximum utilisation of their funds in conversion into housing. </PARA>
<PARA> Although you probably have this table I enclose a copy so that various difficulties can be seen. As you are aware from previous correspondence I am also greatly concerned about the outstanding applications for rental accommodation existing in Tasmania as compared with the other States. From the attached table it is clear that Tasmania is virtually at the highest it has ever been while apart from New South Wales several other States have made very significant reductions. </PARA>
<PARA> Victoria for instance from a high of 23,000 has now 13,000. Queensland from a high of 8,000 is now 5,500. South Australia from nearly 24,000 is now 19,000 and Western Australia from a high 16,000 is now just over 5,000. The policies of all those States has made it possible to have these numbers reduced where the policies of your department, I believe, need looking into very seriously to see why they have not achieved a similar result. Certainly it is not a shortage of money. </PARA>
<PARA> The table of stocks of lettable dwellings bears this out even more where it can be seen that each State has now more rental housing than it had in 1976 but where Tasmania now has in excess of 50 per cent more but still a greater waiting list. </PARA>
<PARA> My investigation of the actual amount going into housing indicated that the total of the last five years has probably been higher than at any previous time and this of course is due to greater participation by the private sector and this cannot be overlooked as a dominant source and although there may have been some reductions in the public sector the total has been extremely high. </PARA>
<PARA> Very naturally you may expect that I would wish to see Tasmania get every dollar to which they are entitled and I believe I have watched these things close enough to assure you that I do just that but I do find it difficult to be able to suggest going to the Treasurer for extra funds at a time when I am not convinced myself that the money we are already getting is performing the best possible function. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said in my opening paragraph I do accept that it is within the rights of the Government to spend their money in any way in which they feel inclined but if they choose to do so in a manner so patently disadvantageous to the system I certainly believe that they have to consider this and that they cannot expect to be funded for inefficiencies and you will concede that I have drawn these things to your attention over and over again because I could see that sooner or later this situation was going to arise and that we have to face it.</PARA>
<PARA> I would be very happy to assist you in any way to ensure that we could suggest schemes that would ensure better use of the money and I believe that we can overcome the disadvantages that you so adequately expound if you are able to look at it in an overall manner and take into account subsequently the matters that I have raised. </PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for drawing it to my attention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From the comments I made to Mr Baldock it was apparent that Tasmania has the highest per capita rate of federal funding, the highest ever rental stock and the longest ever waiting list. No other State had the same ratio. That clearly demonstrates to me that Tasmania has made insufficient progress towards market related rents. Far too much money is tied up in land. Not enough effort is made to sell government houses that are tied up on long term rentals when they could be sold to the tenants. Not enough has been done to try to get greater co-operation from outside bodies, particularly with regard to aged persons and such matters. Tasmania has not used the terrifically efficient co-operative building society movement nearly enough to get money to people who want housing and it has not been nearly sufficiently innovative in its approach to housing generally. The system that has pervaded has meant that it did not need to be. At no stage has it ever needed to be, because it had enough money to carry on in a way in which had been predetermined. I do not mind the State carrying on in that way provided it does not say to Canberra: 'We want more money to continue to do the things we have done in the past'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sure that this Bill will allow considerably more houses to be provided. It will provide the more needy people with houses. As we all know, the need of the needy is growing and should be considered more than ever. In April 1975 Professor Henderson put down his report 'Poverty in Australia'. It is quite amazing to look back at what he said then. On page 164 of the report, when speaking with respect to the numbers of dwellings, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . (72 per cent) were occupied by people with incomes more than 120 per cent of the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA>He was speaking about public authority housing. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, 86,000 families and individuals below the poverty line, and a total of 146,000 with incomes less than 120 per cent of the poverty line, were renting privately. </PARA>
<PARA>We knew all that in 1975. On page 166 the report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We wish to see a competitive situation in the supply of rental housing with housing authorities gradually raising all rents to market levels as improved income maintenance enables tenants to pay. </PARA>
<PARA>It has been only six years since that report came out, and we have moved very slowly. Many of the problems that we now see have undoubtedly been compounded by the fact that we have been too slow to act on some of the recommendations that were made. It is unfortunate that clause 33 had to be included in the agreement. That clause states:</PARA>
<PARA> The State will in respect of the rent for its rental dwellings apply a policy directed to the progressive movement during the term of this agreement of the rent for each dwelling to charging market rent and will review rents at least annually. </PARA>
<PARA>But that clause is necessary. The whole basis of the Government's housing policy, I believe, is built around charging market rental for the houses involved. If we do not charge market rental, we automatically build up a waiting list of people who are looking for a bonus. But if we charge market rental we will find immediately that one of about three or four things will happen: Tenants will buy the houses they are in if there is no advantage in being a subsidised renter, or they will move out of the house and rent a private sector house, or they will move out and buy a public sector house. Whichever happens, an extra housing unit will be created. To allow people who do not need help to clutter up houses for people who do need them is certainly counterproductive in the extreme. Provided we take that clause in conjunction with clause 34, which I referred to earlier and in which a uniform rental rebate policy is included, we will ensure that the people who can afford to pay do so and that the people who cannot afford to pay do not do so. I believe that is the fairest way we can possibly have it. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the Bill can and will tidy up many of the areas that have been in the production line since 1978. It will certainly put the States in a position in which they will be able to demonstrate their willingness and their capacity. It will certainly provide the private sector with new avenues of producing innovative means of participation in what until now has not been part of its general sphere. Accordingly, I support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this stage in this debate I would like to ask the Government whether it might not now well consider legislation to introduce into Australia, especially in the cities, a system of residential public poor houses modelled on those used in Victorian England to house the poor and homeless. I say that not with any spirit of flippancy but because of my awareness of the difficulties and the wretched conditions under which pensioners and disadvantaged people generally in their thousands are living in my home city of Sydney. Certainly as a result of this Bill and its appalling provisions I can foresee circumstances in Sydney in which that degree of support and help for people who may well become homeless or be forced literally onto the streets may become necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is terrible that a society such as ours, which pretends to be an enlightened and modern one in the second half of the twentieth century, should be contemplating a situation in which it lets down the total community to the extent that it cannot provide decent housing. We are placing ourselves on the level of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics which, indeed, cannot provide its people with decent housing. It is in that position for exactly the same reasons this Government is-because it sees its priorities elsewhere. I suggest that for the Fraser Government the wheel is coming full circle in this and other respects. We are beginning to approach some of the worst aspects of the world's older and more conservative communist states. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase in rents is bound to continue and to be exacerbated in the cities as a result of the fall-off in the provision of public and welfare housing as a result of this legislation. With chronically increasing unemployment, I suggest that over the next five years housing will become the greatest national social problem and the root problem in our society. It is well on the way to becoming that already. In the first place, this Bill represents a substantial abdication by the Federal Government of its responsibility in an area which the Australian Democrats believe should be a major responsibility of any national government in any modern civilised society. It should be a responsibility to see that society is organised in such a way as to provide reasonable housing for all of its people. We believe-I agree with Senator Archer on one point-that there is no reason private enterprise should not be involved in this matter. We believe it should be involved. But it should be an enlightened private enterprise which sees an obligation to provide a service as well as making a profit and which should be encouraged, led and guided by government in such a way that it can meet the requirement for housing. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, if we are going to say that private enterprise can do this we have to demonstrate that it can. In all the cities of Australia there is obviously the gaping, yawning fact that it cannot or has not. Therefore, I think the only answer is to try to do something that will improve that whole area of housing. If we have fallen so low as not to be able to guarantee reasonable housing for all our people at this time in our history, it is time we had a very basic moral and practical reassessment of our objectives in this society and of what we are trying to do. I am encouraged by Senator Archer's assurance that the Government will look at this matter annually and provide an adequate topping up of these funds each year. </PARA>
<PARA> If that happens, the Australian Democrats will be the first to be delighted. We can see-to use Senator Archer's words-the beginnings of an enlightened, advanced Liberal Party policy towards public housing in this country when the problems are genuinely recognised and when the Government comes forward not only with extra money each year to add to this pitiful $1,000m over a period of five years-it will be eroded by inflation, anyway-but also with ideas and an enlightened approach to private enterprise. That may take the form of subsidy tax relief but it must be some way of dealing better with the terrible problem of land and its costs in Australia. The Government must give a lead to private enterprise which, I believe, it would be only too glad to follow. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Government continues to give those present signals to private enterprise that nothing is to be done-that the whole purpose of housing and land in Australia is to rip people off as much as possible and think that this is a tremendous area of potential profit-the problem will tend to be exacerbated. The Australian Democrats believe that it is irresponsible for the Government to allow that situation to continue. We believe too that there would be that kind of flexibility if private enterprise entered into this area reasonably. There has been a deplorable lack at all levels of government in this country of any sort of intelligent response to this problem. In Sydney one can see in street after street rows of standard three-storey, nine unit blocks of home units stuck on small pieces of land. An enlightened approach would be for the original developers or builders of those units to come together as a co-operative group and get a larger piece of land on which to build a high rise building with a swimming pool, tennis courts and to provide some sort of area around it where children could play. That would have made all the difference. What do we have instead? We have these dismal rows of buildings which will be the slums of the future and which are already the slums of the present. They present intolerable burdens to the people who live in them. I suggest that if we built houses such as that we are building something that will last for a long time. We are condemning society for a generation or more in advance to the conditions that have been inflicted on them. I imagine that this sort of thought would be the duty of government. It appals me that apparently the Liberal Government sees no responsibility for it to act on these sorts of ideas. </PARA>
<PARA> The second effect of the Bill, having shifted the responsibility for housing on to the States, is to cut the amount of money being made available for them. I return to this point about topping up. In future the Australian Democrats will be watching the Government to see the extent of its sincerity. It can show its sincerity by grappling this problem of topping up the funds provided annually. We hope that that happens. It is the situation in Sydney at present that pensioners and other disadvantaged people are being required to pay $40 to $50 a week for a slum room with shared facilities. I appeal to honourable senators from other States who may not understand how much Sydney is the apex of this problem, to realise how much more difficult things are in Sydney than in some of the smaller cities of Australia which are much more fortunate. </PARA>
<PARA> I have recently had representations from pensioner constituents and pensioner associations in Sydney about this matter. In fact, I made submissions to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) asking for higher subsidies for pensioner rents in Sydney. I have not been able to telephone my office in Sydney where my files are because of the problem with telephones. But I recall that he basically felt that subsidies in this area ought to be the same throughout Australia. I hope I am not misrepresenting the Minister. If I am, I apologise to him in advance. The point is that I ask the Government again to consider as an urgent palliative measure to increase those subsidies for pensioner housing in Sydney because they are desperately needed. Why Sydney? The problem is, of course, at its worst there. For a variety of reasons rents are much higher in Sydney than anywhere else in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not raised this idea of instituting poor houses lightly or flippantly because I am aware of the dreadful accommodation into which so many of these pensioners and other disadvantaged people are being forced. Because of the actual shortage of even this dreadful accommodation, they have a fear of being evicted and actually being forced on to the streets. Thousands of people are living in dirty, inconvenient slum properties with primitive, shared facilities. Often there are no means at all for cooking meals, rooms leak regularly and windows are broken and let in the wind. This is quite common. It is not unusual. It is having a very serious and deleterious affect on the elderly people who are being compelled to live in this sort of accommodation because they find that on the pension, even with the subsidy, they cannot afford anything better. </PARA>
<PARA> They are rapidly reaching the stage at which they cannot even afford that and where the thought of trying to find something else is looming in their minds as the most important thing in their lives. They have a terror in their old age of being forced into an even more demeaning, undignified and humiliating situation in housing. I feel quite sure that those people would definitely be more comfortable, in fact, in a Victorian-style poor house if it were reasonably well built and had reasonable facilities in it. It is a cruel irony that we have allowed our society to get to the stage where we can actually say that about our own cities in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Unemployed youth, disabled pensioners and widows with families are all part of this growing army of people now crowded into bad accommodation. Increasing numbers of people have no accommodation at all and the picture for the future can only become much worse. In Sydney most new, reasonable accommodation being built is very much up market. It is not at all uncommon for a new two-bedroom unit in Sydney to be selling readily at $100,000. Precious little of this new accommodation is for rental and where it is the rents are often very high. Again a rent of $100 a week is not uncommon for a two-bedroom unit in Sydney. Some rents are even higher. I think it goes without saying that the average family is quite unable to think of buying or even renting one of those units. </PARA>
<PARA> Private enterprise is certainly building those units and they are being sold or rented to the people who can afford them. I do not see any evidence in Sydney, nor can the people with whom I have been dealing-the Australian Council of Social Service, pensioner associations and so on-who are looking around desperately for something better find any evidence that private enterprise has done anything whatsoever to meet the kind of requirement that really exists for the disadvantaged people in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly to consider the people on merely average incomes. Workers on the average wage or a little less are in very bad positions. The Government, which is now exacerbating this situation, is making it a crime in this society to have a family, a crime for which both man and wife must be punished. Also, those children they elect to have must also be punished. The punishment often enough is to be forced to bring up children in a temporary home, in many thousands of cases, in caravans in a caravan park or in small home units with no places for children to play or even to make the slightest noise for fear of disturbing the neighbours. From time to time in this place I hear a lot of pious noise about the difficulties of child abuse and how terrible all this is. It is no wonder to me that we get that kind of situation. The only thing that astonishes me is that the problem is not worse when we consider the plight of a young mother with two or three small children. She has to bring up those children from babies in a tiny home unit or, worse still, in a caravan. Whether the Government likes this comment or not, it is a fact that it is these conditions that this Bill not only seeks to perpetuate but also seeks to exacerbate. The conditions will become worse. </PARA>
<PARA> It is small wonder that the Government has saved up this Bill for today, right at the end of the session. It is another one of these nasty surprises for the Australian community, one of those unpleasant things which the Government has saved up to try to force through today in a hurry. When I was reading the debate on this matter in the House of Representatives, I noticed that it was only given an hour to be debated. This is a matter of enormous importance and I think that only being given an hour to debate it is a great disgrace. Last night I spoke on the general philosophy and view of the Government of its responsibilities to allow legislation to be carried through in an even and regular way. I repeat that indictment of the Government now. In bringing all this legislation through in a rush at the end of the session, the Government is demonstrably cheating. It is seen by the Opposition, by the Australian Democrats and by the Australian community as cheating. The Government is doing this because it has things that it wants to cover up. It does not really want to discuss them properly because it has no real answer to them. This is the Government's way of forcing those things through. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats condemn the Bill. Even more, they condemn the mental attitude that lies behind this legislation. The Government says that private enterprise will solve all of these problems. Senator Archer says that it can be done that way, with free market forces. But will it? As I said before, of course, yes, an enlightened private enterprise, with a strong government lead, could do so along lines which Australian Democrats policy has already devised. That was devised by people thinking and working together, by ordinary Australians saying what they want and then voting on it. The tragedy of this Bill is that it signals that that is not to happen; there is not to be any enlightened general leadership or encouragement for a better public housing policy in Australia, but merely a grudging handing out of the smallest possible amount that could be decently set down and a shuffling off to the States to deal with as best they can what should be an important national responsibility. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say, having listened to Senator Mason, that I agree with most of what he said. It is a great disappointment to find a government that purported to believe in housing for the Australian people doing such a miserable job when it really comes to putting some impetus into the area. I was interested to note that the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh), at the conclusion of his speech in the other place, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill represents an important step forward in the implementation of the Government's housing policy. </PARA>
<PARA>It was rather worrying to read that, taking the Bill into account. He went on to spell it out when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> This policy is to: Ensure that every househodl in Australia is able to obtain adequate housing within its capacity to pay;</PARA>
<PARA>We all know that the capacity of a very large proportion and a very growing proportion of households in Australia to pay is getting less and less. One wonders whether that really means that a large proportion of Australians will be living in tents or bark humpies or maybe just camping on the beach, because the income they receive will only provide that sort of shelter for them. Taking that statement into account, we have more than 80,000 families around Australia on waiting lists for houses. More than 150,000 people are homeless. More than a quarter of a million people live in caravans or makeshift accommodation. This is happening in what one of our new senators claimed yesterday is the land of milk and honey, a country where people live in much better circumstances than almost any other place in the world. Yet we have thousands of people who do not have any hope of living in anything like decent accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> Resource development is a great plank of this Government's policy. The Government says that it is going to be the panacea for Australia, that it will provide us with a great, rich and beautiful life. Resource development will solve all of our problems. Yet in the very areas of Australia where resources are being developed, there are appalling shortages of that very basic commodity, housing. There is no move from this Federal Government, which put so much of our effort and resources into those areas, to get on with and provide immediately the housing that is necessary. In Gladstone, Queensland, a quarter of the population is living in caravans, without taking into account the new population growth. In the Latrobe Valley in Victoria, without taking into account any of the new proposals that the Liberal Government in that State has come up with, there is not a room, a caravan or a condemned chook house to rent. Here we are talking about people who are working on the project renting some sort of accommodation. Of course in those areas, if one talks about the aged, single parents, the unemployed and other disadvantaged people in our community, there is no hope whatsoever of getting them any sort of accommodation. Nor is there any move from this Government to provide anything like the amount of finance needed for accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> We talk glibly about giving people clean water and a place to live. This Government does nothing about it. In Portland in Victoria, with the encouragement of this Government, we have extraordinary development in the aluminium industry. One cannot buy accommodation for love or money. Perhaps I should rephrase that. One cannot get accommodation for money. One might be able to get it for some other reasons! The Liberal Government in Victoria estimates conservatively-it is a conservative Government and the Minister is even more conservative-that there are at least 100,000 households in need of bare accommodation. What is this Bill going to do for them? It will do nothing. On the basis of 1974-75 data, the housing Minister in Victoria estimated that the public housing stock can cater for only 34 per cent of the apparent need. In 1974-75 we were still a comparatively buoyant community. But when one looks at the enormous increases in unemployment and in the number of homeless people since 1974-75, what must the current rate in Victoria be, if only 34 per cent could be catered for in 1974-75? Honourable senators can double that figure for 1980-81 and 1981-82. What will this Bill do for that problem? The second point of the Government's housing policy states:</PARA>
<PARA> Encourage home ownership across the widest possible range of income groups concentrating Federal assistance in the areas of greatest need. </PARA>
<PARA>On 7 April this year, there was an article in the Melbourne Herald. It referred to statements made by the Managing Director of Jennings Industries Ltd, Mr J. J. Wood. Jennings Industries would be the the firm which would know a great deal about housing activity and housing policies in Australia. At a Conference of the Australian Association of Permanent Building Societies, Mr Woods said:</PARA>
<PARA> Housing activity would slow down substantially in Australia if mortgage interest remained above 12 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Continued satisfactory growth in private sector housing in Australia depended on the Government effectively managing inflationary pressures arising from the resources boom. </PARA>
<PARA>As we know very well, the Government has been less than successful in doing that. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Governments strategy was to control inflation by monetary measures.</PARA>
<PARA> Competition for funds is sending interest rates spiralling to levels well above the recorded inflation rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Home finance lending rates are a critical factor and care must be taken to ensure that housing does not receive more than its share of constraints. </PARA>
<PARA>This is because the effects on housing will be more immediate than on other industries where higher rates customer finance may be more affordable. What has this Government done about housing interest rates? What were its election promises about the rate of interest that would be charged on housing loans? What is the point of even talking about ensuring that every household in Australia is able to obtain adequate housing within its capacity to pay if the Government is not doing anything about the rates that people have to pay on the loans that they have to take out? The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Wood said housing supply could not withstand high interest rates on long term mortgages because first home buyers made up 50 per cent of the market. </PARA>
<PARA> He said industry and commerce could withstand higher interest rates because they enjoyed the benefit of tax deductibility on mortgage payments and much shorter repayment terms. </PARA>
<PARA>What has this Government done about that in relation to housing? Which area of industry and commerce in this country has it favoured? Yet it talks about providing every household in Australia with adequate housing. The article went on:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Wood said that in looking at what was an affordable interest rate on mortgages a number of key factors had to be kept in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> Half of all employees in Australia earn less than $200 a week. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me apply that to those areas of resource development where people are competing desperately with each other for housing, where people are desperate for loans so that they can provide some sort of accommodation for their families. What are those people earning less than $200 a week going to do in the light of the high rate of interest that is being charged and the piddling amount of money and the lack of direction that this Federal Government has given in that area? What encouragement is there for them to work, to produce, to bring up families, to contribute to Australia? They get nothing from this Federal Government. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Building regulations are strictly controlled in Australia so that home buyers cannot reduce the size of their home below a minimum standard to suit their budget. </PARA>
<PARA>God help us! In some ways I am glad, because if some of them had to reduce their home standards to suit their budget they would be living in a chook house. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The normal maximum term of housing loans in Australia is 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA> An increase of 1 per cent in interest rates reduces borrowing power by around $2500 for a family which can afford mortgage payments of $100 a week. </PARA>
<PARA>That, evidently, went right over the head of this Federal Government. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It is impractical to price the cost of finance into a house to match a loan affordable. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Wood said to sustain a weekly repayment of around $100 on a $50,000 house and land package purchased on a 10 per cent deposit a young couple would require a gross weekly income of around $350. </PARA>
<PARA>We know that there are hundreds and hundreds of young couples in Australia who both go out to work and who do not receive that kind of income. To what are we condemning them? We have all noticed in the newspapers in the last six months stories about the aging population and the lowering birth rate in Australia. Who in the name of fortune would bring children into the world when wages, conditions and the hope of providing even a basic, simple house is so low in Australia today? Mr Wood said:</PARA>
<PARA> Anyone who doubts that housing activity will slow substantially if mortgages stay above 12 per cent should look at overseas experience. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Wood suggested that the Prime Minister of this country (Mr Malcolm Fraser) should look to Mrs Thatcher. After all, the Prime Minister of this country appears to have a great regard for Mrs Thatcher and her methods. Mr Wood pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Thatcher's move to drop housing rates in the British budget from 14 to 12 per cent is designed to stimulate housing demand. </PARA>
<PARA>We can only hope that our dear Prime Minister might listen more closely to what his esteemed colleague is doing in other places. Mr Wood went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Similarly the American housing market is not expected to reflect its large pent-up demand until rates drop to 12 per cent-and this with tax deductibility. </PARA>
<PARA>This gentleman is the Managing Director of Jennings Industries Ltd, a leading housing firm that provides an enormous amount of housing, not only in Victoria but also across Australia. He is a man who ought to know what he is talking about. He was speaking at a conference of the Australian Association of Permanent Building Societies to people who ought to have some appreciation of the situation in the community. That leads me to the third plank of the Government's housing policy platform, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> Ensure stable economic conditions within the building industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Does it sound as though the Government's policies are stabilising conditions within the building industry? Because of the high interest rates and the lack of bridging finance, thousands of houses in Australia at this time are being sold up by mortgagors because the mortgagees cannot keep up the payments. They are losing their jobs, their wages are being reduced, their wives can no longer get work and they can no longer maintain the payments on houses that in the first instance were priced well above their value anyway. There is evidence that many of these houses are being sold for less than their value. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be interesting if somebody were to inquire into who is buying these houses at less than their value. Mortgagees are being left with the difference between the debt they took on in the first place and the amount of money that comes in from the sale of their house. They are being left with that difference as a continuing and crippling debt. In some instances they are being asked to pay 60 per cent interest on default payments. All of this goes over the head of this Federal Government. How can one talk about stable economic conditions in the building industry when there is overwhelming evidence that building societies are going broke, building firms are going broke, builders are going out of the industry and suppliers of building materials are going out of business? An article in the Age of 26 May stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Societies lose ground in home lending market. </PARA>
<PARA> Building societies' share of the home-lending market has fallen dramatically during the first three months of 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Since December, building societies have seen their share of the market slip in the face of increased competition from the banks and from other non-government and government borrowers, which, in the face of tight monetary policy, have been more willing than the building societies to compete for funds by offering higher interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>The market for finance is drying up. The building societies now have to compete for funds by offering higher interest rates. If they do that, of course, they then have to raise the rates that they charge to the ordinary people of this country who have learned that the building societies are the only organisations to which they can turn for assistance in buying a house. Funds are drying up because this Government's policy is to direct all sorts of investment funds into other areas. Its attitude is: Never mind about housing for the ordinary Australian people. The investment funds are going into other areas. Housing is low on the list of people who want to invest funds. Who suffers? The ordinary people who work this country and produce its wealth suffer. But this Government does not see the necessity to assist. </PARA>
<PARA> Fewer and fewer people can afford to buy houses, so fewer and fewer houses are being bought. It is not by chance that in those circumstances the Victorian Minister for Housing has switched his policy from building welfare houses to buying houses from private enterprise for welfare purposes. If he did not do that more builders would be going broke because no houses at all would be built and those that had been built on the spec market would not be bought. So the industry's friend, the Victorian Minister for Housing, is stepping in to help it. </PARA>
<PARA> But will the Government really stretch out that dollar for welfare housing? The Minister and the Government have told us that there is $x to be spent on what we call welfare housing. How a Government that says that every household in Australia should have adequate housing can talk about welfare housing is beyond me. It seems to me that all Australians are entitled to decent housing. Nonetheless, what I want to know is how we can expect to have that welfare dollar stretched out to its maximum if we are to use that money to buy houses on the market. Will more housing be available for people who cannot afford to build their own homes? Will more housing be available for people who at the moment cannot afford to rent on the open market? Of course as people move out of houses which they hoped to buy, they are also in the market competing for any houses that may be for rent. In this free enterprise world in which we live that pushes up the price of rent. If those people ask for a better wage so that they can cope, they will be told that they are causing inflation. Will this use of the welfare dollar that this Federal Government has given the States for housing mean that perhaps more money goes into the pockets of private builders? Already we have reports that fewer houses are for sale. The Age of 8 April states:</PARA>
<PARA> House prices in many parts of Melbourne are likely to rise steadily because of an increasing shortage of residential properties for sale, according to a survey of real estate agents published by the State Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> The survey, conducted in January, shows that more than 80 per cent of agents who participated had insufficient listings of houses for sale. The majority view was that units and flats were in short supply, too. </PARA>
<PARA> The strongest indication of a shortage of houses for sale came from the north, where all agents surveyed said there was inadequate supply. In the north-east, 92.3 per cent gave the same answer and units and flats appeared to be in shortest supply in that area. </PARA>
<PARA>So the money that this Federal Government is giving to the States for housing is being used by the Minister of Housing in Victoria to buy houses in the market place rather than to build houses. We are told that at the moment there is a great shortage of houses to be bought, especially houses where one would expect government assistance might be highest, that is, in the northern and western parts of Melbourne where generally people's incomes are less than those of people who live in the southern and eastern parts. There is a shortage of houses, so now we have the Minister in the market. What will that do to the price of houses? It will send them sky-high because here they have a buyer with cash in his pocket. Will the Minister persist and buy a few houses in those areas at a reasonable price or will he move out to the southern and eastern suburbs of Melbourne where prices usually are higher than in the other areas, but where the need for welfare housing is not so great. In a Press release the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) said:</PARA>
<PARA> The initiatives outlined by Mr Kennett should result in better services to low income families with a housing need, a great involvement by the private sector, and more efficient use of taxpayers' funds. </PARA>
<PARA>For the life of me I cannot see how this will provide a better service for low income families with a housing need because in many instances the houses will not be in areas where people need them. They will be in the outer parts of Melbourne. These days it costs people who live in these areas a tremendous amount of money to get to work. So why will people want to go there? What sort of rent will the Minister ask because he will have to pay a great deal of money to buy the houses. We will certainly need a greater involvement by the private sector. When it comes to receiving the profits, that is exactly how the private sector will be involved. The private sector in the building industry has not shown any initiative when it comes to welfare housing. Where are the houses that private enterprise has built for people to rent? Where is any involvement from the private sector in the area of houses for people who do not have and will not have-while this Federal Government is in existence-the sort of income that will enable them to ever buy their own houses?</PARA>
<PARA> In the last two weeks in this Parliament we have had an indication of how some women feel about housing and government involvement in their lives. Some honourable senators on both sides of this Parliament were scandalised that women, of all people, should make a nuisance of themselves, should sit in King's Hall and should make noise to try to draw attention to the fact that they are on the very lowest scale when it comes to government involvement in assisting them to live better lives. In part those women have been involved in this question of refuges for women. Some women, who for many reasons which we do not have to go into now, have to leave home and find somewhere else to live. Often they have children. They go to a refuge. Refuges are supposed to be what they sound-a place where a person can go for refuge while she draws a breath and then gets on with her life. The refuges are stuffed up because women cannot move out as there is nowhere for them to go. How can there be anywhere for them to live when we have been shown that there is a tremendous shortage of housing for people who can pay and these women do not have any sort of income that enables them to pay? What they need is to be able to remove themselves from the refuge to some decent accommodation which is in the price bracket that they can afford so that they can go on living their lives. That is what the women were trying to say in the hall. They were saying 'Look at us. There is not anywhere for us to go.' This Bill gives them no joy whatsoever. It hands money over to the States which in the main have shown that they do not give two hoots about that sort of housing. </PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria-the Minister of Social Welfare has made kindly noises about refuges-we have a Minister for Housing who is not prepared to take up that challenge, who is not prepared to provide the sort of decent housing that these women can afford to pay out of their incomes. What he will do with that money is involve the private sector but he is involving the private sector by buying spec houses off the market at inflated rates in areas where people cannot use them. How many houses will the Minister be able to afford on this amount of money? That is the $64 question. We know, as I have said, that the Government is showing no concern about giving any sort of direction. </PARA>
<PARA> We also know that money for Aboriginal housing is involved in the Housing Assistance Bill. Again that money is handed to the States to do with as they see fit. We have seen how they see fit. Victoria has never been looked upon as an area that has an extraordinary Aboriginal problem in the sense that people talk about the Northern Territory, Western Australia or Queensland having an Aboriginal problem. But Victoria has thousands of Aboriginal people living there. They live there in squalor, without jobs and without hope. In this place, some three years ago, I raised the fact that money was given directly for Aboriginal housing to the Government of Victoria. Instead of being used in that way it was used to build carports. Houses that already had established garages had the garages pulled down and carports built. Houses that did not have a car had carports built. Houses that did not have a person in the house who could drive a car had carports built. Yet we had hundreds of Aboriginal families desperate for good housing. I raised the matter here, a periphery concern was expressed but nothing was done. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently money that was given to the Victorian Government for Aboriginal housing was given back to the Federal Government without being spent. If that is the attitude that the Victorian Government has taken up to this time when grants have been tied to Aboriginal housing, what sort of result will we get today when grants are not tied to Aboriginal housing? Still we have thousands of Aboriginal families who are desperate for some sort of decent accommodation. I ask the Federal Government to look closely at those two areas of desperate need-Aboriginal housing and housing for women who need somewhere to live which they can afford out of the pension or low income that so many of them earn and where they can bring up their children with decency. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has made big play in setting out this housing policy. It looks fine written on paper. I ask the Government to put some real teeth into it and to see that federal governments in this big, rich country provide that basic of decent living-decent housing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Housing Assistance Bill 1981. The first thing I would like to do is to congratulate the new Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) on a very good Bill which recognises the philosophies of our Government parties in economics, in welfare and in Federal-State relations. The Commonwealth provides taxpayers' funds for welfare housing purposes; for defence and eligible ex-service personnel in the erection and purchase of homes; assistance to young married couples under the Homes Savings Grant Act; the operations of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation-for some time now; for assistance in the provision of accommodation for the aged; homes for public servants on transfer to the Territories; and separate provisions for Aboriginal housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Funds for these purposes have not been insignificant. For example, funds provided to the States for defence service homes between 1972 and 1980 amounted to $662,450,000. In addition to welfare housing there is also a legitimate and very substantial provision by both Federal and State governments to house itinerant government employees, such as members of the Armed Forces, public works, electricity, forestry and Telecom Australia employees and teachers and police. This list is by no means complete. </PARA>
<PARA> In the welfare field, the Commonwealth has provided funds for home ownership assistance and for rental housing assistance by a series of agreements and special grants and advances. I deal first with the agreements. Since 1945 the Commonwealth Government has provided the States with funds for welfare housing by a series of agreements made in 1945, 1956, 1961, 1966, 1973 and 1978. These funds have been provided partly by way of grants and partly by way of loans repayable over long terms and at low rates of interest. With regard to the special grants and advances, the States Grants (Housing) Act 1971 made provision for a housing grant to the States of $5.5m every year and the Housing Assistance Act 1973 authorised special advances to the States for rental housing. The 1978 housing agreement-made by my Government-between the Commonwealth and the six States, excluding the Northern Territory, expires on 30 June this year; so it is now necessary for a new agreement, and that is the purpose of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the history of funds provided for these purposes since 1945, we find that the staggering total figure provided in actual money terms is $4,697.960m. That is not the amount in 1980-81 values but in itself it is a staggering sum which is difficult to conceive. If we convert that amount into 1979-80 dollar values we find that it works out at $11,214.532m of taxpayers' funds provided since 1945 for welfare housing. That staggering sum of money, as I say, is difficult to conceive but it would be the equivalent of about 350,000 dwellings in today's money. It would be equal to 15 fully equipped nuclear aircraft carriers with all the aircraft on board. If we were to stack $1m in $50 notes on the Senate table, the pile would be 9 feet high. If we tried to stack $11,214.532m in $50 bills we would have a staggering pile 102,000 feet high. That is an incredible amount of money which has been poured into welfare housing since 1945. </PARA>
<PARA> One would think that if the taxpayers of Australia provided funds for the equivalent of 350,000 dwellings since 1945 that would be the end of the problem. But let us look at the facts. Under these agreements, my State of Victoria has received, in actual funds, $1,275.133m. The Victorian Housing Commission has encouraged home ownership and of the 88,695 dwellings completed by the Commission to 30 June 1979, the Commission had sold 48,386 of these dwellings. According to the Victorian State Housing Commission, there were 13,861 applicants for rental accommodation as at 31 December 1980 compared with 14,336 at 31 December 1973. So in seven years we have managed the magnificent reduction of 1,475 applicants. What about the rest of Australia? The total number of applicants with all State housing authorities at 31 December 1973 was 85,537. In the five years, 1973-1978, $1,733.650m in actual funds was provided by the Commonwealth. Between 1978 and 1981 a further estimated $877 billion of taxpayers' funds was poured into welfare housing. In actual money terms, that is a total of $2,610.650m. With an average dwelling cost calculated at $28,000 between 1973 and 1978 and $29,500 between 1978 and 1981 that is the equivalent of 91,644 additional dwellings. Yet having spent all that taxpayers' money-$2.6 billion-and provided the equivalent of over 91,000 dwellings, what has happened to the demand? The demand was reduced by the magnificent number of 146 applicants-from 85,537 in 1973 to 85,391 in 1980. This is a bottomless pit. </PARA>
<PARA> In a 1980 survey the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that housing costs as a proportion of income vary with the nature of occupancy from 13 per cent for households in the process of purchasing their own accommodation and 12.6 per cent-almost the same-for those households renting a furnished dwelling from a private landlord. But where the dwelling is rented from a government housing authority the statistics show the rental costs as only 7.1 per cent of income. So there is a demand for this sort of accommodation. Of course, there is a continuing waiting list, and the reason is that the accommodation is cheap. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not doubt that the taxpayers of Australia would be prepared to provide some cheap accommodation for the poor and the disadvantaged in our community. But is this happening? It is not so easy to determine the number of disadvantaged actually in government-provided dwellings but the Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty found that many people living in subsidised welfare housing were not poor and that many poor were not in subsidised housing. Available Bureau of Statistics figures which I have been able to look at indicate that the number of needy living in government rentals may very well be as low as one-third of the total accommodated in government rental housing. That means that approximately two-thirds of those still living in government-owned premises are not the needy. They are being subsidised by this low-level rental accommodation. What is happening here? What is wrong? Why are we able to spend this massive amount of money-the equivalent of $11 billion-and not solve this problem? Let us have a look at what happened in Sweden which, of course, is the laboratory of social democracy now being embraced by the former socialists opposite. (Quorum formed). When Senator Coleman drew attention to the state of the House, I was saying that, since 1945, the equivalent of over $11 billion of taxpayers' funds has been poured into welfare housing in Australia, and we still have a problem. I was about to ask: Why have we a problem? Let us look at what happened in the laboratory of social democracy, Sweden. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1942, Sweden had a housing shortage which was thought to have been brought about by the war. So in that year it introduced rent control to ensure that investors did not exploit the shortage-the sort of thing that one would expect Opposition senators to embrace. What happened? By 1944, the situation was worse so Sweden took the next big government step-the sort of social democratic step that one would expect from members of the Australian Labor Party if they ever get back into government-and created a bureaucracy to fix this problem. In 1944, Sweden's leading official expert on housing policy said that the liquidation of the housing market shortage was a once-for-all business which ought to be accomplished in a relatively short time, but he did not think he would be able to do it in a year. In 1942, the waiting time for dwellings in Stockholm was one month; by 1950, it was nine months; by 1953, it was 24 months; by 1956, it was 30 months; and, by 1958, it was a magnificent 40 months. This occurred under the bureaucracy introduced in Sweden to overcome its housing shortage problem. That was notwithstanding massive injections of taxpayers' funds into government-provided accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> What happened? There is a simple answer if only it is faced up to by people who are realistic in this field. What happened was that the investors were kept out by the rent control provisions and more and more people wanted to live in the subsidised government-provided low rental accommodation. As I said before, people like to live in cheap accommodation if it is provided for them. Australia, with an expenditure of the equivalent of over $11 billion on welfare housing since 1945, has not progressively reduced demands for this welfare housing, nor has it liquidated waiting lists. In fact in Tasmania, where the largest per capita advances and grants have been made, there has been the greatest growth in waiting lists in Australia. In Sweden, and likewise in Australia, there has been an upsurge in demand by single persons for private dwellings and a drift from hostel and boarding house accommodation, a change of lifestyle and an increase, if you like, in expectations. Swedish figures indicate that the number of those in the unmarried group seeking private dwellings increased from 23 per cent in 1940 to 55 per cent in 1975, and the demand was by no means satisfied. What was happening was that teenagers were seeking to get away from their parents and to live in their own private accommodation provided by the taxpayers of Sweden who enabled these people to live away from their parents. </PARA>
<PARA> A similar phenomenon is apparent in Australia. Boarding colleges at universities, government hostels, youth hostels and similar types of accommodation are either closing or experiencing low occupancy rates. But the issue must be this: Is it reasonable to impose this massive demand on the taxpayers of Australia when the shift in accommodation preference in most cases is a matter of choice and not of necessity. Of course there is a need for welfare rental housing for those in actual need; but, while the Government subsidises housing in a way which keeps rentals below an economic return, private enterprise will not be encouraged to invest in that area. At the same time, more people will demand access to the subsidised rental premises. There will be growing demand for fewer premises and a greater demand on taxpayers' funds will be created. That is the simple truth, no matter how unpalatable it is to people such as Opposition senators, including muddled thinkers such as Senator Mason who had some words to say shortly before I rose. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem simply will not be solved by throwing money at it. I have tried to explain that fact to Senator Melzer in this chamber before. All she ever proposes is that we throw money at the problems, and the problems will not be solved in that way. My Government showed the way in the 1978 agreement. This agreement continues that course. However, in accordance with our policy of federalism, this Bill recognises that provision of welfare housing is the responsibility of the States. I hope that the other States follow the lead of my own State, Victoria, which, under its new Minister of Housing, the Honourable Jeff Kennett, has adopted most worthwhile policies. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the details of the Bill and the problems of Victoria which once again is disadvantaged in comparison with other States. The present method of allocation of funds based on the 1973-74 arrangements is no longer relevant and has led to widespread iniquities. Queensland, with 15.6 per cent of the population of the States and the Northern Territory, is receiving 9.7 per cent of advances. New South Wales and Victoria are receiving less than the average per capita allocations while South Australia and, of course, Tasmania are receiving excessive allocations. The 1980-81 advances and grants in per capita terms were: New South Wales, $17.75; Victoria, $17.22; Queensland, $15.19; South Australia, $28.79; Western Australia, $21.80; and Tasmania, $37. Any analysis of the need for welfare housing recognises that the larger and the older a city the greater the need. One would think that New South Wales and Victoria, with Sydney and Melbourne, would get the largest per capita grants, but, no, that honour goes to Tasmania with a total population of 400,000. Next is South Australia, with Adelaide which has a population of only 930,000--</PARA>

There are other inequalities, as demonstrated by the difference in capital costs between States, and, regrettably, demonstrated efficiencies in Victoria as compared with New South Wales are not rewarded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to replace the States Grants (Housing) Act 1971, which I mentioned earlier, the Housing Assistance Act 1973 and the Housing Assistance Act 1978 with an agreement that will operate for five years instead of three years and which will facilitate home ownership for those able to afford it but not able to gain it through the private market. It will provide sufficient rental housing for those members of the community who are deemed to be in need of governmental assistance at a price which is within their capacity to pay. It will also provide assistance for home ownership and assistance with rental accommodation in the most efficient way. It is proposed to exclude from eligibility those not in need, to minimise continued availability of assistance to those no longer in need and to accord benefits which are designed so that the assistance being provided is related to the particular family's or individual's current economic and social circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth, under the Bill, will provide a base level of $200m per annum for the five years of the agreement with additional funding to be determined each year in the Budget context. Of this base level, $54m will be earmarked for rental housing assistance to disadvantaged groups, such as pensioners and Aboriginals, and will be in the form-I use the Minister's words, not mine-of 'non-repayable interest free grants'. I suspect that that phrase is slightly tautologous. I would have thought that any grant would be non-repayable and interest free. These earmarked funds will be allocated between States on a population needs basis, as at present. The balance of the base of $200m-in other words, the other $146m-will be in the form of advances repayable over 53 years at an interest rate of 4 1/4 per cent per annum. That is not bad money; I would not mind some of it myself. In the first year of the agreement these advances, plus any additional non-earmarked funds, will be allocated on an historical basis and thereafter will be gradually adjusted to an equal per capita basis over a nine-year period with a condition that no State receives less than 5 per cent of the united base amount of $146m. That seems to me to be far too long a period. The implementation of an equal per capita allocation will take 10 years, and that must surely be to the disadvantage of New South Wales and Victoria. I would have thought that the Government could look at the implementation of that over a period of five years without drastically disadvantaging the other States. </PARA>
<PARA> The package of welfare housing policies announced on 27 May this year by the Victorian Housing Minister, Mr Kennett, directs assistance to where there is a genuine need among low income families. The greater involvement by the private sector and the move to have the Housing Commission act as a provider of housing assistance rather than a land and housing developer in competition with the private sector is particularly welcome and should free significant funds for a worthwhile attack on the Commission's waiting lists. The spot buying of existing houses will avoid the need for large housing estates with their attendant social problems. I was fascinated when Senator Melzer said that it was a terrible thing for the Victorian Government to be buying houses in suburbs instead of building complexes. </PARA>

Anyone driving into Melbourne from the airport who looks at the ghastly buildings which are many storeys high in the North Melbourne area could not suggest that the Housing Commission of Victoria has not made a wise decision in deciding not to enter into the land development and building area but to try to buy houses which are available on the market at spot prices in order to try to solve its problems. I fail to understand Senator Melzer's logic in suggesting that that is not the wisest policy for Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The initiatives taken by the Victorian Government are most refreshing and come at a time when the Commonwealth has been urging the States to shrug off traditional welfare housing policies which are nonsense in favour of more innovative and cost effective programs directed at the genuinely disadvantaged. Victoria has properly addressed these problems and in due course Victoria will progressively reap the rewards. In the meantime, Victoria continues to suffer inequity in the distribution of the funds. All funds, apart from those earmarked for disadvantaged groups, will be distributed in 1981-82 in the same proportion as advances were allocated in 1980-81. Over the remaining years of the agreement there will be a progressive advancement towards a per capita allocation. As I said before, it is my view that it would be far better for the States if that progressive allocation were made over a five-year period instead of a 10-year period. Finally, I say that the legislation demonstrates this Government's belief that State governments are best placed to know the needs of the needy in their States and allows the States to tailor their programs to meet those needs. It also attempts to ensure that the vast majority of Australians who are owners or owner-purchasers of their own homes will not be burdened for evermore with taxes to provide housing for those who may very well be able to afford to accommodate themselves. </PARA>

I shall be brief because of the time constraints and because the general thrust of the opposition to the Government's stringent or stingy housing assistance policies have been outlined previously in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. However, let me make it perfectly clear that the figures show that, compared to other areas of Federal expenditure, housing has fared badly indeed. Let me deal with the actual outlays in various areas by the Federal Government over the last 14 years. The rate of growth for housing over the period is 130 per cent. That should be compared with the figure of 850 per cent for social security and welfare, 910 per cent for health, 1,570 per cent for education and 233 per cent for defence. In fact, in a period when more and more people have needed government assistance for either home purchase or rental, Commonwealth outlays for housing have shown very little increases. The facts show that in real terms public housing is the only category to have fallen over this period.</PARA></TALK.START>

I wish to challenge his rather parochial view on this matter when he suggested as I understand him, that we ought to be moving to a distribution of funds solely on a per capita basis. In fact, he even went further and suggested that housing finance ought to be provided to the older cities. I cannot follow the honourable senator's logic at all. I would have thought--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, on the need. I appreciate the interjection of the honourable senator. I propose to refer to the comparative needs of our two States. The basis should be the need of families for welfare housing, those which are disadvantaged in particular. I propose to give some statistics in order to compare the situation in Victoria with that in Tasmania. Firstly, Tasmania has more large families than has Victoria. It has more families that are relatively poor. When the last Commonwealth Census was taken 53.7 per cent of Tasmanian families were described as relatively poor. For Victoria the percentage was 48.6. In terms of recipients of pensions, and/or social security benefits, expressed as a percentage of the population aged 15 years or older, the figure for Tasmania is 24.4 per cent, compared with 20.7 per cent for Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have heard a great deal about the need for housing for the single parent group. In Tasmania it represents 4.1 per cent of total families and in Victoria 3.3 per cent. The percentage of the labour force which is unemployed is also higher in my State than it is in Victoria. Again, in Tasmania 5.1 per cent of the population are handicapped, against 4.6 per cent in Victoria. In respect of each of those criteria the situation in Tasmania demands far greater attention than does that in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> I did not set out to engage in a dog fight between the States over this important matter-fighting, as it were, over the division of the cake rather than over its size. It would have done us all good to join in fighting over the size of the cake rather than the way in which it was divided to point out the way in which, in the last 14 years, its size in real terms has diminised. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) might also consider the need for part of the total sum available to be provided by way of grants rather than as has been suggested. At present, the States cannot meet a number of very deserving situations because the sum made available for welfare housing by the Commonwealth is too greatly tied down. I propose to quote from a letter which I have received from Mr Darrel Baldock, the Minister for Housing in Tasmania, a gentleman who would be well known to Senator Lewis. In the letter, which I understand has been sent to all Tasmanian senators, Mr Baldock states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Agreement will not make provision for guaranteed annual grants for innovative housing schemes. This is a major blow because the scope to engage in new less capital intensive rental housing measures has been limited which will result in lengthening waiting periods. </PARA>
<PARA>In that respect he makes a suggestion which I pass on to the Minister for his consideration. Its acceptance would not alter the total amount of money to be provided to the States, if the Government is firmly committed to that course. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> This could be remedied by simply making a proportion of the untied base funds of $200m grants available for innovative purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Baldock suggests that the provision of an amount of $30m would be reasonable. As I understand the situation, none of the other States objects to that particular course being followed. If I am wrong, I hope that the Minister will correct me. If not, the Minister ought to take that suggestion on board. I shall raise it at the Committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> For the benefit of Senator Lewis and of Victorians generally I point out that over the years the Tasmanian Government has regularly committed, in its budget, a hefty sum for welfare housing. For example, in 1980-81, 8.35 per cent of its capital funds and 1.23 per cent of its revenue funds were devoted to housing. In addition, I remind the Senate of a statement made by the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) on 17 May 1981 in a news release entitled, 'Victoria belly-aching over housing funds'. It stated that Mr McVeigh said that in 1979-80 the Victorian Government's contribution to welfare housing, from its own funds, was approximately $6 per head of population compared with a national average of about $16. The figure for South Australia was $47. The Tasmanian figure was second highest, at $27. In Western Australia it was $23, in Queensland $17 and in New South Wales $13. They are not my words; they are those of the Minister for Housing and Construction. I am pleased to note, as Senator Lewis has pointed out, that apparently there is in Victoria a new broom which will sweep clean. Mr Kennett has indeed made some forward-looking statements on this subject. I congratulate Senator Lewis for that. But I urge him and other honourable senators to argue not so much about the division of the cake but about the inadequacy of the cake. I believe it would be in our best long term interests and in the best long term interest of those people who need welfare housing for a combined effort to be made by the States and in this States House to achieve a better result in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the debate on this Bill a variety of views has come forward, particularly from the Opposition. I think one central theme comes through clearly; that is, there is a fundamental difference in philosophy and approach between the Opposition and the Government on this matter. Certainly that came through in respect of other legislation with which we were dealing yesterday and in respect of which the States are in agreement with the Commonwealth. In this matter there are perhaps three areas that demonstrate that fundamental difference. The first is that the Government believes in providing the States with as much untied finance as possible for them to determine their own sets of priorities as they see them within their own borders. That clearly came through in the very real point which Senator Harradine was seeking to make in respect of innovative housing in that a substantial amount of money is to be made available to Tasmania to enable it to provide housing which it sees as necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But, of course, the Commonwealth has put a definite embargo on a certain proportion-roughly one-quarter-of the funds and has said that those funds must be made available to provide housing for disadvantaged groups, particularly Aborigines and pensioners. That maintains the Federal Government's interest in those areas in which it has a great deal of interest and to which it is required by the Constitution to take a particular approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Another fundamental difference between the Government and the Opposition is the user-pays principle. That spills over into how we can best deliver the maximum quality and quantity of housing for those who need it most. It is that which the Opposition will not accept. The amendment moved by Senator Gietzelt touches on the areas which we are discussing and draws attention to what the Opposition considers to be the deficiencies of the Federal Government's approach. In fact they are the strengths of the approach in that the Government sees a need for the States to amplify and develop their own systems by which they can get the maximum value out of their present stock of housing and so that they can provide the maximum quantity of housing for the disadvantaged and for those in greatest need. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Archer earlier put his finger on the point when he indicated that 72 per cent of people occupying the State government's stock of welfare housing earn incomes which are more than 120 per cent of the poverty level, as determined by the Henderson inquiry in 1975. That highlights the fact that those people are occupying housing to the disadvantage of those who are below the poverty line, and it is that which we are seeking to redress by the approach contained in this legislation. Senator Archer also did us a service by drawing our attention to the Schedule to the Bill which sets out the agreement with the States. Clause 33 of the agreement touches on rents charged for dwellings in the States and the movement of those rents towards market values. Clause 34, which is the converse, demonstrates this Government's real desire to help those in the greatest need, as determined by the States, by providing them with rental rebates. In those areas we clearly show our concern for the disadvantaged and for those in greatest need. This legislation was designed to provide a service to those who need it most within the given framework of the limited resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Other speakers have talked about the base level of funding which is set at an annual rate of $200m. Most have tended to ignore the fact that the second reading speech stated that there will be a reappraisal of that amount of money each year and that the amount will be topped up each year. Of course, in each case that will be a Budget decision to be taken by the Federal Government at the time. Furthermore, it seemed that Senator Mason missed the point that this is part of a five-year agreement, a long term agreement, which provides the States with the opportunity of planning their housing programs properly. I believe that is precisely the objective they seek and consequently is the sort of program which has their full support. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe only one other matter of relevance emerged in the debate; that is, the continuing commitment of this Government to providing the highest level of housing for the population. When we take into account the fact that there is a level of 72 per cent of home ownership in this country and that that is higher than in most other countries, we can acknowledge that both public and private enterprise have done a sterling job in providing the stock of housing in Australia, which on its own, is improving in quality as years go by. It is interesting to note, as Senator Archer brought out during his remarks, that only 9 per cent of the total stock of housing is public housing-defined as houses provided by governments. That indicates a rising level of affluence. It indicates that housing policies in this country in the last 35 to 40 years have been tremendously successful and that this Government is dedicated to a continuing improvement. The Government will not support the Opposition's amendment. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides for the validation until 31 December 1981 of duties collected in pursuance of Customs Tariff Proposals No. 6 (1981) introduced into the Parliament on 14 May and proposals No. 7 (1981) introduced on 26 May. Under section 226 of the Customs Act the collection of duties in pursuance of Customs Tariff Proposals is protected against legal challenge for six months or until the close of the session of Parliament, whichever occurs first. The introduction and passage of a validation Bill is therefore a necessary machinery measure which takes over from section 226 pending the introduction of a Customs Tariff Amendment Bill, anticipated for the Budget sittings, to enact the changes contained in the proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> The tariff changes contained in the proposals validated by this Bill arise, in the main, from decisions of the Government on recommendations made by the Industries Assistance Commission in their reports entitled 'Certain Monomers, Prepolymers and Goods of the Silicone Type' and 'Wheel chairs'. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Customs Tariff Validation Bill is to validate the collection of customs duties imposed on imports of silicone products and wheelchairs. Both of the industries being thus protected are quite significant but, in fact, very small employing only 110 employees and 55 employees respectively. The Opposition has no objection to that part of the Bill which deals with silicone products but we have very profound concern with that part of it which deals with wheelchairs. We express that concern in the form of an amendment to the motion for the second reading which has been circulated. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of Motion, add ', but the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) expresses its concern that the Customs Duties validated by the Bill in relation to wheelchairs will maintain the high cost of these necessary aids for the disabled;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) calls upon the Government immediately to review its decision in relation to wheelchairs with a view to replacing the tariff arrangements provided in the Bill with a bounty scheme for local producers; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) condemns the Government for its failure to implement its promise for a programme of aids for disabled people including the free provision of wheelchairs'. </PARA>
<PARA>The concern that the Opposition has thus articulated does not, regrettably, appear to be shared by the Government. The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Moore, when this Bill was debated in the other place two nights ago-admittedly it was debated between 1.45 and 2.20 in the morning, so I guess there may conceivably be some other explanation for his terseness-found himself able to do no more than sneer at what he described as the Australian Labor Party's bleeding heart on this issue and to say that he had no sympathy for the contributions made to that debate by the Labor Party spokespersons, the shadow Minister, Mr Hurford, Mrs Child and Mrs Kelly. I hope that contribution will be remembered when the community-and, in particular, those disabled members of it who are extremley interested in measures of this kind-comes to assess the contribution of this Government to the International Year of Disabled Persons. </PARA>
<PARA> The essence of the argument is simply that-and I hope my brevity on the subject will not be taken in any way as a reflection of the degree of importance with which the Opposition regards this matter-prior to 1 January 1980 there was a tariff on the importation of wheelchairs of 15 per cent which was, of course, bad enough for those obliged to purchase this indispensible item of non-luxury equipment. On that date-1 January 1980-following the removal of United Kingdom preferences in this area as, indeed, in others, that duty escalated to 34 per cent in the case of mechanically propelled wheelchairs and 36 per cent in the case of manually propelled wheelchairs. This, in fact, produced a purchase price for, say, electrically propelled wheelchairs of which something like $1,000 was represented by the import duty tax slug which the purchaser had to pay. This represents-without my needing to labour the point-a fantastic imposition for people who in all sorts of other ways have not only physical and psychological constraints upon them but also very large financial constraints. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, after innumerable representations on the matter and consideration by the Industries Assistance Commission which, in fact, reported to the Government some time ago-December 1980-the Government has decided to reduce the duties from that high of 34 per cent and 36 per cent to 30 per cent in the first year, 25 per cent in the second year and 20 per cent thereafter. Of course, that is better than what it had been and that is why we do not oppose this legislation outright. What the Government seems to be quite failing to appreciate is that any duty on equipment of this kind is just too much to pay for these indispensible pieces of equipment. It represents a very unfair additional imposition on those who are already bearing more than their fair share of life's handicaps. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1980 Budget the Government did, in fact-as perhaps the Minister will remind us if he gives us the courtesy of any reply at all on this Bill-make an allocation of $700,000 to a program of aids for the disabled, including assistance with respect to the purchase of wheelchairs. That was to commence from 1 April this year. However, the Opposition understands that that scheme is not yet in operation. Like so much else in the International Year of Disabled Persons it is a matter of cosmetic huffing and puffing rather than any commitment to hard, real assistance. Perhaps even more significantly, even when this scheme is set in operation and even if in a full year something over $2m is spent under this head and the expenditure commitment is maintained in the future, that still will not be enough to cover anything like the total cost of purchases of wheelchairs in this community which rank, I believe, at something over $4m per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is that the Government's commitment to assistance in this area is very shaky, very superficial and totally inadequate. The answer in this area as in so many other areas of industry assistance and protection, which we debate from time to time in this place, is that if the industry in question is incapable of surviving without public assistance in some form or another, the way to provide that assistance is through the mechanism of bounties which will ensure that the consumers in question, who in this case are clearly more deserving than most, will not have to bear selectively the cost of outlays which ought to be shared across the community as a whole. The Opposition's amendment which I have read summarises these various concerns. I hope that it will, in fact, be supported on all sides of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall respond briefly to Senator Evans's remarks. The point needs to be made that this is a matter of industry protection and it is under that head that this is handled. It is being handled by the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. The tariff is the usual form of industry assistance that is provided in these circumstances. Indeed, the companies were those producers of wheelchairs in Australia. I think Senator Evans would acknowledge that it is important to have a local wheelchair industry and not to rely totally on imports, given that there could be a cut-off in supplies and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak on the matter of Aboriginal affairs in the first reading debate on the Supply Bill (No. 1) 1981-82. I am sorry that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) is not here, but I did advise him that I would be speaking. The opportunity for discussion of Aboriginal affairs has not arisen frequently in this session and consequently we have to take the opportunity of speaking on it at the first reading stage of other Bills. I reiterate that, as far as Aborigines are concerned, this Government, from 13 December 1975, has continually gone backwards with the program initiated by the Labor Government. The program is being continuously and considerably reduced in real terms by this Government. The words of the then shadow Minister, now a judge of the Federal Court of Australia, in November and December 1975 must often haunt and mock him. He distributed a program, particularly in the north-west reserves, among the Pitjantjatjara people and in the Walpiri people's area, saying that things would be better, not worse, under a Liberal-Country Party government. Things have continued to get worse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A long time ago a document was exchanged between the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Chaney. It set up a program effectiveness review, now commonly known as the PER report, which is still a classified document. I see no reason why it should not be made public in view of the fact that the Prime Minister asked for it to be on his desk by April 1980 so that the recommendations could be implemented immediately. I think that the report became available about May 1980; a year ago. I am not going to quote all of the recommendations but I am going to refer to specific parts. The PER report identified as a major task:</PARA>
<PARA>Increasing effective Aboriginal involvement in development, implementation, and evaluation of health and health related programs . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Instead, we see these programs being annihilated in some areas and handed over to the States in other areas. But for the very brave action of Professor Hollows in resigning and drawing public attention to what was about to happen to the trachoma campaign, it also would have gone down the drain. The report went on to summarise the points as:</PARA>
<PARA> Clarifying policy and administrative responsibilities; increasing effective Aboriginal utilisation of general health care; especially primary care, services; channelling finance to services which are more acceptable to Aboriginals and more effective in improving Aboriginal health status; tackling the environmental factors adversely affecting Aboriginal health; and establishing continuous oversight of implementation. </PARA>
<PARA>The report of the Program Effectiveness Review went on to state in more detail:</PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal communities and organisations being involved in implementing action upon which the Government might decide;</PARA>
<PARA> Establishing a small national all-Aboriginal body (and, where practicable, related State/Territory bodies) to be involved effectively in programs affecting Aboriginal health. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a whole number of recommendations. As much of the contents of this report have already appeared in the Press, although other sections have not, I hope that the Government will see fit to release the document. Another recommendation reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Greater priority being given to matters closely related to health, such as housing, water supply, sanitation and electricity for which responsibility largely lies with State and local government. </PARA>
<PARA>It is true that the responsibility does lie with State and local government in some of these fields. But the Federal Government has done nothing to ensure that the States supply the services which they ought to be supplying. In fact, in some States, particularly Western Australia and Queensland, money allocated for the affairs of the Aboriginal communities are diverted into other areas. About training and employment the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Greater employment of Aboriginals in all health delivery systems;</PARA>
<PARA> recognised Aboriginal health worker qualifications being developed by the States and integrated in the existing health professional and sub-professional structure. </PARA>
<PARA>There is then a reference to specific health needs. The report recommends:</PARA>
<PARA> Consideration of areas where special measures might be needed or existing programs strengthened such as dental care, ear diseases, nutrition, mental health and alcohol-related problems; continuation of the National Trachoma and Eye Health program;</PARA>
<PARA>It also suggests:</PARA>
<PARA> Development of a national system of Aboriginal health statistics. </PARA>
<PARA>This was the subject of a question which I asked the Minister yesterday or the day before. He is not sure who in fact is to compile those statistics. I hope that he will come up with that information before the end of this session. In relation to the same project, paragraph 1.22 on page 17 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The PER, like the Ruddock Committee and a number of other inquiries, faced major difficulties with data. There is no routine identification of Aboriginals in statistical collections. In the general health field, statistical information is not complete. In the field of Aboriginal health, statistics are often not collected in an integrated way. There is still a refusal or reluctance to include separate identification of Aboriginals in statistics on the part of some authorities involved in the collection of data.</PARA>
<PARA>That reluctance is easily understandable in Queensland and Western Australia and, until quite recently, of course, also in the Northern Territory, it has become embarrassing to include some of these figures under the ethnic groupings. They are much worse than the figures for the average population. Paragraph 1.23 reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Insufficient progress has been made in tackling the administrative tasks involved in routine collections of vital statistics on Aboriginals. This definitely remains so even in the ACT despite 10 years of effort. </PARA>
<PARA>It is an indictment on the Government that it has not been able to get its act together-I think that is now the popular 'in' term-so that this data could be collected. It is at least six or seven years-probably, almost 10 years-since it was spelled out very clearly in political reports presented in this chamber and in another place that this was vital if a properly programmed health scheme was to be put into operation. On page 44 of the report a reference is made to the availability of medical services delivered to Aboriginals. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Access is good for hospitals, moderate and variable for GPs and poor in relation to specialists. Lack of access to GPs increases use of hospital facilities. There are major socio-cultural and financial barriers to access (including lack of information) and significant geographical variations, e.g. between urban, rural, rural town, (fringe) and remote;</PARA>
<PARA> Quality of care, when received and at the levels available, is technically satisfactory, but there can be significant problems in relation to such factors as attitudes, and also socio-cultural differences and lack of income;</PARA>
<PARA> Program organisation is generally centralised and gives little opportunity for Aboriginal input, resulting in the fitting of Aboriginals to the general programs rather than vice versa;</PARA>
<PARA> Impact on health status-given the large volume of health resources available to be utilised by Aboriginals and the technical competence of health personnel, the results achieved are disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA>I think those are very significant words. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal involvement is negligible. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 48 of the report, paragraph 3.15, another significant paragraph, reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The PER believes that transport is a major problem in some areas. The heavy incidence of unemployment among Aboriginals-varying from 37 per cent nationwide-</PARA>
<PARA>That is somewhere around five times the national level of unemployment-</PARA>
<PARA>To nearly 100 per cent in some communities-their low average income and high ratio of dependence to income-recipients (many of whom are welfare beneficiaries) . . . makes it more difficult for them to travel at their own expense to seek medical advice or treatment. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 3.16 reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The PER considers that the disproportionately high Aboriginal hospital utilisation rates 2 to 3 times that of non-Aboriginals, even higher for children, but with a rate of surgery 2 to 3 times lower . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The latter point is remarkable. The report lists the conditions for which patients are admitted. It sets out a series of illnesses. Pneumonia and gastroenteritis are two major causes. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . indicate inadequacies in the provision of primary health care to Aboriginals and the generally poor environmental conditions in which they live. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 3.17 on page 49 reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginals receive little benefit, despite great need, from existing rehabilitation services; also there has been little effort to modify these services so as to render them more effective for Aboriginal clients in their environment; there is a serious lack of provision of mental health services for Aboriginals both in areas where Aboriginal communities are most numerous and within the communities themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 50 of the report-this is the last paragraph that I wish to quote-it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal dental health is extremely poor, and access to private care is difficult and costly. The result is poor dental care, ill health and considerable avoidable suffering. Government schemes cover segments of the school population, means-tested assistance for adults (normally available only in metropolitan areas), and limited provisions through some AMSs and States Grants programs . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal dental health services, with the exception of one State where some 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the people are able to receive treatment through the school dental service, are deplorably weak. I suggest that that report ought to be widely distributed. It ought to be made available to medical organisations, Aboriginal communities and others to give them an opportunity to comment on it and to suggest the strong points which should be implemented. Of course, the Aboriginal people themselves ought to have the first call on that. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the almost tragic situation which is being faced in Queensland where a great wall of silence has again been thrown up about what is likely to happen to Aboriginal communities on the lands they now occupy under the existing Aborigines Act of 1971 and amendments and the Torres Strait Islanders Act 1971 and amendments. There has been a change of Minister because the former Minister, Mr Charles Porter, did not contest his seat in the 1980 State election. He has now been replaced by Mr Tomkins who has the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs tagged on to his other ministerial responsibilities. I was disappointed when my colleague, Senator Ryan, asked a question in this chamber on 27 May 1981 about what the Commonwealth Government proposed to do. To put the matter in its proper context, I will read the question together with the Minister's response. Senator Ryan said:</PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs whether he is aware of reports that the Queensland Government intends in August of this year to abolish the Aboriginal reserves in Queensland, to incorporate reserve lands in local government areas and to rescind the notorious Queensland Aborigines Act and Torres Strait Islanders Act? Does the Minister acknowledge that these steps would leave Queensland Aboriginals without any rights to the land that they have been occupying for generations? What steps has the Federal Government taken to ensure the bringing down of legislation that will provide for secure, permanent tenure to Queensland's Reserves by Aboriginals who are currently living on them? Will the Government take steps to ensure that such legislation is prepared concurrently with the expected action of the Queensland Government?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister gave one of those normal replies that both he and his predecessors have been inclined to give. In other words, all he did was evade the issue. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am not sure that Senator Ryan does Aboriginals in Queensland a service by assuming that certain events will occur. </PARA>
<PARA>If that sort of comment were not made by Senator Ryan and other honourable senators on this side and by people of good will outside the Parliament, the change in policy in Queensland would probably be even more drastic. We have maintained that for a start if these two Acts were to be abolished then at least the reserve lands now occupied in the various communities ought to be given over to the Aboriginal communities and there should be proper land rights legislation so that they may retain them in perpetuity and that under other legislation dealing with land rights they be given time to look at other areas to which they have some traditional attachment or to which traditional attachment can be proved. The Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I have been following, as has she and other honourable senators, the Press comments on what might be happening in relation to Queensland's Aboriginal reserves. She will be aware, as I was, of the statement made by the Premier of Queensland during the last election campaign. She will also be aware of his promise to consult widely. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement is a fabrication. I am not saying that it was the Minister's fabrication because he was told, not by the official spokesman for Aboriginal Affairs in Queensland, but by the Premier of Queensland, that there are wide consultations. With the exception of some people on most councils, most people on nearly all of the councils have very little say on what goes on. The council at Yarrabah is probably one of the most outspoken and decisions which come from that council would not coincide with what the Minister in this place has said. The memberships of other councils are virtually hand picked, by devious means, by the Department of Aboriginal and Islander Advancement which has no authority at all. However, it is still the DAIA officers in many communities who make the decisions and hand them down to black community councils which are virtually only allowed to act as a figurehead. So the promise to consult widely is a non-event. That sort of consultation is not going on, has not gone on and will not go on in relation to any changes in the ownership of land. Senator Peter Baume's answer continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Unlike Senator Ryan, I have been able to make contact with the new Minister for Water Resources and Aboriginal and Island Affairs in Queensland, Mr Tomkins. I have been able, in fact, to visit some communities with him and to discuss some of these problems. I was very heartened by a Press release, dated 15 May, by Mr Tonkims, who after all is the responsible Minister in the Queensland Government, in which he gave assurances that no one would be evicted from his home or from a reserve as a result of any move to repeal the Aborigines Act and Torres Strait Islanders Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister also stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . no matter what happens to the relevant Acts the reserves would retain their status under the Queensland Lands Act . . . I would hope that Senator Ryan would welcome that statement as much as would anybody else. She may indicate by interjection that she welcomes it. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a very feeble attempt on behalf of the Minister to see whether he could intimidate or compromise the spokesman on Aboriginal Affairs on our side of the House. None of us welcome that statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No one welcomes sentiments that are phoney. This is an entirely phoney sentiment. It is a wonder that Senator Baume, with his fairly high degree of intelligence, is not able to pick this up. The Ministers in the Queensland Government, over a long periods, have not been the spokesmen for the department. Instead the spokesman has been the permanent head of the Department, the well-known Mr Paddy Killoran in consultation with the Premier of the day. This situation has applied particularly over the last ten years with the current Premier. In fact, the Aborigines are not given the right to make their decisions. I remember an occasion on Palm Island when a very good council took the right to make a statement. A ballot was held to have the council removed. That ballot was a phoney. The Department obtained the services-its officers were in it up to their elbows-of a tame Aborigine from Cherbourg. He was the Chairman of a committee that compiled a report. When he was asked at a Catholic land council meeting in Toowoomba why he put certain sections into the report he admitted that he had not seen it. That is how involved he was in the affairs of his own people. In response to further question he stated who wrote the report and it was a white man who was unsympathetic to Aborigines. The end result was that the ballot that was taken on Palm Island worked because of the intimidation and bullying that went on. When the lists were analysed, it was found that people who had been dead for two years had signed the petition. So much for the so-called democracy that operates in Aboriginal areas in Queensland! The Minister went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Tomkins has said that no matter what happens to the relevant Acts the reserves would retain their status under the Queensland Lands Act . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What precisely does that mean? I do not think that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs knows what it means. Mr Tomkins does not know what it means. The Aborigines certainly do not know what it means and we do not know what it means. It is a case of those who draft new legislation pulling the wool over people's eyes so that too many questions will not be asked. Probably the Minister will not recall, because it was in the time when Senator Chaney was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, when leases were given at Yarrabah after a near riotous situation developed because of rebellion against what was happening. Aborigines were to be given little plots of land. The leases were to be given under the Queensland Land Act. They were not assured of any permanency. A crop of beans may take three to four months to grow. The lease could be cancelled before that crop matured. A crop of bananas may take 18 months to two years to grow and the lease could have been taken out just before those plants produced bunches of bananas. That sort of hokey pokey is not suitable to the Aborigines of Queensland or to people in any other part of Australia. But unfortunately it appears that the Aborigines in Queensland are the very people who will now have to accept that problem in the very near future. The Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . because it is under that Act that the land is set aside as Aboriginal reserve land. I am sure that we are all delighted by that particular assurance. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister might be delighted with that particular assurance because it enables him to push the problem under the rug where nobody can see it. The Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Tomkins also stated in his Press release that moves to repeal the Acts were being carried out in a spirit of full co-operation with the elected representatives of the Aboriginal people. I am sure that all honourable senators would want to know that the Queensland Government is acting in co-operation with the Aboriginal people and taking into account their views. Mr Tomkins said that Aboriginal views would be taken into full account when decisions were made about the relevant legislation. I have with me a copy of the Press statement . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He then presented it as though it was the first prize he had ever got at school. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ryan asked further questions on this matter. I will quote part of one:</PARA>
<PARA> My question is: What assurances do we have from the Federal Government that steps will be taken to ensure that Aboriginals living on reserves will have secure title to that land?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Peter Baume replied:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government would want all Aboriginals in Queensland to enjoy secure tenure of the land on which they live. We would be concerned that they should not lose that secure tenure. Apart from that, the question is hypothetical and I do not propose to deal with it further. </PARA>
<PARA>He then moved his foot around and pushed that matter under the carpet too. </PARA>
<PARA> In this city at the moment-there has been for the last two days-is a delegation of Aborigines, all of whom come from Queensland. I was impressed by what was said by one of the delegates, Rachael Wilson, from Palm Island, who, together with some of her people met a number of us yesterday. She said that her people were not interested in the sorts of land rights they are likely to get under the Queensland Government. What they want is for this Government to act in accordance with the recommendations of the report submitted by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. That report stated in quite clear terms that there appears to be quite strong proof that the 1967 referendum and the subsequent legislation do in fact give to the national government the right to implement land rights in any State or Territory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Evans for his comment. Since the publication of that report, I have talked with many legal people and they agree with the Committee's findings. But, again, this Government is not game to front up to any likely political clash that it will have. I now warn Senator Peter Baume, as the responsible Minister, that he is bringing down a very great battle on his head by not being more positive and doing something that can be seen to be done and which can be done with some sort of permanency. This Government is going to be fooled by the Queensland Government saying it will hand over leases in six months, 12 months or two years, or whatever shocking agreement this Government has entered into. This is in spite of the fact that we on this side of the chamber warned the Government what would happen in relation to Mornington Island and Aurukun. The Government should not tell us that they are satisfactory agreements because they are not. They are merely a stop gap measure and they will not have permanent value so far as the Aboriginal people are concerned. There is a general ground swell throughout the Aboriginal and island communities. In particular, I nominate Yarrabah which is well organised. The Aboriginals there are not going to sit and cop it for much longer. They have had a stomach full of everything that goes on so far as the Queensland Government is concerned and they are rapidly getting to the stage where they do not think the Minister has enough political intestinal fortitude to stand up and do battle for them. So, if the Minister is not careful, he also will be run over in the political rebellion that takes place. Palm Island is another piece of tinder which needs only a match to light it. At the moment it is unfortunate that the Queensland Government has supplied the box of matches and it looks as though this Government will strike the match. At Kowenyama another land rights movement is gaining credibility and it will spread through Cape York. It is all very well for the Government to say: 'We have them wrapped up in fences. They are not going to hurt us. Nothing will go wrong'. We will do exactly as Mr Bjelke-Petersen tells us to do-we will accept some sort of funny leases. But all this will do is increase the psychological disturbance of 60,000-plus Aborigines and islanders in Queensland. The Government is not going to overcome the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Courier-Mail of early this week reported a statement by Dr 'Nugget' Coombs. He was one of the original trinity installed in office after the 1967 referendum to set up a ground plan and lay down guidelines as to how that legislation could best by implemented at the national government level. The newspaper article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government should compulsorily acquire the Queensland Government's aboriginal reserves if there were state moves to abolish them, Dr H. C. Coombs said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Coombs, Aboriginal Treaty Committee chairman, said this in an open letter to the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser. The letter was published in a weekend newspaper. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Coombs said the committee was deeply concerned at Queensland Government's plans to abolishing existing reserves and incorporate them into local government areas. </PARA>
<PARA> He said the Queensland Government also hoped, by formally ending the discriminatory Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders Act, to remove the justification for a boycott of the 1982 Brisbane Commonwealth Games. </PARA>
<PARA> 'The abolition of the reserves would end all prospect of aboriginal rights to land being recognised in Queensland and deprive the communities of the last vestiges of self management', he said. </PARA>
<PARA> 'The Commonwealth Government clearly has the constitutional power to act.'</PARA>
<PARA>Of course if this is done for political window dressing it will only be the thin edge of the wedge so far as the State Government of Queensland is concerned. It will want to do so in the hope that the Commonwealth Games to be held in Brisbane will not be boycotted. Of course we have that great international group of leaders to whom the Prime Minister is now sending out his gold embossed invitations who also might boycott the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. One does not know. A couple of people are bending over backwards to try to get on side with the African nations, but they are doing nothing at all for our indigenous people who are in a worse situation now than when this Government took over five years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us hear the remarks of the Queensland Premier. They are very succinct. The newspaper article states:</PARA>
<PARA> But the Premier, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, said last night from Kingaroy, 'The present state legislation specifically covering the development and protection of our indigenous people will be removed.'</PARA>
<PARA> He said aboriginal and island policy was directed at placing the people in the mainstream of society 'where they can exercise the same rights and responsibilities as all other people.'</PARA>
<PARA> 'He said aboriginal and islander policy wanted to become part of the whole Queensland community, and not to be cut off from it, or forced to develop 'apart from their neighbours.'</PARA>
<PARA> Meantime, a group of Queensland aboriginals is planning a trip to Africa to gather support for an African boycott of the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a fear in the heart of the Premier and in the hearts of some of the more stubborn Ministers in his Cabinet that the Games will be boycotted. It will be a great tragedy if they are. But if the Aborigines of Queensland have to suffer as the result of any white-washing legislation brought down to prevent them from owning their own land or to turn them out of their own communities, I for one, as a parliamentarian, will assist the Aborigines with that boycott. This is the only sort of language that those very conservative governments in Queensland, in the Northern Territory and in Western Australia know. Unless there are public demonstrations and well organised publicity campaigns and unless political fear is instilled into the hearts of the conservative people in the three areas I have mentioned, black people will never get any justice at all. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of those politicians-none of them is a parliamentarian, but just the ordinary, cheap, garden variety type politician with a lot of native cunning-who are prepared to hope for and, if necessary, to help the so-called black problems to go away. But it is not a black problem; it is a white problem in each of those three administrations. I am now calling on the Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, his colleagues in Cabinet and the Prime Minister to take positive action so far as Queensland-is concerned in particular at this moment because it will be the area that will suffer most in the political turnabout by the Premier to curry favour with some people. </PARA>
<PARA> None of us wants to see the Acts retained, but we do want to see in all instances these people remaining in control of the land which they have occupied, in many cases for generations and, in the case of some of those to whom their land is a traditional area, particularly those in the Cape York and Gulf country, for tens of thousands of years. Those people are entitled to that land. Only about 7 million acres are involved. A deal made with good will between this Government and the State Government could hand over those properties in perpetuity. Land rights legislation that would give everyone a fair go could be developed after that. Even if it were planned on the basis of the rather bobtailed land rights legislation of the Northern Territory, it would be better than the implementation of the so-called local government Act or a worse kind of lease. I warn the Minister that if this is not done he will buy himself a big fight with all people of good will in the community but, worst of all for himself, he will buy a fight with the Aboriginal races and the Torres Strait Island people of this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall take a short time to draw attention to the insecurity faced by many people in our country at this time. Today I talked with people from the Main Roads Department in Tasmania who, for many months, have been facing the anxiety and insecurity of losing their jobs. Among them were young men and apprentices who have just started their career. There were younger men who have families and who are buying homes. There were other people who are educating their children. There were older people. They all know that when they lose their jobs very shortly there will not be any jobs for them. As a woman, I can understand the concern of the wives in those families. I understand the insecurity that it will bring to those families and, perhaps, the destruction of those family units, the importance of which is consistently mouthed by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Not very long ago we celebrated Anzac Day and remembered those who died to protect democracy in this country, to protect the rights and freedoms of our people. I remind honourable senators that the majority of the people who fought in those wars were working men. They were trade unionists. They fought-many died-to ensure that the standard of living which they had achieved by struggle and strike was preserved. Those people who are today attacking the trade union movement should remember that one of the freedoms they fought for was the right to strike. That right won for the people of this country the standard of living which the Government is reducing for more and more Australians every day. No government gave that standard of living but this Government, by its economic mismanagement and by abdicating its responsibilities, is reducing it. It is a government which supports foreign corporations in the economy at the expense of the underprivileged and the working people of this country. Economic growth is pushed at the expense of people. That growth is also bringing about an increase in poverty, unemployment, anxiety, injustice and the insecurity that threatens the stability of our families. Working people are being thrown on the scrap heap for the sake of the so-called economy. The Government already admits that there are three million disadvantaged people in our country. At present there is great inequality of wealth, and a strike must be seen as a non-violent protest against the injustice in the division of that wealth. Life without poverty should be possible in Australia if right use could be made of our rich natural resources and if people had first priority. Peter Norre, a visiting expert on energy and resources, recently addressed a gathering of Australian politicians. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of ownership, royalties, tax and marketing of your energy and minerals, I know of only one country in the world which gets a worse deal; that's Gabon in West Africa! Why do you allow it?</PARA>
<PARA>That is a question which many Australians are asking at present. The first priority of government is to protect the rights of its people. Article 25 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights states:</PARA>
<PARA> Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to ensure those rights for every person in this country. If one denies people their rights one also takes away one's expectation of their responsibility. This was demonstrated in King's Hall the other day. The rights of those women and the people they represent to proper services, housing and other facilities have been denied them; yet the government is so foolish as to expect responsibility from them. In agreeing to that declaration the Australian Government assumed the responsibility for providing health care equally for all Australians. After five alterations to the original Medibank scheme, public health in Australia is seriously at risk. One section of our society is to be labelled disabled or disadvantaged, and the pittance for it entitles it to free health care. The members of another section have to choose whether they have the food and necessities of life or health insurance, and they risk insecurity and debt. Those on higher incomes can take out insurance and choose either private or public health care. The Government should be promoting the health of the people by increasing preventive and community health services. Not to do so is to incur a huge cost of serious social problems as well as the insecurity and the human suffering which is involved. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of housing, again we find the Government avoiding its responsibility. Adequate housing is essential for the security and the well-being of the family, the aged, the handicapped and the young, yet we have an increasing demand for housing and decreasing funding. The unsatisfied demand in Tasmania is 7,100. Tasmanian funding has decreased from $28.5m in 1975-76 to $11.9m in 1980-81. It is evident that the people in most need of help are of little concern to the Government. The fact that we have homeless people, homeless youth and even homeless children in this country brings shame on our nation. In answer to a question on 28 May regarding the cost of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, the Minister for Finance, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is the Government's intention to see that it is a conference of the standard that would be expected by those who participated in it . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the Government should show the same concern for the standard of living of the people of our own country who are now living far below the standards enunciated in that declaration of human rights. Mr Fraser may believe that life was not meant to be easy, but I do not agree. I believe that life is for living to the full, for happiness, hope and joy for our people. People have a right to live free from fear and insecurity. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not agree with Mr Fraser's assumption that taxpayers begrudge paying taxes and that they are selfish and self-centred. I do not believe that the average Australian people are uncaring of their fellow men or that they begrudge the taxes that are required to provide for the needs and services of their communities and the health services and standard of living of elderly citizens and those who are less fortunate in our society. They object to paying taxes for unnecessary things such as military academies and pomp and privilege and subsidising so-called private enterprise and foreign corporations when wealthy tax avoiders rob the Government of millions of dollars. I think the people have their priorities right but that the Government does not. </PARA>
<PARA> Tax revenue should ensure the services to people necessary to live life of a standard to which the article refers. Only when that priority has been filled should other things be considered. Commissioner Isaac said on 13 May that the source of acceleration of inflation in the last two years has been mainly international and government policy induced price increases. These price increases are felt most by people on low incomes. We must ask why there is poverty in our country and why the quality of life and the standard of living are being lowered. Why is there unemployment, misery and insecurity? Why are profits increasing and wages decreasing? It is time that the Government realised that behind the label of disadvantaged people-Aborigines, pensioners, the unemployed and unionists-there is a human person with human needs and human feelings. I believe there are many such people in this country. I have a feeling that they know why these conditions exist. I think the conditions bring shame to our country. I hope that the Government does something about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been endeavouring over the last three or four weeks to raise the matter I now intend to raise. Having regard to the promise made by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) that we would have ample oportunity to discuss the Review of Commonwealth Functions, on several occasions I have forgone my right to speak. Just because the Senate has a timetable problem it is not my intention to forgo that right, so I will make some comments on the review and on the way in which the Opposition and I perceive the current problems that beset the Federal Government. The last six weeks have been very crucial ones in the history of federal governments. I do not think it is too dramatic to say that the events of the last weeks have momentous signficance for our country. The Government has not only introduced a series of events and incidents that show a degree of instability in government but also it has taken steps to alter the basis of government in a way that has not recurred since Federation. In fact it has rejected and repudiated all the more moderate policies performed by Liberal governments in the post-war years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take as my starting point what I believe to be the relevant sentence in the resignation of Mr Andrew Peacock, the former Minister for Industrial Relations. He said in his resignation speech at the end of April that when he joined the Liberal Party he joined a Liberal party and not a conservative party. That brings to the surface the obvious disagreements, conflicts and differences in philosophy and ideology that exist within the Liberal Party. What have we seen in the years since the Fraser administration came to office? We have seen the development of the most ideological government which has taken the most ideological decisions since Australia made the infamous decision at the Executive level to become involved in the Vietnam war. We have seen a number of issues being dealt with by the Government which reflects that instability, that indecision and that confusion. </PARA>
<PARA> One has to look only at the problems that have occurred, for example, in the area of social security to see the chopping and changing and the difficulties that have existed in this area as the Government tries to maintain a semblance that it is somehow or other intersted in the rights of disadvantaged people and at the same time follow its ideological direction of cutting back on public sector spending. We have seen this very week the difficulties the Government has got into concerning the film industry. We have seen the Government's own appointees challenging its decisions to alter drastically the whole makeup and financing of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. We know what that means to the Australian people. We have seen the fifth attempt to dismember Medibank and the confusion that now exists in the whole area of health administration in this country. We have seen the activities of the so-called razor gang and the reaction that the report has brought throughout our community. We have seen the difficulties connected with the trachoma problems of Aborigines and the resignation and reinstatement of the outstanding people connected with the trachoma program that forced the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to seek special discussions with them in order to get the program back on the rails. The Government has sought to transfer federal responsibility back to the States, many of which we know have racist and inadequate policies and attitudes in respect of Aboriginal health. We have seen the conflicts amongst Government members in this place in connection with the Freedom of Information Act. Perhaps the most infamous thing of all has been what has been taking place in the public interest area and the obvious lobbying that has been conducted by Ansett Transport Industries in respect of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and the matters involved thereto. </PARA>
<PARA> We can only come to the conclusion that we have now reached a stage where we have a corrupt and dishonest government, which is trying to represent itself as being concerned with the interests of the Australian people. The reality is that the corporate sector, as epitomised by such people as the Murdochs, the Abeles and others, has bought the Liberal Party lock, stock and barrel. Consequently we have seen all the machinations in that area. We witnessed the unbelievable behaviour of the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) who, while the Tribunal was sitting, put forward government policy on the matter and then, because of the failure of the Government to get support in its own ranks-the episode was off-key and disgraceful; the Government was rejecting the principles upon which the Parliament had had a certain amount of agreement over many years-had to withdraw the advising to the government's representative before that Tribunal and replace it by additional advisings to Justice Morling. What sort of state of affairs have we reached? We see a constant changing of policy. Decisions are made one day and changed the next. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course we are aware of the difficulties the Government has been in over these last few days in respect of the airlines agreement and the failure of the grouping within the Liberal Party to effect some dramatic change in those areas. The Liberal Party is clearly going through a forced realignment. The consequence is that since the Peacock resignation we have had the razor gang experiences and all that I have referred to. This has all flowed down through the Liberal Party. We have seen the dismissal of two State leaders, one in New South Wales and another in Victoria. It all flows from the struggle for ideas, the struggle for philosophy, in the Liberal Party itself. Yet this is a government that talks about the need to create a stable environment, to have a state of economic management which will encourage business to invest. We have a ludicrous position in which the manager of the Australian Mutual Provident Society can make a decision which brings about the dismissal of the Victorian Premier, Mr Hamer. He stated publicly that, because of the way in which the Government operates in that State, AMP, which is one of the big corporations which dictates private investment in this country, had decided for its own private and selfish reasons not to invest in Victoria. The upshot was quite disastrous for the Liberal Party Government of that State. Consequently, the power struggle within the Liberal Party is leading this country to ruin. It will have disastrous consequences for any attempt to obtain stability in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem is presented by the disastrous course that is being pursued by the Fraser-Anthony Administration. It is the course of Thatcherism-of plain, unadulterated monetarism -in the United Kingdom. Similar policies are being followed in the United States. We are aware that in the United Kingdom, because of the nature of its economy, those policies are having a tremendously adverse effect upon the living standards of the people. We know of the misery and suffering that have resulted from the actions of a lady who says in a contemptuous way 'I'm not for turning' when addressing the problems of the millions of unemployed and ignoring the advice of even the captains of industry in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that Rupert Murdoch, a man who is in a position to dictate to this Government, has tremendous influence in the media in the United Kingdom, and, indeed, in the United States. He decided that President Carter was not the sort of person who ought to be leading that big country and set about bringing ruin to his electoral chances, with the result that his administration was replaced by the Reagan Administration. These ideological struggles in the Liberal Party clearly will have a definite reaction on the Australian economic community as well as the community generally. Therefore, it is small wonder that a recent editorial in Retail World which reflects the opinions of the small business sector should state:</PARA>
<PARA> In one memorable week, we saw in Canberra a debate on whether TAA should be sold to private enterprise; we got the Medibank changes; we saw Andrew Peacock's remarkable (and some would say completely justified) attack on Malcolm Fraser's style of government-then we got the report of the 'Razor Gang'. </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial goes on to speak of the effects of the razor gang's decisions upon the organisation of government in this country, adding:</PARA>
<PARA> First, there's a disturbing air of 'She'll be right, mate' about the Razor Gang's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> It's all very well to slash and change-but you need to be reasonably positive about the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> And that's something the Razor Gang rather disturbingly were not. </PARA>
<PARA> Who is going to fill the huge number of functions the Federal Government is vacating?</PARA>
<PARA> What happens to them if private enterprise doesn't want to step in. After all, many of them are loss-making, anyway. </PARA>
<PARA>It is right that many of the services were lossmaking. As we have seen, as a result of the airline agreement, the Government will allow Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia to withdraw from the non-profitmaking section of airline traffic. The editorial continues:</PARA>
<PARA> How does the government plan to ensure that the chances to fill those vacancies will be spread around?</PARA>
<PARA> You won't find the answers in Mr Fraser's statement on the cuts . . . </PARA>
<PARA> There is a disturbing sense of isolationism in the Razor Gang's recommendations-a suggestion that they were put together without due and careful regard for the consequences . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fraser may have opened the way for his concept of federalism. </PARA>
<PARA> He may also have opened up a Pandora's box of problems for the state governments. </PARA>
<PARA> And he may well have put us on the road to being not one great country, but five quasi-countries, with the small and poor losing out, and the big, rich and powerful getting bigger, richer and more powerful. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly the postion in which we now find ourselves. We find the powerful organisations and corporations, such as the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Australian Industries Development Association, making suggestions which this Government is prepared to pick up, seeking to establish for themselves higher profit aggregates for the purpose of capital investment, and putting themselves in a position in which they are able to influence this Government and affect the rights not only of people but also of State and local governments. In an article which dealt with the question of conflict between private and public sectors, the Age stated:</PARA>
<PARA> For all the Commonwealth's criticism of public sector borrowing by the States, the borrowing is relatively small by comparison to the cause of the problem-the Commonwealth's refinancing requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>It is pointed out that Mr Howard said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is the total size of the public sector borrowing requirement which is of paramount importance. Whether it is a semi-government authority or the Commonwealth Government financing its activities it constitutes the same competition for funds with a growing private sector, and results in the same pressure of interest rates. He said that present interest rate levels were a direct result of keen competition for funds between an expanding private sector and the public sector's call for funds. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, is it any wonder that the Chancellor of West Germany has criticised the United States of America for having interest rates, with their effect on market forces, of 20 per cent. In today's Press he is quoted as having suggested that that may well bring about a world-wide recession and create tremendous problems of unemployment and capital restriction in Europe and other parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> One can say that, as a result of the direct actions of this Government, over the last five years the provision of public services has declined dramatically. Why is this so? The answer is rather simple. It has resulted from the approval of the investment allowance for business, of double depreciation for mining companies, of trading stock valuation methods which assist the big retailers and of increased retention allowances. All of these measures have resulted in a transfer of funds away from the poor and to the rich to the tune of $4 billion. There has been a re-allocation of funds from ordinary people to big business-all in the forlorn hope and belief that big business will invest the proceeds of such capital appreciation and aggregation, and that that will bring about some revival in the domestic economy. But what has happened? Has unemployment fallen as a result of the decisions taken over the last five years? Has the rate of inflation fallen? Have ordinary people prospered under this so-called new direction policy? Of course not. What has happened is that we are now witnessing, as a result of the decisions taken by this Government, a series of policies to alter the whole structure of the Australian political economy and the Australian system of government. </PARA>
<PARA> Even though it could be argued that some of the cuts suggested by the razor gang may have only minor financial consequences, they are proceeding in the direction of altering drastically the structure and processes which have been with us for a considerable number of years. Nevertheless, the Government is being urged on by businesses which want a quick kill, which want to be able to impose their views successfully. Indeed, everything that has happened reveals that they are achieving precisely that. Where is the guiding vision upon which this Government, when it placed its platform before the Australian people in 1975, 1977 and 1980, claimed it would rely? Where is the careful guidance of this country's future? What are we left with? As a result of decisions taken by the Government following pressure from the big business sector, we are left in its place with a concept of small government, with no interest in small business. Rather, we have small government and big business. One only has to look at the legislation that has been rammed through this Parliament in the last few days to see where that will lead us finally. It will lead us to the privation of profits and the socialisation of losses. It will lead to the poor suffering even more than they have in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> These matters will not be put into the category of responsible or efficient decisions. They are not what the Australian people want. They are not acceptable to the Opposition and I am sure that they are not acceptable to the Australian people. They represent a plain abdication of national responsibility in a whole range of areas. To that extent we take up the challenge thrown to us by the Fraser-Anthony Government. We will be campaigning during the next few months to acquaint the Australian people of the sorts of policies being developed by this Government to show the links that the big business sector has with this Government and to show where those policies will lead this country in the long run. They will lead it along the same disastrous way that Mrs Thatcher has led the British Conservative Party. To that extent we have no doubt at all that the policies will be rejected by the Australian people at the most appropriate time. We have no doubt at all that the policies pursued by this Government will be seen by the overwhelming majority of people to be against their interests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again I find myself having to raise a domestic issue which has occurred within the walls of this Parliament. It was brought about by the unscheduled very late sitting of the Parliament last night and it highlights again the lack of liaison between Government Ministers and the people who have to service the Parliament. As we all know, we had to sit here until 3 o'clock this morning. Members of Parliament, particularly Ministers, have facilities in their offices to make a cup of tea or some refreshments. They can do that until the time we leave the Parliament. But when the drivers and attendants who had to stay here until that ungodly hour-some of the drivers and Hansard staff would not have got to bed, I suppose, until daylight this morning-went to get a cup of tea at 1 o'clock this morning, they found that the canteen was closed. That is not good enough. If the Government is going to sit the Parliament past the normal adjournment time, arrangements should be made with the catering people who service this Parliament to ensure that facilities are available at all times for the people who have to stay back away from their homes at that ungodly hour of the morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are facilities for members of Parliament. I understand that there is a regulation that the bar and the catering facilities in the dining room have to remain available until 30 minutes after the last House rises. But apparently that is not the case for the facilities and services provided for the staff of this Parliament. There were quite a few very unhappy people here last night, quite apart from we members of Parliament, as I mentioned earlier today. I make a plea to the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) who is at the table, to consult with her leader so that some arrangements can be made when a decision is made in future to keep the Parliament sitting beyond the normal adjournment time. We know the adjournment time from looking at the business sheet. Last night it was to be 11 o'clock. </PARA>

<PARA> During Question Time on 9 April 1981 you asked a question without notice in relation to resource development projects in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In my response to your question I undertook to ascertain from the Bureau of Mineral Resources its present assessment of the Roxby Downs project. The Bureau has provided the following details of the project:</PARA>
<PARA> The Olympic Dam copper deposit on Roxby Downs, South Australia, is large by world standards although it is not high grade. The mineralisation has been shown to extend over an area 6 km long and 3 km wide but its true limits have not yet been defined. The two companies exploring the deposit have begun a program costing $50 million to continue exploration, metallurgical testing, and other work necessary to complete a feasibility study within two to three years. Eleven diamond drilling rigs are being employed in this project and over the past 15 months 75 holes have been drilled, most of which have intersected mineralisation. Apart from the copper, there is a substantial uranium content and low gold and rare earth values. A minimum figure of 500 million tonnes of copper, uranium, gold and rare earth ore was estimated for the deposit by Dr D. W. Haynes, Copper Consultant, Western Mining Corporation in October 1979. </PARA>
<PARA>Based on published information, the bureau believes that the deposit has the potential of being a major orebody by world standards. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity presented by the first reading of the Supply Bill (No.1) to speak on a matter of concern to me and to many Australians, that is, the conference on the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace which is-perhaps I should say, 'was'-to be held later this year. Since the decision to stage B52 bombers through Darwin and the decision of the Government to grant similar facilities in Western Australia, there has been increasing concern about the growing threat to peace throughout the world. People are stirring, individually and in numbers, to counter in some way that growing trend and to endeavour to have people talk in terms of peace rather than in terms of war. In that context it becomes even more important that we should look at any conference held anywhere in the world that concerns itself with peace. In particular, I think it important for Australia to be concerned with the conference on the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the initiative of the Sri Lankan Government, the United Nations General Assembly designated the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace in 1971. That was 10 years ago. In those 10 years we have seen the Indian Ocean become not increasingly a zone of peace but actually a zone of preparation for war and confrontation. It is regrettable that that should have occurred. Of course, the concept of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace, if it succeeded, would isolate a substantial area close to our shores from the increasing dominance of the military powers. It seems that that is not the case now. Despite subsequent United Nations endorsements of the zone of peace concept, we seem to be no nearer peace in that region. The latest obstacle to achieving a peaceful Indian Ocean has been the move to postpone a conference which was to be held in Colombo later this year. It is around that postponement that I make these remarks. For that reason I think the Government must take account of what I have to say now and what others will say concerning the attitude of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In January this year, the United Nations General Assembly instructed its Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean to 'convene a conference on the Indian Ocean during 1981 at Colombo, taking into consideration the exchange of views thereon'. The Ad Hoc Committee, which is made up of 45 nations, met once in March of this year. It intends to meet again this month. At the March meeting it became obvious that there was opposition to this year's conference and that, I repeat, should be a matter of concern. The chairperson of the Ad Hoc Committee is reported in the Far Eastern Economic Review as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> The failure of the Committee to take a decision on the dates for the proposed Colombo conference frustrated the desire shared by virtually all the littoral and hinterland states which had worked so hard for nearly 10 years in the pursuit of their goal . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The ''vast majority'' of the delegations favoured convening the Colombo conference next August but that a powerful minority consisting of western countries and Japan were reluctant to commit themselves to a date. </PARA>
<PARA>So begins the opposition to and the delay of a very important matter. The United States of America, since the election of President Reagan, has taken a hard line on the conference. To support this I refer to the same article. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Washington's delegate Philip Wilcox administered what many consider to be the coup de grace to the 1981 conference when he accused the Soviets, through their occupation of Afghanistan, of shattering the basis for trust necessary for a meaningful zone of peace agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Until Moscow restores good faith by withdrawing its troops, . . . Wilcox suggested, an Indian Ocean conference would be pointless. </PARA>
<PARA>He said other things but basically that is what he said. I would have thought that the contrary would be the case; that the Afghanistan intervention and the pressure for escalation of armaments in that area and in the Indian Ocean would have given an increased priority to the conference. It seems to me that the United States, by its attitude, is determined to take the view that while the Afghanistan intervention proceeds there should be no conference on the Indian Ocean. The Australian delegation to the Committee has taken a somewhat similar line, as can be seen from its submission to the Ad Hoc Committee of November last year. I say that now because the Australian delegation's attitude, which reflects the government position, is taking an opposite view to that which it took originally. More's the pity. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . alarming events have occurred which directly affect the probability of convening a successful conference in 1981. I refer primarily to the invasion of Afghanistan, a hinterland state of the region. This disturbing development has affected not only our desire to create a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean but also the stability and security of the world as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>Whilst I might agree with that sentiment, I cannot agree with the conclusion. The conclusion, of course, ought to be that the conference should be held and reinforced. It should be noted that this view was not shared by the United Nations. In January of this year the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution calling for a peace conference-I think I have already referred to this-and instructed its Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean to convene a conference. The view of the United States and now of Australia is not shared by the United Nations. The fallacy of using the invasion of Afghanistan as a reason for stopping the conference was best summarised by the chairperson of the Ad Hoc Committee when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Postponing action is like waiting until the flames die down before calling the fire brigade to a burning house. </PARA>
<PARA>That quotation comes from the Far Eastern Economic Review of March 1981. The situation as it now stands is that the Committee will meet again this month to decide the future of the conference. As I have stated, the conference is not just a simple diplomatic luxury. It is a political necessity. It is more than that. It is a very human necessity in order to spread the growth of militancy and to increase the influence of peace. The last 10 years have seen the growth in the military hardware in the Indian Ocean and that has increased the potential for war throughout the world. The extent of this development towards war is in part summarised in an article appearing in the New York Times of 19 April. As there is some shortage of time, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard that article from the New York Times of 19 April headed 'Supremacy at Sea: The Race in the Indian Ocean'. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the most ambitious naval deployment since the Vietnam War, the United States has become a major naval power in the Indian Ocean, challenging the advances of Soviet sea and ground forces in Africa and Asia. The buildup has continued steadily and dramatically over the last 16 months, countering the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and earlier Soviet involvement in Angola and Ethiopia. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Navy in Washington, the United States had 32 combat and support vessels in the area recently. In the 1970s, when the Persian Gulf Squadron was the only permanent American presence in the area, there were only three destroyers. Now France, a North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ally, had 12 ships in the Indian Ocean. </PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet Union recently had 21 ships there, most of them noncombatants and not comparable to the two aircraft carrier groups the United States stations permanently in the area. While the Soviet Union has reduced its presence slightly in the last few months, United States power is dramatically in evidence throughout the area . . . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although incorporating the article instead of reading it does break the thread of the argument I think it is far better for me to have the whole of it included in the record before the suspension of the sitting at 6 p.m. than to go beyond that time as I believe other important legislation has to be dealt with. The American buildup in the Indian Ocean has continued with greater fervour now that Reagan has become President. An article appearing in the Australian Financial Review entitled 'Reagan's 5-year Plan to Militarise the Indian Ocean' states that the Reagan Administration will extend even further the increases that were outlined by former President Carter. For example, in 1982 Reagan is expected to spend $472.6m, an increase of $100m on that intended to be spent by Carter. Honourable senators can see that the position is now the reverse and that the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace appears to be now something of the past because of the tremendous expenditure to be undertaken by the United States. This expenditure increase, together with agreements made with some governments, will allow the United States to have periodic access to a string of bases through which it can protect its economic interests in the Middle East as well as the Indian Ocean region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia, despite statements to the contrary, is assisting in making the Indian Ocean a zone of war and not one of peace. Yet the original intention of the Government was to support that aim. I have mentioned that the Australian support has been reinforced by allowing the staging of the B52s through Darwin. The agreements on American bases in Australia and, in particular, the use of Australian ports for recreational leave for American forces which have been deployed in the Indian Ocean indicate that the Australian Government is helping to prepare the Indian Ocean region for war and not for peace. It has been said that the conference, if held, will not be productive. It has been said that the Soviet Union would in some way, through its friends who would participate in the conference, frustrate the conference. It is interesting to see that the Soviet Union's attitude has been somewhat restrained. In fact the Soviet Union has agreed that at the conference it would not in any way frustrate the discussion of that country's intervention in Afghanistan. I would have though that that was a reasonable approach and an invitation that should be accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that we must recommence the discussions at all levels, whether they be on the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks agreement, the agreement in discussions on detente, discussions on the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace or discussions on the Pacific region as a zone of peace. All those discussions should be recommenced if they have ceased. If they are about to take place then they should take place. The conference on the Indian Ocean to be held at Colombo, Sri Lanka, should be held. The activities of, and agreements made by, the Australian Government are not only my concern in the changing relationships of the Indian Ocean region. Many observers feel that the United States of America, to secure greater military advantage in the region, will take up the tentative offer which the South African Govenrment has made for military links which, if established, will further entrench that racist Government. A further danger that we face is the increased interest of the United States in that area and its determination to escalate its military presence. If that presence is not in some way stamped out, it will lead to an escalation of the Soviet presence in the Indian Ocean. We have that familiar situation of: 'I escalate because you escalate'. So we get a situation which is familiar, and we now find ourselves with sufficient nuclear weapons to destroy the world. We could not just destroy the world 31 times over, as was once said, but some 50 times over. It is a ridiculous, highly dangerous and incredible situation. What should be done? What should be done is explained in an answer by Sentor Carrick to a question from Senator Sibraa on 1 April 1980. Senator Carrick stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I am able to confirm that Australia voted in favour of resolution 34/80 at the 1979 session of the United Nations General Assembly concerning the declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. I am also able to confirm that the resolution did draw attention to the dangers of competitive escalation between the great powers in the Indian Ocean. While the resolution did not specifically call upon the great powers to refrain from any further escalation and expansion of their military presence, it did call upon the Soviet Union and the United States to 'refrain from any activity prejudicial to the implementation of resolution 2032 . . . which was the original 1971 resolution on the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the Government's petition. That is exactly the petition I am putting. It could not have been placed more clearly, more sensibly, more reasonably and more responsibly. Unfortunately, matters have changed, I believe because of an overreaction to the invasion of Afghanistan and because of increased pressure put by the United States upon its allies. In the light of this situation, combined with the buildup of American activity in the region, it is more important now that the proposed conference should go ahead and to re-state the position of the Government, given in answer to Senator Sibraa. We also ought to re-state the word of the chairperson of the ad hoc committee, who said:</PARA>
<PARA> Postponing action until peace and stability returns to the area is like waiting until the flames die down before you call the fire brigade. </PARA>
<PARA>I have quoted that before and I quote it again. It is important that the Australian Government should support a conference on the Indian Ocean and endeavour to hold it this year. It should not encourage some of our friends in the area to postpone it. Nothing is lost by an exchange of views. Nothing is lost by discussing peace. Nothing is lost by discussing peace even while we are engaged in armament. At least we are discussing an alternative. It seems to me that the American attitude under Reagan is: 'We proceed to war. It is only a matter of time. Let us have the edge. Let us have the means to destroy. If we do not have the means to destroy then let us have the means to retaliate and make certain the other person does not win.' That is an extremely horrific position to be taking. </PARA>
<PARA> My view is that this conference on a peaceful Indian Ocean should take place. There are very few places in the world today where one of us can go to talk in terms of peace. I would have thought that this conference would give us such an opportunity. It is important that the Australian Government supports the conference on the Indian Ocean as a peace zone. The threat to peace in the region has never been greater. To wait for the right political climate to occur, whatever that means-that is the view of the United States and others-is to delay activity which could decrease the threat of war. To delay also means that given Australia's agreement with the United States, the Australian people are exposed to what I believe are needless military dangers. Finally, to delay means that we no doubt will cause undue strained relationships with those nations in the region which support the conference and the concept of a peaceful zone in the Indian Ocean. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In joining the debate on Supply Bill (No. 1) 1981, I take this opportunity to say a few things about the media. I mean the media in the general sense, not only the media in Australia but also in Western democracies. I intend to cover Press, radio and television areas. I strongly emphasise that this is not intended to be an exercise of 'bash the media' but rather a plea to the media for a better, more responsible and, if at all possible, restrained presentation of the news and reports of events in Australia and the world. In the column 'On the Other Hand', recently written by Mr Guy Harriott, a prominent journalist, who unfortunately passed away only a few days ago, under the heading 'Press made the scapegoat for bungling politicians', he wrote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Without an independent and vigorous press, abuses, follies and tyrannies of government are not exposed to the public, are not effectively criticised and are not corrected. </PARA>
<PARA>I have no objection to that statement. I fully agree also with the last paragraph, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> May I suggest to my readers that, next time they complain about the inadequacies of the press, they pause to consider a situation in which the only printed record of government activities was a government gazette. </PARA>
<PARA>There is nothing that I would like to emphasise more than that statement. I fully agree with him. I believe in a free Press, but as I said at the beginning of my speech, I believe in a responsible Press and responsible radio and television reporting. In that article he also wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> The manner in which it performs this function can be the subject of legitimate criticism; . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the Press. That is what I wish to speak about tonight. I shall give an example of reporting which is completely untrue and which has no connection whatever with what I said recently in a Senate debate. The only truth in the short report to which I refer is that it stated that I spoke. All the rest is a complete falsification. On 13 May 1981, as recorded on page 196 of Hansard, in a debate on the Census and Statistics Amendment Bill, I said:</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to raise two points only. Firstly, I would like from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) information as to the way in which 'knowingly' filling in a census form is to be interpreted. I can imagine that some of those who have come to this country as I have, will have difficulty in understanding properly the forms or the questions. Some of them, I am sure, will put down a wrong answer, although not knowingly or intentionally. I wonder what the attitude of the court will be to someone who has done that because he has not understood a question. Some of the questions that I have seen in the census forms are not worded in a way that some of us would describe as proper. It is necessary that the Minister explain the situation and give us an assurance that it will not be merely a matter of hoping that the court will decide that a migrant did not understand a question or did not interpret it in the way in which the court or the collector of the forms might interpret it. What is meant by 'knowingly' should be more clearly defined. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what I said and that is what was reported in the Hansard. It will be a strange coincidence if anybody can find any similarity between that speech and a report by Stephen Mills in the Age of 14 May under the heading: 'Three disputes add to Government's troubles'. This is how he understood my contribution to the debate. Under the heading 'Census Bill' it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lajovic (Liberal, New South Wales) asked for an explanation of why the provision was necessary. He recalled that he came from a country with a Communist regime (Yugoslavia) and did not want to see anything similar here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Twenty hours ago, which is not so very long ago, the House of Representatives after a long and difficult debate considered this legislation to which the Senate is now asked to give its assent in the space of a short time, perhaps several hours. This is despite the fact that for the past two years there has been broad discussion by the Government parties, a public inquiry, a great deal of discussion in our Press, comment in the Parliament and a great deal of general concern expressed about the changes which were mooted prior to the last elections. Consequently it seems rather improper and unsatisfactory that the Senate should be put in a position to restrict its capacity properly to debate these Bills which have a profound effect upon the airline industry in our country. After all, the purpose of any airline legislation is to improve our airline services, improve competition and generally serve the public's interests. It must be said that none of those objectives will be reached as a result of these four Bills currently before the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the Opposition has noted the very, very heavy lobbying by Sir Peter Abeles, who was acting on behalf of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd, in the party room, to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcom Fraser) and to other leading members of the Government. It causes us a great deal of concern that such pressure can be brought to bear by a person who has a direct pecuniary interest in the legislation. It has even been suggested in some quarters that his influence was such that the legislation has been designed to meet the interests solely of Ansett Transport Industries. The Bills that we are asked to consider deal with various aspects of the airline industry. Consequently it would be impossible for the Opposition to deal with them adequately in the time that has been allocated for them in the debate. We know that the Government has a temporary majority in this place to do whatever it likes. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator GIETZELT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have always been called an optimist. I hope that common sense will prevail in these matters. Generally speaking, we have been subjected to a practice which shows that it is very difficult to have an impact on the Government once it has set its legislation in action. We are placed in a difficult position. Yesterday's Hansard was not available until a few hours ago. That Hansard enables us to examine properly the debate that took place in the House of Representatives. But it is interesting to note that some eight members of the Government parties felt sufficiently strongly about this legislation to cross the floor. The Government narrowly, by one vote, failed to achieve its objectives. The Bills in this package contain some advances-the Opposition concedes that-on existing arrangements for the provision of airline services in Australia. But the Opposition does not believe that the legislation is satisfactory and that the two-airline agreement should run for more than eight years which is what this legislation surreptitiously attempts to bring about. Nor does the Opposition, as it has said during the brief debate that we had on the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares, believe that the profits of Ansett and Trans-Australia Airlines came under sufficient scrutiny by either that inquiry or the Parliament. Yet those are obviously very relevant factors in respect of what this legislation seeks to do. Therefore, we will move amendments to the Airlines Agreement Bill which are designed to correct these deficiencies. We will also move amendments in the Committee stages to the subsequent Bill-the Independent Air Fares Committee Bill. Of course we will be interested in the circulated amendment that will be moved by a Government senator and also the projected amendment by the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Chipp.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We see the major intent of these Bills as being to ensure the profitability of Ansett Airlines for at least the next eight years. In other words, the legislation is giving a licence to print money indefinitely. Yesterday we witnessed in the House of Representatives debate a major and critical rebellion of the Government parties-the Liberal and National Country Parties-over what they consider the undesirable aspects of the preference and protection being afforded to the Ansett company, which will be the principal beneficiary as a result of this legislation. Therefore, we are entitled again, as we have several times this week, to challenge the ideological position on which the Fraser ministry has attempted unrelentingly to foist upon Australians in every aspect of their lives the sort of legislation which seems to have at least struck some reaction from the Government benches. We have seen the conservative factionalism develop as well as the personal ambition of some of those people who have taken what they consider to be a position of principle. Surely we can now ask the question: Are we watching the death throes of this Government? In recent times we have seen so many of the major differences within the Government concerned about the philosophical position which it occupies. How ironic it is that profound difficulties should occur over this legislation which attempts to entrench further the rights of those very favoured people-multimillionaires-who have been responsible through their control of the nation's media for the Fraser Government's hold on power. Of course they are exacting this legislation which will help them further to improve profitability in the airline industry. Any benefits to the public that may arise from this legislation will be quite incidental to the purposes that I have mentioned. The Australian Labor Party's policy objectives in the airline industry are to ensure maximum access to safe, convenient, competitive airline services at a minimum cost to the user. To add emphasis to that, I will quote from the Sydney Morning Herald editorial on 29 May last. Indeed, one could quote from a number of newspapers which have expressed concern about the ideological position that the Government has taken. The Sydney Morning Herald editorial states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is also obvious that the most important consideration in determining the duration of the proposed new agreement was the profitability of the airlines as they embarked on their investment in new wide-bodied aircraft. The interests of companies that would like to compete with Ansett and TAA and, more important, the interests of the public were at best given secondary consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial also stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Federal Government, acting in its capacity as guardian of the public interest, proved a very poor negotiator with the airlines. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, what the editorial is saying is that the Government succumbed to the pressure, to the lobbying. We could well ask why, particularly in regard to Ansett, because the very inquiry which the Government itself established, comprising three very respectable businessmen, men who are held in high regard in the community-the Holcroft Committee of Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares-has made the point very strongly that there is no justification in the provision of air services for the operators, Ansett and TAA, to earn profits commensurate with trading operations in the general commercial environment. The fact is that the public transport system of which the airline service is a major part is there to provide a service to the community, not just to provide profits to the investing group that now has control of that organisation. It is not there to earn massive rewards for multimillionaires who, after all, are not prepared to take very much of a risk on their investments. Of course, there is no risk in this business because the system operates on a cost-plus basis. Only the profits have not been spelt out in specific terms, which is a point made by the Holcroft inquiry and by the Opposition when these matters were debated recently. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me quickly relate the origins of the two-airline policy. Honourable senators will recall that it was introduced by the Menzies Government in the early 1950s to prop up the failing private enterprise operator, Australian National Airways. It is interesting to read what the then Prime Minister said about the need for competition between the government airline and the private operator. Many of us have said many times in debates on these matters in the past how much we regret the fact that there is no actual competition in the Australian airline industry. That early legislation was amended in 1975 to meet the desires of the successors of ANA, namely Ansett Airlines of Australia. That policy subsequently has entrenched a rigid regulatory control of domestic airline services and has been supported by successive conservative governments. Of course, the hands of the Labor Government were tied in the years from 1972 to 1975 because the agreement had been signed on the eve of the general election in 1972. </PARA>
<PARA> A great contradiction in the behaviour of honourable senators opposite is that despite their constant statements and claims about the efficiency and efficacy of free enterprise and how things can best be done by the private sector, the two-airline policy is, by its very nature, the antithesis of free enterprise. It provides two private multi-millionaire operators with guaranteeed protected access to half the capacity of the major airline services in this country. We do not have to probe very deeply to appreciate the other benefits that accrue to Ansett because of the preferential treatment it is given. The fact that TAA, a public company, operates is a considerable disadvantage to the private operator. Given the basis on which the private operator is protected from any competition, there can be no danger of a competitor pushing it out of its share of the traffic or of endangering its commercial position. As I mentioned, the private operator is protected and this legislation will give added emphasis to that protection by a cost-plus pricing system. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators may recall, the present proprietors of Ansett Airlines seized control of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd in a gigantic stock exchange coup in late 1979. We all recall the pleas which were made at that time by Sir Reginald Ansett to the Government for assistance, for protection regarding what was happening on the stock exchange. But, of course, the Government took no steps at all to protect the interests of an intrepid and enterprising businessman who, whilst he had taken control of ANA some 20-odd years earlier, found himself squeezed out as a result of the activities of two new entrepreneurs, Rupert Murdoch and Peter Abeles. They paid a heavily inflated price for ATI. The new proprietors then had to find some way of increasing the financial yield from Ansett Airlines. They did not have much difficulty because they had a very compliant government. They had a captive, corrupt government then and they have a captive, corrupt government now; a government prepared to do their bidding, prepared to listen to the pleadings and the lobbying of the captains of our airline industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The two-airline agreement was to be renegotiated and changed to assist further the multi-millionaire proprietors of Ansett Airlines. The new agreement makes no reference to a limitation on profits, despite the exclusive right of the parties to provide major domestic airline services. So they can do literally what they like. This legislation is designed to help to achieve that higher financial yield now required by Ansett Transport Industries to fund the inflated prices and to help to pay for the tax-free profits gained by Mr Robert Holmes a'Court from the sale of his shares to the present proprietors. As I have pointed out, because the fare structure is based upon a cost-plus system and because the agreement requires the operation of only two operators over the entire domestic trunk route network, Ansett cannot fail. It is on a sure thing. There is no risk or danger from competitive forces over the entire trunk route network. No risk capital is involved. It is a proposition which cannot lose. That guarantee is, of course, given to them as a result of this legislation. Again, this is a point which was made by the Holcroft inquiry and which was so quickly put aside by this Government because the inquiry dared to challenge the fundamentals upon which the two-airline agreement operated in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> One is entitled, therefore, to repeat what has been said time and time again: The two-airline policy is a licence to print money, as, indeed, is the Government's policy in respect of the television industry. That is a point which has been made time and time again by editorial writers around this country. What did the editorial writer of the Australian Financial Review say on 7 December 1979, at the time when the coup was in progress, when a man identified with the industry was making a plea for assistance from the Fraser Government? He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The major asset of ATI is the entrenched rights and privileges it possesses under the two-airline policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Television licences are public property which may not be freely bought and sold. So is the position of ATI within the two-airline policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Government policy does not have to remain unchanged on either. </PARA>
<PARA>It certainly has not been changed. The present multimillionaires of ATI who bought into that company and who organised that stock exchange coup on their own initiative now want to have it guaranteed by legislation of the national parliament. Let their risks be on their heads; let their risks not be an imposition upon the air travellers of this country is what the Opposition says. They are masquerading as the providers of a better public transport service. They would not have entered into contracts to purchase new aircraft if they did not have knowledge of the new airline agreement which was negotiated, and which was not made available to the Parliament, on the eve of the 1980 election. The travelling public is not being protected and its interests are not being recognised. The travelling public has no obligation to ensure an inflated rate of return on the investment which the proprietors of Ansett have made in their own airline. The incredible subservience of the Government to the Ansett proprietors is shown by the surrender of its sovereign power to determine airline policy. We know how it pushed aside those eminent gentlemen who were associated with the Holcroft inquiry. It is an incredible, unacceptable and disgraceful performance. I know of nothing in parliamentary history which shows a sovereign goverment handing over its power to determine policy to a private organisation which, in this case, is the two multimillionaires. </PARA>
<PARA> The granting in clause 2 of the agreement of a 90 day power of veto to Ansett and TAA over Qantas Airways Ltd flying domestic routes is without precedent in parliamentary history but it also indicates the level of distrust. This is very important because this legislation has come before the Parliament after several months of public dissention, disarray, backroom brawling and attempts to overthrow the leadership of the Government, and correctly so. We hope that the Senate might exercise, as it so often does not, its opportunity to do just that. Out of all of that disarray has come this second version of a two-airline agreement within 12 months. The distrust indicated in clause 2 of the new agreement is the distrust between the Australian National Airlines Commission, Ansett Airlines and the Government. In effect Ansett has said to the Government: 'We do not trust you to legislate in the manner you have indicated in this agreement. We do not trust you to legislate in the terms you indicated in respect of the Independent Air Fares Committee. We do not believe that you can trust your own back benchers'. That seems to be a fair comment, having regard to the attempts made within the Government parties to have some rationality and some control over the airline industry. That is the climate in which this legislation has been brought before the Parliament. It was rushed, there was inadequate time to debate and there was a determination by the Executive to push it through the Parliament, regardless of all the consequences, the views and the public disquiet that obviously exists. </PARA>
<PARA> The removal of freight from the agreement is supported by the Opposition. The introduction of wide-bodied aircraft and specialised cargo aircraft should result in a higher level of efficiency in the industry, together with improved services to air freight users. Accordingly, we do not oppose the Airlines Equipment Amendment Bill. However, it must be understood that the continued restrictive definition of trunk routes will give Ansett and TAA exclusive right to those routes, thus severely limiting opportunities for the development of regional operators such as East-West Airlines Ltd and other future developments as population and market patterns grow-not only grow but possibly change. We are witnessing in Australia a change in our population modes and patterns. East-West has rightly expressed its concern at the dangers which it sees arising from the limitations being placed upon operators in the new agreement. It has circularised members of the Senate and, as a small operator, it has complained bitterly about what the airline agreement does to it. It pointed out that the Government, in pressing forward with this legislation, is pandering to the big at the expense of the small. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the amendment that we will be moving is to limit the life of the agreement to five years, which is the minimum life under the existing agreement. In the view of the Opposition the Government has no mandate to extend the life of the agreement whether it be from one year to six years, three years to eight years, or from five years to 10 years. It has been revealed in recent times that a secret deal was made and concluded between the proprietors of Ansett, Sir Peter Abeles, and the Government, to double the life of the agreement to 10 years. That has become obvious in the public debate that has ensued as a result of some concern expressed by the Government's own back bench. That deal was made prior to 17 March last year, the date on which Ansett, with a great deal of fanfare at the National Press Club conference, announced its decision to purchase its new Boeing fleet. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that there is not a word about the new airline agreement, except the setting out of certain basic philosophical positions of the Government in the Prime Minister's election program. The Government does not have a mandate to take the extraordinary steps that this legislation seeks to do. The doubling of the life of the agreement to 10 years was carefully concealed from the Parliament, the public and from the Government's own parties by Ansett and by Sir Peter Abeles, despite the expensive fanfare associated with the announcement of the purchase of the new Boeing fleet. I refer specifically to the speech of the Minister for Transport, Mr Hunt, in the other place on the last night of the last Parliament. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> We have now reached a stage where discussions on principles with the airlines have been finalised and drafting of the new agreement is nearly adopted. </PARA>
<PARA>He failed to tell the Parliament that months previously an arrangement satisfactory to Ansett had already been concluded. That was on the evening of 18 September last year. Some 16 hours later it was announced that the Minister, Ansett Airlines and the Australian National Airlines Commission had signed a new agreement. But it was carefully concealed that the new agreement provided for a doubling of its life to 10 years, thus taking away from future governments the right to have some say in the way in which the airline industry operates in this country. I also quote from the Minister's Press release of 19 September last year recording that event. Paragraph 3, in reference to the new airlines agreement states:</PARA>
<PARA> The terms of the new agreement are along the lines of the principles outlined in the second reading speech of the Australian National Airlines Act introduced into the House of Representatives on 18 September 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister was careful to make no reference in his speech or in that Press statement to the doubling of the life of the airline agreement or to the veto power being provided to Ansett to prevent the use of Qantas Airways Ltd capacity in the provision of direct domestic services. There was a conspiracy of silence to delude the Parliament, the Australian electorate, the Government's own party and, certainly, the Opposition, because the Government was going out on an election campaign and it did not want the discontent that exists in the Australian community over the lack of competition in our airline industry to become an issue in the 1980 Federal elections. Not one word was uttered except for a report that appeared in the Australian Financial Review of 19 September last. That report, a very small report, referred to a 10 year agreement. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is reported that the Minister refused to confirm the accuracy or otherwise of that 10-year agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>He knew questions were raised about it but he refused to deny or confirm them. He denied that information to Parliament, as did the airline. I assert that Sir Peter Abeles, his colleagues and the Government thus have engaged in a conspiracy of silence to deny essential information to the Parliament and to the Australian community. The reasons for this would be clear to honourable senators. If the Government had proceeded to announce the terms of a new airline agreement along the lines that subsequently came forth, there was every probability that the rebel Liberals, in Western Australia for example, may have taken certain steps in respect of an independent Senate team on a platform of fair internal air fares. After all, Western Australia has shown that it has a degree of independence in these matters and might conceivably have changed the balance of power in the Senate if that had happened. The Government would have been in a worse position than it will be as from 1 July next. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will therefore be operating in the Senate from July under what we believe to be false pretences. It has acted corruptly and reprehensibly. In collusion with Sir Peter Abeles it has pre-empted the decision-making authority of the Senate. What of the term of 10 years? I shall quote from no less a personage than the secretary of the Department of Transport, the Minister's own senior adviser in the Department. A few weeks after this deal was done on 15 April 1980, in an address to the Committee of Economic Development of Australia, that gentleman said:</PARA>
<PARA> In listening to me, you might bear in mind that in a fast changing world a span of 10 years is a long period over which to make predictions. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he was saying that it was difficult in planning the transport scene and in developing transport policy to make any kind of firm prediction based on that time scale. A five-year period, as proposed in the amendment the Opposition will ask honourable senators to consider, will enable reviews of the agreement to be carried out in, say, the third year or the fourth year so that we can establish whether the travelling public benefits from the agreement. The amendment will enable the effectiveness of the new arrangements to be assessed and an assessment made of the market changes. It will enable Parliament and the government of the day to appraise the features of the new generation short haul aircraft which, after all, is relevant because the Government gives guarantees for the purchase of such aircraft. The amendment will enable the Government, the Department of Transport and the Parliament to evaluate changes in the tourist industry, including changes in demand. It will enable the Government and the Parliament to determine any desirable changes to the agreement, with public interest being the prime consideration. The appropriateness of any further extensions of the airline agreement beyond that date or amendment to the agreement could be made in the light of experience, public interest, public concern and other information. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister and Ansett Airlines have chosen by their actions to deny the electorate, the people of Australia and the Parliament. In a general election campaign, a secret deal had been done to restrict the provision of air services in this country for a period of 10 years to the detriment of what the Opposition and the Australian community believes to be the Australian people. Why was the matter kept secret? Perhaps the Minister can inform us. It was kept secret because the Fair Internal Air Fares organisation in Western Australia had proposed to mount a candidate at the Senate election in 1980. This deal, of course, was made in March 1980. On 27 May, having engaged in an exercise to conceal critical information from this Parliament and from the electorate, Sir Peter Abeles had the temerity to make a statement to the Australian Financial Review. The newspaper reported:</PARA>
<PARA> Sir Peter Abeles said that he viewed the five year idea very dimly and that Ansett would not have committed itself to its big re-equipment program if it had known it was not to have a 10 year term. </PARA>
<PARA>The Ansett company knew; the Parliament, including Government back benchers, did not. The Minister for Transport and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) had done a deal on behalf of the Government. Sir Peter Abeles, in an attempt to pre-empt this Parliament and to bludgeon the honest men and women of integrity on the other side of the chamber who know that this proposal is not right from the point of view of the Australian people, had the temerity to claim the company would not have gone ahead with its re-equipment plans if the agreement was not to be for a 10 year term. </PARA>
<PARA> In this proposal Sir Peter Abeles and the Government engaged in that conspiracy to pre-empt the decisions of the Parliament and to conceal from the public what they were about. If the amendment is carried, and we invite support from the men and women of integrity on the other side of the chamber-the people who are prepared to put the public interest first-it is the Opposition's intention to have a review in year three and year four of the five year term in which the Senate would carry out its correct and proper role as a House of review. It would carry out the kind of analysis and assessment that I have indicated. If immediate changes cannot be made to the existing arrangements because of their complexity, these changes could be discussed and debated and means established to determine how new equipment could be brought in, how air fare structures could be changed if necessary and how greater flexibility and better service could be provided to the Australian people. I foreshadow moving the following amendment:</PARA>
<PARA> Page 3, after clause 8, add the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA>Cessation of operation of Act</PARA>
<PARA> '9. (1) This Act, unless sooner repealed, shall cease to be in force at the expiration of 5 years after the date of commencement of this Act. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) For the purposes of section 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, when this Act ceases to be in force by virtue of sub-section (1), it shall thereupon be deemed to have been repealed by an Act other than this Act.'. </PARA>
<PARA>The alterations to the Airlines Agreement Bill have been very cleverly drafted to preclude any possible amendments. It is all or nothing as far as this Government is concerned. It has tried to put its rebels into place. The expert legal advice received by the Australian Labor Party is that the form of the amendment which I have foreshadowed, given the context of the Bill and the manner in which the agreement has been drafted and placed in the Schedule, would be effective if carried. The Opposition asks honourable senators opposite to give consideration to this amendment as indeed the Opposition will be considering the amendments to be moved both by Government members and the Australian Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I regret that Senator Gietzelt lapsed at times into using rather intemperate language. I will leave it to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) to correct those points when he replies at the end of the debate. Australian civil aviation is at an historical point. It is a time of probably the greatest legislative change and probably the most imaginative and most creative move that we have seen in this Parliament. The consequences of these changes simply cannot be foreseen by us tonight. It is a truism, I suppose, that transport is very important to Australia. Australia is a big country with a low density population. While we do not have to move so many people, we have to move some big bulky supplies around. We need the most efficient form of transportation in all fields-surface and air. I sometimes think that interest in aviation as a transport medium is over-emphasised with respect to the great importance of all the surface forms of transport. I am not arguing for less emphasis to be placed on air movements but rather for more emphasis to be placed on road, rail and sea borne trade around Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thank the Minister for allowing the chamber to debate these Bills cognately. This leads to an economic use of time. It is a much more efficient way to deal with the legislation than the course followed in the House of Representatives last night. There are so many interesting and important points in the four Bills before us that one must set priorities for discussion in the short period we have to debate them. The first Airlines Agreement Act was passed in 1952. Since that time progressively tighter controls on the industry have been passed by the Parliament. The first significant tightening in the level of control took place roughly 20 years ago. The time of the death of Ivan Holyman presaged the end of the second Australian National Airways Pty Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> ANA at that time was in trouble as a result of its own bad commercial judgment and not as a result of the regulatory policies of the government at the time. It misinterpreted the trend in equipment and the passenger appeal that would come from it. Having started with DC3s, it progressed to DC4s and for a short time was one of the few airlines to operate the rare DC5. The company then bought DC6As and DC6Bs. To the public at the time that type of aircraft was just another propeller driven aircraft and was indistinguishable from the DC4s. Trans-Australia Airlines, a young company in the early 1950s which was managed much more aggressively than in later years, moved into new equipment with the Convairs and then the turboprop Viscounts. It cornered the passenger market. The combination of poor equipment with poor management led ANA into considerable commercial difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> In the circumstances of the 1950s, there was a great belief that governments could do everything: They could heal the sick, cure poverty, educate everyone and make everyone wealthy. So it really was not surprising that the Government felt it could move in and, by legislative means, develop an effective airline industry. In the last 30 years, we have seen the inappropriateness of governments being in the market place. It has become very clear to all of us who take any interest in the economy that the further a government is removed from a market place the healthier is that market place, the lower is the inflation rate, the more people there are employed and the greater is the increase in standards of living. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can prove it. Most governments have gone so far down the path of socialisation that it is very hard to find an example. But, if one looks at countries such as Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore, one will find examples of freer economies which have been successful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I welcome these Bills because they represent a positive sign of a turning point in the philosophy of this Government, back towards a freer market economy. They mark a significant change in the attitude of the Government towards its place in the market. Although the changes themselves do not take us very far down the path, one can go back to that old Chinese statement that a journey of a thousand miles begins with but a single step. I believe that here we have taken two or three. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement before us replaces that contained in the two-airline legislation. The Airlines Agreement Act, under which the two major airlines are operating, although it has preserved the place of those airlines as majors on the Australian trunk routes, has resulted in both airlines having the same fares, the same equipment, flying the same routes and competing against one another in an eternal race around Australia using parallel timetables. The public is sick of that and, last year, the Government, recognising the fact, encouraged Ansett to buy equipment which was different from that ordered by TAA. Without being unduly critical of the two-airline agreement, all that it has produced in the way of competition has been competition of a very phoney kind-to see who can give away the most food and drink. That move has only added to the costs of travel to the Australian public. The cost of the free drinks, the free sandwiches and all the other gimmicks involved inevitably is passed on to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> In fairness to the airlines, it must be said that even if they had wanted to operate in a different way they simply could not have competed because under the present agreement they have been tied in respect of so many issues that initiative and room to move have been denied them. The consequence has been that both airlines have become, relatively speaking, inefficient. The result of that inefficiency has been the imposition of higher air fares than should be paid by the Australian traveller. I have heard it said in this chamber, and have read in the Press, that really Australian air fares are not high at all. That is an incorrect assumption. The case is put that air fares in the United States are comparable to those in Australia; that when one takes account of the exchange rate, and looks at the whole route structure there is not much in it. It is also said that our fares are significantly lower than are air fares in Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> In Europe, air transport is not a means of mass travel at all. If you want to go anywhere you hop on one of the excellent trains which run between the capitals of Europe and arrive much sooner than you would if you flew. In considering the position in the United States, one must emphasise that an air traveller has access to a far wider range of fares than is provided by the standard fare structure that is available in Australia. I recall a time in January of this year when I wanted to fly from Boston to Los Angeles on my way home. If I had flown at four in the afternoon I could have done so in a 747, using a regular public transport service, for about $US140. I wanted to be in Los Angeles by about four in the afternoon so I flew with a different airline at a cost of somewhere around $US450. Both flights were regular public transport services. Such considerations are not taken into account in statistics. I am not referring to discount fares, advance purchase excursion fares or anything like that. The range of fares available to travellers in the United States is far wider than is the range of fares available to travellers in Australia. So one can fly more cheaply in that country. A secondary factor is that salaries in the United States are a bit higher so that the number of hours to be worked to pay for an air fare is slightly lower than would be the case here. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the causes of inefficiency in the Australian airlines is having too many employees. Paragraph 6.63 of the Holcroft report, which is found at page 69, states:</PARA>
<PARA> Hocking in his paper 'Economic Efficiency of the Australian Airlines' . . . said:</PARA>
<PARA> 'There are two alternative conclusions. Either the quality of service on Australian airlines is significantly greater than that in the U.S.A., or Australian airlines are technically inefficient in the sense that the same output could be produced with much less labour. Both conclusions are bad. The quality of service in terms of safety, cabin attendance, booking efficiency and so on is, we suggest, quite high enough on American airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> 'If the Australian airlines are technically inefficient, this may not be entirely the fault of their management.'</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The table gives indicators of performance of employees in the airlines in relation to task performed. The column 'Freight and Mail Tonne Kilometres' shows figures per employee of 6,100 for Ansett and 7000 for TAA against a high figure of 37,000 for Continental and 27,000 for Braniff. Of the figures for the American airlines, the lowest is 12,400. Roughly, the American airlines carry twice the amount of freight per employee that the Australian airlines carry. Under the column 'Passenger Kilometres per Employee', the figure is 507,100 for TAA and 425,500 for Ansett as against 1,313,900 for American and 1,202,900 for Eastern. In other words, there is considerable disparity. Lest anyone say that because the Australian airlines, TAA and Ansett, are significantly smaller than the American airlines they do not enjoy the economies of scale, I refer to page 193 of the Holcroft report which deals with the issue and makes the point that economy of scale is not really relevant with airlines as it is with some other industries. At paragraph 11.35 on page 193, the Holcroft Report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to costs, the Inquiry is disturbed by the apparent tendency of the present system to result in fleet capacity increases to provide for extra traffic which was induced by air fare discounting. Where this additional traffic fails to meet the profit impact test, it threatens to add to the level of core fares. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 11.36 states in part:</PARA>
<PARA> Evidence given by East-West Airlines and others before the Inquiry suggests that there are, in general, few substantial economies of scale in the airline industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggested earlier in my speech that the freeing of Government restraint on the airline industry is one of the keys to reducing air fares. The answer to our problems is not to follow the route so beloved by the Opposition of having one airline. I refer the Opposition to the mess that the British have got themselves into with the British Overseas Airways Corporation as it used to be called, and British European Airways. I refer them also to the problems the New Zealand airlines have with Air New Zealand. What the Government must do and what these Bills to a very large extent do is to allow some true competition to develop between TAA and Ansett in all ways and, most importantly, to allow the possibility of a third or fourth carrier coming onto the scene. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to go back and deal with the sanctity of only two airlines operating in Australia because it is often said that we cannot tolerate economically more than two airlines in this country. Holcroft examined that proposition on page 48 of his report. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> In . . . 1952 . . . the Government retained TAA, being, it said, opposed to monopolies. The Prime Minister, Mr Robert Menzies added ' . . . we believe that there is no room for more than two major national operators if the necessary standards of efficiency are to be maintained'. This statement is significant, because it identifies as a foundation of the two airline policy the view that the technology and scale of airline operations was such that the Australian network could not support more than two airlines of the size necessary for efficiency. Yet the evidence today is strongly against this belief in economies of scale and decreasing unit costs of providing a service. Thus the main presumption underlying the inauguration of the Two Airlines Policy is not now applicable if it ever was. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of government involvement in the airline industry is safety. Safety takes pre-eminence above all else. A secondary function of government is to prevent unfair economic competition in the market place which compromises that safety. My mind goes back to the early 1960s when I read a report of an interview with the then Director of Civil Aviation, Donald Anderson, as he was before he was knighted. He was asked by the interviewer why Australian airlines were safe. Donald Anderson said at that time-it is still true today-that profitable airlines are safe airlines. It does not necessarily follow that there are no accidents if an airline is profitable, but one can be quite dogmatic in the belief that an unprofitable airline, which is cutting costs at every avenue, will be an unsafe airline. So the Government has a responsibility to maintian minimal control on the industry so that the operators are not taken to the brink of economic hardship. </PARA>
<PARA> This airline industry is a great industry, and the changes proposed by the Government are reasoned and planned changes. They provide for four great advances: First of all, the consideration of the selling of Trans-Australian Airlines; secondly, the separation of freight operations from airline passenger traffic; thirdly, the creation of an independent air fares tribunal; and, fourthly, the establishment of a deregulation inquiry. The decision to look at selling TAA represents a maturation in Government thinking-a maturation that I applaud the Government for because only 12 months ago it was unthinkable that the Government would have looked at following that path. Yet that path is inevitable if we are to get costs down in Australian airline traffic. For those people who misinterpret what is going on, it does not mean that TAA will disappear from Australia or that it will no longer serve the people of Australia. As a public company it will do so every bit as well as and better than it does as a government instrumentality. </PARA>
<PARA> While TAA is a government instrumentality we must have a two-airlines agreement, because we have a public company competing in the market place with a government authority. Therefore, we have to have an airlines agreement Bill which protects the non-government airline from a rapacious Treasury or a rapacious government on the Treasury benches. We have to write a Bill of great complexity to cover all the eventualities. That means high costs and high air fares. The answer to that is to put both airlines on the same footing. We simply cannot nationalise Ansett because that is not a political reality, but we can sell TAA. My hope is that when TAA is sold, subject to constraints as to who owns it so that it does not become a monopoly with the other airline, we will see the abolition of the airline agreement with its greatly restrictive clauses and we will get some real competition into the market place and some lower fares. </PARA>
<PARA> The second great change proposed in this legislation relates to freight. Freight operations are a specialised field. It has been shameful that governments of all persuasions have denied any competition in the freight field. Because of the way in which the business has been operated it has been made very difficult for operators to get freight licences, and when licences were obtained licence holders were denied the right to import aircraft. As I said before, that is a shameful way to go. I believe the opening up of the freight market is a great and significant step forward. </PARA>
<PARA> The third proposal in the legislation is the creation of an independent air fares tribunal which will be free of airline and Department of Transport control. Its guidelines in fare setting will be that fares shall be related to cost and that those fares shall be nationally uniform. I do not resile for one moment from the fact that that may produce some great changes in the far pricing structure in Australia because we in this country have not been setting fares on a cost related basis. But it is important from a business point of view that we know what it costs to provide a service. I hope that the independent air fares tribunal will provide that information because then we will get a fairer and more equitable basis for fares and ultimately again cheaper fares. </PARA>
<PARA> The final proposal for a deregulation inquiry is of great significance. I stressed earlier in this speech that government interference at an unnecessary level in the market place leads to increased costs. I do not have a wildly optimistic view about deregulation. I do not believe that an open skies policy will be appropriate in Australia, and in one way I think an open skies policy is a bit of a blue skies belief. But I am more than prepared to examine in detail the process of deregulation to see what benefits can come from it, because any investigation of deregulation will lead to some reduction of government interference in the market place. I simply do not believe there is anyone in either chamber of this Parliament who can say what the fare between Sydney and Melbourne should be. I am quite convinced, having read the Holcroft report, that no one in the Department of Transport who is vested with the authority to set those fares, can do so either. That is the business of the airlines in consultation with an informed committee. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three minor clouds on the horizon with this legislation. The first refers to clause 12 in the Schedule to the Airlines Agreement Bill 1981. I do not doubt the necessity for the inclusion of clause 12 which, I think, is quite necessary for the protection of the public. However, it allows the airlines to give notice to quit when they are losing money on routes-and they will be rural routes. I cannot overstate in this chamber the problem as it relates to Queensland. It will cause all parliamentary representatives a great deal of trouble as TAA, which is losing a current figure of over $1.5m a year in providing a very valuable service through western Queensland, moves inevitably to withdraw its Friendships from that service. At present that $1.5m loss on the western routes in Queensland is being laid off and subsidised by all the other TAA traffic in Australia. Under the new Bill it will be forbidden for the airlines to cross-subsidise in that way because the fare structure will be based in jet traffic alone, not on turbo-prop aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA> The reason for that loss is quite simple-there are not enough passengers travelling on the routes. It is no more difficult than that. However, it is important that we have this capacity on those routes because the alternative is to go for the light twins of the commuter airlines. The route characteristics are of long stage lengths and harsh environmental conditions, with high ambient temperatures. The light twin-type aircraft that conforms to air navigation regulation 203 that is used for commuter aircraft simply does not provide the safe and effective form of transport that we need in that area. In my judgment the answer to that is to buy the right equipment but, unfortunately, that is not available at present and it is probably five or six years off. As the existing service provides a necessity for the west the answer, in my judgment, is to provide a short term subsidy until such time as the right equipment can be introduced. I make it quite clear to the Senate that in the fullness of time I shall be asking for a subsidy to keep TAA on the western routes until alternative equipment can be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I have some reservations about is the Independent Air Fares Committee. Part III, clause 17, of the Bill deals with the approval of discount air fares and the introduction of a third operator on to a trunk route, on which Ansett and TAA are operating. I will seek the advice of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) on this matter in the Committee stage but the clause seems to indicate that if Ansett and TAA can show that passengers are flying with the third airline and that their costs will inevitably go up because those passengers who could have flown with them are flying with the third operator, then the third operator will have to charge the same air fare as the major carriers. That would effectively deny the third carrier a place on the route. I think that is an unduly restrictive clause to put in the legislation because one can conceive an operator such as East-West Airlines or Bush Pilots Airways Ltd being able to put on equipment at odd times and attract passengers by discounting a fare with respect to the major carriers. I think that in the interests of the travelling public that facility should be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point I make about the legislation relates to the magnitude of the changes involved. I believe there is an unanswerable case to provide some safeguard for the public in this legislation. As I said earlier, these are reasoned and planned changes. Let us look at what is involved. We have new equipment coming to all the airlines of a dimension we have never seen before. What is more, it is different equipment. Trans-Australia Airlines will have the Airbus and Ansett will have the 767s. The different equipment will dictate that there be a different operating pattern for the airlines. There will be an abolition of the parallel timetables. There will be a different fare basing structure. No freight will be involved. There may well be defects in the legislative process we have before us, as I have indicated with respect to those two earlier points. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the two airlines will be operating in a totally different commercial environment from that in which they have operated up to the present. Of course, the overall economic situation is something that we cannot foresee. The way fuel prices have changed so dramatically in the last five or six years, who knows what will come in the future? This is the greatest era of change in our history and I believe that the Parliament has a right to protect the public interest. It has a right to protect the Government's interest in the agreement. It has a right to protect TAA and Ansett. Therefore, I believe that there is a case for a review period. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept that the minimal period of tenure for the agreement should be eight years. That is the period that is acceptable to the Government and to the two airlines. In passing, I say that I regret the degree of misinformation that has been in the Press about this point. I can speak only for myself but I am quite happy to accept that an eight-year minimal period should be the period for the agreement. I know that Ansett Airlines accepts that eight-year period. Furthermore, I think it would be reasonable to suggest that Ansett would like some warning period. Ansett would be happy to look at a review point earlier than eight years providing the agreement is not changed within eight years. It is in its commercial interest to have a longer setting up time. I am not aware of any objections from TAA to this proposal. I am not aware that the Government, when it has a quiet think about the proposition, will have any objection either. I think it is just a responsible and common-sense way to act. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I will be moving an amendment in the Committee stage which puts a review period into one part of the Bill and which in no way at all alters the sense or the intent of that Bill. In conclusion I congratulate the Cabinet and all those Government members who have put so much work into this Bill. It has been one of the biggest pieces of legislation that has come through the Parliament in the short time I have been here. I think it is a step forward that is of great benefit to the Australian people. We are on the right road with this legislation and it has my full support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate Senator MacGibbon on a most thoughtful speech. In his wildest dreams he could never be accused of being a rampant socialist nor, I hope, could I be accused of being a hard-nosed tory. I think that 90 per cent of what he had to say tonight finds total agreement with my philosophy and the philosophy of the Australian Democrats. We deplore the fact that four such complex and far-reaching Bills are being rammed through the Parliament in such a short time. These Bills were introduced in the House of Representatives-very late-only last Thursday, 28 May. They were rushed through that House yesterday. In fact, it was not until 5 p.m. today that we could even get the Hansard of the House of Representatives to look at and study the debate that took place in that chamber. Now the Bills are being rushed through the Senate, although only one week has gone by since they were introduced into the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Almost every day there has been a saga of alterations to the legislation. For those who have not been privileged to attend the back bench committees with the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt)-that includes all members of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats-the only information has come from news leaked to newspapers. Quite often during the week different newspapers have carried different versions of where the legislation has been going and to what extent the Minister and the Cabinet have been agreeable to changing it. Also confusing are the reports of the attitudes of Sir Peter Abeles and Ansett Airlines of Australia to the proposed changes. I will have more to say about that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The performance tonight would be bad enough if it were a quiet week but the Government seems determined to make a mockery of the Parliament. Several very important and complicated Bills have been introduced all at the one time. There have been various income tax amendment Bills, the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill, the Housing Assistance Bill, the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Bill, Customs amendment Bills, the Road Grants Bill, and non-controversial matters such as the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill, the Koongarra Project Area Bill and the State and local government tax sharing Bills. On top of all that there is the razor gang omnibus legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats will remember the contempt with which the Government is now treating the Parliament. We will remember that for a long time. I make this point: I remind the Government that the Australian Democrats will be here at least until 1987. During that time the Government will be bringing in a great deal of contentious legislation. The Senate and Australians can rest assured that all that legislation will be given the closest scrutiny it deserves. In less than just a month the time will be over forever when the Government will be able to treat at least this chamber like a rubber stamp. All legislation will gain the attention it deserves. </PARA>
<PARA> We regard these airline Bills as unacceptable. We suggest that this is amply demonstrated by the fact that eight Government members in the House of Representatives crossed the floor last night to vote against these Bills. This was the biggest back bench revolt in the history of the Fraser Government and surely one of the biggest in Australian political history. I just hope that the courage shown by those Western Australians and others who crossed the floor of the House of Representatives last night will be followed by their Western Australian, Queensland, and Tasmanian colleagues in the Senate this evening. The Australian Democrats will be supporting the sunset amendment to be moved by Senator MacGibbon at the appropriate time in the Committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I regard what has been made known to me today as a deplorable tactic. I have heard it through several avenues. Each avenue and each source, particularly this afternoon, has made it palpably clear that this came from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) himself. This information was that if the Senate tonight accepts Senator MacGibbon's amendment, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) who represents the Minister for Transport in this place would immediately report progress and that would be the end of this Bill. In other words, the Government has told the Senate-more particularly it has told its own Government members like Senator Bjelke-Petersen: 'If you and five other senators dare cross the floor on this issue tonight and support Australians obtaining cheaper air fares, this Bill will be withdrawn and will never surface again'. In other words, the situation would be that the old airline agreement which has been in operation for over 20 years, will run on and on to the advantage of Ansett Airlines of Australia. It will allow that airline to continue to hold the licence to print money and run its business on a cost-plus basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is a scandal that the Executive and the Prime Minister can so publicly threaten members of Parliament and that that message could be conveyed to me. As Leader of the Australian Democrats I was told that we had better watch out. Honourable senators from Western Australia, Queensland and Tasmania who support Senator MacGibbon's amendment have been told that they must watch out. If they do so, that will be the end of this amending legislation which has occupied the newspapers for the past month. I leave the Senate to make up its mind about the respectability of those sorts of tactics. One would wonder what effect this threat will have on the independent Senator, Senator Harradine, who represents a State which is savaged by the kind of air fares which people who travel to and from Tasmania are being charged. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's problems on this question stem from its decision last November to truncate the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares. Once the Government received the committee's report early in February, rather than the middle of this year, it chose to ignore most of it and poured scorn on the heads of its distinguished members. The hatchet job on the Holcroft committee has been very skilfully done. If one searched the newspapers about that time, one would have found little public comment by Ministers or public servants on the capabilities or efficiency of the three members of the Holcroft committee. The scuttle-butt has gone around this place. By way of gossip, each of them has been bucketed in a very efficient way. Since early this year I have been calling for the Government to reopen the Holcroft inquiry so that it can finish its work or, preferably, the setting up of a Senate committee of inquiry into the same question. To fulfil that undertaking that I have been talking about for several months, I now move as an amendment to the motion before the Chair:</PARA>
<PARA> At the end of motion, add , 'but the Senate is of the opinion that a select committee of the Senate should be established to complete the inquiry undertaken by the Holcroft Committee into domestic air fares'. </PARA>
<PARA>Why should not the work of this committee be complete? To reach fully informed conclusions about questions of basic importance to the airline industry, the Holcroft committee recommended a formula for air fares. A lot of criticism has been made of the formula that was put forward by the Holcroft inquiry. I agree with many of those criticisms. I think it is a suspect formula. But any formula would be preferable to the Government's arbitrary approach to fee setting. How does any Western Australian senator tonight know that the arbitrary reduction of $9 that the Government plucked out of thin air and said: 'That is the proper reduction in the fare Western Australians should pay for a journey from the west coast to the east coast' is correct? How do we know that $150 should not have been knocked off? How do we know that it should not have been more? We will not know. Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland have not been told the basis upon which the Government has made its judgment about the fares applying to those States. It has simply plucked the figures out of the air. I wish someone would respond and ask: 'Why are the Australian Democrats moving that this matter go to a Senate select committee?' We have proposed in the legislation the Independent Air Fares Committee. If one reads the Bills carefully one will see that it would take that Committee at least two years-probably more-to get any form of result. That means that Western Australians, Queenslanders-particularly those from the north-Tasmanians and to a lesser extent South Australians, would in that two-year period be paying massive sums to subside the journeys of people travelling between Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. We believe that a Senate select committee-an all-party committee-could be appointed forthwith and come up with a reasonable result within at least six months. We will push for that. In passing, I note that the agreement's treatment of the term 'trunk route' is also unsatisfactory. We think that these routes should be listed and be made known in order to protect the smaller operators. I mention the name of one company-East-West Airlines Ltd-whose arguments to Senator Mason and me have been most persuasive. It is a battling commuter airline which is trying to provide a service at a cheaper cost to air travellers. That airline seems to be, under this agreement, placed totally at the mercy of the major airlines. We will be making an appropriate comment on this at the Committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The airlines agreement proposed by this Bill is completely unsatisfactory. Under its terms the agreement could theoretically operate indefinitely plus three years so long as the Government, Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett agreed on this. That is the reason we intend to support Senator MacGibbon's sunset clause amendment under which the Act ceases to be in force after eight years. That is, after the expiration of five years, three years' notice of termination could be given. But in any event, the agreement cannot last more than eight years. Ideally, we would want an amendment to the Bill to operate in such a way that it would be mandatory on the government of the day-whichever complexion it may be because we are talking about a time five years from now and there will be a general election before then-to let the proposed committee on deregulation do this work, produce its report and at that point force the government of the day, whether it is Labor or coalition, to take some positive act, either to notify termination or to tell the two airlines: 'At the end of eight years it will be open skies' or 'We are now persuaded that deregulation is not on and therefore at the end of eight years we will be signing a new agreement'. To me that would be palpably fair. It would be above board because within five years the Government would have to make a decision and would have to bring that decision to Parliament. Parliament could debate it. The two airlines, both TAA and Ansett, would know exactly where they stood and the whole question of whether deregulation would be a good thing could sensibly be debated in this Parliament. I share Senator MacGibbon's feelings or views that without pre-empting the work of the committee, I cannot see how any committee can come forward in a country like Australia, with its special and peculiar problems, and recommend an open skies policy. For the sake of Western Australians and north Queenslanders, one hopes that it could, but I believe that that will be the inevitable result. Under this agreement we are asked to ratify and under the Bill we are asked to pass tonight, after the expiration of five years the agreement could go on and on. The present legislation before us does not force either the Government or an airline to notify termination. The agreement could go for 10 years. At that stage one of the parties could say: 'A three-year notice of termination will be given'. The agreement could go for 100 years and then the Government could say: 'Three years from now we terminate'. I make it palpably clear that although I say this two-airline agreement is in fact giving a private company, Ansett Airlines, a licence to print money on a cost plus basis, I bear no animosity towards that company. In fact, I hold it in very high regard, for business, personal and many other reasons. It is a fine airline. It is extraordinarily well run and is a fine example--</PARA>

<PARA> The idea put forward by the Australian Labor Party in the House of Representatives last night, which would have brought the agreement to a dead halt after five years, is not acceptable to the Australian Democrats. We will be voting against the Labor Party's foreshadowed amendment to that effect to be moved tonight to the question that the Bill be read a second time. We believe that the rules of the game have been announced. The agreement was to remain in effect for 10 years. About a month ago, this Senate said: 'We will approve a loan Bill so that Ansett can borrow money to buy the equipment costing hundreds of millions of dollars'. All of us know when we passed that Bill that in our minds, Ansett's mind and the Government's mind, the legislation was to remain in force for 10 years. They were the rules of the game. Once we have declared the rules of the game, once the game has begun, once the ball has bounced, I do not think it is fair to change the rules. I do not think it would be fair to say to Sir Peter Abeles, once the game has begun: 'Righto, you thought you had 10 years but now you have only five years'. Sir Peter Abeles himself has agreed to a reduction from 10 years to eight years. That is why the Democrats support the eight-year sunset clause, even though Sir Peter Abeles does not. He does not object to the period of eight years. However, we will be supporting the amendment which the Labor Party is to move in the Committee stage and which Senator Gietzelt has foreshadowed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not fair that the agreement should be allowed to run indefinitely when future circumstances are so unpredictable. There is no way of knowing how much deregulation will be desirable in 10, 15 or 20 years time. We cannot afford to be locked into an agreement as restrictive as the one that the Government is suggesting. Our proposal is that after five years the Government should announce what will happen in another three years when the new scheme, whether it is to effect deregulation, partial deregulation or even continuation of the two airlines scheme, comes into operation in eight years from now, that is, in 1989. I hope that the Senate will agree to that proposal tonight. I think the Senate is living in a moment of high drama. We have a commitment from Senator MacGibbon to cross the floor and vote with the Democrats and the Labor Party on this question. I am given to understand at this stage that at least two other Government senators are prepared to do that also. If two other Government senators-I assume that Senator Harradine will vote with the Government on this issue-were to cross the floor on this issue, we could put a sunset clause into the legislation which I believe would bring justice to the airline policy in our country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Airlines Agreement Bill and the associated Bills that make up this complete package. It is a package for which I am extremely grateful. I congratulate the Government on bringing it down. I have been very closely involved with the negotiations over at least two years. It has been a long and hard haul. I believe that this package should move us towards less regulation in the airline industry in Australia and it follows that it should lead towards more competition in that industry. I have mentioned that there has been a very thorough consideration by the Government of this matter over at least two years, but that can also be said of the public. The public has been heavily involved to an extent never seen before in an inquiry such as this. I am pleased with and rather proud of the efforts of the Western Australian Liberal back benchers in leading the effort to encourage the Government to come up with what it has finally proposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What has been achieved? First of all, we are moving towards a situation in which we are eliminating to a large extent the degree of cross subsidisation that was demonstrated in the Holcroft report. We are setting up an air fares committee which will be entirely separate from the Department of Transport and which will set what it sees as cost-based fares on each route. I believe that this is the best possible move under the present regulated system. We are committed to turning Trans-Australia Airlines into a public company and we are establishing an inquiry to make recommendations to the Government on the level of shareholding that should be held by the Government and by the general public. There is to be an inquiry into the deregulation of the Australin airline industry and the report of that inquiry is to come down within five years. Five years may seem a long time to those of us who get pretty impatient but it will take at least that long, in my opinion, to investigate the system properly. The United States of America ventured into deregulation some years ago but I believe that it will be quite some time before whether the American experiment has worked can be properly and adequately assessed. So many conflicting reports have come out of the United States. My friend and colleague Senator Collard and I argue about this very subject as least once a day. He uses his selective reports and I use my selective reports. We are a long way apart in our views. This is the sort of problem that the inquiry will sort out. </PARA>
<PARA> Some problems have arisen with the proposed two-airline agreement. One has been demonstrated by East-West Airlines, with which I have had discussions and have exchanged many letters. I hope that its particular problem can be resolved. I believe that the new airline agreement is unduly restrictive in that it makes it virtually impossible for a new operator to enter the industry on major routes. As I have said, our regulated system, which after all sets out to protect Ansett and TAA, provides very little option for that. I believe in the gradual deregulation of the industry. I believe also that the Government has moved in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> I will outline some of the activities of the Western Australian Federal back benchers in the events culminating in the legislation before us tonight. We have had a large number of meetings with the previous Minister for Transport, Mr Nixon, and with Mr Hunt since he was appointed Minister for Transport. We have also had many meetings with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). These meetings have involved really tough negotiations. I thank the Government for the huge step it has taken from its original stand. In particular, I pay tribute to my Western Australian Liberal back bench colleagues for the extremely hard work they have done to achieve what has been achieved. I will not support Senator MacGibbon's proposed amendment. I reached that decision only late this morning. The reason why I will not support it is that I am convinced that to pass that amendment would be to destroy everything that has been achieved so far. That decision has nothing to do with the fact that I am Deputy Whip. In fact, I decided last night that I would resign this morning from this position. I recognise very clearly the obligations that the holder of this position has to the Government. I apologise to my Western Australian colleagues who may feel that I have deserted them and let them down. That is something which I will have to live with. But I am convinced, after many discussions early this morning, that to pass the amendment would be to destroy everything that has been achieved in the last two years. I am not prepared to take that risk. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are discussing the Airlines Agreement Bill 1981 and related Bills. As we know there are four Bills in all. Much has been said about the benefits that will flow to the airline companies but very little has been said about what will flow to the paying public, the travelling public. I believe that one should look at why these agreements are put in legislation and who will benefit from them. In the first place, the two-airlines agreement provides for the Government to hand over to two multi-millionaires its sovereign right to determine air policy. I believe that that is at the back of the Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When Sir Peter Abeles, the proprietor of the Thomas Nationwide Transport organisation, and Mr Rupert Murdoch, the proprietor of News Ltd, took over Ansett Airlines of Australia they paid out a gigantic sum of money on the stock exchange. For the next eight years the paying public will pay for that huge takeover. On top of that, when Sir Peter Abeles became the manager of Ansett and began running that company he forced new concessions on Ansett. He certainly improved the meals of Ansett and provided free drinks. Consequently, some of the travelling public left Trans-Australia Airlines and went to Ansett. TAA was then forced to give this extra service. Many people may say that that is good and in some ways it is, but it has all meant an increase in fares for the paying public. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to put on the record an indication of how air fares have escalated in the last three years. I think it is astounding how the prices have risen. I have not taken out figures for first class travellers because anyone who travels first class today usually has his air ticket paid for him. The prices I will give apply only to economy air fares. On 1 June 1978 the air fare from Adelaide to Canberra was $76.60. By 1 June 1981 that fare had risen to $116.20, an increase in three years of $39.60. On 1 June 1978 a person paid $79.70 to travel from Adelaide to Sydney. On 1 June 1981 he paid $119.80, an increase of $40.10 in three years. On 1 June 1978 a person paid $52.60 to fly from Melbourne to Sydney. Today he pays $88.40, an increase of $35.80. On 1 June 1978 a person paid $47.30 to fly from Hobart to Melbourne. Today he pays $74.10, an increase of $26.80. On 1 June 1978 a person paid $24.90 to fly from Canberra to Sydney. On 1 June 1981 he paid $56.20, an increase of $31.30 in a three-year period. Many of our Western Australian colleagues have complained about the air fares. On 1 June 1978 a person travelling economy between Perth and Melbourne paid $173.90. Today he pays $220.10, an increase of $46.20. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation was not introduced just to enable Sir Peter Abeles and Mr Rupert Murdoch to recoup the huge amount of money that they paid out on the stock exchange when they took over that company. It was also introduced because of the hold that Mr Murdoch has today over a lot of political parties and politicians, and I believe that this should be divulged. I believe that Rupert Murdoch makes politicians and political parties jump to his tune. This is no worse than the actions of the Mafia organisation that we have condemned in this country. It is no worse than the actions reported recently in the Melbourne Press of the Vietnamese who are cutting off the fingers and threatening people in the Vietnamese community. Today Peter Abeles does not have to threaten people. In the past he has displayed that characteristic. That is one of the reasons--</PARA>

Such a situation is incorrect. This country should be looking to transport as one of its main avenues to creating a tourist industry. While we are paying the high prices I have mentioned, we can never do this. The tourist industry would be capable of putting many of our young people back to work, but because governments bow and scrape to stand-over people such as those I have mentioned, we will never progress to full employment. All these airline Bills simply relate to the Government's doing what it can for the very wealthy, not for the paying public. Australia is an island continent on which people have to travel long distances. Aircraft is the only suitable method for long distance travel. We should be working out, as a Senate, ways and means of decreasing the cost of travel in this country. People who have to travel from Western Australia, from Tasmania, from the north of Queensland, from my own State of South Australia, and from the Northern Territory, from Darwin down, are entitled to some recognition of the prices they have to pay. In many cases, they work in isolated, hot areas and at least once a year their families go to cooler climates. The cost of transport today is so astronomical that it is becoming prohibitive for the general family to travel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We can see the plums that have been given to the major airlines but absolutely nothing has been given to the commuter airlines. Let me give one illustration. Pagas Airlines in South Australia plays a great part in providing transport in that State. It provides a transport service to Leigh Creek and to many other parts of South Australia and into the top end of Queensland. Pagas Airlines wanted to purchase a Nomad aircraft and I made representations on its behalf last year. Had that airline been able to borrow money in this country, which it could not do, to purchase that Nomad aircraft, the interest rate it would have had to pay would have been between 17 per cent and 19 per cent, which was prohibitive. That company tried everywhere in this country to get the money to purchase that aircraft but it could not do so. It was then forced to look at the Brazilian aircraft, the Bandeirante aircraft. The Brazilian Government gave the company the necessary finance at 7 1/2 per cent adjustable interest. That, I believe, is a disgrace. We have lost the aircraft we could have manufactured in this country. The Government gives subsidies and guarantees to major airlines purchasing aircraft overseas, but it does absolutely nothing for commuter aircraft companies that fly into the outback of this country. It does nothing for the people who live in isolated areas, whatever State they live in. Certainly TAA is running a service in the outback of Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And doing a great job. But under this agreement it can opt out of that service. I believe that is a disgrace. All Australians should have equality, irrespective of whether they live in cities or in outlying areas. I believe that has to be taken into account. As I said before, transport is a vital issue. When I came to this Senate I said that transport was so vital to this country that we, as a Senate, should be endeavouring to reduce the cost of transport. If we were doing our job here tonight we would not be giving plums to very wealthy individuals who own companies. We would be looking at what would benefit the whole of this country; at what is good for the nation, what is good for the people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We should form committees to look at this matter, as Senator Chipp has suggested. That should be looked into sensibly and rationally. We can reduce the cost of transport in this country. We should be looking at ways of improving all the conditions in the industry. This Senate should be looking at ways and means of keeping aircraft flying around the clock. Aerodromes are situated in cities but because of noise pollution they have to close at 11 p.m. If we cannot get quieter aircraft, those aerodromes should be placed outside metropolitan areas. As I say, our aircraft are so costly they should be flying 24 hours a day. With co-operation and forward planning they could be. But we do not want to do this. We want to keep air fares up. As I say, there is no benefit to the general public. All the benefit goes simply to the very wealthy of this country, and I object to that. At the appropriate time in the debate on the Independent Air Fares Committee Bill, it is my intention to move the following amendment:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out all words after 'That', insert:</PARA>
<PARA> 'the Senate is of the opinion that the Bill is deficient in that it does not provide for-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) cost allocation reviews on a sufficiently comprehensive and frequent basis;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) the involvement of the public, including consumers' representatives, in the review process; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) recognition of the profitability of the major airlines in the conduct of reviews by the Committee'. </PARA>
<PARA>The people really do not have a say in this eight-year agreement that is provided in this legislation. A committee comprising three people is to be set up but I notice that no one from the general public, the paying public, and no one from the trade union movement is to be a member of that committee. I believe the committee should be broadened. I believe that a member of the paying public, a person who works in this country and pays for his airline seat is entitled to be on that committee. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have pointed out, the cost escalation of air fares in this country in the last three years is a disgrace. The standard of aircraft has improved. With the introduction of the Airbus, there is no reason air fares could not be reduced. The Airbus most certainly will replace DC9 aircraft. I presume that the Airbus will fly from Sydney to Melbourne and that a number of DC9 aircraft will be replaced. There is no reason why the fares on the routes that aircraft will fly could not be reduced. As I said, I believe that unsatisfactory airfields in capital cities should be relocated to remote areas where they will not annoy people. Alternatively, quieter aircraft should be used. I understand that the Airbus will be a quiet aircraft. It is quieter than the Boeing 767 which Ansett Airlines of Australia will buy. I believe that the Senate should stand up for itself. It should not be stood over by the people I have mentioned. I ask the Senate to consider the amendments that the Opposition is moving and to support them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is discussing a package of Bills affectionately known as the airlines Bills. I will not go through their details at this stage. It is no secret that over the last few months we have been looking at the two-airline agreement, the report of the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares. I take on board Senator Chipp's comment that he has not had much time to look at the legislation but I can assure him that quite a few other people have been looking constantly at the Airlines Agreement Bill and the related Bills over a long period so that we hope we can put the airlines of Australia in a better position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall inform honourable senators of the history of the matter, particularly in relation to the Holcroft report and the much mentioned and, I suppose, much maligned term 'cross-subsidisation'. I must say that my discussions with the airlines some years ago first alerted me to the fact that they were aware that there was a problem with cross-subsidisation-that is, people on long haul routes were paying more than they should compared with those people travelling on the short haul routes. But there was a problem in that, even though they recognised this situation existed, they were finding it difficult to right because of the political implications that would be involved in the highly populated, dense traffic areas of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane if, without any explanation or justification other than their own figures, they tried to increase the air fares on those short haul routes at a greater rate than on the long haul routes. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, the Domestic Air Transport Policy Review gave them the vehicle by which to start righting that wrong. This they did. They pointed out the inequities. Since that time, every air fare increase, to my knowledge, has seen the flag fall component rise at a greater rate than the distance component. This meant that the short haul passengers were bearing a more equal share in the air fare structure in Australia. That was going pretty well, but somewhere along the line a group of people in Western Australia got together and called themselves the Fair Internal Air Fares Committee. Those people got in on the act when the act was just about over. I think I have mentioned here before that that committee put our colleagues from Western Australia under pressure, the like of which few of us have had to experience. They became pretty emotional. It is quite easy to be emotional about disadvantages in a State a long way away. I come from a far away State, and, indeed, I plead guilty to being parochial on more than one occasion. Of course, this campaign got up quite a head of steam. But I frankly do not know what the committee was on about. By the time its members recognised the wrongs, the airlines and the Domestic Air Transport Policy Review had recognised them and the machinery was in place and was correcting that wrong. But by the same token, we had this well orchestrated, well financed campaign, the repercussions of which are still reverberating around Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of that pressure, the Government established the Holcroft committee to report to the Government. Its original reporting time was to be at the end of January. The committee acknowledged that in correspondence. However, when it was seen that the committee was to take a little longer, and because of a few other factors which are not necessarily relevant to the Bills tonight, the Government said: 'We want you to report at the end of January'. I think it was about the middle of February when we got the report. That report-I have spoken before on it-mentions cross-subsidisation. The campaign got under way again. Let us have a look at cross-subsidisation in the course of discussing these Bills. First of all, I think it must be said that if there are disadvantages, they do not all apply to Western Australians. The end-to-end traffic is generated 50 per cent either way. It was not only Western Australians who would have been disadvantaged. The people in the east travelling west would also have been disadvantaged. This campaign generated a tremendous amount of unreal expectation in the minds of Western Australians. At one stage it was even calculated that because of the Domestic Air Transport Policy Review and the Holcroft report the people of Western Australia could expect a $200 reduction in the return economy fare, an expectation that could never have been realised, but still it was part of the campaign which was generated over there. The Holcroft report mentioned an $11m subsidy on the Sydney-Melbourne run was being contributed to by the long haul passengers. The Melbourne-Perth route in turn was subsidising to the tune of about $8m. I tried to explain in another speech the fact that the Holcroft report never substantiated those claims and never gave us the methodology. The report suggested a new air fare formula-I have spoken on that before-and indeed agreed that the report justified it, but the repercussions of that formula were never looked at. It was just taken for granted that it was right. Using the new formula the total revenue for each sector was worked out and the revenue obtained under the old formula was substracted from it. Therefore, he arrived at the figure which we have seen in the tables in the report and said that that was the tune of the cross-subsidisation. Three basic factors are wrong with that. </PARA>
<PARA> First, the report does not take into consideration multi-stage journeys, circuitous routing or discounting. About 20 per cent of the two million passengers each year on the Sydney-Melbourne leg are multi-stage passengers. Thus about 400,000 of them are multi-stage passengers. The flag fall at that time was $21.80. If one multiplies that figure by 400,000 one arrives at an amount of $8.7m or thereabouts. One has almost accounted for two-thirds of the so-called cross-subsidisation already. There is circuitous routing. People going to Alice Springs or Darwin quite often use the Sydney-Perth-Adelaide leg. There is discounting. Over the whole Australian network about 60 per cent of the passengers pay full fare and about 40 per cent of the passengers pay a discounted fare. For very obvious reasons the people on long haul routes who have to pay a higher fare go into a travel bureau and do their homework before they book and look for the best fare. The discount fares on long haul routes total about 52 per cent. In other words more than half the fares paid on long haul routes are discounted. About 48 per cent are at full fare. That is another figure that must be put into the equation when we try to understand where the so-called cross subsidisation has gone wrong. To use plain common sense which sections, if the Australian airline network was put up for sale, would honourable senators look to buy? It is quite obvious that they would opt for the densely populated areas, that is, the Sydney-Melbourne or Melbourne-Sydney-Brisbane run. The whole idea of suggesting that those routes are cross-subsidised to the extent mentioned is completely ridiculous. In the last speech I made on this subject, I incorporated a table which enabled people to decide whether there is cross-subsidisation. It is well nigh impossible to come up with a particular figure, but one can do a notional amount of work to see how fares are standing up. As I understand it, that table has been spread far and wide and has not once been challenged. That table showed that, at the time of the Holcroft report there was still slight cross-subsidisation from long haul to short haul. That fact was recognised and, as I said, it was being righted well before the pressure group in the West got into the act. After the Holcroft formula has been applied we now have substantial cross-subsidisation from short haul to long haul. It has reached the ridiculous stage where even the short haul routes such as from Melbourne to Tasmania are now cross-subsidising the long haul routes. That was never the intention. If that formula had been right in the first instance, we would not have needed that subsidy towards Tasmanian travellers. </PARA>
<PARA> I submit that the campaign to which my colleagues have been subjected and which has been transmitted through them to this place has been based on a pretty false premise. They have used a fair bit of emotionalism; they have used, or misused, the Press. Some of the Press statements which have been released cannot be substantiated. They have been quite scurrilous. Their people have called into question one of the best, safest, most efficient and cheapest airline systems in the world. I admit that it does have faults, but we must take into consideration all the problems which occur in providing Australia with airline services. My colleague Senator MacGibbon mentioned the discounts that are available in the United States. There are discounts in America, but it was not too many years ago when Australia offered more discounts than America. America went overboard with its discounts, so much so that the airlines literally could not afford them. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="C67">Senator COLLARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is certainly another point; they certainly are going broke. So many discounts were offered that, if a person rang up to book a flight, it would take the reservations clerk about two hours to give him the best deal he possibly could. Those airlines found that they had to put on an extraordinary number of people in the reservations area, so any benefit that might have accrued to those airlines by filling their aircraft was soon dissipated by their overheads connected with the extra reservations clerks. At that stage those airlines cut out most of their discounts and Australia was offering more discounts than they did. Even now-I could stand correction-I believe Australia is one of the few countries which offers discounts for children and students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We operate our airline system in a regulated way. I frankly believe that this is the only way we can provide an adequate service to as many Australians as possible. If we deregulate the industry, we would have the best and cheapest airline system in the world between Brisbane-Coolangatta and Sydney-Melbourne. I represent people other than those who travel on those routes. We have to recognise, whether in the field of communications or transport, that Australia has its problems. It has a small market place to start with for any transport system. We are spread over a pretty large land mass. What makes it harder is the fact that 70 per cent of our population lives within 30 kilometres of the coast. I do not believe that they are the only people who should be serviced. Our two trunk operators last year carried, in round figures, 11 million passengers. O'Hare International Airport in Chicago handled 48 million passengers. That sort of figure gives honourable senators some idea of the difference in the market place. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently we all received, courtesy of the Northern Territory Government, a rather expensive publication on the myths of the two-airline policy. I will not go into all the aspects, but will pick up one point concerning the effect of deregulation in California. I find it novel for the Northern Territory Government to use that example. The area of California is 411,014 square kilometres. The population is 22,694,000. The Northern Territory covers 1,346,200 square kilometres, which is about three times as large as California. It has a population of 115,700. Let me compare those figures with my State of Queensland which has an area of 1,727,000 square kilometres and a population of 2 million, which is one-tenth of the population of California. The total area of Australia is 7,682,000 square kilometres and the population is nearing 15 million. It is hardly a fair example to compare us with California. The Northern Territorians have always been worried-and quite rightly so as they live in an isolated area-about the Darwin services. I venture to suggest that there would hardly be a city of the population of Darwin which is around 60,000 which has similar air services. Airlines come to it from all over Australia. Nearly every day Boeing 727 services run from Melbourne via Adelaide and Alice Springs or from Melbourne, via Sydney, Brisbane and Mount Isa. Other services come through Gove, Port Hedland and so on. I think those people are entitled to that service, but let us not start knocking what has provided that market place, small though it be, with a system that is pretty good. My own State of Queensland, which has less population than either Sydney or Melbourne has nine jet airports operating every day of the week. It is hard to finance that sort of operation, yet we do so and still keep air fares at a reasonable rate vis-a-vis the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently America is going through the throes of deregulation. My colleague, Senator Thomas, mentioned the fact that we argue about what is happening in America and we use any evidence we like. We can use any evidence we like from America concerning deregulation to justify whatever argument we want. It would be accepted that with deregulation, even though there is such a tremendous market place, the industry is certainly going through some sort of turmoil. When and if it ends most people will have a service of sorts, but many will not have the services they were used to. There will be a lot more commuter operators, and the few trunk operators will be fairly stable. The commuter operators will never be stable while deregulation exists. The unfortunate part is that, as commuter operators come in, go broke and get out, the cost of money becomes more expensive to borrow as it has to be recouped. A certain problem accrues to the passengers who seek to use the services. The disruption in schedules is bad enough, but obviously air fares will ultimately bear the cost of that disruption. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary for our airlines to be viable. They deal with a lot of very expensive equipment, some of which is only basically paper equipment when they buy it. Quite often deposits are paid before the aircraft manufacturer has even cut metal. It is necessary for them to become viable. If companies go broke after having paid deposits for equipment, the whole industry begins to get into disarray. Then, once again, the fare-paying passengers will ultimately bear the cost. It is also essential for adequate maintenance that the airlines be viable. I repeat, the first two things that suffer when an airline begins to lose money are things that passengers never see, that is, aircraft maintenance and crew training. We must remember that the cause of the DC10 crash in Chicago, when the engine came away from the wing, was put down as nothing more or less than cost cutting on maintenance. That the airline concerned was not the only one involved in such practices was very noticeable. Both governments and communities have a vested interest in ensuring that airlines remain viable without necessarily sheltering them too. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the Australian market place is pretty small but Australian costs are also higher. In round figures, without going into too much detail, the direct operating cost per hour of a Boeing 727 in Australia, as against that of the same aircraft in the United States, is about $1,000 higher. There are many reasons, not least of which is that our work force has better conditions than any other country in the world. It has entitlement to long service leave which other countries have never heard about-employees there get perhaps four weeks annual leave after 20 years service. I believe that the Australian worker is entitled to that virtually on the day he begins work. Similarly the Australian worker is in a more favourable position with regard to the payment of penalty rates and other concessions. Another most important aspect is that we have to keep such a large inventory of spares. So there are many reasons why our direct operating costs are higher but that fact must be recognised. Ultimately it must be borne by the fare-paying passengers. When those factors are taken into consideration our air fares do not shape up too badly. </PARA>
<PARA> Another subject, one on which I have asked a question in the Senate, is that of curfews. Senator Elstob mentioned it indirectly. Very soon the A-300 Airbus will be in operation in Australia. Shortly after that we will have the Boeing 767. Both aircraft are powered by the same basic engine. There are differences but I need not mention them here. Their noise footprint is basically the same-or a little less than that of the F27. The F27, indeed the Lockheed Electra, can operate for 24 hours a day out of any of our major airports. It is essential that this Government soon take a decision-I would appreciate it if the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) could say whether such a decision has already been taken-on allowing aircraft with a suitable noise footprint to operate 24 hours a day. Airlines can get the most utilisation out of their aircraft only if they can keep them flying. It is significant, and to our airlines' credit, that our utilisation is one of the highest in the world. If we can get rid of the curfew, particularly for aircraft that meet the requirements, it will help to keep our air fares down. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, we operate in a regulatory environment. I can see that situation continuing for a long time. The only thing to change it would be a massive change in our demographic situation. Unfortunately, that does not appear to be on the horizon. We would need not only a massive increase in population but also a population shift from the seaboard to our inland areas. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter of concern to me and my colleagues in Queensland is that of western Queensland air services. I have acknowledged on other occasions, and I acknowledge here, that the people of Western Australia have paid full cost-related internal air fares. Yet every time a Western Australian uses a trunk operator he or she subsidises air travellers in western Queensland. That is an injustice. It must be recognised, and the people of western Queensland must expect to pay a cost-related air fare. There is provision in the legislation for the Government to pay a subsidy, albeit an interim one, if such fares become prohibitive. Once again we must be careful because it would be counter-productive to pay such a subsidy as would attract to the air services people who would normally travel on non-subsidised buses which are operated by private bus operators. That in itself would be a disservice because if the bus service were reduced those who did not have air services would suffer. Obviously, consideration must be given to that aspect. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government must take on board the fact that there might be need for an interim air service subsidy in western Queensland, particularly since there will not be available in the immediate future an aircraft to take the place of the F27. We in Queensland must accept that the F27s cannot go on forever and a day; that the older they get, even though they are safe, the more uneconomical they become and the less likely it is that they can be kept on those services. In meetings that my colleagues and I have had with the companies concerned and with the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt), we have fortunately been given guarantees that TAA will not walk away from its responsibilities. I think that ultimately a change will be made, but the services will still exist. It might be by way of an amalgam of an F27 and other commuter aircraft until such time, in 1985 or 1986, as aircraft such as the De Havilland-8 or the Saab Fairchild are available for regular passenger transport services. </PARA>
<PARA> We work in a regulatory environment, but we must also provide as much competition as possible in that regulatory environment. That is one of the reasons why I am supporting this package of Bills. The Government has recognised the need to provide a service over as much of Australia as possible but it has also recognised that we cannot be too protective. In this package of Bills we have also recognised the increasing role played by regional operators. My approach to the legislation was along the line that not only would the regional operators have to be given a fair go but also they must be allowed to expand, and indeed give the trunk operators a bit of curry-which they need. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also instituted an air fares committee. That is a good idea. I do not think it will give everybody the result expected but at least it is an independent body that can look objectively at the situation. The deregulations committee will give us an idea in a few years time of how the Australian airline situation measures up and whether we should move towards further deregulation, hold the line or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I say that my main consideration in my support for these Bills is that we should provide a good, viable, safe air service to all Australians, not just to one section of this country or group of people, as may be possible in the constraints within which we operate. For that reason we should look at this legislation not as some great new economical hypothesis dictating that we should do this, that or the other but as providing, within the environment in which we operate, a service that will be as competitive and viable as is possible. I support the package of Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Few measures emphasise more effectively than these Bills the philosophical poverty and actual corruption of the Fraser Government. They are one instalment of the pay-off to Rupert Murdoch for his unflinching prostitution of Press ethics in the interests of the Fraser Government's political survival. As he did in the United States to secure those soft loans, Rupert Murdoch trades off political support for commercial advantage. Tonight we are seeing one of the instalments in that trade-off which was made before the last election. This Government, which claims a non-negotiable philosophical commitment to market forces, small government and consumer sovereignty, legislates to provide a completely captive market for at least eight years for two companies which might as well be called Tweedledum and Tweedledee. That repudiation of the Government's claim to legitimacy was rationalised by the Minister for Transport, Mr Hunt, when presenting the Airlines Agreement Bill second reading speech in the House of Representatives last week on these grounds. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . I was concerned to allow a reasonable period of operations under these new arrangements before contemplating further amendments particularly bearing in mind the massive investment of some $800m made by TAA and Ansett to acquire new fuel efficient aircraft to maintain their high standards of service. I believe every minute of the 8-year period of the agreement will be needed. </PARA>
<PARA>Where, one might ask, is the daring entrepreneur of Liberal Party fable? Instead we have flaccid and flabby seekers of government patronage and absolute guarantees of freedom from competition. The very magnitude of the investment which the Minister cited as being required to re-equip with modern aircraft, $800m, is of itself an enourmous barrier to entry by new firms. But even that enormous market barrier is not enough for daring entrepreneurs like Rupert Murdoch and Sir Peter Abeles and for a government which complies readily with their wishes. </PARA>
<PARA> Happily there are a handful of Liberals in both Houses who actually believe some of that Liberal Party rhetoric that we read so much about at election times. They will not accept this perversion of the Liberal Party's stated principle. Some of them have voted, and presumably some of them will vote, accordingly. For that stand on what are supposed to be the fundamental principles of their own party they have been bullied, threatened and harassed by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and by his toadies, among whom can be numbered the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) who apparently effectively dealt with Senator Thomas today. If I were Senator Thomas I would be more concerned with the next Senate pre-selection in Perth if I wanted to remain in this Parliament than I would with the threats of Senator Durack. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate that the Minister, Mr Hunt, should use the high capital cost of entry as a spurious argument for guaranteeing a captive market for the Government's favoured friends. The Minister's behaviour throughout, like that of the Government he represents in this matter, has been an amalgam of devious misrepresentation, blatant misrepresentation and incompetence. On 18 September last year he introduced a Bill into the House of Representatives, although the House was to be prorogued that day, and stated that a draft agreement was in the process of being prepared. No time frame was placed on the duration of that agreement. No hint was given as to the duration of that agreement by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The next day, after the Parliament has been prorogued, he issued a Press statement saying that the agreement had been signed. I note for the record that the Fraser Government was obviously much more efficient at conducting its business in those days than it has been in recent months if the agreement was being drafted on one day and was signed and announced the next. On that day, 19 September, the Australian Financial Review alleged that the agreement signed had a duration of 10 years. Mr Hunt refused to comment on the accuracy of that story. He refused either to confirm or to deny that the agreement signed did, in fact, cover a 10 year term. We now know, of course, that it did. Just prior to the election, as a stunt, the Government set up the Holcroft inquiry. With the election safely out of the way, that inquiry was scandalously truncated at the end of January. It was given seven months to do its job. The next week the Government announced that it would conduct an inquiry into deregulation. That inquiry was to have five years to report from the time it was set up and the Prime Minister and others indicated that it probably would not be set up for two or three years. So on the one hand we had seven months for the Holcroft inquiry and on the other we had seven years or more for this farcical inquiry into the deregulation of the air industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport, under attack from some of the Liberal politicians to whom I have already referred and probably under some pressure even from his own party, decided to hit back at his critics at the Country Party council meeting in Canberra held on 7 March. He was particularly under attack from Western Australians. In the Sunday Telegraph of 8 March, which reported the meeting, he is reported as stating:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . if there is no two-airline system the parts of Australia that will suffer most will be Darwin and Perth. </PARA>
<PARA>It appears that the reason he advanced in support of that allegation was this allegation:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it was not until the two-airline system came into operation that the State--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, Western Australia-</PARA>
<PARA> Achieved regular scheduled services to the eastern States. </PARA>
<PARA>That simply is not true. The two-airline agreement dates from 1952. There have been scheduled services from Perth since the 1940s at least. The Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA> I am sure the people there-</PARA>
<PARA>That is the people in Perth and also in Darwin covered by the scope of these remarks-</PARA>
<PARA>Would not have access to the more sophisticated wide-body jet services that will be coming on stream in the '80s-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, unless the two-airline agreement continued. Why that should have been so he did not explain, except for some spurious allegation that the wide-bodied aircraft would be concentrated on the most populous routes so they could make the most money. How much money they made, of course, would be a function of the fares they charged, which was an independent variable. Leaving that aside, what if the people in Perth and Darwin-particularly the people in Perth-did not have access to wide-bodied aircraft? I am sure that the normal traveller from Western Australia-as distinct from those who have their fares paid by other people-paying his or her own fare is concerned primarily with what it costs. He is far more interested in a lower air fare than in a 727 wide-bodied aircraft. I note this in passing: If Mr Hunt is so concerned about Western Australians having access to wide-bodied aircraft, why has he introduced into the Parliament an agreement which gives Ansett Airlines of Australia power of veto over the use of the wide-bodied Qantas Airways Ltd aircraft by domestic passengers?</PARA>
<PARA> After that fraudulent and incompetent attempt to justify his position, the Minister for Transport has introduced legislation deviously designed to prevent any amendment to the agreement appended to this Bill. It is a question of all or nothing, so it is alleged; and 'nothing' means a continuation of the present agreement. The Parliament has been disfranchised by this Government and Rupert Murdoch has been given the power to veto within three months the legislation which the Parliament may or may not pass. All Australians have been disadvantaged by the two-airline agreement. The industry has been stultified. It has featherbedded inefficiency. We have the idiocy of parallel scheduling and compulsory waste of a type that refuses to allow the 1,000 seats a week which are vacant on Qantas aircraft between Perth and the eastern States to be utilised. All of those things will continue under the new agreement proposed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, with the absurd two airlines agreement we have successfully combined the worst features of both worlds-of a capitalist economy and a centrally planned economy. Western Australians have suffered most of all because of the two airline subsidy. Because of the cross subsidies, in particular, which have received a good deal of publicity, the absurdity of governments supporting a system which discriminated against the most naturally disadvantaged, by geography, of the potential customers of the airlines, which is, of course, the reverse-it violates both the laws of the market to which the Government is supposed to be committed and the other generally, socially accepted--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The absurd system which has prevailed-and which to some extent possibly still prevails-is that the most disadvantaged, by reason of geography, of potential customers subsidised the relatively advantaged customers. This violated both the laws of the market to which this Government is supposed to be committed and the generally, socially accepted policy in Australia that in certain circumstances there is an obligation on the society in general to compensate people for particular disadvantages. For those reasons, Western Australians are particularly conscious of the faults of a two-airline agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before moving on to discuss that matter, I point out that Senator Ryan has drawn my attention to the fact that East-West Airlines Ltd has sought permission to operate a commuter service between Canberra and Sydney at a cost of $46 standard economy fare compared with $56, the price currently charged by the two major airlines. That application has been blocked pursuant to the powers and the intent of the two airlines agreement. I wonder what Senator Reid will do in regard to this legislation, on a matter which so directly concerns the people she purports to represent. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the Government members of parliament who have so far voted against this legislation-only the House of Representatives has voted on it so far-not surprisingly have been Western Australians. Three of those who voted against the Government will nevertheless almost certainly be swept out of their seats at the next election-partially because of this legislation-not on any personal grounds but because the only way to get rid of the two airlines agreement is to get rid of the Fraser Government. To get rid of the Fraser Government, it may be necessary to get rid of those three or maybe four Western Australian members of the House of Representatives. They must go. One of the things, ironically, which will help to sweep them out of their seats will be this legislation, if it is passed. I notice that Senator Martin was invited to the Lodge tonight. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought he said: 'What does that mean'? I would have thought that it was fairly self-evident. I shall deal with some of the specific disadvantages that this legislation, if passed, will continue to impose on Western Australians. There are, and have been for a very long time, a thousand empty seats a week on scheduled Qantas flights between Perth and the eastern States. Qantas is eager to carry domestic passengers. It would carry them at fares considerably lower than the domestic airlines are able to charge. If those seats were permitted to be filled, six Boeing 727 flights between Perth and the eastern States a week would become redundant. That would save a quarter of a million litres of fuel, among other things, which ought to be attractive to a government which has a stated policy of fuel conservation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst this agreement does not explictly prohibit those seats being utilised, it gives the power of veto to Ansett. Western Australians can anticipate a continuation of the excellent service they have to the east whereby they have a choice basically of leaving Perth at midday or midnight due to the absurd system of parallel scheduling which also will continue. As a by-product of parallel scheduling it is necessary to spend-this is currently under way-about $40m on Perth Airport to cope with diarnal passenger peaks and the congestion which that induces. If the services were spread over a longer period, the congestion would not arise and the expenditure would not be required, at least for the present, and probably in the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I express my disgust at some of the tactics which have been used by people other than members of the Government with an interest in this matter and particularly by those who have been associated with Ansett Airlines. Last week I was visited by a News Ltd journalist who said that he wanted to have a talk about the Western Australian dissident members of parliament. I said that that would be okay. I was informed by the journalist that the story was around that the dissident Western Australians were being influenced by a group of Perth very wealthy businessmen. Although no names were mentioned the implications were that they were probably people such as Mr Holmes a'Court and Lang Hancock. The more important implication was, of course, that these Western Australians had been bought off. </PARA>
<PARA> It may well be beyond the comprehension of the two chief executives of Ansett that, having bought off the Fraser Government, they could not buy off every member who was supposed to be associated with it. It may well have been incomprehensible to them that that could have been caused by any reason other than that somebody else had paid a higher price. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The suggestion made to me was that because a limited number of Western Australian politicians were resisting government policy, they had been bought off. On the contrary to reflecting upon them, I said to certainly one of the more important journalists-I do not know them all-that I did not believe the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde), whom I have known reasonably well for a number of years, would do that. I was quite certain that he would not be in anything like that. This probably will not be disputed at least in this chamber, but I am not noted for readily handing out accolades to Liberal Party politicians. I do not know precisely who it was who attempted to spread that scurrilous rumour to discredit those members of the Liberal Party who had been standing up to Mr Fraser. Whether it was an executive or a senior executive of Ansett Airlines or someone in the Government, I do not know. But I have no doubt that it was a deliberate attempt to plant a story like that to try to get some confirmation from other people in Parliament so that the story might take off and hopefully discredit those who had taken a stand on what they saw as principle. That tells us a good deal about scruples or lack of them of the people we are dealing with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have heard a lot of rumours about what might happen to the various amendments that are going to be moved. I will watch with particular interest at the way the Western Australian senators vote. Two of them are in the Ministry and of course they will vote with the Government. There are four other Government senators from Western Australia. I will watch with particular interest to see how they vote. I am sure that the electors of Western Australia will also watch with particular interest to see how they vote. I suspect that the members of the Western Australian Liberal Party of Australia preselection council, the next time Senate preselections come up will also watch with some interest. It is perhaps fortunate for Senator Durack, having just scraped through the last Liberal Party preselection council meeting, defeating the crook Crichton-Browne by only one vote, that he will not be facing a preselection council the next time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin by acknowledging some of the remarks made by Senator Collard who, I think, set out very well the position about the disadvantage Western Australia has suffered in the recent air fares controversy. I am grateful for his recognition of the fact and for his hopes that that situation will be rectified. I cannot let the occasion pass without saying a couple of things in reply to Senator Walsh. He is always interesting to listen to, but he is much, much better when he is factual. I could not grasp who he was really attacking tonight. Is it that he thinks that attempts have been made to bribe some of the senators on this side, or does he believe that stories have been spread that attempts are being made to bribe us? I could not grasp what he was getting at. I respect Senator Walsh when he is factual but not when he indulges in this hyperbole. He seems to understand pretty well and have much the same opinion as I do of the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde) in the other place. I say in all courtesy to Senator Walsh that if he said 'Good day' to a few more of us now and again, he might know a little more about us. I try as hard as I can to make his acquaintance and he does acknowledge that I pass him now and again. If he knew us a bit better he would not be making allegations like that. I know that it is the function of the Opposition to oppose and to oppose strenuously. I respect Senator Walsh and all others on the opposition side for that. But it seems to me that things get a little out of hand. I will leave it at that because that is not really what I am here to speak about. I will leave the Government to deal with whatever allegations are of interest to it and about what Senator Walsh had to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I indicate that I will be supporting the amendment which will be moved by my friend and colleague, Senator MacGibbon. I will support no other amendments because I believe that his amendment comes closer to what is good for this country. I repeat that Senator MacGibbon's amendment comes closer to what is good for this country than anything else I have heard. By coincidence, it also seems to represent the views of Sir Peter Abeles, at least those views which he gave on one occasion to some of us. I know there is argument about the interpretation of those views but I, at any rate, have no doubt in my mind as to what was said on the occasion I am referring to by Sir Peter Abeles, and neither has any of my colleagues who were there at the same time. But this is not to say that what Sir Peter Abeles wants is what the Government is going to do. I know that the Government is going to resist strenuously that allegation. I think it will be able to prove that some of the things that have been said by people on the other side tonight, about multimillionaires running this Government, are quite wrong. I ask honourable senators in all seriousness: Is anyone, multimillionaires or anybody else, standing over this Government? Standing over this Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)? Standing over Malcolm? Not now, not ever! I think the Opposition understands that as well as I do. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention something that was said by my friend and colleague in the other place, Mr Peter Shack, the honourable member for Tangney. It sums up what some of us here are trying to do tonight. He says that he sees it as his responsibility to come into the chamber and vote for things which, he believed, if passed would make good law. I think that is what we are trying to do tonight. It certainly sums up the objective of Senator MacGibbon's amendment. The Government feels, no doubt-and I have no doubt about its sincerity-that what it is doing is in good faith. It thinks that the Bills it has presented are good for the country. Mostly they are. I am the first to concede that enormous progress has been made in certain directions. But, as I said some years ago in another place and on another Bill, all we want is one little amendment which will improve things enormously. That is the amendment that I will support. This amendment clearly sets a limit of eight years on the agreement. That is plenty of time, surely, for the companies to get settled in, to make the agreement work, to make profits and to provide for the future.</PARA>
<PARA> Some weeks ago, the Government guaranteed the loans which the airlines will use to re-equip themselves. I believe that this is fair enough and that the open-ended nature of the agreement as stated in the Bill is just too much. Notice of the termination of the agreement must run over three years. That means, if the agreement runs for five years it will be plus whatever, whenever and maybe forever. Then three years notice of termination can be given. This is not satisfactory to a number of us. We have put our case very strongly for quite some time to the Government. We regret that the Government has not accepted what we have put to it. I wish that the Government would go that little bit further, but they are not going to. They have not, and I regret that. I will be supporting Senator MacGibbon's amendment, which makes the Bill acceptable to me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I have been engaged with people of integrity in the House of Representatives, in my own State and with people of every political persuasion. I have been engaged in conversations and discussions with members of my own State Council of the Liberal Party for several years. Senator MacGibbon's amendment is a culmination of all the efforts of those discussions and of that work. I hope that we succeed for the good of Australia. I accept without reservation what Senator Chipp said earlier on these matters, but I have to say that no one has threatened me, no one has cajoled me. The discussions I have had with those who have been involved have been penetrating and diamond hard, but without acrimony. I feel that no one has pressured me. I can only offer this as my own experience and not necessarily as a contradiction of what Senator Chipp said earlier. I understand the position of the Deputy Whip, Senator Thomas. I understand the position of those who cannot see things in the same way as those who will be supporting the proposed amendment. I accept without any rancour their attitudes and what they are going to do. I hope that they feel the same way about what we are trying to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the Senate would have to say that I have not invested much wind in this place yet. Indeed, I do not intend to do so. What I say here will be what I believe it is necessary to say and will not be said just for the sake of speaking. When I spoke in the Senate on 29 April, for the sake of time, I incorporate in Hansard a document by the Nobel laureate, Professor Hayek. I wish to read part of that document tonight, because I think it sums up what we are trying to do. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> There is some justification at least in the taunt that many of the pretending defenders of 'free enterprise' are in fact defenders of privileges and advocates of government activity in their favor, rather than opponents of all privileges. In principle, the industrial protectionism and government-supported cartels and the agricultural policies of the conservative groups are not different from the proposals for a more far-reaching direction of economic life sponsored by the socialists. It is an illusion when the more conservative interventionists believe that they will be able to confine these government controls to the particular kinds of which they approve. In a democratic society at any rate, once the principle is admitted that the government undertakes responsibility for the status and position of particular groups, it is inevitable that this control will be extended to satisfy the aspirations and prejudices of the great masses. There is no hope of a return to a freer system until the leaders of the movement against state control are prepared first to impose upon themselves that discipline of a competitive market which they ask the masses to accept. The hopelessness of the prospect for the near future indeed is due mainly to the fact that no organized political group anywhere is in favour of a truly free system. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an exposition of how I feel about many things which governments, State and Federal, do. I understand the difficulties. I know that we cannot abolish a state of affairs which has grown up over many years. We cannot sweep it away overnight. But I feel that when little steps can be taken, as Senator MacGibbon said earler, they ought to be taken. That is where I stand. That is why I will support the amendment, which I believe is basically good for Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise very briefly to make my position quite clear. With respect to Senator Chipp, I read recently in the West Australian a report of a statement by him to the effect that any Government member who did not oppose the legislation had been subject to coercion by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I wish to make my position quite clear. I have not been subject to coercion by anyone. I have never spoken to the Prime Minister, nor has he spoken to me, about this legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not go into the party room. I have never been coerced. My judgment on this matter has been independent from the start. When this group in Western Australia first tried to subject us to pressure, I wrote to the group telling the group of my views. I said in simple terms that I would not support the group. That goes back many months. I have never diverted from that course. My view is my own independent judgment. I respect my colleagues from Western Australia who disagree with me. They have made their independent judgment and I respect it. They have never tried to coerce me, nor have I ever tried to coerce them. So the view I express in support of this legislation is in line with my own judgment, no one else's, and without coercion from anyone. I just make that point quite clear for Senator Chipp.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not wish to speak at length. I do not believe that many of the arguments used by those who support deregulation or the variants of deregulation have any validity at all. I support philosophically the idea of a free market force. It must be a pragmatic one. I am very interested in the situation in the United States of America. I accept that one can use all the arguments relating to the United States to whichever advantage one wishes. No stronger view has been expressed in favour of free enterprise than that expressed by the new Reagan Administration. It has expressed very clearly a philosophy in favour of private enterprise. I was very interested to note on an article by Barbara Donnelly of Associated Press-Dow Jones on Friday 22 May, which expressed the views of the Chairman of Alitalia, Umberto Nordio, who had had discussions with the Reagan Administration concerning the unmitigated disaster that deregulation had meant to the United States airlines. He is reported as saying after discussions with leaders in the Reagan Administration that they had expressed quite clearly that that Administration:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . intends to change the free-for-all airline deregulation policy that has brought even major US carriers to the brink of collapse. </PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Key Reagan contacts clearly grasp the notion that the deregulation policy of the Carter Administration was mistaken. They have shown a clear intention of changing it. </PARA>
<PARA>The report went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Braniff-</PARA>
<PARA>That is a great domestic and international airline-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . will declare bankruptcy in the near future . . . He also singled out Pan American Airlines . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Another great American airline which has been engaged in a takeover of other airlines. For example, the National airline, a big airline, has been taken over by Pan Am because it was at the point of collapse. Mr Nordio said about Pan Am:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a company in very serious difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> Braniff is about to go under. Watch Braniff, watch Pan Am. If Braniff doesn't go bankrupt it will be because it will go the route of Chrysler towards Government subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA>Later he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The American companies are currently the first to line up at the CAB (Civil Aeronautics Board) to ask for a change in deregulation. And right there with them is the State Department, which knows what Carter's pseudo-idealistic policy did to US international relations. </PARA>
<PARA>That deals with international airlines, but these big companies are also domestic carriers. Let us look at the situation in the United States. Great cities, such as Philadelphia, no longer have regular commercial jet services. They are served by small commuter airlines. I commend the comments by Senator Collard both tonight and in his speech on 9 April on the Airlines Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill as ones which deserve study. I think he has put the situation clearly. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I am opposed to some of the changes which have been made to air fares, but the arguments that Australian air fares, particularly on long haul routes, are the dearest in the world are absolute nonsense. I recommend that the Senate look at the tables which were incorporated in Hansard by Senator Collard, which prove this point. I also commend the comments by Senator Collard concerning the methodology of the Holcroft inquiry, which completely ignores the points he made tonight about the multi-stage routes, which give an entirely different picture of cross-subsidisation. I am not against changes and I am not against more competition, but I believe that this legislation will mean, because of the fact that the airlines are to use new and different equipment, greater competition on our routes under some form of control. </PARA>
<PARA> Deregulation, as some of my colleagues have recommended, has proved in the United States to be an absolute disaster. The American airlines are suffering a severe financial loss. The fact is-I think as Senator Collard said-that the first two things that suffer are maintenance and crew training. Braniff, one of the companies that I have just mentioned, has already been fined because of its failure to carry out proper maintenance. In other words it is taking short cuts to save money. The Australian airlines-because they have been reasonably profitable but not overprofitable-have had a magnificent safety record. I think it is correct to say that the airlines conduct their maintenance tests over and above the regulations laid down by the Department of Transport. The first area that suffers when airlines start to lose money is safety. I make this point clear. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the legislation because I believe it is in the interests of Australia. Despite the weaknesses and problems, and considering the points that have been made by Senator Collard that we have a small market compared with other countries and long lines of communication, I believe that we have an airline system in Australia equal to any in the world. Those of us who have flown on domestic airlines in other countries would find it very difficult to find a service generally comparable to that which we enjoy in Australia. Therefore, for these reasons, I support completely the arguments used by Senator Collard. I declare myself free from coercion and I support this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The issues involved in these pieces of legislation have been canvassed at length in the House of Representatives and are now being canvassed in the Senate. We are dealing, as I see it, with only one amendment to the second reading motion and that is an amendment moved by Senator Chipp which relates to the establishment of a Senate select committee to complete the inquiry undertaken by the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares. All of the other matters to which honourable senators have addressed themselves have related really to the clauses of the Bill and to the proposed amendments to be moved in the committee stage by Senator MacGibbon, Senator Gietzelt and Senator Elstob. I presume that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) is not anxious at this stage to call a point of order on me if I advert to those matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First of all I must be the only member of this chamber who has not been spoken to by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), Sir Peter Abeles, Rupert Murdoch, Trans-Australia Airlines, East-West Airlines, or anybody else. I am not complaining about that; that is how I like it as a matter of fact. However, I have examined the matters that have come before us in the correspondence that has been received and I have studied it quite carefully. In particular I have looked at the East-West material that has come forward and also the answers that only as recently as yesterday have been given by the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) to those particular propositions and considerations. So it is now a matter for the Parliament to decide. I will oppose the amendment to be moved by Senator MacGibbon in the Committee stages because I believe that that proposal is an abdication of the responsibilities of both the Government and the Parliament. It establishes a situation where the operations of the agreement simply lapse after a period. In my view there is a need for a positive proposal to be advanced and for that to be submitted in sufficient time to get a reflection of the people's view on this matter before this airline agreement lapses. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it there is not a great deal of argument about the details in the 1981 agreement. It has been pointed out in the Minister's second reading speech that the Airlines Agreement Bill 1981 is better than the current agreement which, of course, can only be terminated after five years notice. The proposed legislation does do what in fact I feel ought to be done. That is, it requires the Government to make a firm commitment to the two-airline policy. I will quote from the Minister's second reading speech. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . before its re-election to office last year, the earliest one could expect that notice of termination of the current agreement could be served is after the next election, due in 1983. Such notice would have to specify a termination date of at least five years from then, say the beginning of 1989, or eight years from now. I have earlier made a commitment in respect of the termination of this agreement five years hence should certain circumstances occur. In deciding upon such arrangements I was concerned to allow a reasonable period of operations under these new arrangements before contemplating further amendments particularly bearing in mind the massive investment of some $800m made by TAA and Ansett to acquire new fuel efficient aircraft to maintain their high standards of service. </PARA>
<PARA>All these matters have been thoroughly investigated. To my way of thinking to have an amendment to the Bill which simply allows a government of the day, by not taking any decision whatsoever, to allow the important issue of airline services throughout Australia to lapse, purely by the effluxion of time, would be an irresponsible act. The government of the day must be forced to advance a positive proposal and, of course, once having advanced that positive proposal to give notice of the termination of the airlines agreement and the period of that notice would go over the subsequent election. In other words the people of Australia would then have the opportunity, as is their right, to determine whether the positive proposal by the government of the day is valid. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect to which I will advert relates to the question of deregulation. If Senator MacGibbon's proposal were put forward, if the inquiry came down with a proposal for deregulation and if the Government did not make any decision but just simply went along with the lapsing of the arrangements then, of course, there would be a situation of deregulation. In my view there is no joy in that for my State. I concede that Western Australia has a particular point of view which ought to have been considered, but if I were the Government I would deregulate Western Australia, give it to Qantas Airways Ltd and the international airlines and balance it up by giving the domestic airlines New Zealand. I think everything would be all right under those circumstances. I therefore indicate that I will not support that particular proposition in the Committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the amendment moved by Senator Chipp, there is already so far as my State is concerned, a Senate Select Committee on Passenger Fares and Services to and from Tasmania. I hope that that Committee will direct its attention to the question of air fares between my State and the mainland.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has been debating this evening a very important series of measures, the first of which is a Bill to give the approval of Parliament to a new airlines agreement. It is quite clear from the length of the debate we have had in the Senate and from the debate in another place that in this Parliament there as been a very great interest in and concern about the propositions that are contained in this new airlines agreeement and the associated legislation. The Government has attached very great importance and significance to the negotiations for this new airlines agreement which it felt was necessary to secure as long ago as about 1978 after the Government itself had undertaken a review of domestic aviation policy. Since then the Government has believed that the existing agreement was deficient in many respects and needed to be brought up to date. It has taken the consistent view that it supported the principles of the two-airline policy but that it believed the existing policy needed to be reviewed and renegotiated. Those negotiations with the other parties to the agreement have been going on from as long ago as the middle of 1978.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The general tenor of this debate seems to indicate that the Senate accepts that the agreement that has been renegotiated and which is before us for approval tonight is a significant improvement on the existing agreement. There are a number of aspects which clearly are improvements. The Government particularly was concerned to free up the existing agreement to make it more competitive, and I think it is clear that those policies have been achieved. The Government also has been concerned for some time about the general level of services provided by our aviation policy under the two-airline agreement and in other respects. As I think Senator MacGibbon pointed out earlier in this debate, great technical changes have been taking place in the airline industry and the Government therefore felt that appropriate changes were needed to our aviation policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is pleased that the major operators in this area have been prepared to embark upon significant changes in their own equipment policies and attitudes. It is also pleasing that they have been prepared to renegotiate the agreement. We must bear in mind at the very threshold of this debate that the existing agreement provides that the company-Ansett Airlines of Australia-and Trans-Australia Airlines-the other party to it-have very significant rights and that agreement cannot be determined without notice of five years being given to those parties by the Government. So there are very significant existing rights. For the Government to be able to achieve the purposes of the policies I have mentioned and to implement them, it has been necessary to persuade the companies to give up the rights they have under the existing agreement and to enter into the new agreement which we have before us for approval this evening. That is in fact what the other parties to the agreement-the company and the Australian National Airlines Commission-have been prepared to do. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to these broad policies I have mentioned, the company and the Commission have been prepared to make changes in relation to their equipment. These very large purchases of new, modern equipment, I think everybody will agree, will make revolutionary changes in the nature and quality of the major airline services throughout Australia, particularly on the trunk routes operated by the major operators. Of course, other major changes are occurring in other aspects of aviation affairs in this country. They also need appropriate changes of policy, and they also are recognised in the new agreement and in aspects of this legislation. So, all in all, we are now about to embark upon a very great era of change in policies as required and in what services are to be provided for the Australian people under those policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government was able to complete negotiations for a new agreement in September last year but since then it has reconsidered the agreement and has been able to renegotiate with the other parties. It has now come forward with what I think everyone agrees is a better result than that achieved in September last year. The Government has also taken a number of other very significant steps. First of all, it set up the Holcroft Independent Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares. That inquiry made a major investigation into the fare setting formula. The Government accepted the recommendations of that inquiry and also took a major step towards implementing them in April this year. The report of that committee has also made a major contribution to changes in policy and to the air fares that Australians are paying, bringing about a fairer system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has, in the development of this present agreement and in the development of the legislation currently before the Senate, also indicated some other major changes. One of the major changes has been the decision to establish a public company and to transfer the assets and operations of TAA to that public company and for the other major operator in future therefore to be on an entirely commercial basis. That should have major significance in the achievement of the Government's desire for greater competition, even within the two-airline policy. In addition to that step, the Government said that it will inquire into the feasibility of the disposal of some or all of the shares which initially will be held 100 per cent by the Government, with perhaps the achievement of a further competitive environment with that company becoming an entirely private operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the Government has said that it will establish another committee of inquiry to undertake an assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of deregulating the domestic aviation industry. This is the most important step of all. By this step it has raised the question and the possibility of the replacement of the two-airline policy, which has operated now for nearly 30 years in this country, with an entirely new aviation policy. That committee will observe these new major changes which undoubtedly will occur because of the factors I have mentioned and because of the new agreement and the new legislation that we have before us this evening. That inquiry will assess the situation in regard to the agreement over the next five years. It will be asked to report to the Government within that five-year period in order to enable the Government, the Parliament and the public to assess the results of these major changes which, I have said, have been occurring and which will occur over the period. It will enable full consideration by the Parliament as well as by the Government of what has occurred and of the report of that inquiry. At the end of the five-year period that we are now looking at we will be in a position to have a major debate and a major rethink of these aviation policies which we have been pursuing in one form or another now for such a long period. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt), in his second reading speech, which I on his behalf have given here, went even further and said:</PARA>
<PARA> As soon as the inquiry has reported, the Government will ensure there is a full parliamentary debate on its report. Should the inquiry make recommendations supporting deregulation for the domestic aviation industry, and the Government accept those recommendations, the Government would then move immediately at the end of the five-year period of this agreement to give the three years' notice to terminate the two airlines agreement in accordance with its provisions for termination. </PARA>
<PARA>That would give full effect to the decisions that may well be taken at the end of that five-year period, and then, in an orderly, efficient and sensible way, to implement any such decisions that may be taken. In other words, the Government wants to be in that position at the end of five years. We have had a good deal of debate about the question of termination of the agreement. Amendments to have a fixed determination of it at the end of eight years have been foreshadowed. That is the five year guaranteed period before anything can be done, on the assumption that there presumably would be an immediate giving of three years' notice and that the agreement would then come to an end firmly at the end of that eight-year period. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the agreement does not provide for that in so many terms. The agreement provides that at the end of five years it can be determined only by three years' notice by any party to it, which, of course, includes the Government. This is a vitally important aspect. No doubt there will be some more discussion in the Committee stages. The Goverment would adopt the arguments that Senator Harradine so very clearly stated here. We have indicated that if, at the end of the five-year period, the recommendation is that the agreement be brought to an end, if the Government and the Parliament accepts it, the Government will be in a position to bring that agreement to an orderly conclusion, and nobody will be disadvantaged or will suffer from it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We can make undertakings only on an assumption as to the positon we would be in. I am giving them on that assumption. That is what the Government has said in regard to the undertaking that we have given here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important that, after the Government's very long period of negotiations with this company and the Commission which have entered into this new agreement the agreement, achieved after those very hard fought negotiations, be the final agreement that has been entered into. We have it before us tonight and it provides for this form of termination to be adhered to. The Government proposes to honour the agreement it has entered into. Senator Chipp has proposed an amendment which is different from the one I mentioned. His amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA> A end of motion, add, ', but the Senate is of the opinion that a Select Committee of the Senate should be established to complete the inquiry undertaken by the Holcroft Committee into domestic air fares'. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to deal briefly with that matter before I conclude my remarks. The Government is opposed to that amendment. It is our view that it is entirely unnecessary. The Government has in this legislation for the period of the new agreement, whatever it may turn out to be, provided for a new independent air fares committee which will conduct an inquiry at various levels into the fare setting formula. The Minister said that within six months it will ensure it conducts the sort of inquiry that was undertaken by the Holcroft committee, but the Government does not intend to wait for that to be done. The Government has said already that it will appoint consultants to complete the Holcroft calculations in relation to domestic fare setting formula. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Holcroft reported when it finished its inquiry. There were some further calculations and inquiry to be done. The Government said that it proposed to do that. I am pleased to be able to inform the Senate that, having approached a number of independent consultants to complete this work by Holcroft, the Government has today selected Price Waterhouse and Co. for this purpose. The work of the consultants will be tabled and made available to the Independent Air Fares Committee to assist in undertaking its calculations in the future. The point is that the Government has now selected the consultants to complete this work. It is very technical work and quite inappropriate for a committee of the Senate which would not be suited to deal with it. It will be done by consultants of a high calibre. In future, this sort of inquiry will be done at various levels and on a broad basis of methodology every two years or three years. The inquiry will carry out major and minor reviews of fares and will also look at discount fares. The questions that were addressed by Holcroft will be thoroughly investigated at regular intervals by the Independent Air Fares Committee which is part of this package of legislation before the Senate. I hope that it also will be supported. For those reasons, I trust that the Senate will give this important Bill a second reading and will reject the motion that Senator Chipp has moved for an inquiry by a select committee of the Senate. I trust that we will be able, in due course this evening, to pass this important measure.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> 9. (1) This Act, unless sooner repealed, shall cease to be in force at the expiration of 8 years after the day on which the agreement referred to in section 5 comes into force and effect. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) For the purposes of section 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, when this Act ceases to be in force by virtue of sub-section (1), it shall thereupon be deemed to have been repealed by an Act other than this Act. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not wish to debate some of the points that have been raised and propose to comment on two issues only. The first concerns the point raised by Senator Harradine. From listening to him it was clear that he believed that if the proposed amendment were passed a vacuum would exist. I can assure the honourable senator that a vacuum would exist only if the Government took no action and I find that inconceivable. The second point of which I have been made aware of is that there has been a misinterpretation of what I have said regarding the intent of this amendment. I understand that Cabinet believes that the Act would be amended in a way that is, in fact, not contemplated. There is abroad an impression that somehow or other a review period would be brought in at the end of eight years; that, without any warning or setting up time, a new airlines Bill would have to be introduced. Of course that is not true. Of course the three year warning would apply, so that the need for this review period would have to be exercised after some 4 1/2 or 5 years of the term of the agreement had elapsed. In no way would the terms of, or the essential interest provided in the Bill, be altered in any way. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is a reasoned and planned move to improve the airlines of Australia. We live in a time of change. The changes proposed are more extensive than are proposed in any other such legislation that has come before this Parliament. We will have new equipment. We will have new technology. The two major airlines will have different equipment and that in itself will produce different scheduling agreements. There will be a new fare basing system. As I indicated in my speech at the second reading stage, there is in my mind some uncertainty about certain clauses of the legislation and as to how they should be interpreted. I suggest that we should not be locked in irrevocably, without a review facility. Above all, who can foresee what the economic climate and conditions will be in Australia in the future? To all these things must be added the possibility that the investigation into the selling of Trans-Australia Airlines will recommend that it be sold. One cannot foresee what the recommendations from the deregulation inquiry will be. It is common sense to have some review position in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment will not change the spirit, the intent or the legality of the present Bills. It will provide nothing more than an opportunity for the Parliament to look at the circumstances that relate to the operations of the airlines at the time. As far as I know, there is no objection at all from the operators. As I said earlier, I am not aware that the Government will have any objection to this recommendation when it has time to think about it quietly. I believe it is necessary in the interests of the Australian community that this review period be provided. I believe it is in the interests of the Australian Government. I believe it is in the interests of TAA and Ansett Airlines of Australia. I commend the amendment to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with everything that Senator MacGibbon has just said, except for one point-that he is sure if this amendment is passed, the Government will accept it and see the wisdom of it. It has come to my notice today from about five different sources that the message has come out with crystal clarity from the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that if, in a few moments, this Senate passes this amendment, the Minister in charge of the Bill will immediately move that progress be reported, we will assemble in the Senate and the Bill will be withdrawn, never to be presented again. That would mean that we would have to rely on the old agreement. If honourable senators have any self-respect as members of the House of review and if they believe in what they have been saying in speeches-that this chamber should not be subject to Executive or Prime Ministerial direction-let them know as they vote tonight that they will not be voting from a detached point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I repeat what Senator MacGibbon said. I say this because of what Senator Harradine said in his speech at the second reading stage. What does this amendment mean? It means that there will be a sunset clause in the agreement. No government in its right mind, whether it be Labor, Liberal or coalition, would allow the agreement to go for eight years before giving proper notice to the airlines that it intended either to terminate the agreement after 8 years or to have an open skies policy. Notwithstanding the undertaking given by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) in his speech tonight, that the Government would make an announcement in five years, if the report on deregulation said, as I expect it to say, that an open skies policy was not suitable for Australia and the Government then proposed no further action, this agreement, if this amendment is not carried, would just carry on and on. It could well carry on for 20 or 30 years, plus three years, the three years being the time in which notice has to be given under the terms of the agreement. I do not believe any private company should have that sort of licence virtually to print money on a cost-plus basis. That is what a duopoly means under this agreement. I believe some check should be placed on that. The sunset clause contained in Senator MacGibbon's amendment gives that protection to the Parliament and to Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be supporting the amendment moved by Senator MacGibbon. I was further encouraged to do so by the reply of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) in winding up the second reading debate tonight. The Attorney admitted on behalf of the Goverment that the existing agreement, which will be repealed by this Bill, has become unworkable and out of date. I put to the Senate that it had become unworkable and out of date because there had been no pressure point on any of the parties to get together to have a new agreement. This agreement has gone on and on because it is an open-ended agreement subject to five years notice. No government, neither on our side of politics nor the Whitlam Government in its three years, was prepared to give the five years notice of termination. Senator MacGibbon's amendment gives that notice now. A lot has been said about how the airlines would be affected. I have come to the conclusion that the airlines are entitled to eight years. I come to that conclusion because they were informed that during the life of this Parliament the present Goverment would not give the five years notice. They have been saddled with the proposition that there will be no notice in the life of this Parliament and then, if notice were given in the next Parliament, they would have five years to put their house in order. I believe that undertaking ought to be honoured by the Parliament. That is what the agreement does. It gives them five years for certain and then at any time after that date three years notice may be given. All that Senator MacGibbon's amendment does is to convert that minimum of eight years-the five plus three-to a maximum of eight years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The airlines are not disadvantaged by having their minimum converted to a maximum. They have eight years in which to recover their costs, to have their investment amortised and to put their house in general financial order. I do not believe any government, as Senator Chipp said, would allow the whole agreement just to collapse in chaos at the end of eight years. That is not in the realms of practical politics. Of course, even if the amendment is lost, such a scenario is possible. Who knows which government will be in power in five years time?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh well, we have always been eternal optimists! But one does not know. None of us knows. None of us might be here at that time. In five years time, the government of the day may give five years notice, converting the eight years minimum to the eight years maximum. If a government were stupid enough, it could then sit back, do nothing and have chaos at the end of eight years. I know that Senator Harradine said that there may well be an election in between. But there may not be an election in between. As I understand it, there seems to be a movement about the place to have four year parliaments. If we go down the track of four year parliaments, with fixed terms, it may well be that within those three years a government would have the capacity to give notice in its first year with only three-quarters of its term to go before the three years ran out. Therefore, I say that most of the arguments that have been put, with respect to those who put them, do not hold up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say again: This amendment converts the eight years minimum to the eight years maximum. The airlines will not be disadvantaged but I believe the community will be advantaged, because there will be that pressure point upon the two airlines and the Government to make certain the agreement does not run on and on so that it becomes like the present agreement-out of date and unworkable. There is an admission on all sides that new technology is coming. There is an admission on all sides that the different equipment will revolutionise the airline industry in this country. Yet for some reason which totally escapes me the Government wants an open-ended agreement. I would have thought that on the Government's own argument, namely, that the present agreement has become unworkable and out of date, and on the Government's own admission that new technology will revolutionise the airline business in Australia, the Government itself would welcome this sunset clause. Therefore, I will be voting in support of the amendment moved by Senator MacGibbon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition noted that Senator MacGibbon moved precisely the same amendment as was moved in another place about this time last evening and that it there attracted support from a considerable number of Government members to the extent that the amendment was lost by only three votes. As indicated by my colleague, Mr Morris, who is the spokesman for the Australian Labor Party on these matters, we regard this as being only a second-best proposition. We do not quite share the enthusiasm that Senator MacGibbon has for the amendment. Nevertheless, we believe that this is a House of review and that the Senate should take into consideration the debate that took place in the second reading debate. Further, we believe that the Government's position is untenable. Without necessarily agreeing with all of the views of the free marketeers that have been expressed so ably in the debate both here and in the other place, I say that we have some doubts about the legality of the proposal, although we have been assured by Senator MacGibbon that they are not necessarily valid and that they can be cast aside. Therefore, we take the view that the Opposition will share the views of those members of the Government parties who have the courage of their convictions. Accordingly, we will be supporting the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is important to start by saying what will achieve a desired result. It is my understanding that there is general agreement that the desired result is to ensure that the matter does not go on indefinitely in the way to which reference has been made by my colleagues, Senator Withers and Senator MacGibbon. We want to know whether, after all of the steps which have been provided for in the package of legislation are taken and the Executive acts in the manner to which reference has been made, that matter will come back to the Parliament? Will the Parliament be able to debate it? Will the Parliament be able to act to ensure that one way or another the people of Australia will be able to know what is proposed in relation to the future of the domestic airline industry in Australia? What will ensure that that review will, in fact, take place? What will ensure that adequate notice is given to those who are involved in operating the airlines to enable them to have a lead time sufficient to adjust to whatever decisions are taken by the Parliament?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What it boils down to is a desire to ensure that after there has been the deregulation inquiry, after there has been the restructuring of Trans-Australia Airlines from a statutory authority to the structure of a public company, after there has been the further inquiry and consideration of the provisions of the Holcroft recommendations by, as we understand from the remarks of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) tonight, Price Waterhouse and Co.; and after there has been a chance to see how the Independent Air Fares Committee works, the matter will come back to the Parliament with an expression of view by the government of the day and with an assured opportunity for each of the Houses of parliament to express their views and to play some part in the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I have believed throughout the considerable period of some 2 1/2 years during which these matters have been discussed that if we want to achieve the results which apparently the Opposition, the Australian Democrats and every person who has spoken in this chamber would like to achieve, the first, most important and essential step is to restructure TAA from being what in effect is part of the Public Service and subject to the limitations of the fact that it does not have a financial gearing ratio which would enable it to operate commercially or a freedom from the Public Service-there are all sorts of problems such as running up a bill of $140m for superannuation during a period when the airline made about $20m profit-so that all these problems can be overcome. I think that once TAA is put onto a commercial basis-irrespective of who owns the shares-and once that structure has been ratified, we can look to a number of changes taking place automatically, as result of the impact of human nature and its competitive aspect. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I believe that the single most important step that can be taken to achieve the results which have been talked about by various senators in this chamber today is the restructuring of TAA. Considerable and understandable concern has been expressed by our colleagues from Western Australia, in both the House of Representatives and this chamber. I do not want to dwell on the history of that. I say simply that I believed that there was a way which would serve the purpose of the Western Australians who wanted to limit the period of five years. I believed that there was a way that would serve the purpose of the Government which has undertaken to give the airlines and the various other interests reasonable notice, that is, five years plus three years notice. An amendment could have been introduced which would have the effect of ensuring that after about 4 1/2 years and before five years action would have to be taken. </PARA>
<PARA> In the period in which I have been a member of this Parliament, I have never known more confusion to be created by what I would have thought was a relatively simlpe proposal. It has been called a sunset clause. It has been referred to by Sir Peter Abeles in the telex which was incorporated by Senator Chipp earlier in the debate. In a telex addressed to the Minister for Transport, Sir Peter Abeles said:</PARA>
<PARA> On your enquiry I would like to confirm to you once more that a sunset clause is not acceptable to Ansett and has never been acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA>The words I wish to emphasise follow:</PARA>
<PARA> This could enable a government of the day to let an agreement run to the last day and the uncertainty of the future could not be accepted by this company . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The telex continued. That is a total and absolute misunderstanding of what this amendment, moved by Senator MacGibbon, seeks to achieve. If it is passed, it will ensure that before the five years are completed the matter is discussed by the Parliament and that then either the Act is amended to extend the provision or, alternatively, three year's notice is given by the government of the day which, under the airlines agreement is required before it can be given the approval of both Houses of parliament. That is a matter to which I do not think anybody has adverted yet but which is rather important in a consideration of all of this matter. With all the confusion that followed because of the use of the words 'sunset clause' and the impression that was given that people wanted to drop the shutter at the end of eight years without notice, I think it is important to say what I believe, from what I have understood from the speeches I have heard, many people wish to achieve. They want some way by which the matter will be reviewed before five years so that we know what will happen, so that Parliament has a say in what will happen and so that the companies have time to know and to plan in accordance with the decision that is taken. </PARA>
<PARA> This morning, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) answered a question in the House of Representatives and used some words to which I will refer. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The report of the deregulation inquiry will plainly need to be published and debated. The Goverment will plainly need to state its views in relation to it. It will do so. </PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government will be publishing that report. We will be making a statement about it-</PARA>
<PARA>To the Parliament. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA> These are all firm commitments of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I have been told that in news services there has been some suggestion that in a discussion I had with the Prime Minister today the Prime Minister threatened me and tried to heavy me. I can only say that the relationships between the Prime Minister and me remain as they have been over quite a long period of time. Having read the answer that was given this morning, having endeavoured to clarify what the Government means and having endeavoured to clarify what was sought by the amendment, I believe that a form of words which I suggested be given as a formal, a clear, undertaking by the Government will serve the purpose of ensuring that, subject to this Government remaining in power at that time, and I have every trust and confidence that that will be so--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That prospect is one which is as remote as the Opposition's support for what I am just going to say. If there is a change of government, that will be a matter, as it would be anyway, for the government of the day, because any government can propose to the Parliament an amendment to the legislation once the day has passed on which this Parliament has approved the two-airline agreement. From the moment the two-airline agreement is passed by this Parliament nothing alters the contractual obligations. It cannot be altered by statute without incurring certain responsibilities at law. So, from the time that the principal Bill with which we are concerned is approved, there is an agreement in relation to which there is a five-year minimum and in relation to which there is a requirement for three years' notice to be given after both houses of Parliament have supported the giving of three years' notice. If the Opposition wishes to change the legislation and it happens to become the government, it will have the opportunity to do so. I have been informed that the present Government will give the following undertaking: The Government will make a statement of its views and proposed action in relation to the report of the deregulation inquiry. That statement will be made to the Parliament before 30 June 1986-in other words, five years from now-and there will be an opportunity for the Parliament to debate the matter at that time. In other words, the objective which was sought--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The undertaking will be given in this chamber by the responsible Minister. That is my understanding. If it is not, I will be surprised. I have every reason to believe that that undertaking will be given. That undertaking achieves what was sought, which was to ensure that before five years is up the results of the deregulation inquiry, the results of the further Holcroft consideration by Price Waterhouse &amp; Co and the results of the Independent Air Fares Committee's work, will be able to be brought before the Parliament with a statement as to what is proposed and debated by both Houses of Parliament and the appropriate action being taken by Parliament. I am prepared to accept that clear, specific and firm undertaking as a sufficient basis to ensure that the prospects which were sought will be achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, I refer to the fact that the honourable member for Tangney, Mr Shack, who moved a similiar amendment in the House of Representatives, apparently also had the same objective because in speaking last night he said that if the amendment was accepted:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government of the day will then be in a position to give notice after five years and consideration of the findings of the deregulation inquiry. If the Government chose to go down the deregulatory path there would be a three-year transitionary period, after which time the agreement in toto would expire at the end of eight years. </PARA>
<PARA>That position will be achieved if the Government and, I would add, the Parliament of the day four and a half years to five years hence but before 30 June 1986 so decides, and for that reason I believe that the undertaking, if given, will ensure the objective which most people sought. </PARA>

That is a factor in my decision and I make no apology for it. Queensland has a vigorous charter airline, Bush Pilots Airways Ltd, which has done much to extend the benefits of air travel to Queenslanders. I am not happy about the position that an airline such as that is placed in by the two-airline agreement. Nevertheless, tonight we are facing one of the realities of life and that is that the two-airline agreement expires on 30 June.

However, if it does not go through, we will continue with the present proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will not speak at length on the statements made by Senator Rae on the subject of the misunderstood so-called sunset clause, except to say that he has essentially stated what I think had to be known. It is unfortunate that Sir Peter Abeles of Ansett Airlines of Australia has also so muddied the water and made it difficult for people to establish their attitudes when he appears to have set certain parameters. There appears to be a 'Parliament can like it or lump it' attitude. I do not say that that is what he has meant, but that is the atmosphere which has been cast in Press reports. I have not discussed the matter with him, either singularly or in any committee, but I have read Press reports and heard other versions of things that have been said. I do not think he has conducted himself wisely for whatever purpose he wanted to achieve. I have to conclude, on the basis of words he has stated, that he does not understand what a sunset clause is. That is not helpful. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, we are faced with a decision and it is not a 'to be or not to be' decision. I shall vote against the amendment, not because I think there could not be some useful things achieved by it. But I am not prepared to let an open-ended situation go on whereby the present airlines agreement obtains. I think the proposed one is preferable. I accept the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in Parliament this morning as to the Government's intention in relation to the deregulation investigation. I accept that this is a statement of the Government's decision. I accept that the Government is genuine in setting up that inquiry and that by a combination of that inquiry and inserting the five year clause with a three year option, we can move towards a situation which is acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great difficulties of having to debate an airlines agreement, much less negotiate it, which is an enormous difficulty, is the fact that our airlines industry is in a state of considerable change. I am sure that it is the fervent hope of all of us that an inquiry into deregulation- a proper, considered inquiry-will pick up the main trends of change and will give us some guidance on what is necessary in the development of this industry in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is opposed to this amendment. I dealt with it at length in my reply to the second reading debate. I gave the reasons why the Government would oppose it. The amendment had been foreshadowed at that stage and I felt it important to set out my reasons at some length. I mentioned, of course, that the Government had been in negotiation with the company and the Commission for some time to achieve a new agreement. I said that great strides had been made in those negotiations and in the renegotiated agreement that the Government has brought before this chamber this evening for ratification and approval. The Bill provides in clause 5:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The agreement between the Commonwealth, the Commission and Ansett being the agreement a copy of which is set out in the Schedule, is approved. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what we have sought from this chamber this evening. The Government, and I think the Committee, believes that the new agreement is a vast improvement on the existing agreement. It has been achieved after long and hard bargaining and negotiations. The agreement provides for a method of termimation. This is set out in the agreement itself. It states that there is a guaranteed term of five years, and that after that time expires notice may be given by any of the parties to terminate the agreement but if the Government gives such notice, as Senator Rae has said, it has to obtain the approval of both Houses of Parliament and it has to give three years' notice. That is the nature of the agreement that we have entered into. The Government proposes to honour the agreement it has entered into as a result of these negotiations. It believes in honouring its agreements and it also believes that the agreement will achieve great benefits for the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention also the big changes that have occurred to the Government's aviation policies. The Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) in another place and I in this Senate on his behalf have made extensive reference to the Government's policies and in particular to the inquiry into the advantages and disadvantages of deregulation of the aviation industry. There has been a striking change of policy because of the long commitments that have been made by the two-airline policy by successive Liberal-National Country Party governments. The Minister and I have pointed out that we propose that the inquiry should take place over the next five years but that before that five years is completed the Committee should report and that the Government and the Parliament should be in a position to evaluate that report and to decide the direction in which the industry is to go. The Government, the Parliament and the airlines would need flexibility in making what would then be some very major new decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Senator Rae is quite right in his analysis of the amendments that have been suggested, namely, that there has been much misunderstanding about the nature of the sunset agreement. Certainly, there is a lot of misunderstanding on the part of honourable senators opposite not only about this matter but also about most other things-certainly about anything which has any legal characteristic. Undoubtedly, there are some legal difficulties in relation to the Parliament on the one hand approving this agreement and then including a clause of this sort in the same Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not arguing this question on legal grounds. I am arguing it on the grounds that the Minister who I represent has pointed out very forcibly in two debates in this Parliament-that it is the nature of the agreement, the nature of the negotiation and the fact that we have entered into an agreement which we intend to stick by. We also intend to stick by the undertaking that we give in this Parliament and elsewhere for a proper inquiry into deregulation to report before those five years are up so that all these major questions can be resolved within that period. It is a very sound assumption that we will be the government over this period of five years. It is the policy of this Government to make a statement of our views known in relation to this matter and the proposed action in relation to the report of the deregulation inquiry. That statement will be made to the Parliament before 30 June 1986 and there will be an opportunity for Parliament to debate the matter at that time. Those are very firm and solemn undertakings that we are giving as a government. Of course, they will be very firmly adhered to. For those reasons and in these circumstances I sincerely hope that the Committee will not adopt this amendment because I think its purposes are certainly achieveable without the amendment passing and on the basis of the undertaking that I have given. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak again because of the speech of Senator Rae and the reply just given by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). I wish to deal particularly with the undertaking given by the Attorney. What the amendment proposed by Senator MacGibbon does is to ensure that before the end of eight years new legislation must come back into this chamber. It is as simple as that. At the end of eight years the legislation falls to the ground. It might be argued as to whether that would be upheld in the courts but the intention of Senator MacGibbon's amendment is that before the end of eight years a new Bill must come back into this Senate, either to extend the present Bill or to have a new Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Attorney-General has just given an undertaking. I accept it as being given in good faith and that the Government will adhere to it. But what does it tell us? The only new information in it is that a statement will be made before 30 June 1986. That is the only new thing that we have learnt. On any report which the Government commissions, it makes a statement of its views and of its proposed action in relation to the report. What is new about this? There will be an opportunity for Parliament to debate the matter at that time. With respect to the Attorney and my very good friend, Senator Rae, that is what happens day after day in this Parliament. There is a specific time for reports to be brought down. Often ministerial statements are attached which give the Government's view that they will take some action, refer the matter to an interdepartmental committee or have another inquiry. A debate takes place. In effect, what is lost is the legislative power of this chamber. That is what Senator MacGibbon's amendment is all about. It is reserving the legislative right of this chamber in eight years' time. This undertaking given by the Government does not do that. There is no undertaking that the Government will introduce a Bill. There is no undertaking at all about the legislative process. There is an undertaking about the parliamentary debating process. It is no different from any other report which the Government commissions. </PARA>

Therefore, much as I am sympathetic to the appeal of my friend, Senator Rae, and whilst I accept the undertaking given by the Attorney-General, I just say 'what is new?'. There is nothing new, nothing novel about it. I repeat that the Senate will still lose its right to legislative scrutiny at the end of eight years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to say very briefly that I believe the interests of the people who are involved in short haul air travel and who are disadvantaged by the huge increase in the amount of the flag fall-and that particularly applies to northern Tasmania and Canberra residents as well as to those who would wish to be tourists visiting either area, each of which has a major tourist industry-would be well served if the Government would consider seriously, as I trust it will, the application which has been made by East-West Airlines in relation to the operation of a service between Canberra and Sydney at a rate which will not be related to sharing through flag fall charges the cost of the operation of a total national airline system with all the attendant overheads which have caused, under the current Holcroft formula, that figure to go so high. I hope that consideration will be given to permitting some regional operators to provide short haul regional operations in relation to the Canberra-Sydney route and perhaps the Melbourne-northern Tasmania route so that until the deregulation inquiry has been completed and until the survey of the recommendations of the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares has been completed and all the other things which this chanber has debated are taken into account, people will not be massively disadvantaged as they are at the moment. I therefore ask the Government to show some good faith in relation to the intentions which have been expressed, at least for a trial period or a limited period, by approving the application which has been made by East-West Airlines for provision for a special Sydney-Canberra operation in competition with the two major domestic airlines.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>STATES (TAX SHARING AND HEALTH GRANTS) BILL 1981</PARA>
<PARA> The States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Bill 1981 has two main purposes:</PARA>
<PARA> (A) To give effect to new arrangements for the payment to the States of tax sharing grants during the period 1981-82 to 1984-85; and</PARA>
<PARA> (B) To give effect to new arrangements for the payment of health grants to the States and to the Northern Territory in the same period. </PARA>
<PARA>The new arrangements for the payment of tax sharing and health grants reflect the outcome of major reviews which the Government has undertaken of the existing arrangements for assistance to the States for general revenue and health purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing tax sharing arrangements, which are authorised in the States (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act 1976, provided for a review to be undertaken prior to 30 June 1981 and the hospital cost sharing agreements with four States and the Northern Territory expire at 30 June 1981. These latter arrangements, together with certain other assistance for health purposes, have been revised so that, with the exception of payments to South Australia and Tasmania under their continuing hospital cost sharing agreements, the health grants will now have the character of general purpose payments. As such, they are appropriately included in the present Bill and, from 1983-84, they will increase each year in the same proportion as the tax sharing grants. </PARA>
<PARA> The new tax sharing arrangements have been determined by the Government after careful consideration of the views put forward by the States in a submission received last February and after consultation with the States and the Northern Territory at a Premiers Conference held on 4 May. The new health grants arrangements reflect the Government's consideration of the Jamison Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals, discussions with State Health Ministers and the outcome of the Review of Commonwealth Functions. This Bill, in short, reflects detailed consideration of the wide range of views that have been expressed on these matters. It also reflects, as I shall explain, the continued attention by the Government to the pursuit of policies which are both economically necessary and consistent with the States accepting greater responsibility for the operation and financing of State services. </PARA>
<PARA>New Tax Sharing Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> A major feature of the new tax sharing arrangements is the switch from using personal income tax to total tax as the base for purposes of calculating the tax sharing grants to both the States and the Northern Territory. A sharing of total Commonwealth tax collections provides a more equitable basis for determining the provision of general revenue assistance as it will mean that the tax sharing grants will grow at the same rate as total Commonwealth tax revenues. It will avoid possible problems in the future if there were to be changes in the mix of Commonwealth taxation. As total tax collections tend to fluctuate somewhat less than personal income tax collections, it should also help to reduce uncertainty in the year-to-year levels of grants to the States and the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Bill, total tax collections by the Commonwealth are defined by reference to those taxes set out in Schedule 1. These taxes cover over 99 per cent of total tax revenue as defined in the Budget Papers and, apart from certain minor taxes, fees and fines, the items excluded for purposes of the new arrangements cover only those taxes and charges that are effectively set aside for specific Commonwealth purposes or for the Australian Capital Territory. These exclusions are both appropriate and will simplify administration. I emphasise that the rate of growth of total tax collections as defined, which will determine the rate of growth of the tax sharing grants, will not differ to any noticeable extent from the rate of growth of total tax shown in the Budget Papers, except in circumstances where the Commonwealth imposes a special tax surcharge or rebate. In that event, as is the case under the existing personal income tax sharing arrangements, the gain or loss to Commonwealth revenue will not be counted for purposes of determining the grants. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax sharing grants will not be determined by reference to total taxation until 1982-83 as the move to a total tax base will involve a transitional year in 1981-82 in which the basic percentage of total tax collections to be provided to the States will be established. That percentage, which is expected to be about 20 per cent, will be derived by taking the States' tax sharing grants in 1981-82 as a percentage of total tax collections, as defined in 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA>Tax Sharing Grants in 1981-82</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>For 1981-82, the total tax sharing grants for the States and the Northern Territory will be calculated by increasing the 1980-81 tax sharing grant for the States and the Northern Territory combined by 9 per cent. An amount of $78.1m will then be added to take account of the transfer of certain Commonwealth functions to the States and the Northern Territory and of the population component in the formula for determining the Northern Territory's grant. The total amount payable to the States and the Northern Territory under this arrangement will thus be $6,929m, or 10.2 per cent more than in the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The distribution of this amount between the States and the Northern Territory in 1981-82 cannot be finally determined until final population figures as at December 1981 are available. That portion of the amount derived by increasing the current year's grant by 9 per cent will include special allocations to three States totalling $27m, which were decided upon at the Premiers Conference of 4 May and are set out in column 2 of Schedule 2. The distribution of the remainder of that portion will be on the same weighted population basis as for this year's grants. </PARA>
<PARA> I should emphasise that, if any changes in relativities were to be effected as a consequence of consideration of the forthcoming report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, further amending legislation would be required. As honourable senators will be aware, it is generally accepted that the general revenue grants should be distributed between the States so as to enable each State to provide government services of a standard broadly comparable with those of each other State without imposing higher rates of taxation or other charges. However, there are considerable practical and conceptual difficulties in determining the appropriate relativities. Accordingly, the Government will carefully examine the Commission's report and consult with the States before reaching a decision as to any changes in the distribution of general revenue grants and as to the arrangements which should apply after the current financial year as regards the right of states to receive special grants. </PARA>
<PARA> On present estimates, the total amount of the 1981-82 tax sharing grant payable to the Northern Territory is $315.1m. In accordance with the Commonwealth's intention that the population element in the formula in the memorandum of understanding with the Northern Territory should be fully observed, an additional sum of $5m is included over and above the Territory's share of that portion of the total tax sharing grant derived by increasing this year's grant by 9 per cent. The amount of $315.1m also includes a sum of $4.0m in respect of the transfer of Commonwealth functions to the Territory. With the concurrence of honourable senators, I incorporate in Hansard the following table which contains the latest estimates of the tax sharing grants payable to each State and the Northern Territory in 1981-82. </PARA>

<PARA>Tax Sharing Grants for 1982-83 and in Subsequent Years to 1984-85</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Following the transitional year in 1981-82, the total tax sharing grant for the States for any particular year will be determined by applying the basic percentage of total tax to collections of total tax in the previous year. The Northern Territory's grant will be determined by reference to the formula in the memorandum of understanding, but with the substitution of total tax for personal income tax. Provision for the Northern Territory's tax sharing grants for these years will be made in the annual Appropriation Bill and the Territory will continue to be eligible for special grants payable on the recommendation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of features of existing tax sharing arrangements will continue under the new arrangements. I refer, in particular, to, firstly, the retention of the right of the States and the Northern Territory to impose surcharges or give rebates of personal income tax under stage 2 of the fgederalism arrangements; secondly, the retention of the Commonwealth's right to be able to declare an increase in, or rebate of, any Commonwealth tax to be a 'Special surcharge or rebate', and hence excluded from the total tax sharing base; thirdly, the continuation of arrangements for consultation between the Commonwealth and the States and the Northern Territory on changes in Commonwealth taxation which affect the tax base; and, finally, the guarantee that the States and Northern Territory grant in any year will be not less, in money terms, than in the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA>Tax Sharing for Local Government</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided on the continuation of the existing generous arrangements whereby local government is entitled to 2 per cent of net personal income tax collections. I note that tax sharing grants to local government have been increased from 1.52 per cent of net personal income tax collections in 1976 to 1.75 per cent in November 1979 and to 2.0 per cent in May 1980. The associated Bill to amend the Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act 1976, which I will introduce shortly, is a machinery provision to enable that Act to remain in force after the States (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act 1976 has been repealed. The amendment Bill includes various definitions-presently included in the States (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act 1976-on which the Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act 1976 relies. </PARA>
<PARA> Before turning to the new health grants arrangements I should like to refer to one or two aspects of proposals made by the States to the Commonwealth in regard to the tax sharing arrangements. In particular it needs to be recognised that the States made it quite clear in their February submission that they regarded the existing arrangements, as reflected in the States (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act 1976, as unsatisfactory and requiring amendment. The main proposed change sought was for an assured minimum growth in general revenue payments. In effect, the States sought a share of the tax pool or a guarantee, whichever was the larger. </PARA>
<PARA> Acceptance of this proposal would have committed the Commonwealth to a minimum growth in general revenue grants of one per cent to 2 per cent faster than gross domestic products-that is, possibly 5 per cent to 6 per cent per annum in real terms. This would have been inconsistent not only with the need to restrain public sector expenditure but with the need to limit the Commonwealth's own expenditure commitments. </PARA>
<PARA>Health Grants</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the new health grants arrangements. As I have indicated, these are included in the present Bill because of the Governmens's decision to change the basic character of Commonwealth assistance for health from assistance specifically directed to that purpose to payments which are for general purposes but which are identifiable as health grants. The Government sees this change as a move towards ending divided control over the provision of health care services in the States and the Northern Territory and thus eliminating potential costs and inefficiencies that can be involved in such duplication. The arrangements contained in the Bill are an interim step towards full absorption of health grants into the tax sharing grants. </PARA>
<PARA> In determining the form of the health grants arrangements, the Government has been guided by two fundamental principles: Firstly, the States should assume their full constitutional responsibility for the provision of health services and should be free to determine their own priorities as to the allocation of funds for those services; and secondly, those people in the community who can afford to pay for the cost of health services they receive should do so either by way of personal payment or through health insurance; but those who cannot afford it should continue to have access to free basic health treatment. This Bill is only concerned with the Commonwealth's direct grants to the States for health purposes. It must, of course, be considered in the context of the overall revision to health care arrangements which were outlined in statements in the House by the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) and by me in this chamber on 29 April 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> For purposes of the Bill, the States and the Northern Territory are divided into two main groups, according to whether their hospital cost sharing agreements expire on 30 June 1981 or 30 June 1985. In the case of South Australia and Tasmania, whose hospital cost sharing agreements expire on 30 June 1985, the required funds will be provided under the authority of this Bill unless these States decide to terminate their agreements and join the new arrangements. Provision is made to meet this eventuality. Assistance to these two States in lieu of payments for community health and school dental programs is provided in the form of special health grants which, in 1981-82 and 1982-83, will be approximately equal to the real level of the total of such payments in 1980-81. After 1982-83, these special heath grants to South Australia and Tasmania will escalate in proportion to the appropriate previous year's increase in total taxation collections, as defined. In the case of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, there will be one grant in place of separate assistance previously provided in respect of public hospitals, community health and school dental services. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of this overall grant for 1981-82 will be determined by increasing the equivalent of 1980-81 assistance by 10 per cent and deducting from that sum 60 per cent of the Commonwealth's assessment of the capacity of each State and the Northern Territory to raise additional revenue if the States concerned were to impose charges of $80 a day for shared ward accommodation and $110 a day for private ward accommodation, $15 an outpatient occasion of service and an average cost a bed-day for compensation patients. The assessment of additional revenue raising capacities, for 1981-82, which will be determined by the Treasurer on the advice of the Minister for Health, will be made on the assumption that the specified charges should not apply before 1 September 1981 and that there would be one month's lag in the collection of revenue. Towards the end of the financial year 1981-82, there will be a reassessment to take account of any relevant revenue raising experience. In addition to these grants, there will be a further $16m provided to Queensland, for 1981-82 only, to cushion the adjustment that State would otherwise experience. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1982-83, the total health grants for these four States and the Northern Territory will be approximately the same real level as in 1980-81, less 100 per cent of the additional revenue, compared with 1980-81, which the Commonwealth consideres could be raised if the specified charges were in place. The distribution of the total derived in this manner would then be determined in the light of advice from the Commonweath Grants Commission. The terms of reference of the Grants Commission inquiry will be announced shortly. After 1982-83, the total annual health grant for these governments will increase in proportion to the increase in total tax collections in the appropriate previous year. That is, it will increase in the same way as the tax sharing grants. The Bill also provides for further possible variations to inter-state relativities after 1982-83 in the light of consideration of the report of the Grants Commission. A condition attached to health grants for those governments is that eligible pensioners and disadvantaged persons and their dependants, as assessed by the Department of Social Security, are to have free access to shared ward accommodation and services rendered in public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I emphasise that, in deciding on these new tax sharing and health arrangements, the Government has had very much in mind the urgent need to restrain the growth of public sector expenditure so as to make room for productive growth in the private sector without giving rise to inflationary pressures that could only damage the economic prospects for Australia. The Commonwealth has a recognised responsibility for economic management and the Government firmly believes that these new arrangements are in the longer term interests of the nation as a whole and of individual States. It is acknowledged that these arrangements are less generous than their predecessors. This needs to be viewed in the light of a number of factors. I mention, in particular, the generous nature of the arrangements which have applied since 1976-77, resulting in large increases in the real level of general revenue payments each year since then; the apparent rapid improvement in levels of services provided by the States in recent years, as indicated by the average increase of about 3 per cent per annum in real per capita terms in State recurrent expenditure on goods and services between 1975-76 and 1980-81; and the fact that the States have been able to reduce the burden of their taxes in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> Beyond this, it needs to be kept in mind that the relative size of the public sector has not been reduced to any extent since the large increase that occurred in the mid 1970s. The Government believes that there is scope to place greater reliance on the private sector and, in present and prospective economic circumstances, a pressing need to free resources to allow an expansion in the private sector. This view has been fundamental to economic decisions taken by the Government in recent times and will remain at the core or its economic strategy. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), in his statement to the Parliament on 30 April, observed that the Review of Commonwealth Functions has been the most significant and far reaching ministerial review of its kind ever undertaken by a Federal government. The Prime Minister announced some 350 decisions aimed at transferring to the private sector and the States functions more appropriately performed by them and rationalising functions which properly belong to the Commonwealth. The overall objective of the Review is to establish conditions under which there can be increased opportunities for all and better care for those in need. As the Prime Minister said in his statement, the immediate aim of the review was to streamline and fine down Commonwealth operations. He further said:</PARA>
<PARA> Big government concentrates power, loses perspective on its own limitations, and leaves less room for people to make their own choices. </PARA>
<PARA>The elimination of unnecessary costs of government is an essential ingredient of a sound and growing economy. And a sound and growing economy is important to all Australians and their families. The implementation of the Government's decisions arising from the Review commenced on the day of the Prime Minister's statement. Some decisions can be implemented almost overnight. Others cannot be achieved as quickly but initiating action has been taken. Positive demonstrations of the Government's determination to withdraw from inappropriate activities and streamline Commonwealth operations are already in evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to following through the decisions announced by the Prime Minister with all expedition; decisions which are in the best interests of all Australians. In reaching its conclusions, it weighed all considerations, in particular the longer term gains to the Australian community. The Government will not be swayed from the speedy implementation of the decisions. The measures contained in this Bill are part of the implementation process. The large majority of the decisions announced by the Prime Minister are being implemented by executive direction as they do not require legislation. Several amendments will become effective from the date when royal assent is given. However, some provisions will not become effective until necessary obligations are discharged or arrangements completed. </PARA>
<PARA> Further legislation may be required after more detailed reviews of some functions have been completed. Negotiations with the States are required to implement some decisions. In particular, later legislation may be needed to encompass decisions on such matters as student loans, the Curriculum Development Centre, the transfer to the South Australian Government of Australian National Railways staff and deregulation of the Australian National Railways and the Australian National Line. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall now outline the individual provisions in the Bill which give effect to decisions on each of the three major areas examined by the Review-the private sector, the States and the Commonwealth sector. </PARA>
<PARA>Transfer to Private Sector</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Bill includes provisions which enable the transfer or sale to the private sector of several activities currently undertaken by the Commonwealth. The Government's view is that activities of a commercial kind are generally best performed by the private sector, where they are open to the disciplines of competition. Not all such transfers require legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for the Capital Territory is empowered in Part II, Division 3 of the Bill to direct the Canberra Commercial Development Authority to enter into an agreement for the sale of the Belconnen Mall. Upon completion of the sale the Canberra Commercial Development Authority Ordinance 1974 will be repealed. Similarly, the Minister for the Capital Territory is empowered in Part II, Division 4 of the Bill to direct the Canberra Retail Market Trust to enter into an agreement for sale of the Canberra Retail Markets after which the Canberra Retail Markets Ordinance 1971 will be repealed. In accordance with the decision that the Australian Post Courier Service be abolished, Part III of the Bill removes from the Postal Services Act 1975 all references to that Service. </PARA>
<PARA> Part IV of the Bill deals with amendments to the Wool Industry Act 1972 to give effect to the Government's decision that the Australian Wool Testing Authority and some wool stores operated by the Australian Wool Corporation be sold. The continued issuing of test certifications and ready trade acceptance of such certification is essential to the sale of the Australian wool clip. This has influenced the legislative provisions made for the sale of the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 115 of the Bill will allow for the formation of a body corporate owned by the Australian Wool Corporation to assume the present functions of the Authority, and to facilitate its sale as a going concern to a final owner. Provision is made for the Corporation to hold an interest in the body which is the final owner to such an extent and on such terms and conditions as the Minister approves. If necessary, the Corporation may act as a guarantor for the purchaser. Certificates issued by the authority prior to its sale will retain their validity. Any certificate issued by a new testing body in which the Corporation has an interest will be a legal certificate in the same way as those presently issued. The proposed amendment to Section 76 of the principal Act will empower the Minister to direct the Corporation to dispose of land or buildings which comprise wool stores under Part VII of the Wool Industry Act where, in his opinion, these are surplus to minimum wool storage capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> Part V of the Bill will amend the Bankruptcy Act to ensure that as much as practicable of the bankruptcy trustee work that is currently being performed by the Commonwealth will be handled by the private sector. The amendments seek to create a framework in which creditors and debtors will make greater use of the facilities in the private sector for handling these matters:</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, estates with divisible assets of over $10,000 will be administered by a registered private trustee unless the Court exercising jurisdiction in bankruptcy or the Registrar in Bankruptcy is satisfied that there is no registered trustee willing to administer the estate. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, some changes are being made to ensure that the trustee is not subject to any restrictions which might impede the performance of his trustee function in a proper and businesslike manner. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, most of the statutory responsibilities currently exercised by the Official Receivers will either be considerably reduced or else transferred to the trustee of the estate (whether public or private). </PARA>
<PARA>Part XIII of this Bill provides for the Minister for Housing and Construction to enter an agreement for the sale of the business of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. The Corporation was established in 1965 to insure lenders against losses on housing loans. It has been successful in serving as a catalyst for the development of a mortgage insurance industry in Australia, with the result that three private mortgage insurers now operate in competition with HLIC. The Government has concluded that mortgage insurance can now be provided efficiently by the private sector without direct Government involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> In selling the Corporation the Government expects to see the continuation of a competitive mortgage insurance industry with the business of HLIC taken over as a going concern. Accordingly the Corporation will continue to operate on its present basis up to the time of sale. Any purchaser of the Corporation's business will be required to have the necessary strong financial backing. Sale will be subject to the understanding that the purchaser maintains the level of services now provided by the Corporation. The sale will not prejudice the interests of policy holders or those persons whose housing loans have been insured by the Corporation. The Commonwealth will stand behind the liabilities of the Corporation on insurance policies written up to the time of sale. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government acknowledges the contribution of the management and staff to the Corporation's success. It will ensure that they are treated fairly and equitably. </PARA>
<PARA>Deregulation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government's determination to remove unnecessary and ineffective regulation of industry is reflected in several components of the Bill. Part II of the Bill gives effect to the government's decision to deregulate a number of activities currently being carried on in the Australian Capital Territory. The repeal of the Architects Ordinance 1959, the Surveyors Ordinance 1967 and the Agents Ordinance 1968 will enable the professional organisations in each sphere to regulate their own affairs. The Bill will repeal the Prices Regulation Ordinance 1949 and empower the Milk Authority to determine the maximum prices for milk in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> By amending the Landlord and Tenant Ordinance 1949 the Bill will abolish the office of Rent Controller and the Fair Rents Board thereby removing fair rent control in the Australian Capital Territory. All other functions of the Rent Controller which do not relate to rent control will now be exercised by the Minister or his delegate. By repealing Part III of the Co-operative Societies Ordinance 1939 the Bill will give effect to the Government's decision to deregulate co-operative trading societies. Control of trading hours for the sale of goods will be abolished by the repeal of the Trading Hours Ordinance 1962. Other minor amendments to various Ordinances consistent with the Government's decisions are also included in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Acquisitions of shelf and shell companies are, at present, notifiable under Section 26 of the Foreign Takeovers Act. The Government has decided to exempt from notification acquisitions of shell and shelf companies. The proposed amendments in Part XII of the Bill will reduce and simplify the notification requirements for foreign investors and further improve the efficiency of the foreign investment screening process. </PARA>
<PARA> Part XVIII of the Bill repeals all Price Justification legislation, following the Government's decision to abolish the Prices Justification Tribunal. Provision is made in this part for the preparation and tabling of the final report of the operations of the Prices Justification Tribunal and for the transfer to the proposed Petroleum Products Pricing Authority of those PJT records that relate to the production or supply of petroleum products or to associated services. A separate Bill to establish a Commissioner for Petroleum Products Pricing is being introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Part XX which amends the Remuneration Tribunals Act 1973, provides that a person simultaneously holding two full time offices may at most receive only one salary and one annual allowance. This provision is included in the light of Part XIV of the Bill which would permit the holder of the full time office of Commissioner for Petroleum Products Pricing to be appointed also as the full time member of the Temporary Assistance Authority, should that be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The other purpose of Part XIV of the Bill is to amend sub-section 23(1) of the Industries Assistance Commission Act to allow the Minister to refer to the Commission matters relating to assistance to industries generally without referring to a specific industry or group of industries. This amendment is proposed as a consequence of the Government's decision to request the Commission to investigate the scope for modifying or improving the Customs by-law system. </PARA>
<PARA>Industry Assistance</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Review's approach to reducing costs on the community included identifying areas with less need for specific government initiatives to promote particular business activities. Parts X and XI of the Bill provide for the Export Expansion Grants scheme to be extended for an additional year with the grant rates being halved for the additional year and for the Export Market Development Grants scheme to be extended for an additional year. The export incentives schemes are being referred to the Industries Assistance Commission for inquiry and report by 31 December 1981. The extension of the export incentives schemes will give time for the Government, following the report of the IAC, to consider the future of the schemes and for industry to be able to take the Government's decisions into account in their export planning. Bills have been introduced earlier this sittings relating to export inspection charges for fish and dried fruit. Inspection charges will be extended in the next two years to a range of other primary products. Legislation to give effect to the reduced taxation concessions announced by the Prime Minister in his 30 April statement is being introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>Transfer to the States</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Review of Commonwealth Functions identified major programs appropriate for early transfer to the States. Such transfers are part of this Government's consistent policy of allowing the States greater freedom in deciding how they will spend their available finances. The transfer will eliminate unnecessary overlap, waste and interference in the delivery of services and programs. Part XXI of the Bill provides for the amendment of the States Grants (Urban Public Transport) Act 1978 so as to give effect to the Government's decision to terminate specific purpose assistance to the States for urban transport as from 30 June 1981. The Government takes the view that urban public transport is an area which is properly the responsibility of the States, and that henceforth it should be for State governments to determine the total amount of funds to be allocated for their urban public transport programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators may be aware that, at the Premiers Conference on 4 May 1981, the Commonwealth announced that the States' overall entitlements for 1981-82 under the tax sharing arrangements would include a special adjustment of $50m to offset the termination of specific purpose grants for urban public transport. The Bill also gives effect to the Government's decision to terminate assistance to the States for transport planning and research after the current year. Again, the Government views this as an area in which the States must bear the prime responsibility. The majority of the projects which had been funded under the program related predominantly to State and Local Government concerns. The Commonwealth will, however, continue to provide funding for the Australian Road Research Board-ARRB-and the Australian Railway Research and Development Organisation-ARRDO. Separate legislation is being introduced to give effect to the new tax sharing provisions with the States, and hospitals and related health services funding. </PARA>
<PARA>Rationalisation of Commonwealth Activities</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Other parts of the Bill deal with a range of decisions to rationalise Commonwealth Government activities. I remind honourable senators that the Government made its decisions in this area with several clear objectives in mind: Firstly, to make sure government activity does not inhibit private sector expansion; secondly, to reduce unnecessary demands on the taxpayer by cutting back on bureaucracy; and thirdly, to achieve the greatest efficiency and effectiveness possible. Part VI of the Bill is to give effect to the Government's decision to remove the options, currently available under the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971, of making compensation appeals against determinations of the Commissioner for Employers Compensation to State and Territory courts and commissions. It also transfers the present jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Tribunal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. All matters not heard or part-heard by the Compensation Tribunal at the time Part VI is proclaimed will be transferred to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal subject to appropriate transitional provisions provided in the Bill. Matters before the State and Territory courts and commissions at that time will continue to finality but no new applications for judicial review may be made after the date of commencement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for aspects of Compensation Tribunal procedures that may be more advantageous to an employee appellant than present aspects of procedures before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to apply to compensation appeals before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Thus, for instance, the time for lodging of appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in such matters will be 60 days not 28 days. The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has received from the Administrative Review Council a report concerning rights of appeal under the 1971 Act and related matters. The amending Bill is consistent with each of the Council's recommendations in relation to the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Tribunal. Part VII of the Bill provides for the amendment of the Audit Act 1901 to provide that all payments of remuneration or allowances to Commonwealth employees shall not be made in cash unless the Minister for Finance otherwise determines. However, it is expected that a few exemptions will be granted and that they will apply mainly to industrial type payrolls. </PARA>
<PARA> Part VIII of the Bill retains the Commonwealth Teaching Service but provides for the abolition of the office of Commonwealth Teaching Service Commissioner. It provides for the transfer of the functions currently performed by the Commissioner to the Department of Education, the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority and the Public Service Board. A significant factor in the decision to abolish the office of Commissioner was the reduction in his responsibility which will occur with the imminent transfer of Commonwealth Teaching Service members employed in the Northern Territory to a Northern Territory Teaching Service. The Department and the Schools Authority will be responsible for functions associated with the on-going operation of the Australian Capital Territory further education and schools systems respectively including appointments, promotions, deployment of staff and discipline. The Board will be responsible for terms and conditions of service, including the conduct of arbitral proceedings and for authorising the creation and abolition of teacher positions by the relevant authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Part IX repeals section 5 of the National Health Act thereby removing the requirement for the Director-General of Health to be a medical practitioner. This amendment would give effect to an earlier recommendation made by the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration. The proposed amendments to the Lands Acquisition Act 1955 in Part XV gives effect to the Government decision that the overseas property activities of statutory authorities be transferred to the Department of Administrative Services. The Act will apply to all overseas property acquisitions by agreement-including acquisitions by statutory authorities-in the same way as it applies to acquisitions by agreement in Australia. This will achieve a consistency of approach in the Government's property dealings and will avoid any wasteful competitive biddings between Commonwealth instrumentalities on overseas property markets. A side benefit of the amendments will be that overseas property transactions will be included in the schedules of property acquisitions provided to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Part XVI of the Bill will repeal the Legislative Drafting Institute Act of 1974, by which the Legislative Drafting Institute was created. The Institute was established for the purpose of training legislative draftsmen, mainly for the benefit of this Parliament but also to assist other countries, especially developing countries, in the training of draftsmen. Five annual training courses have been conducted by the Institute, each of about 10 to 12 persons, and a course currently in progress will terminate in November of this year. Most of the trainees have come from other countries. It is intended that, in future, training and assistance of this kind will be given in the form of on the job training, in either the Office of Parliamentary Counsel or the Legislative Drafting Division of the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Navigation Act 1912 the engagement and discharge of merchant seamen comes under the supervision of mercantile marine office superintendents. It has been decided that the present degree of supervision, which is a carry-over from earlier days when such supervision was needed in the interests of the seamen, is no longer necessary. Part XVII of the Bill therefore amends the Navigation Act to provide for the reduction of such supervision. This is being achieved mainly by amendments that will allow seamen to be left behind from their ships for legitimate reasons, such as proceeding on leave, without going through formal discharge procedures and to rejoin their ships without going through formal re-engagement procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> Part XIX amends the Preference to Australian Goods (Commonwealth Authorities) Act 1980. Its purpose is to give effect to the Government's decision that the purchasing function of the Department of Administrative Services is to be extended to encompass purchases over the Finance Regulation 52 limit of $10,000 for statutory authorities and departments. The legislation will provide a basis for a major rationalisation of Commonwealth procurement operations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) will introduce a separate Bill to provide for the amalgamation of the Australian Capital Territory Totalizator Agency Board and the Liquor and Poker Machine Licensing Boards. An amendment is being moved to the Archives Bill to provide for charging for archival storage of certain records of Commonwealth business undertakings. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The timely and efficient manner in which the Government's decisions are being implemented reflects their widespread acceptance. The measures which comprise the Bill, together with many more being implemented administratively, are a significant step towards reducing the cost of government to the community and so contributing to economic growth and the well-being of all Australians. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will give effect to some taxation measures recently announced by the Government. Included in the measures are the changes to a number of taxation concessions referred to by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on 30 April 1981 when he spoke in another place about decisions made following our Review of Commonwealth Functions. Another matter covered is the income tax rebate for contributions for basic health insurance. Also dealt with is the announcement on 29 April 1981 that there is to be half-indexation of personal income tax for 1981-82, and that that year is to be the last in which the system of tax indexation will apply. I turn to the details of each measure. </PARA>
<PARA>Reductions in Taxation Concessions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the point has been made before, but it is appropriate that I mention it again now. It is that taxation concessions are, in a practical sense, as much a call on the Budget as are direct outlays. That is true even if the effect of a concession is only to delay the collection of tax. It follows that, when Government expenditures come under review, taxation concessions are among the things that have to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> An outcome of the examination made in the course of our Review of Commonwealth Functions was a decision to reduce the value of some income tax concessions. Among the concessions to be reduced are the 20 per cent loading on depreciation rates on plant, the investment allowance and the rebate of tax that is allowable to shareholders for capital subscribed to petroleum exploration and mining companies. Also to be affected are the immediate deduction allowable for the cost of converting oil-fired or liquefied petroleum gas-fired plant to operate from alternative energy fuels and the deductions that are allowable for capital expenditure incurred on the development or operation of a mine or oil field. </PARA>
<PARA> As indicated in a statement accompanying the Prime Minister's speech on 30 April, the reduced level of each concession will generally apply in respect of expenditure incurred by a taxpayer after that day. However, expenditure incurred after 30 April 1981 under a contract entered into earlier, or in respect of work carried out by the taxpayer which was commenced earlier, will continue to qualify for the present levels of concession. The deduction for capital costs incurred by a taxpayer in converting oil-fired or LPG-fired plant to use alternative energy sources is to be allowable in equal instalments over 2 income years instead of being wholly deductible in the year in which the expenditure is made. </PARA>
<PARA> The special loading on depreciation rates for plant is to be reduced from 20 per cent to 18 per cent. The investment allowance deduction of 20 per cent is to be reduced to 18 per cent, with corresponding adjustments to the shading-in rates for plant costing less than $976. Deductions for capital expenditure incurred in the development or operation of a mining property or an oil or natural gas field are to be calculated, where appropriate, by reference to a maximum statutory life of the mine or field of six years, instead of five years. Finally, the rebate of tax available in respect of moneys paid on shares in petroleum exploration and mining companies, or to certain interposed companies, is to be reduced from 30 per cent to 27 per cent of the moneys so paid. The reduced rebate will in general apply to moneys paid by a taxpayer after 30 April 1981, but moneys paid subsequently in respect of calls made on or before 30 April 1981 on shares owned by the taxpayer at that date will retain eligibility for the present level of rebate. </PARA>
<PARA>Income Tax Rebate for Cost of Basic Health Insurance</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As foreshadowed on 29 April 1981 by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar), an income tax rebate is to be allowed for contributions paid by a taxpayer for basic hospital insurance or basic medical insurance cover. The rebate is, of course, part of the Government's new health arrangements. The new rebate will be available at the rate of 32 cents in the dollar-equivalent to the standard rate of tax-for contributions paid for basic medical or basic hospital insurance cover for the taxpayer, the spouse of the taxpayer and any children of the taxpayer or his or her spouse. It will apply to eligible contributions made on or after 1 July 1981 in respect of cover from then on. </PARA>
<PARA> This new rebate is to be quite separate from the general concessional rebate that covers various classes of private expenditure, including payments for medical and hospital expenses. Because of this a person may receive the new rebate even if he or she is not entitled to the general rebate. This means that tax savings from this concession will not depend on a taxpayer's total rebatable expenditure being more than $1,590. </PARA>
<PARA>Tax Indexation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer announced on 29 April that half tax indexation would apply for 1981-82, as indicated by the Prime Minister in the policy speech of 5 September 1980. This Bill will give effect to that announcement. The benefits to individual taxpayers from the tax reductions proposed by these amendments are significant. In total, they will amount to some $500m in respect of the 1981-82 year. In line with the practice of previous years, the indexation adjustment is based on the increase of the average consumer price index for the four quarters ended March 1981 over the average from the four quarters ended March 1980. This was 9.9 per cent. The law provides for a discounting of this percentage for the effects of the Government's oil pricing policy and the health care financing arrangements announced on 24 May 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> The discounting produces a net increase of 7.6 per cent. On this basis, half-indexation means adjustment of the personal rate scale, and dependent and related rebates, by 3.8 per cent-that is, a half-indexation factor of 1.038. Indexation of this order will have the effect that the tax threshold will change from $4,041 for 1980-81 to $4,195 for 1981-82. Subject to the first $4,195 of taxable income being tax-free, the standard rate of 32 per cent will apply to incomes up to $17,894 instead of $17,239. The 46 per cent rate will thus not apply until taxable income exceeds $17,894. The maximum rate-60 per cent-will first apply at $35,789, instead of at $34,479 as at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The increases in dependant and associated rebates due to indexation will mean, for example, that the maximum allowance for a spouse will rise from $800 to $830, and for a sole parent from $559 to $580. When allowance is made for these changes in both the rate scale and rebates, the tax free income for a person with a dependent spouse will rise from $6,541 in 1980-81 to $6,788 in 1981-82, and for a sole parent from $5,787 to $6,007. The tax reductions will be reflected in reduced pay-as-you-earn tax deductions from 1 July 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> With the concurrence of honourable senators, I incorporate in Hansard a number of tables showing the effect of the tax scale and rebate changes on tax payable for 1981-82. </PARA>

As the Treasurer indicated in his statement on 29 April 1981, the Government has decided that discretionary adjustments to the taxation rate scale and rebates are preferable to the existing tax indexation arrangements. This Bill will therefore delete from the law-as no longer necessary-the provisions under which the present system of indexation operates. In future the Government will pursue on a discretionary basis-and usually in a Budget context-its policy of reducing taxation where circumstances make it appropriate and responsible to do so.

These people, who are residents of Queensland, find it necessary, by virtue of Queensland laws, to travel interstate for this form of medical treatment as AID is not available in Queensland. Recently they received a communication from the Infertility Clinic, Medical Research Centre, Prince Henry's Hospital, advising them that there had been some changes to the medical benefits available for the treatment that is currently undertaken for AID. I seek leave to incorporate this letter in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> A very recent (mid-May) decision of the Medical Benefits Schedule Revision Committee of the Commonwealth Department of Health will bring about a major change in health insurance fund payments for artificial insemination, using donor semen. The current charge for a first insemination is $70.40 (under items 2112, 963, 2216 and 1859) and for subsequent inseminations is $52.40 (items 2112, 963 and 1859). From June 1st, 1981, the above Committee has ruled that the only item number under which a benefit is payable will be 2105 ($9.00) with the exception of the first insemination when item 2216 may also be payable ($18.00). Thus, the net amount payable by patients using the service will be $43.00 for each insemination. Usually, three to four inseminations are made in each cycle and the average number of cycles to achieve a pregnancy is three, making a total of nine to twelve inseminations and a net average cost of $387.00 to $516.00 (none of it claimable from health insurance funds). Individual patients may of course be liable for smaller or larger charges. </PARA>
<PARA> We feel that this Commonwealth Department of Health decision is highly regrettable. We wish to provide you with the following information and to make certain suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA> 1. We wish to continue to offer this service for couples unable to achieve pregnancy by other means, who elect to have this form of treatment-we recognise that such treatment is not acceptable to some couples, but is keenly sought by others. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. We can continue the service only if the charges remain similar to those currently made, as no other funds are available to pay the staff required to provide the service, nor is there any realistic possibility of such funds being made available by the State Health Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. We intend to suspend the service as from the 1st of June, 1981, until at least July the 1st, i.e. for one month, in order to bring the gravity of the situation to your attention and to take stock of the steps that we might be able to take to improve it. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That letter outlines what becomes a very substantial change in the cost position of people in this position undertaking this course. This couple have been travelling to Melbourne for this treatment for some time now. From the details they have given to me in relation to the way in which they have undertaken this treatment, they obviously have tried to do it in the cheapest possible way in terms of travel to and from Melbourne and expenses incurred along the way. For example, they indicate that by travelling non-stop by car it costs an average of $145 each way for each trip. It is necessary for these trips to be made over a period of, apparently, at least 3 months for some chance of the treatment to be successful. Even doing this by the cheapest possible means it is costing them over $1,000 after Medibank Private refunds. I emphasise that this is done in the cheapest possible way with no overnight accommodation during trips between Brisbane and Melbourne, a distance of more than 1,000 miles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because of an unfortunate cancer affliction, AID is the only option that this couple have to have children. They make the point that it seems to them that with this very particular infertility problem they have been singled out compared with patients with other medical problems. I think we would all agree that that is a serious medical problem and, for people in that position, a heartrending one and one which should be treated with the greatest possible degree of sensitivity. They believe it is the only successful alternative they have, given the husband's sterility. I do not seek to delay the Senate at all unduly tonight. I have attempted to state this matter as briefly as I can. I have given Senator Peter Baume, the Minister representing the Minister for Health, some information about it in advance. I would like to ask the Minister whether the situation of people such as these can be taken into consideration and whether, with this dramatic change in medical benefits which amounts now, as I understand it, to only the benefit of a consultation fee payable for each treatment, the Government might consider the very particular effect that this change in medical benefits can have on individuals in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I know it is not a function of medical benefits that a government should have to judge the cost of treatment of a couple living in a suburb of Melbourne versus a couple living some thousands of miles distant but who must necessarily travel to Melbourne for their treatment. This couple clearly were prepared to undertake the cost of the travel and the additional cost above the medical benefits that they held. The change in medical benefits payable has put them in an impossible position, as I am sure it has put quite a number of people. I seek the Minister's illumination of the issue, if possible, and at least an undertaking that the Government may consider the effect of this decision and its social and personal ramifications, which are very great and real indeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators are only too well aware that, whilst the Standing Orders and other rules of this place are intended to enable the full, free and fair debate of matters of concern to the people we represent, it is not unknown to use the rules available to us for less high-minded purposes. In this context, I draw attention to what I see as the rationale behind the notice of motion given to the Senate this morning by Senator Ryan for the disallowance of the Traffic (Amendment) Ordinance. I hasten to add that I do not dispute her right to give it. I do not dispute that she has followed the forms of the Senate and acted within the forms available under a statute of Parliament. Further, I am not concerned with the subject matter of the notice, for this is relevant to the point I wish to make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My concern lies rather with the use of an important and precious right of a private senator as a device to hold over to the next sittings a matter which, in my view, should have been determined within the Senate as it is presently constituted. The matter which is the subject of this notice of motion first arose during this period of sittings. The issues were debated twice. The first time was on a motion for the adjournment of the Senate and the second time was on a substantive motion to take note of a statement made in this place on behalf of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. It appears to me that propriety demands that any action sought as a result of Senate consideration should similarly be determined by the present composition of the Senate. A device is available to the Government to bring forward the subject for debate during the present sitting period. In turn, and possibly in accordance with the ways of politics, a countervailing device may become available to thwart that stratagem, and so on ad infinitum. The Government parties considered this matter and determined not to continue that course commenced by Senator Ryan this morning. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I make in this adjournment debate is that, based on an assumption-perhaps valid, I do not know-that the numbers will be there after July and conversely, that the numbers are not there at the moment, a matter which has been considered in this place already and, I might add, which has largely been overtaken by events, is deferred in the interests of politics until the next session. </PARA>

What a stunning piece of obdurate sour grapes even by Senator Lewis's own spectacular standards in that respect! He is complaining, simply, that the legislative initiative has been taken out of his and the Government's hands. What more deserving a case for taking out of the hands of the Government could this one be? The initiative has been hitherto in the Government's hands from day one. What a spectacularly insensitive performance this has been. How spectacularly insensitive to the civil liberties and rights of ordinary Australians has been the course of action so far undertaken by the Government, by the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) and by Government senators, including Senator Lewis. When one goes back to the beginning and looks to the circumstances in which the ordinance was originally promulgated, one sees it as a sneaking back stairs bit of Executive law making. It was done without reason, without foundation and, in fact, without precedent in law.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking exactly about the issue of propriety. Senator Lewis is interjecting, but I will not do him the honour, which he so contemptibly does not deserve, of having that nonsense read in the Hansard record. The point of order claims that I am not addressing myself to Senator Lewis's speech, if it can be so dignified, and that I am really discussing the substantive merits of the motion. Nothing could be further from the truth. The remarks of Senator Lewis went to the question of the propriety with which Senator Ryan had in fact acted in seeking to ensure further parliamentary consideration at a time and place of her own choosing. Nothing could be more relevant to assessing the proprieties of Senator Ryan's action than by looking by contrast to the impropriety of the Executive action and the action of Government senators which had preceded it. Perhaps, on that basis, I can proceed to continue with my remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address myself briefly to the issues of impropriety which are also evident in the behaviour of the Government and of Government members and which has led up to this episode. The impropriety began, as I said, with a sneaking back stairs bit of Executive law making which was not based on any empirical evidence of a kind that is subsequently able to be justified or ever could be justified. It resulted in a situation of overkill in the performance, perhaps understandable when given the nature of the law they were dealing with, by the law enforcement officers of the Executive. This was followed up with a further bit of Executive impropriety in the insistence upon retaining the prosecutions which were manifestly unjustified to retain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This has been followed by the further Executive impropriety of Mr Hodgman admitting, subsequently, that the ordinance had no legitimate foundation in principle, but he refused to withdraw the prosecutions. The Executive and Government misbehaviour and lack of propriety has further resulted in Government senators determining not to recommend to this chamber, notwithstanding the acknowledged breach of any reasonable standard of civilised civil liberties, that the ordinance be disallowed because they did not want to embarrass their particular Minister whom they knew to have made a fundamental error of judgment and to have misbehaved by reference to any reasonable standards of principle. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had a further demonstration tonight of the attitude of Government senators, one and all, and of their likely response if this matter did come forward into the chamber. When we add together the elements of that long litany of insensitivity, misbehaviour, and general reluctance to concede even the most fundamental standards of humanity and legal propriety in the way these people are being dealt with, the result of it all is that the course of action undertaken by Senator Ryan is no more than any responsible legislator would set in train to maximise the opportunity of a parliamentary disallowance of this indefensible Ordinance, to maximise the opportunity of the women who have been caught up and prosecuted and charged with an indefensible criminal proceeding. A situation will be created as a result of Senator Ryan's initiative whereby this Parliament can debate the matter in a calm, sane and rational atmosphere. So long as people such as the bucolic Senator Lewis and those who think and behave like him have the opportunity to express themselves in these terms. There is no prospect of justice being achieved in practice or of justice being seen to be done, or of the legislation coming out as it should, that is, removed from the statute book and not allowed to remain there in 1981. For all those reasons, it is a perfectly defensible course of action that has been set in train by Senator Ryan. It is a perfectly understandable reaction that Senator Ryan, or any reasonable legislator or any reasonable citizen witnessing the procedures of this chamber, and particularly the procedures tonight, would wish to create a situation whereby the question of the disallowance will be dealt with in a proper, calm and rational atmosphere, at some distance from the particular events which have given rise to the circumstances tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech of Senator Lewis, and I have chosen to ignore every one of his interjections because they ought not ever to be dignified in print in Hansard by being acknowledged, can only be described in the way I began by describing it, that is, as an exercise in the worst possible kind of sour grapes and a disgraceful performance on the part of any legislator who wants to claim the respect of his colleagues in this chamber, let alone of any member of the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not hold the Senate for long. I think I should respond to Senator Martin's comments on the question of artificial insemination and the case she raised of the constituent from Brisbane whose costs will be increased by a recent administrative decision. The Senate may care to reflect upon the fact that the question is really one about rebates for services, not about fees. It is really a question of charges, not of costs incurred in the medical sense. The letter the honourable senator produced sets out the situation in terms of medical benefit changes. It does set out a regrettable situation with the doctors involved in that they have indicated that they are going to withdraw their services for a month as some kind of protest against the changes. I think that for any professional group that is unfortunate. That part of the letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We intend to suspend the service as from the 1st of June, 1981, until at least July the 1st, i.e. for one month, in order to bring the gravity of the situation to your attention . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we have here a group of people who are concerned about changes in their rebates. The only persons who will suffer from their actions will be the patients, and I am a little disappointed about that. As a result of discussions by the Medical Benefits Schedule Revision Committee a ruling was given that in future artificial insemination using donor bank semen would attract the following benefits: Firstly, a consultation benefit for consultation by the medical practitioner for the woman; secondly, for each insemination by a medical practitioner, a benefit at the rate applicable to a medical consultation; and thirdly, for each mucus test performed, the benefit that would be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee to which I have referred consists of officers of the Department of Health and representatives of the Australian Medical Association. In other words, the medical profession is directly represented on the Committee in helping to work out the rebates to apply to the appropriate schedule fees. Previously the Department had given a ruling that, in respect of artificial insemination from specific donor to specific recipient, benefit was payable for the processing and freezing of the donor semen. Recently hospital units have been using this ruling for artificial insemination employing donor bank semen. The honourable senator will realise the difference between bank semen and the specific recipient-specific donor procedure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, AAH refers to the husband, but it could relate to any specific donor. The itemisation in the medical benefits schedule relates to each specific medical service. That is the way in which medical benefit rebates are constructed. In other areas where there is a question of using a substance-for instance, the processing of blood, of corneas or of bone, which do not relate to a specific medical service, no benfit is attracted. It was considered that the processing of semen should be regarded similarly. Therefore, the ruling was given that in future this processing would not attact benefits. That was the basis on which the ruling was given. The items in the schedule cover professional services rendered by medical practitioners. It is considered that the processing of blood, semen and so on is basically a technical procedure and therefore does not come within the scope of these particular forms of medical benefit. The honourable senator asked whether I would refer the situation to my colleague in view of the changes in cost to the constituents who have written to her. I will certainly refer it to my colleague and ask him to give it such further consideration as he is able.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator Messner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The quote referred to by the honourable senator comes from Appendix A6.1 of the Domestic Air Transport Policy Review which was published in 1978. In the summary of that Appendix (p. 7) it was also stated that '. . . it should be pointed out that these findings are not necessarily an indication that the airlines themselves are poorly managed or operated. . . . The appropriate conclusion to be drawn from this study is that Australia's major airline system is not technically efficient by world standards.'</PARA>
<PARA> However, the nature of Australia's domestic air services network, covering an area similar in size to the USA but with a population of only 14 million concentrated mainly on the south-eastern coast seriously affects any comparisons of technical efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA> The general thrust of the Government's domestic aviation policy since the Review has been to increase competition. The first steps taken were to re-negotiate the Airlines Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> The airlines too, have taken decisions which will increase the level of competitiveness in the industry. The most significant decision has been to acquire different front line aircraft types with TAA selecting the Airbus A300B and Ansett obtaining a range of Boeing aircraft with the B737 to be introduced in June.</PARA>
<PARA> In May 1980, the Government established the Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares which presented its Report on 16 February 1981. It was then tabled in Parliament on 25 February. The Government adopted the principles contained in its recommendations of a cost based, nationally consistent approach to air fares by the use of an air fare formula comprising a flagfall and a distance rate for the national jet network. The Government also endorsed the Inquiry's view that as wide a range of discount fares as possible be provided without increasing the burden on the full fare paying passenger.</PARA>
<PARA> Statements have been made in the Parliament recently confirming the Government's intention to establish TAA as a public company, and establish an independent fare committee to determine all domestic air fares. An inquiry into deregulation has also been announced which is expected to report within four or five years. All these initiatives are evidence of the Government's commitment to maintain a safe and efficient airline system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 8 April 1981 (Hansard, page 1206) Senator Hearn asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Transport, a question, without notice, concerning the possible effects in Tasmania of a move toward the greater use of private contractors in road building.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided me with the following information in answer to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA>
<PARA> The Roads Grants Bill 1981, which was introduced into Parliament recently by the Minister for Transport, provides that Commonwealth grants for construction works on National Roads (i.e. National Highways and declared Developmental Road projects) will be conditional upon tenders being called and dealt with in accordance with approved arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's objective is to ensure that maximum value is obtained from its very substantial outlays on National Roads which are, of course, eligible for full Commonwealth funding. The Government considers that only by the creation of a competitive environment can it be sure that this objective will be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not the Government's intention to exclude State Road Authorities and Local Authorities from carrying out National Road construction works. It has therefore been decided that State and Local Government Authorities will be free to bid for the works in competition with private contractors. Given the road construction experience which these authorities have gained over the years they should be in a good position to compete for such works.</PARA>
<PARA> The legislation will not require National Roads maintenance works to be put out to tender. Moreover, the tender requirement will not apply to any project in the Arterial Roads and Local Roads categories. It will be entirely a matter for State and Local Government Authorities to decide the method of carrying out the relevant works (i.e. by contract or day labour).</PARA>
<PARA> As some 90 per cent of total roads expenditure is on Arterial and Local Roads, considerable scope exists for the continued employment of State and Local Government day labour forces on these roads if they prove to be unsuccessful in competing with contractors for particular works on National Roads.</PARA>
<PARA> The use of contractors on roads is not a new concept and they are already widely used in most States and Territories. Overall, direct payments to the private sector account for between 50 and 70 per cent of the total value of works carried out on National Highways in most States.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport is aware that most roadworks in Tasmania are carried out by the Department of Main Roads and that a large day labour force based at Ulverstone is currently engaged on National Highway works. However, no major construction firms are at present based in the State and it should not be assumed that jobs would necessarily be lost if private contractors from interstate were successful in winning tenders for works on National Roads. For example Leighton-Candac-a Sydney-based firm-is constructing the Bowen Bridge. Apart from a small management team, the workforce engaged on the bridge was recruited from within Tasmania.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 29 April 1981 (Hansard, page 1454) Senator Cavanagh asked me as the Minister representing the Minister for Transport, a question, without notice, concerning rail fare concessions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided me with the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government announced that fringe benefits would be extended to sickness beneficiaries. However, there are considerable administrative problems involved in extending transport concessions to these beneficiaries. Indications are that the States are not prepared to extend transport concessions to sickness beneficiaries on the services operated by them, including Adelaide metropolitan services. Agreement is also required with the State systems before the concession can be granted on the majority of services operated by the Australian National Railways Commission which are over interstate routes involving State railways. The Government is currently examining the situation in the light of these difficulties.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 29 April 1981 (Hansard, page 1459) Senator MacGibbon asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Transport, a question, without notice, concerning requirements for cabin attendants in relation to airline safety requirements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided me with the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The requirement for cabin attendants is primarily related to passenger safety considerations.</PARA>
<PARA> An Air Navigation Order promulgated by the Department of Transport defines these safety requirements as applicable to Australian airlines.</PARA>
<PARA> Providing the requirements for the training of cabin attendants are complied with and the minimum specified number is carried, the Department of Transport's safety requirements are met.</PARA>
<PARA> Frequently airlines elect to carry more cabin attendants than is required by safety regulation. The duties of these additional staff are related to the provision of cabin services and as such are a matter for the commercial judgment of the operator.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the Australian National Line (ANL) loss position, and the recent industrial action of the maritime unions, as referred to by the honourable senator.</PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the two crew system would increase ANL's costs by up to some $5m a year. As ANL is required to operate along commercial lines this increased cost would need to be recovered.</PARA>
<PARA> The coasting trade is one aspect being presently examined by the joint shipowners/unions committee on the revitalisation of Australian shipping. Any recommendations which arise from that forum regarding the level of regulation will be carefully considered by Government.</PARA>
