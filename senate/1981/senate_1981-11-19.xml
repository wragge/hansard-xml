<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment. Has the Government received representation from Actors Equity and the Australian Writers' Guild on the Government's 39 per cent cut in the funding of the Australia Council since 1974? Is the Minister prepared to approach the Prime Minister with a request for a supplementary grant of $1.18m to the Australia Council? Does the Minister now understand that the failure to obtain that supplementary grant will lead to irreparable damage to the entire entertainment industry in this country and a major loss to Australia's culture? Is a major facet of Australia's culture to be sacrificed to save a mere 0.025 per cent of Budget outlays?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe Senator Childs's question is misconceived and inaccurate in its conclusions. I am not aware whether the Australian Writers' Guild or Actors Equity has made approaches to the Government, but I imagine that if they have an interest in this matter they might well have made approaches; they might well have made submissions. I can certainly find that out. The fact is that the Australia Council does a significant job in promoting the arts in Australia; it receives very considerable support from the Government; and, most importantly, it now has a new chairman, a man who is expert in management matters and who has already made his presence felt. Already he is trying to make sure that the Australia Council emerges as an even more efficient and able organisation than it has been over the years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know whether there has been a request for a further $1.18m, the figure Senator Childs mentioned. Clearly, that is a matter that would be decided in a Budget context. Any further grant for the Australia Council would be a decision for Government to take at the time of formulating a Budget. I am sure that appropriate decisions will be taken at the proper time. In the meantime, I have no doubt that the Australia Council will continue to promote the arts in Australia as it is supposed to do. I am sure that the resources it has will enable it to do this most adequately.</PARA>

In particular, I refer to the discussions the Prime Minister had with the South Australian Premier, Mr Tonkin, and the decision taken that South Australia pay this year an amount of less than $36m to discharge completely the previous Labor Government's indulgent and irresponsible debt of $79m for the South Australian Land Commission.

Although the land is worth more, it would need to be put on the market for a number of years to get that yield. Both sides agreed that the figure was an accurate and a fair valuation. There have been discussions on the period of payment. It has now been decided that $36m will be paid in this way: One payment now and two equal payments, one next year and one the year after.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YJ7">Senator MASON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, is further to the question asked by Senator Chipp last Tuesday. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the report of the Defence Sub-committee of the parliamentary Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence tabled yesterday which specifically states that three United States bases in Australia are likely to be on the list of Soviet nuclear targets? I refer, of course, to North West Cape in Western Australia, Pine Gap near Alice Springs and Nurrungar near Woomera in South Australia. I ask the Minister also whether he noted the report in today's Sydney Morning Herald which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In very careful language, it-</PARA>
<PARA>That is the report-</PARA>
<PARA>claims that if the facilities did not exist, Australia would not present any worthwhile nuclear targets.</PARA>
<PARA> The report makes nonsense of repeated Defence Department statements in the past that Australia is at nuclear risk whether the United States has facilities here or not.</PARA>
<PARA>Has the Minister noted also the Committee's comment that, while urban areas would not be seriously affected by a Soviet attack, 'airborne debris would gradually fall over the southern hemisphere'? In the light of this information, what comment has the Minister to make about the report and what action does the Government intend to take to safeguard Australia and its people and preferably the rest of the southern hemisphere from the effects of such airborne debris in the wake of a nuclear attack?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I responded to Senator Chipp's question the other day I said that the best way to safeguard the Australian people from airborne debris was to stop nuclear war entirely. I pointed out the physical situation known as the cosmic mix. Wherever in the world atomic missiles are exploded, physically there is a mix. Whereas here in Canberra at this moment from natural causes there are something like 102 millirads of exposure, there are an extra two millirads for all the atom bombs that have been exploded in the world. They have been equally mixed up in the cosmic mix.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, Labor Party senators laugh, but the Labor Party was intense when former Senator Murphy took to the World Court the question of the Mururoa Atoll explosive tests and pointed out that wherever the winds might blow the effect of those explosions would be shared equally around the world in the cosmic mix. So in fact what I am saying is in line with the evidence given by the then Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I well remember that Senator Chipp asked me a question. The answer that I gave in effect was that one has two choices-either to have defences to try to obviate war or to have no defences at all. If one is to have defences to obviate war, that is, to provide a sufficient deterrent to safeguard peace, those very defences, whatever they may be-be they installations, armament, armour or troops-will be, of course, potential targets should a potential enemy decide to embark upon war. This is precisely the situation that has always been realised, that everything--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind Senator Robertson, who is now pointing his finger, that Darwin was bombed in World War II. There were no B52s and no deterrent installations at all. Darwin was bombed because the then enemy decided that it had defensive installations and, therefore, it was vulnerable to attack. One has simply to determine what are the most effective defensive mechanisms by way of installations and defence armament to prevent war. If those installations are interesting targets should there be a war, one must take those risks.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I was asked a lengthy question in a number of parts. The fact of the matter is that a serious question demands a serious answer. My answer is that I have not read the report itself. I have read newspaper reports on this situation. I repeat that wherever one sets up in peace time installations aimed at deterring war, in the horrible event of war, whether those installations are of the type at Pine Gap or at military camps, they are likely to be the targets of retaliation, as Darwin indicated in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a supplementary question. I am appalled at the Minister's perception of airborne debris as some vague thing which is in the atmosphere. We are talking about fall-out from nuclear explosions. In the light of this clear official statement that we are subject in this country to the likelihood of nuclear attack and fall-out across the whole of the southern hemisphere, is the Minister now saying to me that the Government has no consideration whatsoever of even the most limited forms of civil defence which might begin to protect the people of this country?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, as you will have observed the supplementary question bore no relation to the initial question. I related my remarks to the question about debris and pointed out that nuclear debris and fall-out, because of the phenomenon of cosmic mix, occurs world-wide and that there can be no nuclear free zones in a world in which nuclear weapons are exploded. One should do everything that one can to deter any kind of war, either conventional or nuclear. It is in the best judgment of the free world that installations such as those at Exmouth Gulf and Pine Gap are essential to provide the best estimate of the maintenance of peace and the deterrence of war. We could put down all our defensive mechanisms and become totally exposed. That would not prevent us from the debris of nuclear war. It would probably aggravate the opportunities for such a war.</PARA></TALK.START>

There are plenty of other ways which people have open to them to pursue their quite legitimate grievances in the industrial area. They do not extend to putting up a picket line in front of a school. I think all honourable senators would want to endorse Senator Reid's concern that children in the Australian Capital Territory should not have to be put to this kind of test.

This is the way in which the market has been segmented. The advertising campaign to which the honourable senator referred was aimed at meeting Telecom's PABX sales program in parts of the market for which it has responsibility.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I think the Campbell Committee believes that it has conducted a very wide-ranging examination of the financial structure of this country. I do not think that an assumption such as that implied in Senator Watson's question should be made. The recommendations of the Campbell inquiry are very wide-ranging. Perhaps Senator Watson feels that small business should have been given greater prominence in some of the recommendations, but I think it is quite unfair to infer that the composition of the membership of the Committee limited, in that way, its examination of the financial structure or limited the recommendations that it was prepared to put to the Government. As I have said on a number of occasions, the recommendations of the Committee are under study. I am sure that, arising from that, many matters will need further examination. If there is some gap in the recommendations that have been made, perhaps Senator Watson would like to give us some information on what he would like fed into the examination of the recommendations so that the particular area that he has mentioned can have our further consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Treasurer to a recent decision of the Government with regard to income tax zone allowances. I remind her that the Northern Territory Government computed a cost of living disadvantage in Darwin of $2,600 per adult per year. On that basis both major Northern Territory parties in their submissions to the Cox Public Inquiry into Income Tax Zone Allowances supported the demand for an annual rebate of $2,500. Mr George Slater, a member of the inquiry, in his minority report recommended a restructuring of the zones, with Darwin and Mount Isa to be incorporated in a new zone B with an annual rebate of $1,500. Given that Mr Slater's recommendation was the only one to approach the recommendations of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Western Mining Corporation and the governments of Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania, and given the fact that Mr Slater expressed serious doubts about the conduct of the inquiry concerning unjustifiable time constraints, will the Minister undertake to ask the Treasurer to reconvene the inquiry to reconsider the zone allowance for these severely disadvantaged Australians?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I certainly will refer to the Treasurer the request to look further at the zone allowances, but the recommendations that came forward to the Government did receive a lot of consideration. There certainly was a minority report which also received consideration. In looking at the zone allowances it is always difficult to remove benefits that have once been enjoyed and at the same time give some recognition to the difficulties of people living in the more remote areas of Australia. We felt that the final outcome was satisfactory from the Government's viewpoint, taking into account the many difficulties and sometimes inequities that can result from it. However, I would have no hesitation in referring Senator Robertson's comments to the Treasurer. If he sees fit to review the recommendations again, I feel sure that that would be done at an appropriate time, although I would not expect that he would feel that it is appropriate immediately to do so, the Government having given as much consideration to this matter as it has in the recent past.</PARA></TALK.START>

Nevertheless, I ask: Is it a fact that the International Bauxite Association Council had a meeting in Australia in the first week of November?

Do exporters of Australian bauxite and alumina regard themselves as bound by those recommendations? Whether the answer is yes or no, will the Australian Government be using its export controls over bauxite and alumina to ensure that the recommendations of the International Bauxite Association are adhered to in order to further the North-South dialogue to which this Prime Minister is committed, in the interests of those developing countries, particularly Jamaica, which would be well served by a strengthening of the cartel-like operations of the International Bauxite Association?</PARA></TALK.START>

I think recently, on the London metal market, the price of aluminium was something in the order of $936, which is some hundreds of dollars lower than it has been in the past. That has been due to the recession brought about by high oil pricing and the consumption of foreign exchange by countries buying oil rather than trading otherwise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is Labor Party policy. It is interesting to note that the satirical comment 'That would be a great result' is derisive. Senator Lewis asked whether I am aware of these matters. I am. The trade union movement has had a very distinguished and a very respectable growth in Australia where it has concentrated, which was its original intention, upon the industrial conditions of the individual workers. This Government would support thoroughly the development and strengthening of the industrial trade union movement. Unfortunately, its leaders, both present and past, have conceived that they ought to play politics instead of looking after the individual industrial conditions of the workers. So they have perverted their principles and have misled the great majority of Australian trade unionists who are decent people wanting to get on with their jobs. They have put them in impossible positions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So, yes, I am aware of these matters. Yes, these things are perverting the principle of industrial trade unionism. In this country Federal and State governments have the sovereign responsibility and right to make political and executive decisions as to the nature of operations and the trade unions have the responsibility to look to the working conditions and the general health and welfare of their workers. Although this Government believes in decentralisation, it certainly has invited the State governments, I think at a Premiers Conference, to consider for a time an experiment in concentrating industrial powers and responsibilities in the centre in the belief that that would in fact overcome some of the disputes, such as the Kurnell dispute, which overlap.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of responsibility for children's services has arisen in informal discussions with a number of State Ministers, including the State Minister from Western Australia, without any of those discussions being in any sense definitive or getting to the point where one has been near to a decision. With respect to the Western Australian Minister, those discussions have taken place in the context of discussions on programs where there is a formal shared responsibility between the State and the Commonwealth. I refer in particular to the Family Support Services Scheme and the Youth Services Scheme, both of which involve joint State and Commonwealth action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the responsibility between the Commonwealth and the States is concerned in this area, there are a number of lines which I think would be described kindly as blurred. For example, the Family Support Services Scheme tends to go very close to some areas of State welfare responsibility and State responsibility for children and the Youth Services Scheme has certainly thrown up activities which have tended to impinge upon the direct State responsibilities in child protection. Those sorts of blurred lines give rise to difficulties because questions then tend to arise as to where responsibility will lie when a particular problem arises, whether it is the problem of young people being loose in the streets of Kings Cross or whether it is the problem of child protection generally in a society which, if not suffering a greater amount of child abuse, is certainly exposing a higher level of child abuse than we would have believed existed in the community recently.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer is yes. I have had some discussions which I would describe as being of an informal nature because they have simply been an adjunct to more formal discussions on programs where there is clearly a shared responsibility. I do not think there is anything of substance in those discussions at this stage which I can usefully expand on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recall answering a question yesterday from Senator Archer, I think, in which the issue of postage rates was raised in a particular area. I think I told Senator Archer then that the Australian Postal Commission has not raised with the Minister for Communications the question of further increases since those increases that were announced in, I think, June this year. In relation to the first part of the honourable senator's question, I have no reason to believe at this stage that further increases are imminent. Senator Townley's question really refers, I think, to the staffing consequences which might follow from the volume of activity within the Postal Commission. To obtain a detailed answer to that question the matter will have to be referred to the Minister whom I represent. I will undertake so to do.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Attorney-General seen an article in the Adelaide Sunday Mail which states that children performing nativity plays and singing Christmas carols for their parents at end-of-year concerts may be breaking the new copyright laws? Furthermore the article states that the Australian Performing Arts Council has been asking individual schools for a fee of $40 for a blanket licence. Surely this is carrying out the rules and regulations under the Copyright Act to absurd lengths besides causing undue anxiety for teachers and parents. For these reasons and because children are being and will be deprived of a wide range of educational resources, I ask the Minister whether he will seriously consider revising the new copyright laws to exempt primary, secondary and correspondence schools. In the meantime, will the Minister give and publish-free of copyright-clear guidelines for the use of all book and non-book materials in these schools?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen the article in the Adelaide Sunday Mail but I gather from what Senator Elstob says that it has something to do with a performing right, which is one aspect of copyright. He proceeded to ask questions about the problems of educational institutions in relation to the copying of audio-visual material. I know that that matter is of interest to Senator Elstob; he has asked me questions about it on other occasions. Finally he asked generally about, I assume, the photocopying by schools of books and other material. Those three matters raise entirely different issues in relation to questions of copyright. As to the first matter, which appears to me to involve a question of performing rights, I would not be prepared to make any comment on it without seeing the article to which the honourable senator referred. If the honourable senator lets me see the article or if he has some material in relation to the matter that he can give me, I will look at that and give my views, so far as I can without giving legal advice as such, which, of course, I would not wish to do in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the question of audio-visual copying for educational institutions, that is a priority matter being examined by my Department in a general review of audio-visual provisions in relation to copyright. I have made several statements about that matter and I can give the honourable senator a copy of them if he has not already seen them. I have asked for submissions from the public in relation to that matter and I am very well aware of the problem with audio-visual copying for educational purposes. I am giving it priority in that review.</PARA>
<PARA> The third question that seems to arise relates to photocopying provisions. As the Senate would be aware, the multiple photocopying provisions have come into force. I think they are, broadly, shaking down reasonably well. My Department has been closely monitoring them. I am expecting to receive a report shortly from the Department about what specific areas have given rise to problems as a result of giving effect to this new law. Again I will be looking at that with close attention to see whether there will be any need for changes to be made to this new law. A number of very important questions are raised in the honourable senator's question. At this stage I do not think I can give any further details.</PARA>

I said that the increase would be somewhere around $1 a week but that I would check the precise figure. The Budget statements indicate that the new health arrangements would add about three-quarters of a percentage point and that the indirect taxes announced in the Budget would add another three-quarters of a percentage point to the overall increase in the CPI. The combined effect of 1 1/2 per cent will automatically flow through to pension rates.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 10 November 1981 Senator Childs asked me a question without notice concerning the Homes Savings Grant Scheme. The Minister for Housing and Construction has confirmed that the Government is currently reviewing the problems of access to home ownership and the impact on home buyers of recent changes in the availability of housing finance, interest rates and house prices. This review will include the identification of the groups in the population most affected by the changes and an assessment of the possible ways of assisting these groups. It will also include an assessment of the effectiveness of current assistance schemes, including the Homes Savings Grant Scheme. Changes to current arrangements, if any, cannot be considered until all options have been closely examined. I cannot, therefore, comment on possible changes to the Homes Savings Grant Scheme or the possible introduction of a mortgage interest tax deductibility scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can, however, confirm that in 1981-82 the Government allocated $74m to the Homes Savings Grant Scheme. This scheme, since its introduction in 1964, has assisted more than 560,000 householders to buy or build their first home. Benefits to eligible first home buyers include a grant of up to $2,000, an additional bonus of $500 for families with one dependent child and $1,000 for those with two or more dependent children. The allocation of $74m to this scheme was not made at the expense of funding for welfare housing. In 1981-82 the Commonwealth is providing a total of $262.2m to the States and the Northern Territory, including $50m in untied grant funds under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. Untied grants and advances are distributed by each State for rental housing and home purchase assistance according to the priorities of that State. Commonwealth funds are supplemented by internally generated funds resulting from the operations of rental and home purchase assistance programs, and also by funds allocated by the States themselves. Also, in recent years the States have received increased general purpose funds from the Commonwealth which they can direct to welfare housing where it is recognised by them as an area of priority.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>My remarks on this matter will be fairly brief because I will be speaking not to the report itself, which I have not read, but to the topic. I apologise for not speaking more fully but the honourable senator who was to have moved the motion to take note of this paper is not here today, otherwise the report would have been given the treatment which it merits. I would like to make a few brief comments before seeking leave to continue my remarks. I remind honourable senators of the comments of the consultants on clause 2 (1) of the terms of reference, as set out on page 4 of their report. They state:</PARA>
<PARA> In our view, the contents of that sub-clause make it desirable that we indicate against any recommendation where it relates to any of the following:</PARA>
<PARA> administrative overlap or duplication</PARA>
<PARA> legal overlapping or duplication</PARA>
<PARA> inherent legal problems</PARA>
<PARA> policy</PARA>
<PARA> incidental matters. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason the report was commissioned is dealt with on page 5, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> In the first report of the Uranium Advisory Council in 1979, reference was made to 'the proliferation of relevant laws and regulations at a Federal and State level, with the attendant prospect of conflict and confusion'. </PARA>
<PARA>It is understandable that in the interim period as the Northern Territory moves from control by Canberra through to its own self-government there will be some sort of overlap and some sort of duplication. It is understandable also, I feel, that the Northern Territory Government wishes to control all the activities in the Northern Territory. To make a comparison by looking back to Aboriginal land rights and to the wish of the Northern Territory to control national parks, in both of these areas the Federal Government has indicated that it has certain wishes and the Northern Territory Government has come out quite strongly to say that the Federal Government has no responsibility in this area; it should be the responsibility of the Northern Territory Government. There are many people in the Northern Territory who would support the Federal view that there is room for a Federal presence at present. They fear control by the Northern Territory Government at present on two grounds, I think: Basically because of its association with big business and that decisions will be made because of that association; and they also fear the 'develop at all costs' syndrome. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I compare the situation of uranium mining with that of land rights. There was a clear decision by the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory that the Federal Government should retain responsibility. That was indicated clearly when the Joint Select Committee on Aboriginal Land Rights in the Northern Territory went around examining the matter. It has been indicated clearly by statements that the Aboriginal people have since made through their Northern Land Council, the Central Land Council and other bodies. I believe that the report we are looking at today on uranium, the matter of land rights and the matter of the Kakadu National Park are all interwoven. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt at all that we do need clear laws. We can see from the report that there is a multiplicity of laws. It is quite clear that the group which undertook the inquiry has defined a number of areas in which there is duplication and overlap. We also need to define very clearly the responsibility for the setting up of the laws, the establishment of the laws and then their implementation. I come down clearly at this stage on the side of the Federal Government. I believe that the development of the national park, the problems associated with land rights and the situation concerning uranium, at this stage anyway, ought to be the responsibility of the Federal Government. I do not think I need go into the arguments on this. We can canvass these at another time. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, I am very pleased to see that this report has been brought down. I am happy to be able to state the point of view from this side of the chamber that it should be a Federal responsibility. I believe that this view is shared by the majority of the people in the Northern Territory. I look forward to giving greater study to the report and at a later stage making a more detailed comment. Because of that, I seek leave to continue my remarks. </PARA>

In the letter of the Chairman of the Commission to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) there are a number of interesting statements. The first is that the Government provided a sum of $8.6m in order that the Australian Tourist Commission could arrange a program of overseas marketing for 1980-81 and that that marketing program was essentially successful in that it maintained the same real level of marketing activities as had occurred with the $8m Budget for 1979-80. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> The high growth rate in visitor arrivals stemming from 1977-78 continued in 1980. But for 1980 short-term visitors totalled 904,558-up 14% on the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA>The report provides a number of charts and figures which are particularly interesting to those of us who live in non-eastern States. Visitor figures are listed on page 8 of the report. As I have said, over the last three or four years the ATC has been particularly successful in increasing the number of overseas visitors to Australia. However, if we turn to a table on page 22 of the report we find that the length of stay of visitors in 1980 was, in the majority of cases, less than three weeks. Given the size of Australia, I suggest that all that would do is give those visitors-the majority of the 900,000-odd people who visit this country-the opportunity to visit only the eastern States; that is, they would fly into one of the international airports on the eastern seaboard, work their way up or down that seaboard and then disappear across to Christchurch or go back home, leaving the greatest part of Australia unexplored by them. This is borne out by the fact that only $331,247 of the $8.6m that the Government provides to the ATC is devoted to domestic tourism promotions. This amount is hardly substantial enough to divert any of those 900,000 people to the major part of the country and encourage them to go further into Australia than just Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. Their problems are made worse by the fact that, typically, the Commission has offices only in Sydney and Melbourne, which gives the other capital cities in Australia very little opportunity to press for increased marketing of their States. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggested in 1978 that we should go back to the position that obtained in 1974 when the Australian Labor Party was in government and domestic tourism marketing was a substantial part of the role of the Australian Tourist Commission. It is essential for the non-eastern States that the Australian Tourist Commission takes a much larger role in marketing domestic tourism-that, of course, would require an increase in funding-or that a domestic tourist commission be established. Frankly, I would prefer the latter. At the moment tourist facilities in Australia are distributed almost randomly around the country; certainly, they are scattered around the country. No attempt of a serious sort appears to have been made by the Federal and State governments and industries to co-ordinate visitors in this country and the travel of those visitors across the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, in the annual report the Australian Tourist Commission points out that it is funding a visitor travel program which incorporates industry input. It seems to me that a domestic tourist commission would be in a far better position, having domestic tourism as its main, in fact only role, to co-ordinate tourism with the States and industry. In fact, I suggest as a start that it could well consider introducing an air travel package of the sort that applies already in most overseas countries. Visitors who come to this country would then pay a small amount of money which would entitle them to travel anywhere in the country for a specified period. The revoltingly high air fares that affect this country-particularly those applicable between Perth and Adelaide-are an extremely inhibiting factor for any overseas visitor who intends travelling across the country rather than simply staying in Brisbane, Melbourne or Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> It would not hurt either if a domestic tourist commission set up, it is hoped by this Government, could suggest the upgrading of regional airports in Australia so that high tourist orientated areas such as the south-east of South Australia had something to offer people immediately they came into the area. As I said either earlier this week or late last week, the south-east of South Australia is rather offputting to visitors who arrive and see the appalling facilities that are provided at Mount Gambier's airport. This is particularly so in view of the rather luxurious accommodation that is provided at Hamilton in the district of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). </PARA>
<PARA> The report sets out quite adequately what the ATC is doing to encourage overseas visitors. It sets out very inadequately what it is doing to encourage Australians to visit other parts of Australia. Page 16 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> While the Commission's principal marketing efforts are of necessity concentrated abroad there was continuing activity on the home front. Two major programmes-the Make Friends for Australia campaign and the Holiday Australia promotion-both continued during 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Recent research indicates the campaign is unobtrusively effective. International Visitor Survey figures showed that no fewer than 11 per cent-</PARA>
<PARA>Hardly a vast number-</PARA>
<PARA>of international visitors to Australia were at least partly inspired to visit because of previous contact with Australians overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Holiday Australia promotion over two years was designed to stimulate Australians to see more of their own country. It was launched with a 32-page self-contained lift-out published in the Australian Women's Weekly. </PARA>
<PARA>I know that magazine has a large circulation but I wonder how effective it is as a means of promoting Australian tourism. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the original circulation a further 1 1/4 million run-on copies of the booklet were distributed to the public through the trade. </PARA>
<PARA> The promotion was well supported by industry and deemed successful. </PARA>
<PARA>No statistics are supplied in this report to substantiate that comment of the ATC. I go back to what I said earlier: It is well past the time when either funding for the Australian Tourist Commission to conduct domestic tourist research and development programs should have been initiated or a domestic tourist commission should have been established by the Government with the sole role of co-ordinating and developing the Australian tourist market within Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This report contains extracts from the annual report of the Australian Postal Commission. In a curious way this report from Australia Post might be regarded as a success for the Fraser Government because, for a government with a stated commitment to downgrading Australia's public enterprises, it must come as something of a triumph for government policy to learn that Australia Post, one of Australia's biggest public enterprises, has recorded its first loss since its creation as a commission. The loss for Australia Post in this year was $12.7m. In fact, Australia Post has always sought to operate at close to break-even point. Last year the Commission made an operating surplus of $11.7m. As the report notes, if those figures were taken into account and averaged out over the two years 1979-80 and 1980-81 Australia Post would have broken even. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, Australia Post cannot offset this year's loss against last year's gain because last year the Government took Australia Post's profits from it to repay a loan. Australia Post had intended to continue to pay interest on that loan because, like a number of other public enterprises under attack from this Government, it has been starved of capital. Not only is the Government winding down the availability of credit for Government enterprises such as Telecom Australia and infrastructure programs, but also it is taking money away from such instrumentalities when they are least able to afford it. To add insult to injury, the Commonwealth has raised interest repayments on outstanding loans from the Commonwealth thus starving Australia Post for capital even further. This attitude to the interest repayments of Australia Post is in stark contrast, of course, to the fixed term loans arranged for National Country Party Ministers such as Mr Anthony and Mr Nixon. The result for Australia Post is that it is forced to abandon substantial elements of its capital works program or, alternatively, to finance those elements by increasing charges. This is an issue which Senator Townley is diligent in pursuit of but apparently he is in ignorance of the reasons for the possible increase in charges about which he talks. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia Post has already increased its charges. In July, standard charges rose by 9 per cent. Priority paid charges grew by 43 per cent. Registered publication rates rose by an average of 23 per cent this year. Private box levies have increased by 20 per cent. Christmas card postage will rise by 20 per cent. This report from Australia Post makes it quite clear that further rises are inevitable in the near future as a result of Fraser Government policies. There is no other explanation of rises further to those which the Commission might normally seek. In addition, as I pointed out, Australia Post is being forced to run down its capital development. The effect of Australia Post's running down its capital development is two-fold. Firstly, Australia Post, like Telecom and other statutory authorities, redirects the profits it generates from city postal routes towards the less profitable areas in the country. Any running down of internal financing directly prejudices country areas because the funds are simply unavailable to cross-subsidise country deliveries. </PARA>
<PARA>The resultant winding down of country services is already in evidence. It is a matter in respect of which I thought the National Country Party might have had some interest. Indeed, some concern was expressed at the last conference of the National Country Party, held a week or so ago, when for the first time delegates to a National Country Party conference seemed to be aware that the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair), far from being one of their leaders, might be just pulling their noses. It is important that that issue be brought more and more into the minds of people in the non-metropolitan regions of Australia because that process is going on and on under the administration of the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I said that it would mean the end, inevitably, of the level of cross subsidy which Australia Post now provides. But the other danger of reduced internal finance is that programs which will cost more in the short term but which will contribute to efficiency in the long term just cannot go ahead. What we are seeing in this is the classic political trade off which the Fraser Government continually makes whereby, for short term political or ideological gain, something is done which will prejudice the country in the long term. This is a Government whose view of the long term extends no further than the next election. That is a tragedy for organisations such as Australia Post and its clients, the people of Australia. What better example of this is there than the termination of Australia Post Courier services. The annual report of Australia Post states this about its Courier Service:</PARA>
<PARA> During the year Australia Post Courier achieved further business growth and maintained its position in the highly competitive courier market. </PARA>
<PARA> The Courier network was further expanded during 1980-81 to encompass a total of 41 centres, including bases in all State capitals, Canberra, Darwin, Gold Coast, Launceston, Newcastle and Wollongong. </PARA>
<PARA> At its peak in May there were 333 vehicles in the Courier fleet and 286 Courier drivers. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the decisions of the Committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions,-</PARA>
<PARA>That is the razor gang-</PARA>
<PARA> Australia Post Courier was abolished on 30 June 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a report of the Commission drawing attention to the profitability and success of the Australia Post Courier service and a decision, presumably based on dislike of success in government instrumentalities, to abolish that Courier service. That decision was made in April of this year and became effective on 30 June 1981. The position is that, as with Videotex and a number of other communications decisions, completely irrational decisions are made, based on ideology and the need to do favours to particular sections of the business community. Mr Sinclair prevented the implementation of an Australia Post decision which would have meant that in a few years millions of dollars could have been ploughed back into country postal services in Australia. The abolition of the Courier service is just an example of that sort of decision. The report talks of:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the uncertain effects on its finances of changes in its operations, following the decisions of the Government as a result of the Review of Commonwealth Functions. </PARA>
<PARA>It is talking about the chaos created by ad hoc razor gang decisions handed down from on high. All these things affect the efficiency of Australia Post. As I said, the National Country Party conference expressed its concern at a number of these decisions. Even the National Country Party conference is beginning to wake up to the fact that this Government, day by day, is making decisions in relation to Australian Government instrumentalities which are damaging to the interests of country dwellers. The Federal Government is ushering in a new era of public administration in Australia whereby public investment is shunned and private investment is imagined to be uniquely productive. The Government is bringing that approach to Australia Post, Telecom Australia, the Australian Broadcasting Commission and other public instrumentalities, all of which provide extraordinarily good services for non-metropolitan dwellers throughout Australia. The results of these actions will be to push up charges and to depress the standards of service, particularly in the country. In the meantime, the Government continues to talk. Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In speaking to this motion, I am very pleased to note that the agriculture Ministers from every State at this meeting in Darwin expressed some concern about the amount of foreign investment in rural land in Australia. I think every honourable senator would have had some correspondence from local councils expressing concern on this matter. I have had correspondence, in particular, from the Corporation of the City of Mount Gambier, which has expressed concern that some of that very fine land in the south east of South Australia could fall into the hands of foreign owners. I hope that the Government, in its wisdom, brings in some very strict regulations to prevent foreign ownership of Australia's best agricultural land. Although we have very extensive trading arrangements with Japan, no Australian could go to Japan and buy land in that country. I doubt whether he could go to any other country and buy land. Yet because of the strength of the dollar, and the profits some people expect to make backed by the Government, the Goverment allows foreign people to come to this country and buy some of our best agricultural land. I am very pleased that this matter has been discussed at the meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council. I look forward to very strict guidelines being introduced which will place strictures on those people buying land in Australia, particularly in the south-east portion of the State in which I live. As I said, concern has been expressed to me, through the clerk of the Council, Mr Johnson, that some of the best land in that area could fall into the hands of foreign owners. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I wish to mention and to which reference is also made in this report, is the discussion which was held on the export of live sheep from Australia. This concerns many people, particularly from the cruelty angle. That is the angle to which I will refer today. I was very interested to see in the House of Representatives Hansard of Tuesday of this week an answer given by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) to a question asked by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) which related to the deaths of sheep on the ship Persia during a trip from Australia to Egypt in September 1981. That is only several months ago. Mr Nixon said that on that particular trip, 8,764 sheep perished. He went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The Persia completed loading of 49,500 sheep on 1 September 1981. On 4 September the ventilation system was out of action for 35 minutes and 266 sheep died. On 8 September the ventilation system was out of action for 5 3/4 hours and 1,003 sheep died. Both periods of non ventilation were caused by a breakdown in the electrical switching system. </PARA>
<PARA> Following these two ventilation failures the main engines had to be run at reduced capacity due to a crack developing in a cylinder head liner. This resulted in a reduction in production of drinking water. The ship altered course and called at Aden to take on additional water. There were 6,028 deaths attributable to this water shortage. </PARA>
<PARA> The other 1,495 deaths were due to other miscellaneous causes. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is a cause for very great concern that we are allowing live sheep to be exported from this country when in one shipment 8,764 of those animals perished. Most Australians have a great concern for the welfare of not only the human race but also dumb animals. Some of these ships are like great floating hotels. They are passenger ships which have been converted to live sheep carrying vessels. It is a disgrace that this is allowed to happen. This is something which the Opposition will be pursuing to see that the Government brings in some very strict regulations. I had to raise the matter here some time ago about the cruelty which is inflicted on live horses being shipped to Japan, but that is another matter. We do have some regulations insofar as shipping goes, but my understanding is that no regulations exist for transporting live horses by aircraft to Japan. Recently inspectors from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals were not allowed to inspect an aircraft at Tullamarine in order to examine the conditions under which the horses were being transported. We have a lot of matters to look at in this country in the treatment of dumb animals. I hope that the Government will take some cognisance of the complaints that have been made by Senator Mulvihill and myself in this Parliament over a period. It is high time that these practices ceased. There is more to having a very good life than just making money. One has also to give due concern to the ill treatment of animals. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter to which I will refer briefly in the time that is available to me is that portion of the report which relates to the egg industry marketing arrangements. I notice that one matter which came up for discussion-it was proposed by the Victorian Government-concerned an increase from 20 to 1,000 in the size of hen flocks which are exempted from the provision of the Poultry Industry Levy Act 1965-79. I am very pleased that the Council was advised by the representatives from Victoria that the Victorian industry did not support that proposal. I am sure that the industry Australia-wide would not support that proposal. The limit of 20 hens is put there for a very good purpose. It is to allow back yarders or home producers to produce their own eggs without having any detrimental effect on orderly marketing in Australia. Having been a poultry farmer I am well aware that a good poultry farmer, if he looked after his poultry properly, could hope to get a production of 14 dozen eggs a year from any one fowl over the age of six months. Of course, we know that fowls start laying in many cases, long before they are six months old. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to confine my remarks to the production of hens which are over six months old. A hen has to be over six months old before the levy is payable. If one multiplies that 14 dozen by 12 one gets a figure of 168 eggs from each hen. If one multiplies that by 20, which is the allowable amount, one gets the figure of 3,360 eggs. If one divides into that figure the number of days in any one year one will come up with a round figure of nine eggs a day that a housholder can produce without having to pay a levy. In my view, that is ample. No householder would use any more than nine eggs a day over the whole year. That is a nominal figure only because, as I have said, eggs would be produced by those laying fowls before they attained the age of six months. That is a matter which I am very pleased was not agreed to by the Australian Agricultural Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter which concerns me is that the Agricultural Council has now agreed to lift the hen quota in the Australian Capital Territory from 150,000 to 200,000. I notice that the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) sent a telegraphic assurance to the Council that the new quota would be strictly enforced. I hope that we can take some solace from that and that he will enforce it. In the past it has not been enforced in the Australian Capital Territory. There have been many prosecutions against a massive poultry unit in the Australian Capital Territory which is known as Bartters. The fines which were imposed were very minimal. It is stated in the resolutions that the Council agreed that the additional quota be negotiable and that the Council of Egg Marketing Authorities of Australia be asked to examine and advise on a mechanism of payment for any additional State or Territory quotas sought in the future. I am concerned now as to whether the extra quota will be handed over to Mr Bartter and that he will increase his monopoly in the Australian Capital Territory. If one does a swift analysis of the figures which I have mentioned one will find that 200,000 hens and a population in the Australian Capital Territory of somewhere around 200,000 more eggs will be produced that can be consumed in the Australian Capital Territory, so the eggs will continue to be exported to Victoria and New South Wales to the detriment of the commercial egg producers in those two States. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few seconds that remain, I place on record the appreciation of the poultry industry of Mr Norm Mair, a business manager in South Australia, who gave many years of loyal service to the Australian Egg Board. His services will be missed. As a person who was poultry farming when Mr Mair was with the Hall Sandford company, I can say that he did a magnificent job on behalf of the egg industry in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite the Government's best efforts to limit the capacity of its consultative bodies to reflect the needs of the community, its policies have been very sharply criticised by its National Women's Advisory Council. As usual, it has managed to ignore these criticisms and pursue its own agenda to the disadvantage of women and those dependent upon them. This comparatively conservative government-appointed body, which contains senior members of the Government parties, has produced a list of recommendations which show a sensitivity to community needs that is far in excess of the policies and practices of the Government. For example, in a section on women's refuges, its report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Council believes that women's refuges provide essential services to women and their children who are victims of domestic violence. </PARA>
<PARA>The Council is most concerned that the new arrangements will force refuges in all States and Territories to compete with established and well-organised lobby groups in the health care system for a share of available funds. The recommendation of the Council on this matter is to urge the Government to reconsider its decision on women's refuges in order to safeguard the financial viability of this service, which is of inestimable value to women and children in crisis. I would like to add to that a very heartfelt 'Amen' from the women of the far-flung and less progressive States of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Other recommendations include the raising of family allowances for all children, not just for less than a quarter of the children of Australia and the indexing of those allowances; more financial support for full-time careers; and disability allowances to compensate the disabled, both those who work as well as those who do not, for costs incurred. In the International Year of Disabled Persons the Government has done pathetically little for disabled women. The report also recommends special measures for single parents. It puts emphasis on the Office of Child Care and the Children's Services Program as deserving priority in meeting the needs of women. This has been emphasised throughout the recommendations and is clearly seen as vital, yet at present there are proposals which would destroy the essence of this program under the excuse, as the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) put it yesterday, of rationing resources. Also, the Minister has avoided answering the question whether he will retain the Office of Child Care as a combined policy and subsidy division. </PARA>
<PARA> The report contains 91 sensible, reasonable recommendations. However, I must express my concern at the Government's apparent indifference to the issue raised by the Council and its failure to develop an Australian plan of action for the balance of this United Nations Decade for Women. I remind the Senate that the decade has only another four years to go. It is now over a year since the delegation in Copenhagen was forced to vote against the international plan of action on the flimsy excuse of verbal hairsplitting. It is over a year since Australia signed the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women. The Government has not yet produced, let alone endorsed, a plan of action for Australia to show its good will. Instead, appendix 15 of this report contains a recommended plan developed by the National Women's Advisory Council but, as far as I am aware, it has not yet been accepted, endorsed or apparently even been of concern to the Minister. In fact, it is without status. </PARA>
<PARA> A quick glance at this Australian program recommended by the Advisory Council shows that it certainly could be of benefit to Australia as a whole and to women in particular. It covers employment, health, education, training, child care, country women, migrant women, lone parents and a range of other issues. These relate to many groups in society who are disadvantaged because of age, youth, physical disabilities or lack of access to paid work. As such, it is important to all Australians that the Government develop its own plan of action and, after appropriate consultations, implement this to the advantage of and justice for all. One part of the report which especially appeals to me is that relating to occupational health and women. I refer to chapter 7. This chapter refers particularly to the lack of data and research on the particular problem of women and work-caused disease and injury. This is a problem of which the National Health and Medical Research Council has been aware since 1978 when the matter was raised by a joint working party on the health of working women. The recommendation from the National Women's Advisory Council on this issue states:</PARA>
<PARA> It was agreed that inadequate occupational health statistics disaggregated by sex make it imperative that baseline statistics be collected and analysed to provide uniform nation-wide data on all aspects relating to the occupational health status of women. </PARA>
<PARA>Speaking from my own experience as a trade union official over the last few years, I can certainly endorse the need for that information to be collected. The recommendations arising on the subject of the occupational health needs of women were obtained as a result of an excellent seminar conducted by the National Women's Advisory Council in May of this year. It appears to me that this type of seminar has a value way in excess of the actual funds which are spent on setting up such meetings. It is a source of great disappointment that the funding for the National Women's Advisory Council for this current year is somewhat less than it was previously. The cuts in expenditure are at the expense of seminars such as the one to which I referred and publications. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the National Women's Advisory Council is one of the government authorities which provides the best value, dollar for dollar, that we are likely to see in this nation. Every dollar is at a special value when we consider the decades of neglect of most of these subjects of particular significance to women and which the Advisory Council deals with so efficiently. I congratulate the Council on this report. I sincerely hope that this council is enabled by the Government to continue to function at the level of excellence to which we have become accustomed. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to congratulate Industrial Relations Bureau officers for their titanic efforts in detecting a massive increase in the exposure of underpayment of wages. I do so in a qualified way because as a trade unionist naturally I am on the side of the worker who has been denied his rights. I think any trade unionist knows that some people who have gone to the IRB for redress have often been reluctant to join a trade union. Frankly, it makes the job of the IRB officials a lot harder sometimes. When settlements are achieved some of these people are found to be super-militants. In effect, protracted trade union negotiations, much less arbitration hearings, have achieved the wage standards that they were seeking to obtain. </PARA>
<PARA> For all that, I know we are at a stage when it can be seen that the IRB-I do not know whether it will revert to the name of the Commonwealth Arbitration Inspectorate or some other name-has a very vital role to play in the future. The pattern of our work force today is that with so many part time workers-that has its good and bad sides-it is very difficult at times for unions to organise effectively. When one notes that the monetary recoveries have increased from $700,000 last year to $1,290,000 this year I think that speaks volumes for the dedication of the officers concerned. I suppose they have to walk on a tight-rope at times. I say to them that it is a job well done. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer specifically to page 7, paragraph 2.27, which indicates that an innovation has been developed. A list has been compiled showing the cases where money has been secured but it is not possible to locate the people concerned. That is not surprising because of the migratory trends in the work force. I know that several years ago I made a spot inquiry at Port Hedland about money owed and found that people had moved on without collecting what was due to them. By what is indicated in paragraph 2.27 the IRB has taken a step forward in that it has inserted in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette the list of people with money being held for them. In addition, an appendix to this report gives the list of people. At the Estimates Committee hearings of the Department of Industrial Relations I suggested that perhaps we can improve on this in a number of ways. The Government Gazette could at least be syndicated to major ethnic newspapers. With a quick glance at the list of people one could pick some people of origin from some European countries and others would probably be Australian born. We might be able to locate some of these people. Although in modern day terms it might not be a lot of money owed to people in the Australian work force, for people moving around in search for employment, any amount in excess of $50 that was owed to them would be regarded as manna from heaven. </PARA>
<PARA> In welcoming this innovation I say that I believe the Minister might take on board two suggestions. Firstly, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs might supply honourable senators interested in industrial relations with the relevant Commonwealth of Australia Gazette or, secondly, the Minister might go even further and syndicate the information to the major ethnic newspapers. I have in mind La Fiamma, Nova Doba, the Hellenic Herald and possibly the Spanish Weekly. In that way we would pick up most of the people of non-Anglo-Saxon origin. This is a matter that should be pursued. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>I have not really had time to study the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Button) may have a few words to say on that matter. However, I would like to make an observation. Looking through the Act-I am sure that my leader will go into it a bit more deeply-I see that sections 52 and 53 deal with safety. (Quorum formed). I was a bit disappointed to see that this inquiry has not investigated safety. After all, accidents in industry are one of the prime reasons that so many working hours are lost in this country. One-third of total working hours are lost through industrial disputes and the other two-thirds through industrial accidents. Naturally, I was hoping to see more on safety in the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks after I have an opportunity to study the report further. </PARA>

<PARA>From looking at the paper I note that it is only a financial statement which appears under the heading 'Australian National Railways Commission', and the address given is Norwich Centre, 55 King William Rd., North Adelaide, South Australia. The financial statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA> An annual report covering the whole of the activities of the Commission is being prepared and will be submitted as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>That means that we will not be able to examine that report until we come back in about the middle of February. It is interesting to note that this financial statement appears under the title 'Australian National Railways Commission'. I have complained before in this Parliament about the word 'Railways' being dropped from the name. The organisation is now known as 'Australian National'. That is very confusing to many people. I raised this matter at some length on 28 May 1981 in the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the honourable senator that good things come to those who wait but, unfortunately, some members of the Opposition in the Senate have to wait much longer than others. It does not say much for the efficiency of the Australian Railways Commission that it takes six months to provide answers to questions I posed. As the answer has not been incorporated in Hansard, I will read it so that people who are interested know what was the answer to my question. Senator Carrick stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided me with the following information in answer to your question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian National Railways Commission-the corporate name for the authority responsible for the operation and management of the Australian National Railways-has adopted the trading title of Australian National as part of its new corporate identity. The decision to adopt the new trading name was made on commercial grounds and the Commission believes that the introduction of the new identity will help in its overall strategy of achieving profitability. </PARA>
<PARA>This certainly has not helped the Commission to achieve efficiency as it took six months to give me an answer. The Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore ANRC believed that it was necessary to create a single entity out of the three formerly separate systems. Each of these systems previously had its own identity which was shown in its own colour scheme, operating procedures, uniforms, et cetera. It was felt that a completely new identity was necessary to ensure the potential benefits of the much larger system were realised. </PARA>
<PARA> For legal purposes, such as entering into contracts, the full title of the body corporate is used, that is, Australian National Railways Commission. In general advertisements, however, it is the practice to use the 'shorthand' trading name, usually in conjunction with a picture of a locomotive or train which clearly indicates the Commission's function. </PARA>
<PARA>The photograph of a diesel locomotive or some freight cars is the only clear indication of the Commission's functions in advertisements seeking people to invest in the Australian National Railways Commission. All its new stationery states 'Australian National'. I think this is very misleading. Of course the answer to me talks about better profitability but it does not say that ANR squandered $409,000 of its funds to some company-the name is in the Hansard; I have mentioned it before-to come up with this magnificent suggestion that it drop the word 'Railways' and call itself Australian National. </PARA>

But what I am concerned about is that even though the Commission is running at a loss it was able to give $409,000 to some person to come up with a new logo-'Australian National' in green and gold. If that is not an absolute waste I do not know what is. The Commission deserves to be severely criticised for it. I am very doubtful about the better profitability mentioned in the answer. I am waiting until its report for 1980-81 is tabled to find out whether the Commission has achieved better profitability and attracted more business.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> So far as the Victor Harbor railway service is concerned ANRC have made their position on the future of the line quite clear, namely, that the track on the Victor Harbor line is in relatively poor condition and on present indicators is expected to have a remaining life for passenger services of about five years. Following this period heavy expenditure would be required for track replacement if services are to continue. The Commission has said publicly that a decision will need to be made in a few years to either rehabilitate the line or cease services altogether. The Commission has also said publicly that rehabilitation could not be justified on commercial grounds. </PARA>
<PARA>In my view neither could the expenditure of $409,000 for a new logo be justified on commercial grounds. But what I am concerned about is that a decision now appears to be in the pipeline to close the Adelaide-Victor Harbor railway line which is of great service, particularly to the town of Victor Harbor and the tourist industry in South Australia. we have heard a lot from Mrs Adamson, the Minister of Tourism in South Australia, about the need to attract tourism. The Railways Commission has been saying that shortly it may have to make a decision on commercial grounds to close that line. Mrs Adamson ought to have something very strong to say about that because it is a line that could be made profitable if the Railways Commission and the Tourist Bureau, with the help of Mrs Adamson, got off their backsides and did something about running that line most efficiently and improving its condition so that it can transport tourists from Adelaide to Victor Harbor. </PARA>
<PARA> We heard a lot of talk just recently from the Premier of South Australia about Adelaide having an international airport. How will he transport the tourists to Victor Harbor, one of the most scenic centres in South Australia? By private buses, by private enterprise? We already have a railway line which is operating but which needs perhaps a few hundred thousands dollars spent on it. It will not only provide a service to people who want to visit Victor Harbor but also provide a great deal of employment. Of course we are suffering drastically from very high unemployment in South Australia at present. We need to do something to curb the downtrend which is continuing at a rapid rate under the premiership of Mr Tonkin. So I say again that the Railways Commission should have another look at keeping this railway service in operation. I am sure that the people in the Victor Harbor district will be very concerned when I send them a copy of the letter dated 11 November which I received the other day, and are able to ascertain that the Australian National Railways Commission is considering closing that line. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the people in the Victor Harbour district make their feelings known very strongly to the Minister of Tourism in South Australia and also to the Federal authorities. I will be quite prepared to take up the case on their behalf in this Parliament. I will do so and again and again. Senator Archer pointed out that he gets a little sick of honourable senators promoting things in this chamber day after day. But we have to do this. The only way we can get results from this Government is to keep reminding it of the things for which it is responsible. The Government ought to do something about this matter. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This report was compiled under the auspices of the Commonwealth Department of Health. Whilst I might agree with some of the recommendations that are made in that report let me say at the outset that it does not go far enough. One of the most obvious problems in the development of particular or specific health services, particularly for adolescents, is of course, the limitation of funds which are available. There is no doubt that existing organisations in our community recognise the problems of adolescent health. They also recognise that they are helpless to do anything about the problems because of that limitation of funds about which I have spoken. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard mentioned in this chamber many times, and I have raised this matter many times, about the manner in which Federal funds for family planning associations and the like are effectively cut. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) who is at the table may feel inclined to say they have not been cut, that the organisations are getting the same amount of money they got last year. I put it to the Senate that in actual fact that is an effective cut of 10 per cent to 12 per cent. If we consider that the previous year the amount was the same then we have to accept that now we are about 20 per cent down on the necessary funds needed to provide family planning associations and other health-related organisations such as women's health care houses with an adequate budget to be able to service the community in a way that they are managing to do today by eking out the existing finances that are available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia we are particularly aware of and familiar with the problems of the Family Planning Association of Western Australia. We have the largest State which means that we have the greatest territory to cover. It is only with the assistance and under the auspices of a number of local government councils that we have been able to have family planning association services extended to such places as Esperance and Geraldton. There is a desperate need for family planning associations and related health services in other areas of Western Australia. But, of course, these services are not provided because funds are not available. We know that there is a great need in the community to recognise adolescent health requirements and needs. It is interesting to note that other perhaps more enlightened societies have long recognised the problems of adolescent health. In fact the report at page 3 states:</PARA>
<PARA> In the United States adolescent medicine has enjoyed recognition since the early fifties and training programs in the speciality have increased in number with support from Federal funds since that time. </PARA>
<PARA>We are 30 years behind in recognising even that there is a problem in the adolescent health area. In looking at this problem the report reiterates four major themes which have already been identified many times by the World Health Organisation working group. Those themes are biological aspects, emotional problems, sexually related behaviour and risk-taking behaviour. We also have to recognise that whilst all of these may apply to adolescent men and women, additional adolescent problems can perhaps be added to the problems of those who happen to be female. This is pointed out in part by the report. The report says, for instance:</PARA>
<PARA> At a time when physical appearance and peer comparison are highly prized, delayed sexual development in teenage boys and disparity in breast development in girls are areas of concern of this age group. </PARA>
<PARA> Menstrual irregularities are more the norm than the exception in early adolescence and reassurance to anxious young teenage girls by a sympathetic practitioner is the remedy in almost all cases. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me just go back from that, while we are talking about the sympathetic practitioner and his reassurance to those young teenage girls, to a comment which was made earlier in the report. Speaking about the situation in the past and relating that to the present, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> When medical care was sought, adolescents tended to fall between paediatrics and adult care. </PARA>
<PARA>I put it to the chamber that at the moment they still do. For instance, some years ago my 13-year-old daughter developed severe appendicitis. It was impossible for the medical practitioner to determine whether she should go to the children's hospital, where obviously she would be in a ward with children of a much younger age, or to the Royal Perth Hospital where she would run the possibility of being in a ward with people of a much older age group. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> True, their particular health and social problems were sometimes exasperating and elusive-</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that the problems were exasperating not only to the medical practitioner but also to the parents who had to try to deal with them. </PARA>
<PARA>sometimes requiring a great deal of time to manage and not readily 'fitting into' an existing pattern of health and welfare services. </PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons medical practitioners were not always equipped to handle the problems of youth in a meaningful way, and some doctors had-and still do have-difficulty in empathising with this particular group. </PARA>
<PARA>That brings me to the nub of this report. It stresses the need for services designed particularly to deal with adolescents. We are finding in our society-it is a sad state of affairs but nevertheless a true one-that more and more social problems are developing with people of a younger age. In the past, those who were risk orientated, as the World Health Organisation terms them, tended to be about 18 or 19 years old. Now we are finding that this is developing as early as 12 or 13 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA> If one approaches any of the youth hostels in Western Australia, particularly those run by Jesus People Inc., one will find that their area of concern is those children who tend to leave their homes at a much younger age than was ever envisaged some 20 or 30 years ago. Perhaps children of 12 and 13 years of age left home, or were forced to leave home by the attitudes of their parents and the societal problems that their families were experiencing, years ago. If they did, I do not think the community was aware of it. The community is certainly aware of it now. It is a mental health problem. It creates specific difficulties for organisations in the community which are endeavouring to cater for the needs of those people. The situation is particularly difficult when we have a government which is continually cutting out the funds of various professional organisations which would be in a position most able to assist. On page 20, the report says:</PARA>
<PARA> Health professionals and others who work with youth recognise that:</PARA>
<PARA>adolescents tend to under-utilise existing health services;</PARA>
<PARA>some adolescents need encouragement to access needed health services;</PARA>
<PARA>adolescents need health care providers who are able to relate comfortably and with empathy;</PARA>
<PARA>there are benefits to be derived from grouping adolescents together in treatment areas. </PARA>
<PARA>I am aware that there are a number of tertiary institutions throughout our society which have health counsellors available to people who attend the particular tertiary institution. My prime concern-because my time is limited I will be very brief on this matter-is for people who do not ever get to a tertiary institution. I do not know of any high school which has more than a counsellor available to provide any emotional back-up service for adolescents going through high school. Many children in our society, both male and female, leave school at the end of their third year, at the end of their fourth year or at the end of their fifth year of high school and never attend a tertiary institution. Therefore they are not able to take advantage of those institutions which do have a health counselling service available to them.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I welcome this report; it is the last of the reports that will be based on what I regard as inaccurate figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Quite simply put, the Representation Act determines the allocation of seats to States, based on the population in those States. This report indicates that there will be no redistribution of boundaries based on population changes within Australia between States. One of the great complaints of Victorians is that the figures produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics are based on the census figures. Strangely enough, they are not really an accurate guide to the population in each State. In previous censuses the population has been determined on where a person resided on the night on which the census was taken. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem for Victoria is that because of our, let us say, less than welcome weather in winter, when the census is always taken, at least 60,000 Victorians go to Queensland to get into the sunshine. That means that every time the Bureau reports to the Chief Electoral Officer the population figure based on the June quarter or whatever, 60,000 Victorians are deprived of representations because the original base figure is wrong. I found it a great relief and an encouragement that in the last census two questions were asked-firstly, 'Where were you on the night on which the Census was taken?' and, secondly, 'Where do you normally reside?'. That will mean in future that about 60,000 Victorians will be put back into the State of Victoria. That has implications not only in terms of redistribution but also in terms of Commonwealth Government grants to each State. </PARA>
<PARA> When the allocation of seats was made Victoria had a quota of 32.56 per cent. We needed a drop of only 0.01 per cent to lose a House of Representatives seat. That would have been most unfair, based on the fact that 60,000 of our population were never calculated in the figures. Of course Senator Tate would be worried by the fact that under this scheme Tasmania is really entitled to only 3.5 per cent of the seats but because it is an original State it has five seats. I am not really criticising that but some sort of flexibility should be shown to the other States that are right on the borderline. I welcome this report; it will be the last one based on false figures. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I thank Senator Carrick and the Government for the courtesy they are now showing to private members in allowing them to introduce and to move the second reading of private members Bills an this fashion and in allowing Bills to remain on the table for six months or whatever the period may be so that the public can have the chance of looking at problems such as the one to which this Bill relates. This Bill is not party political; it deals with the removal of the sales tax component from the unit cost of goods when calculating the amount of sales tax to be attributed. As will transpire from my second reading speech, the Australian Democrats do not have any firm answers but we want to identify the problem and to ask the Senate on a non-party basis to make contributions as to how the problem faced by people living in the outback and in the country areas might be overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> The tyranny of distance has shaped Australia's development as a country remote from the economic and cultural mainstream of the Western world. Some of these constraints were self imposed. On our doorstop we chose to ignore the great cultural heritage of the East. Blinder still, we have refused to learn the lessons Aboriginal people had to teach us about how to get along with each other and with the wide spaces and the harsh natural beauty of this wonderful country. As a nation we are beginning to throw off this tyranny of the mind, this unthinking narrowness, just as modern technology is moving us closer to the rest of the world in physical terms. Yet, for many Australians, the tyranny of distance still has very real meaning. I refer to the people who have refused to join the mad rush-one could say the insane rush-to the large urban centres of south eastern Australia where the majority of Australians now live. </PARA>
<PARA> This drift to the cities has slowed down but it is still continuing at a frightening rate. The 1966 census showed that 61.43 per cent of Australians was living in major urban centres and 16.89 per cent was living in rural areas. I repeat that in 1966 roughly 61 per cent of Australians was living in major urban areas and about 17 per cent was living in rural areas. Ten years later, the 1976 census showed that 64.65 per cent was living in major urban centres, an increase of approximately 3 per cent and only 13.89 per cent was in rural areas, a decrease of similar magnitude. The percentage of people living in 'other urban' centres has remained constant at approximately 21.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I am talking about the people who live and work on farms and on mining developments and the people who struggle to provide essential services to remote settlements and country towns, the people who provide us with over 70 per cent of our export income-an essential factor for the comfort enjoyed by the rest of us who live in the cities. I refer also to the people in Alice Springs, in Darwin, in Port Hedland and similar administrative centres providing back up facilities for outback areas. To them all, distance means higher living costs, dearer petrol, limited employment opportunities, exorbitant telephone charges if they want to talk to friends and relatives in other parts of the country and outrageous travel costs if they want to see them. It means limited educational, social welfare and health facilities. It means the insidious, ever increasing transport costs, reflected not only in the lower disposable income of families but also in higher manufacturing and marketing costs for industry and primary producers, reducing their ability to compete and hindering the establishment of new markets. The Australian Democrats intend to promote decentralisation of industry and to work for opportunities and living conditions for people in the outback equal to those of people in urban areas. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill that I am introducing-and I am proud to introduce-the Sales Tax Assessment (Rebate for Transport Costs) Bill 1981-as a private member's Bill is designed to attack one of the difficulties faced by people and industry outside major urban centres. It seeks to exempt from sales tax that portion of the taxable amount which represents the cost of transport. The desirability of this measure is clear: People paying sales tax on goods which have a high freight component, that is, people or producers living or working in areas outside major population areas, pay a disproportionately higher amount of sales tax where the freight component is included in the wholesale price of goods taxed. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give a simple example. Those honourable senators who are not Victorians will excuse me for giving a Victorian example. A manufacturer of a desk in Wangaratta would need to include the cost of transporting all parts required for the desk. This already puts him at a disadvantage with his counterpart or competitor in Melbourne. However, in addition, he pays-and ultimately the purchaser of the desk pays-sales tax on these freight charges, further reducing his ability as a country manufacturer to compete with his city counterpart. Similarly, sales tax applies to goods transported and sold by wholesalers in country areas to people living in those areas. This means people living in those areas are at a disadvantage compared with the people who live in the cities. Clearly, it is equitable to exclude the freight component from the amount on which sales tax is levied. If the aim is clear I am afraid the mechanics to achieve it are less so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Asprey Taxation Review Committee considered this issue and, while expressing the view that equity did require change, concluded that it was very difficult to bring it about. The Democrats acknowledge and respect that view but do not accept it as a sufficient reason for this Parliament to do nothing. The Bill seeks to achieve sales tax exemption for the freight component by enabling taxpayers to claim a rebate at the time of making their return for sales tax payable to the Commissioner. In this way the creation of separate administrative machinery is avoided. In turn, the taxpayer would be obliged to obtain information and to maintain records adequate to substantiate the rebates he or she claims. </PARA>
<PARA> This latter aspect particularly requires close scrutiny by the people entitled to make claims and it is this consideration which has induced us to specify a commencement date of 1 July 1983, which provides ample time for consultation with all parties affected by this Bill. In other words, the Democrats are saying: 'Here is a problem affecting people who live in country areas. An inequity is being suffered by you'. We do not have any specific solutions, nor did the Asprey Committee. But we have put forward one possible solution: We are asking those people who live in the outback and in country areas to tell us, the senators of their own States and their local members of the House of Representatives, whether the Democrats way is a clumsy way of overcoming this problem. Are there better ways? We believe that it is right and proper to allow until 1 July 1983 for people to make representations on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, let me quote some cost of living figures which demonstrate more clearly why the Democrats have persisted with the attempt to overcome at least some of the difficulties imposed by the tyranny of distance. I refer to the experimental retail price index prepared by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The index established a standard cost of living figure by averaging the actual cost of major food items in the six capital cities. This figure '100' is then compared with prices of a similar basket of items in other places. On this basis, in 1980 the Queensland towns of Mount Isa and Weipa rated 113 and 126 respectively; in Western Australia, Derby rated 119, Kununurra 135, Marble Bar 136, Port Hedland 115; in the Northern Territory, Alice Springs rated 111, Darwin 114 and Katherine 118. I ask: Where is the justice, where is the equity, that forces people living in those towns and those areas to pay that much more for the basic necessities of life? As a country we have no right to expect people to live and work in these places, to bear the hardships and disadvantages of isolation and, on top of that, to accept additional living costs of this order. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will amend the income tax law in two respects. Firstly the Bill will give effect to decisions taken by the Government to reduce the taxable value of the right that certain employees have to occupy free, or at low cost, residential accommodation provided by their employers. The Bill will also give effect to the proposal announced on 11 August 1981 that payments made to induce a person to return to work be made subject to income tax and liable to pay-as-you-earn tax instalment deductions. </PARA>
<PARA>EMPLOYEES' HOUSING</PARA>
<PARA> The first measure proposed by this Bill will implement the undertaking given by the Government in connection with the settlement of the Queensland coal miners' strike of last year. </PARA>
<PARA> In securing settlement of the dispute it was agreed that the income tax law would be amended to provide a more concessional basis for assessing the value to the miners of the residential accommodation provided to them by their employers. </PARA>
<PARA> The benefit of this concession will extend to employees in other industries who also live and work in remote areas if it is customary in the industry concerned for employers to provide free or subsidised housing for their employees. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, after giving careful consideration to representations that it received on behalf of employers and employees engaged in the sugar industry, the Government has decided that the concession is also to be available for employees who meet certain additional criteria. These are persons who, while not living and working in remote areas, have no alternative to occupying accommodation supplied by their employers either because there is not suitable accommodation available in close proximity to the work place, or because they are required by their employers to live close to the work place and be on call for duty. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, availability of the concession in this extended way will depend on it being customary in the particular industry in which the taxpayer is engaged for employers to provide free or subsidised housing for their employees. For persons who do not live and work in areas remote from major centres of population it will also be a requirement that the employer provides accommodation for at least five other employees engaged at, or in association with, the place at which the taxpayer is employed. </PARA>
<PARA> In deciding to extend this concession to workers in the mining industry and to others similarly placed in other industries, the government has recognised that large numbers of employees are required, in following their employment, to reside and work in areas remote from large centres of population where they do not have access to many of the amenities and conveniences of urban living. </PARA>
<PARA> In accepting that the concession should also extend in certain cases to housing provided in non-remote areas, the Government has recognised that in some instances employees have no realistic alternative other than to occupy accommodation provided by their employers and that the conditions under which such accommodation is occupied are often onerous by reason of factors such as close proximity to the work place. </PARA>
<PARA> The concessional basis of valuation for income tax purposes proposed in the Bill will limit the amount to be included in the assessable income of an eligible employee, in respect of benefits granted by way of employer-provided housing, to 10 per cent of the market rental value of the accommodation, less the amount of any rent paid by the employee for use of the accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides that, as a general rule, future changes in the market rental value of accommodation provided to an employee will be geared to annual movements in the rental component of the consumer price index as measured for the capital city of the State in which the accommodation is situated. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the criteria set out in the Bill to establish whether or not employer-provided accommodation is to be regarded as being in an area remote from a major centre of population for these purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed that urban centres that had a population of 12,000 or more at the date of the 1976 census be classed as major population centres and that a location be classed as remote if it is not in, or adjacent to, such a major population centre. </PARA>
<PARA> Places of employment and locations of relevant accommodation that are within 100 km by the shortest practicable surface route of the centre of a city shown at the time of the 1976 census to have had a population exceeding 130,000 people or that are within 40 km of a town or city that had at that time a population of 12,000 or more people will be regarded as being adjacent to a major population centre and therefore not qualifying for concessional treatment on the basis of remoteness. Such accommodation may qualify, however, if the alternative tests to which I have referred are satisfied. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation is also to have power, where all the circumstances warrant it, to treat a person who lives or works in, or in an area adjacent to, a major population centre so defined as living or working outside that area if persons living or working near that person fall to be regarded as being in a remote area under these rules. This is to obviate different tax results being applied to near neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures proposed by the Bill concerning employee housing benefits will operate from the commencement of the 1977-78 income year and the commissioner of taxation will have power to amend assessments made before the provisions come into operation so as to effect any reduction in the value of assessable housing benefits brought about by the new measures. </PARA>
<PARA>INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that when the industrial dispute on the Loy Yang power station project was settled late last year, payments made to dismissed employees who returned to work were described and paid, under the settlement agreement, in such a way that no tax was payable on the payments. </PARA>
<PARA> The payments which were based on the wages that the employees might have been expected to receive during the period of their dismissal if they had remained at work during that period were declared as being to compensate employees for hardship suffered during the dispute. But in the Government's view the payments were designed principally to induce the employees to return to work, and if they had been so described, or if they had been paid in respect of a period of employment rather than of a period of dismissal, the payments would have been fully taxable. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time the Treasurer announced that the Government was examining the question of whether similar payments made in future, should be made subject to tax, and on 11 August 1981 he announced the Government's decision that any such payments made under arrangements entered into after that date would be fully subject to income tax. </PARA>
<PARA> In broad terms, the Bill will amend the income tax law to include in the assessable income of a taxpayer any amount paid to him or her under an agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into after 11 August 1981 for the purpose of achieving the result that the taxpayer would, or but for special circumstances would, resume performing work or rendering services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also provide that payments made after the end of the month in which this legislation receives the royal assent are to be subject to pay-as-you-earn tax instalment deductions, at a rate to be prescribed in the income tax regulations-that rate will be equivalent to the standard rate of personal tax (32 per cent for 1981-82). </PARA>
<PARA> Details of the technical aspects of the Bill are contained in an explanatory memorandum that has been circulated to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that the Social Services Amendment Act 1981 extended the scope of the double orphans' pensions provisions in the Social Services Act 1947 to enable those pensions to be paid to persons having the custody, care and control of refugee children who are admitted to Australia, where the parents of those children are outside Australia, or the whereabouts of the parents of those children are unknown. </PARA>
<PARA> A technical, but important, defect has been found in the definition of 'refugee child' in the legislation, and this Bill will amend that definition to cover all children the Government considers should fall within the extended provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing legislation defines 'refugee child' in terms of a child granted refugee status by the Australian Government. There are, however, children who are admitted into Australia as refugees who do not have the formal status of refugee granted to them. The Government intends these children to fall within the class of children in respect of whom double orphans' pensions are payable. In addition, there are children admitted into Australia otherwise than as refugees, under special humanitarian programs, whom the Government considers should be regarded as within the class of children in respect of whom double orphans' pensions should be payable. I am sure that honourable senators will share the Government's concern that the double orphans' pensions provisions be extended in respect of those groups of children who come to Australia whose parents are outside Australia or the whereabouts of whose parents are unknown. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that clauses precluding spouses of persons involved in industrial action from receiving unemployment and special benefit were deleted by the Government from the Social Services Amendment Bill 1981 during its passage through the Parliament. This was done pursuant to a request of the Senate, not because the Government agreed with the request, but to prevent delay in the passage of the remainder of that Bill which, inter alia, authorised the payment of additional unemployment benefit to single beneficiaries aged 18 and over. In deleting those clauses, the Government announced that fresh legislation containing those provisions would be introduced at the first available opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill introduces those provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Before October 1979, the Social Services Act precluded payment of unemployment benefit to a person who was a direct participant in a strike. However, it enabled unemployment benefit to be paid at the 'married' rate to the spouse of a person ineligible for unemployment benefit on those grounds. The Act was subsequently amended to provide that unemployment benefit payable to the spouse of a person engaged in industrial action was to be at the 'single' rate. A further amendment precluded payment of special benefit to a person who, because of industrial action, was not qualified to receive unemployment benefit. This Bill now proposes that, for so long as a person's spouse is disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit because of involvement in industrial action; or unwillingness to undertake suitable work; or failure to take reasonable steps to obtain such work, that person will also be ineligible for unemployment benefit. Additionally, a person will be ineligible for unemployment benefit for so long as payment of that benefit to the person's spouse is postponed because of their misconduct as a worker, because they have become voluntarily unemployed or because they have failed to accept an offer of suitable employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with this approach, special benefit will also be withheld from persons not eligible for unemployment benefit in these circumstances. The Government has decided, however, that if a person is precluded from receiving unemployment benefit and special benefit, in a case of extreme hardship and where there are no other means of support, their spouse may be eligible for special benefit at the single rate, with additional benefit for any children. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, we are not here concerned to discuss the merits of strike action as contrasted with other means open to employees in dispute with their employers to resolve these disputes. What we are concerned with is how the cost of strike action is to be borne. The Government holds strongly to the belief that these provisions should become law. In the case of the provisions relating to industrial action, we do not believe that Australian taxpayers should be asked to subsidise strike action through the social welfare system. Trade unions choosing to take such action make a free decision to strike. If they choose to take such action, they should bear the consequences of their action, not the tax-paying community. Trade unions cannot expect, in those circumstances, that the rest of the community will pick up the bill for the support of the families of members of the trade union involved in the strike. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation as it stands at the moment permits a situation where trade unions can choose to strike, knowing that through the operation of the social security system their members can be largely insulated from the financial effect of their actions. Unless frivolously or maliciously entered into, the object of a strike is to obtain, by the exercise of economic pressure directed against the employer, a benefit for those who take such action. As a result, the benefit sought is itself economic, such as increased pay, a shorter working week, or special allowances. Not infrequently, strikes are settled on a basis that effectively compensates those who have gone on strike for pay lost during the duration of the strike. </PARA>
<PARA> The point to be emphasised is that to strike is an exercise in freedom of choice. It is one taken by the membership of a union to promote its own interests and only its own interests. It is taken against the interests of the employer and, what is directly relevant to this Bill, it is one which is not taken in the interests of the community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the effect of strike action is often in conflict with the interests of the community as a whole or some part of it. Frequently, the community suffers as a result of strike action. This may be reflected simply in inconvenience or in terms of direct economic cost. Furthermore, in a larger sense, it may be said that in the longer term the community always suffers as the cumulative result of the strike action is to decrease the availability of goods and services, and sometimes to do great damage to particular sectors of the economy, or to particular employers. </PARA>
<PARA> These matters need only to be mentioned to make clear the absurdity of any argument that benefits should be paid to strikers or their families, and should be paid by the community at large. For it is the community at large that provides through taxation the funds from which strikers are presently paid the benefits that this Bill proposes to eliminate. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been numerous cases where the wives of strikers, who have appeared to have no genuine intention of joining the workforce themselves, have registered for work in places such as mining and construction towns where there is no real possibility of employment for them. This has enabled them, under the existing legislation, to obtain unemployment benefit, and so transfer to the taxpayer some of the real cost of the industrial action taken by their husbands. </PARA>
<PARA> So, the Australian public is attacked from two directions. First, it has to bear the personal disruptions, inconveniences and associated costs that result from the strike. In addition, it is then called upon to meet the cost of providing income support for the families of those involved in the strike. </PARA>
<PARA> To act to correct this situation is not to 'punish' the families of strikers, but to ensure that people accept the financial consequences of their own actions and do not look to the rest of the community to bear the costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, there is no good reason why the community should automatically and immediately be expected to assume the normal financial responsibilities of people who are not willing to work, who voluntarily and without good reason give up their job, or who are dismissed through their own misconduct. This is happening at present, because the spouses of such people can register for employment in their own right and, if they are unable to obtain employment, can claim unemployment benefit both for themselves and for their 'dependent' spouses. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, we believe that whether people refuse to work because of industrial action or whether, in some other way, they show themselves unwilling to enter or remain in the workforce, there is no reason why the rest of the community should shoulder their financial responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill prevents them from manipulating the social security system to shift the consequences of their actions. </PARA>

I have not obtained particulars of that application, but the fact of the matter is that all such applications have been treated with equality. All the applicants have received letters advising them that no funds are available in the current Budget for funding new projects. Therefore, there is no point in making a particular examination of the application referred to by Senator McLaren.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was a suggestion that the applicants concerned had received a letter stating that there would be no new funding in 1982-83. That certainly would not be accurate. If that was stated, I would be very interested in seeing the letter. In light of the fact that no funds were available for funding new projects in the current financial year, it was thought that there was no point in leaving hanging in the dark applications such as the one Senator McLaren raised. Therefore, within the last couple of months all such applicants were advised of the position. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Giles raised a series of matters. At this stage I do not have my note of all the matters that she raised. She asked about the number of times that public servants had, on my behalf, appeared and delivered papers on child care. I can recall only two such occasions. I was invited to open a child care centre in Melbourne and I was invited to a form of meeting which had to do with family day care in the Australian Capital Territory. On those occasions I was not able to attend. Accordingly, I prepared speeches which were settled by me and which were then delivered on my behalf by the head of the Office of Child Care. I authorised her to explain to the meetings that they were papers which had my personal imprimatur. Subsequently, in a debate on child care, I produced those here. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not in a position to say how often I have asked back bench members of parliament to represent me. They represent me very often at all sorts of meetings. Australia is a very large country. My Department funds hundreds, if not thousands, of organisations. I certainly receive thousands of invitations. Unfortunately, I am not able to meet all those commitments. Accordingly, it is my practice when possible to ask an elected representative to represent me and to put the Government's point of view. That has occurred in this area as in others, be it in opening centres and aged persons homes, or in attending a meeting to put a Government viewpoint. That is a practice which undoubtedly will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not in a position to make apologies about my not being able to attend all those meetings. In September, I think I was able to spend two days in my home town of Perth-that includes weekends. In October, I spent two days in my home town of Perth. This month I have managed to do a little better than that, but I am afraid that it is just not possible to be in all places at once in a country the size of Australia. I suspect even in a smaller country it is not possible to be in all places at once. </PARA>

Whilst the Minister has said there is going to be no funding, I again make the plea which I made last night, that perhaps he or the officers responsible in his Department can have another look at the request from the Lower Murray child care centre to see whether something can be done so that this project does not have to shut its doors.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will examine further the matter of the Lower Murray child care centre, as requested by Senator McLaren. While I am on my feet, Senator Colston also raised a matter yesterday which had to do with delays associated with the release of group certificates by the Department of Social Security in Queensland. He asked whether, if there had been delays, steps had been taken to prevent a recurrence. There were delays with the dispatch of the unemployment benefit group certificates. Those certificates were not dispatched to clients until 22 October 1981 and because of that delay they were accompanied, I am told, by a letter of apology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In an effort to limit client inconvenience, the letter also advised recipients that if they had already lodged their tax returns for 1980-81, group certificates should be forwarded to the Australian Taxation Office together with the departmental letter of apology and explanation. Departmental liaison with the Taxation Office indicated that that would be the most appropriate course of action to pursue. The late issue of group certificates arose from a breacdown in the administrative controls which normally ensure the timely delivery of those documents, which, I agree, are important and are wanted at the beginning of the new financial year rather than well into it. The matter has been put under close review within the Department and action is in hand to prevent a recurrence in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise with the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) the progress, or lack of it, in attempts to finalise reciprocal social security pension agreements between Australia and countries such as Italy, Greece, West Germany, Holland, et cetera. It seems to me that this matter has been going on since 1972 or 1973. We have had frequent consultations between the various governments, particularly between the Italian and Australian governments. I know that it is a difficult problem, with most countries-whence we get our migrants having contributory pension schemes and Australia having non-contributory schemes. But it seems that if a government such as the Italian Government can arrange reciprocal agreements with Canada and the United States and with most unlikely countries such as Argentina and Brazil, we should be able to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are probably in excess of 10,000 Italian pensioners in this country. There are 2,500 to 3,000 Australian pensioners in Italy. Their situation is confused. The communities, as I am sure the Minister knows, are anxious that some sort of an agreement be reached. The Italian Government seems to think that there has been sufficient consultation and a sufficient exchange of ideas. The position of some West German migrants in this country is difficult. Those who have taken Australian citizenship can get their reciprocal pensions only if they have an address in West Germany. This creates all sorts of problems for them. I think it also leads to a lot of misunderstanding. When are such agreements likely to be finalised? How often in the future will Italian officials and politicians have to come to Australia and how often will Australian officials and politicians have to go to Italy, for instance, before we get some satisfactory arrangement for those groups which make up a considerable proportion of our community now and who, as they age, will make up an even greater proportion?</PARA>

Even if the number of people were half a million it is still amazing for the Government to admit that there is that proportion of people who are not covered. I am sure he will not suggest that it is half a million people who are well off and who do not even feel the need for health insurance. A fair proportion of that number would be people who just missed out on being entitled to a health card, who are still in a category of great need and who cannot afford to take out health insurance. The other aspect of the Government's admission about people on low incomes who are eligible for health cards was Senator Chaney's admission that 40 per cent of those who are likely to be eligible have not applied. Even if one acknowledges the point that there is time for people who have had treatment to obtain a card retrospectively, it does not say much for the Government's selling of the scheme and its publicity about it. The Government has had to admit that 40 per cent of those whom it suggests are likely to be eligible have not yet claimed a card.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has to indicate what it intends to do about this matter. I know that it will not acknowledge that its scheme is wrong, that it has made a wrong decision or that there should be improvements to it. The Government at least ought to be doing something more about publicising the health card arrangements so that that 40 per cent, who it says are eligible but have not yet obtained a card, do get one. Perhaps the Government could even acknowledge that its system of having a sharp cut-off point for the eligibility of a card does disadvantage a lot of people. Many of that million who are not covered are placed in a situation of being in need, being unable to afford health insurance, and they have missed out under the restrictive means test on eligibility for the health card. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> (2.56)-A number of matters have been raised. Senator Grimes asked what progress had been made with respect to reciprocal agreements. I was pleased that he acknowledged that it was quite a difficult problem and that he indicated some of the reasons. There is a lack of coincidence between the basis of the Australian scheme and the bases of schemes applying in the countries with which we would be concerned to have reciprocal agreements-countries such as Italy, Germany and Greece, which have contributed many of our migrants. The fact that those countries have contribution-based systems and that we have a more universal tax-based system gives rise to problems in merging the two systems in the sort of reciprocal agreements, that apply between, say, European countries. The matter is one which has been receiving steady attention from the Government. Senator Grimes is right in saying that meetings have taken place between officials of various countries. There have also been visits by politicians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since I have held this portfolio, I have had a number of meetings with representatives of some of our key migrant donor countries and they have expressed their interest in making progress towards reaching reciprocal agreements. I have taken part in a series of discussions with other involved Ministers, and there have been a great many discussions at the official level. I am now a fair way along the track in drawing up a submission which can be put before the Government. At present further interdepartmental discussions are taking place. I have settled on what I regard as an appropriate draft for circulation to other departments. I am not able to say whether it has been sent out; it may well have, as I saw the relevant officers of my Department on the matter some weeks ago. As to when progress might be expected, I am a little cautious about giving a date. If I had been asked to do so at the time of the Supplementary Estimates, I would have said that I would expect some initial Government decisions to be taken by now. I would like to be quite frank with the Senate and say that it is a fairly difficult problem and it is not easy to see which is the best next move to take. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators who are interested in the subject will be aware that progress was made with reciprocal agreements in the early part of the 1970s. The Whitlam Government, with its decision to grant general portability of pensions in 1973, changed the shape of the Australian system in a way that made the agreements reached to that point largely irrelevant. The matter is one in which there have indeed been difficulties. We are working on them at the moment. I should like to see progress made late this year or early next year but I would be cautious about giving a precise date because there are difficult issues to be determined. I certainly accept that this is seen as a matter of importance by many Australians who spent part of their lives in another country, their country of birth. </PARA>
<PARA> There is not a great deal that I would wish to say in relation to the points raised by Senator Coates except to point out that it is not Senator Walters who writes the headlines in whatever newspaper it is. Senator Coates criticised Senator Walters for the headline which stated: 'Everyone protected in health scheme'. I simply say that those are not the words of Senator Walters. Senator Walters gave certain figures about an estimated 67.5 per cent of people being covered for medical costs and 71.6 per cent for hospital costs as at October 1981 compared with very much lower figures in March under the previous scheme. She pointed out that when one added in the number of pensioners, that is, 13.4 per cent of the population, the number of health care card holders, that is, 5.4 per cent of the population, and the number of repatriation pensioners and defence personnel, that is, 2.5 per cent of the population, this brings the total of the population who now have some insurance cover to 92.9 per cent. As Senator Coates himself pointed out, with respect to the balance who qualify for assistance under the protection which is given for those with low incomes, there is a retrospective entitlement if they seek care without having organised themselves to get a health care card. There is the opportunity for them to do that over a period of some 13 weeks. There is, of course, no time limit on their applying for a card prospectively. That entitlement is in place and it is there for their protection. It is an important distinction which is to be made about this scheme as against the pre-Medibank scheme which applied in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the total figure of about 7 per cent of people without any hospital cover, a number of those will be people who have chosen not to insure and who would not be in a low income category. That is a right which Australians are entitled to exercise. I suppose there is a percentage of young healthy people with good incomes who see themselves as running a fair sort of risk. That is not something which has been encouraged by the Government which has, of course, offered a taxation concession to people who take out insurance, a concession which has been welcomed by the substantial majority of Australians who do insure. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to further publicity to ensure that those who are entitled to a card get it, I acknowledge that it is important that we watch the extent to which eligibility is taken up. But I remind the committee that whichever way one goes in this area one can be open to criticism. We were subjected to criticism from one front bencher in the Australian Labor Party who said that we were not advertising enough and from another who said that we were, in fact, spending taxpayers' money on propaganda when we advertised the scheme. So there is room for a difference of opinion as to the extent to which we ought to be going into advertising campaigns on these matters. But I note the point made by Senator Coates. I will see that we will give that further consideration as the year progresses. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the Queensland appeals tribunals, there has been discussion in the Senate from time to time about difficulties in the appeals system. Questions were asked, I think, by Senator Colston with respect to that. There were delays, as I recall, in the appointment of medical practitioners in Queensland. It was necessary, following the announcements last year with respect to the changes in the appeals system for medical practitioners to be appointed. My recollection is that appointments were very late in Queensland for the simple reason that we were not able to get medical practitioners at the then prevailing rates of pay. Those rates of pay have been increased. The appeals tribunal situation now is, as I recollect, satisfactory. I expect, therefore, that the discrepancy which shows a longer waiting time in Queensland would be one which ought to be reduced in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will follow up that matter at a subsequent time when further Estimates come before the Senate. I now raise the question of the continuing problem of overpayments. I raised this matter one day, by way of a question but was not fully able to explain, at Question Time, my concern, as a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, that the problem which exists within the Department of Social Security persists. It may be that there are one or two matters over which the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) has no control. Considering the overpayments that occur overseas, I now want to ask the Minister whether the closure of, I think, the Department of Finance office in Geneva because of the razor gang's decision will accentuate the problem of overpayments. I believe that office has been closed. I think most payments in the European sector to pensioners of Greek, Italian and other European origin were paid through Geneva. I believe the office has now been closed and all the operations have been transferred to London. My information is that the Geneva office was highly efficient. The question to ask now is: Is the Department, faced with this problem of overpayments, likely to find that that problem will increase because of the transfer? What representations did the Department make in this connection to those who were responsible for the decision?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Also on the question of overpayments, is the Department finding difficulty in recovering moneys because the Australian Federal Police has now withdrawn from that area? I ask, therefore, whether the Department made any representations. Yesterday I asked a question concerning nursing homes. It was pointed out to me that the matter of nursing homes has to be considered between the nursing homes and the Department, and that no individuals, as such, are concerned. Social Security benefits are overpaid to people and I take it that the recovery of the money would have to be by way of a process. Who carries out the process now that the Federal Police have withdrawn from that area? Is the difficulty of having summonses processed the reason the overpayments have persisted at this level?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a brief question pertaining again to overseas pensions. During the debate on the social services legislation the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) expressed some sympathy for the situation which has now arisen whereby under the Social Services Act as it now stands persons on wives' pensions who are living overseas and who become widowed are required, I believe, to return to Australia to seek a widow's pension. As I said at the time, this seems to be a fairly unjust sort of situation. If someone who qualifies in every way under our legislation for social services benefits receives that benefit and becomes widowed, under the regulations they need to return to Australia to get that further benefit which is really only an extension of the benefit they previously received. Can the Minister tell us what he intends to do about this-if anything-and what the situation is now of wives who are in this position?</PARA></TALK.START>

Overpayments have persisted and are substantial. What then is the problem? Is it a problem of staff ceilings being imposed which make it impossible for the speedy recovery of these moneys? If that is the problem, when one considers the many millions of dollars which have been overpaid, is it not false economy on the part of the Department to impose staff ceilings and, therefore, restrict its ability to ensure that these overpayments are quickly recovered?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question of overpayments is one which perhaps is sometimes misunderstood because of the running totals which are kept of the total amounts outstanding. When one looks at the debits raised year by year one finds that in 1978-79 the figure was $20.7m in 1979-80, $23.9m and, in 1980-81, $27.1m, although the total outstanding is shown in 1980-81 as $44.9m. Amounts are carried forward in each of those years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When one looks again at the overpayments recovered compared with overpayments raised-I will take in an extra year because there was a bit of a dip and I do not wish to mislead the Senate-one finds that, in 1975-76, 53 per cent of overpayments were recovered compared with overpayments raised. In the following year, 1976-77, 61 per cent of overpayments were recovered. But then there was a bit of a dip in 1977-78 to 55 per cent. In 1978-79, the figure started to climb back to 58 per cent; in 1979-80, it was 61 per cent; and, in 1980-81, it was 61 per cent. The figures seem very large. I realise that at times it can be a source of some scandal. I simply ask honourable senators to place those figures against the total payments made by my department. I could not give the figures for those years off the top of my head, but the payments made through my Department this financial year are budgeted at just under $10 billion. When one takes those as a percentage of the amounts paid out, the amount of the overpayments becomes a little more explicable as it is a relatively small amount. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a number of limiting factors on our ability to recover those overpayments. But the main limiting factor is that a lot of those overpayments are made to people on very modest incomes and of very modest means. In those circumstances there is often an inability for the people who have received the money to do anything other than perhaps repay it by very small instalments. From what I have seen, the Department is sensibly benign in its treatment of people who, through some error of theirs, have often received an overpayment. Relatively small amounts are deducted on a fortnightly basis from benefit usually by mutual arrangment with the client of the Department. So, where one enters, for example, into an agreement whereby one will recover only a couple of dollars a week perhaps over a number of years, one is contributing to an apparent shortfall in collections above overpayments. That is inevitable, given the nature of the Department. Under those circumstances, I am sure that the Opposition would not be urging us to pursue the recovery of overpayments in a rigourous way which might give a better percentage figure but which would give rise to a degree of hardship which would be totally unacceptable. </PARA>

One could say that the expenditure of so many millions of dollars is small in percentage terms. However, the Minister has underlined the concern that many honourable senators feel, namely, that by such overpayments not being prevented a considerable hardship is being placed on many pensioners. In a number of cases honourable senators receive details from pensioners who are distressed because they have unconsciously received an overpayment and subsequently have found that their pension or other entitlement has been reduced by the amount of the repayment. I think the Minister has underlined the human nature of that problem. I would have thought that would cause the Department of Social Security to place greater emphasis on seeing that this does not occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Surely with the technology available overpayments can be avoided. It comes back to the fact that not enough people are employed within the Department to meet the massive problems that it faces in this area. The longer the solution to this matter is postponed the greater the problem will become. As industrial conditions on the job break down-apparently they have-this problem of overpayments increases and the distress that this causes escalates. I do not know whether we can carry this argument much further, but I think it is important to have it on the record so that at least the Department can apply itself to seeing that the problem does not increase. The best way to deal with the problem is to meet it at its source. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General is constantly reporting on the matter of overpayments. This must be an embarrassment to the Department and the Minister. The distress which the Minister has outlined ought not to be allowed to persist. If it is a matter of staff shortages I suggest that the Minister would have the support of the Senate, when such allocations are made, in increasing the staff. This across-the-board application of ceilings is causing extreme hardship to certain departments and that hardship is transmitted to people who are least able to bear it. I repeat that these ceilings represent false economy because it has been revealed in the Australian Taxation Office that much money which could have been collected in taxes was not collected because of the application of staff ceilings. We find the same problem in this Department. Can we get an assurance from the Minister that more staff will be employed? By doing this he would solve two problems. At the present time there are industrial problems in his Department and they will not be solved by stand-downs. They will be solved by placing more people on the floor of the Department, especially in those areas in which the staff members have immediate contact with the public. If more staff is brought into operation the problems that we are concerned about will decrease. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise the troubled matter of the administration of invalid pensions which we raised at the Estimates committee hearings but which I do not believe was satisfactorily answered at that time. The Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, at the time seemed happy enough with the situation. He said that things had settled down in the area. But I and many others are far from satisfied that invalid pensioners, and particularly invalid pension applicants, are being seen to get justice from the Department of Social Security. In the eight years from 1972 to 1980, the number of invalid pensioners rose from 138,800 to 229,200. The number rose steadily over that period in line with the population increase-slightly faster but no faster in fact than the increase in every other category of social security pensions or benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When what could be described as punitive action was taken against invalid pensioners by the tightening of the eligibility requirements after the famous legal opinion that was given to Mr Lanigan, the Director-General of the Department at the time, the numbers not only did not rise at the regular rate but also, probably for the first time since statistics were introduced, they began to drop. The number of invalid pensions paid has dropped in every month since May 1980. So instead of an eight per cent average increase which would have taken the number to about 250,000 we have had a regular drop which has decreased the number of invalid pensioner payments to 220,700. About 19,000 people who one could suggest would have been entitled to invalid pensions under the pre-1980 rules have been refused. That is a fairly liberal use of figures, I know, but it is an estimate which I believe one could make. The estimates this year have predicted an increase of 1,000, far fewer than there would have been in any other year for which I have figures; but there is just no sign of that yet. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of August the figures still showed a drop. More people seemed to have been knocked back for and fewer people put on invalid pensions. People are certainly able to appeal but it is difficult for them to take the steps which are often very daunting and to pit themselves against the bureaucracy and the medical experts of the Department of Social Security and the Department of Health. I have no idea how many of the 19,000, or whatever the figure is, have a valid case for appealing, but the impression of those in the community with knowledge in this area is that only a tiny proportion of those who should appeal ever will appeal. The Department and the procedures do not make it easy because at the moment there are some hundreds of appeals before the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. We learned during the Estimates Committee hearing that there is an average waiting time of five months for a decision. Over 100 cases are before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Appeals and rejections, I believe, would be less necessary if the Government would watch the use of what were the revised invalid pension guidelines which the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) announced earlier this year but which seem in fact to have had virtually no impact, as the declining numbers of invalid pensioners demonstrate. Doctors are still required to make their assessments on medical evidence only. I know of nothing to indicate that they are given any background information on family circumstances or on work environment or are encouraged to take work history, age or any other factors into account. </PARA>
<PARA> This would be less serious, I suggest, if the Director-General of Social Security, or whoever his delegate is who makes decisions on pension grants, took a broader view than the very strict medical interpretation the Department of Health officers have been insisting on-under instructions, one would assume. In the Willie Panke case the Administrative Appeals Tribunal pointed out that it was the Department of Social Security's job to take the broader view. But even now I suggest the Department seems to be taking the view of the former Director-General, Mr Lanigan, that it is its job to keep the people off the invalid pension, not to put them on it. I think there is a great deal of room for improvement in the information about eligibility given by social security officers in the supporting evidence about applicants which the medical officers should have, and in the way the Department assesses applications after the medical reports have been received. </PARA>
<PARA> The two cases in which the Administrative Appeals Tribunal upheld the appeals of rejected invalid pensioners make interesting reading but they will do nothing for present applicants unless the Department takes note of the more humane approach that has been suggested by the AAT. One can look at a further case which was conceded by the Department of Social Security at the eleventh hour. The Legal Service Bulletin of October last points out that in 1980 an applicant, Mr P. Stefyn, applied for an invalid pension. It was his third application in two years. He was aged 56 and had not worked since 1978. His application was based on chronic physical and emotional disabilities. The Department rejected his application. He appealed to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the appeal was formally dismissed by a delegate of the Director-General in March 1981. In April 1981 the applicant consulted the Springvale Legal Service. According to three medical reports he was unemployable. Each of the doctors-two were psychiatrists and one was a general practitioner-examined Mr Stefyn a number of times. Mr Stefyn claimed that only one of the four doctors that the Department of Social Security had sent him to had given him a thorough examination. </PARA>
<PARA> The legal service applied to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review in April and in July Mr Stefyn was advised to make a fourth application for an invalid pension. He consulted the same three doctors and the legal service obtained up to date medical reports on the gentleman. His application was set down to be considered at a preliminary conference on 2 September. The Springvale Legal Service points out that another case was set down for the same day. The Department conceded in the other case on the day before it was to go to the preliminary conference. At the preliminary conference the Department was given copies of the medical reports. In the view of the legal service, the Department seemed determined to fight the case. It was thought that the Department wanted to use Mr Stefyn as a test case for applications based on psychiatric grounds. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal hearing was set down for 21 and 22 September this year. The Legal Service briefed a barrister who had been successful on other invalid pension applications. The three doctors who thought the gentleman was unemployable and the local State member of Parliament, who had taken up his case, were alerted. On 14 September the legal service sent its most recent report to the Department of Social Security. On the morning of 18 September, one working day before the hearing, the Department conceded. </PARA>
<PARA> The Springvale Legal Service asks a very pertinent question. It asks: Why? We cannot believe that one single medical report, which merely reiterated an earlier opinion by the same doctor, convinced the Department at the last minute. Perhaps it was the opinion of the Department of Social Security doctor who examined Stefyn on his fourth application, 10 days before the date of the hearing. Perhaps the Department of Social Security did not feel confident enough to put the AAT to the test again after the Panke and Reid cases. Too many adverse decisions in the AAT would put pressure on the Department of Social Security to review its policy in the area of invalid pensions. The legal service makes the point that the conceding of Mr Stefyn's case indicates the Department's uncertainty in the face of an administrative appeals tribunal which has real teeth and shows greater sensitivity towards incapacitated people in today's labour market. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is fair to say that even though the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is a quasi-judicial body, and the reputation of such bodies is not often considered to be particularly humane, its decisions would seem to be more humane than the Department's. Can the Minister comment on the Department's experiences in this area, particularly in respect of cases that have gone to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal? The delays and trauma are considerable for people who are incapacitated. A further point that I would like clarified is whether the Government is likely to accept the recommendation of the Australian Council of Social Service that if an applicant is unhappy with a Commonwealth medical officer's assessment he should be able to request an additional medical examination, the cost of which should be reimbursed by the Department of Health. I think there is real concern that invalid pensioners are not being and have not been given a fair go. This all seems to coincide with the production of the directive control of invalid pensions by the former Director-General. One was led to believe earlier by the announcements of the Minister for Social Security that the whole situation would change. As the Minister said, he thought that the whole thing had settled down. The figures seem to give us some reason for concern. The repeated reports that all of us have received of the difficulties faced by people seeking invalid pensions would seem to indicate that, in fact, the situation may not have settled down. One wonders whether the Minister has had any further thoughts on this matter since the Estimates Committee hearings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It appears that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) is not going to reply but will let the vote be taken. I want to raise another couple of matters before the vote on this section of the Estimates is finally taken. I refer to the health card arrangements. I wonder whether the Minister could provide some figures, broken down State by State, of successful and unsuccessful claims by applicants for low income health cards. Has the Department of Social Security maintained records of the number of people who have made applications at offices of the Department of Social Security and who have had their claims rejected? I know that these records will not be wholly informative because of the fact that many people have worked out for themselves that they would not be eligible. It would be interesting to know how many contacts with the Department there had been by applicants and potential applicant and how many of them had ended up being successful. Does the Minister have any figures on the cost of the administration of the health card arrangement, not only of the publicity but also of the issuing and providing of cards for the 118,000 people who have obtained them? I think it is important that we know the relative costs of the various components of the Government's health scheme. Because of the scheme that the Government has introduced there is a need, as the Government sees it, to provide low income health cards. It would be interesting to know the value for money of the administration of that scheme. I just reassert what I said before about the whole scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister tried to say that Senator Walters had not said what I had said she said, but she is quoted as saying that virtually the whole of the population now has protection against health costs. That is clearly not true; the Government admits that. Forty per cent of low income people have not obtained health cards. Of the order of a million people have no cover at all. Before the vote is taken, I want to check with the Minister whether he will be able to keep his promise of earlier in the week to table in the Senate this week a statement on the health arrangements for overseas students. There are not many hours of sitting left in this week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Claims of political harassment in a number of departments have come to my notice through a number of people. I have chosen to talk in the debate on the estimates of the Department of Social Security on a specific case. I have had a range of specific approaches in relation to other departments of political harassment concerning people who seek to be candidates for various political parties, not only at the Federal level but also at the State level. Of course we are dealing here only with the Federal level. I raise in particular a matter relating to the commercial studies section of the Taringa Rehabilitation Centre in Brisbane. I am not necessarily seeking an answer from the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) now but I would like an undertaking that he will personally satisfy himself that in this case there has been no active harassment or political overtones in the elimination of the commercial studies section and of its tutors. I am advised that in December 1980, at very short notice, the attendance of a particular tutor was reduced from 20 to 12 hours a week and in 1981 a proposal went forward to eliminate the commercial studies section though there was still a clear need at the rehabilitation centre for such a commercial studies section.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I merely want to say in general that the problems that have been met by political candidates at State and Federal levels are confined, in my experience, not only to governments but also to private industry. Not only do many candidates suffer severe losses through their own expenditure in relation to elections but loss of income, harassment and loss of promotional opportunities are still quite active in private enterprise and, it would appear from the cases that have been represented to me, in government. In this particular case I seek an assurance from the Minister that he will satisfy himself that this has not been the case at the Taringa Rehabilitation Centre. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly have never heard any suggestion of political harassment at the Taringa Rehabilitation Centre. Needless to say, I would be utterly opposed to any such activity. I will take up the matter with my Department and check it out. In recent times I have heard some quite disturbing reports of political victimisation in my State of Western Australia but it has all been victimisation by the Left of people who do not choose to support the Australian Labor Party. It may be that one only ever hears these allegations about the other side of politics. In any event I will examine the matter that has been raised by Senator Macklin. I would be very surprised if, within my Department, there was any interest at all in that sort of activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Grimes raised again the question of invalid pensions. I cannot say that there has been very much change since the time of the Estimates committees. Since that time we have been largely concerned with parliamentary proceedings and it has not been a time of particularly active policy development, examination and review. However, he did raise some of the interesting facts and figures in this area. I will quote his figures because, although I have not independently checked them, they are certainly in accord with the broad picture as I recall it. For example, he quoted an increase in the number of invalid pensioners from 138,000 to 229,000 over a period of eight years. Whilst he said that that figure is increasing at a faster rate than the increase in population but is no faster than increases in the numbers of other beneficiaries, I would say only that that is not necessarily a very consoling or convincing point to make. The fact is that over roughly the same period there was a considerable increase in the level of unemployment, for example. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter in which one can be fairly non-partisan. The graphs paint a very clear picture. From about 1974 there was a very substantial increase. The increase continued for a period after we came to office and it has become stable over recent years with some slight reductions over the last year and a half or so. There has been a very substantial change in what would be regarded as the average level of unemployment over the last five, six or seven years-in fact, since 1974-as against the prior period. The annual rate of increase in the number of pensioners-again I quote from memory-is in excess of 6 per cent per annum, whereas the increase in the number of people of pensionable age has increased by slightly over 2 per cent per annum. So I do not get much consolation from the suggestion that the increase in invalid pensions is necessarily in order because those pensions are going up at the same rate as are other pensions and benefits. I suppose the question that has to be asked is whether it is a fact that at any time a quarter of a million Australians who wish to work are 85 per cent incapacitated for work. </PARA>
<PARA> There were elements of the invalid pension system which I think were undesirable. I speak, of course, from reports because that period precedes my involvement in the portfolio. There were elements of unevenness in the administration of the tests for the invalid pension and I think the substantial and positive change which was made was designed to ensure a more even application of the rules. I think it is comprehended outside and within the Parliament that we have made a considerable effort to ensure that the invalid pension guidelines are adequate and understandable and that they meet the requirements of the Act. Those guidelines were published in, I think, last May and were sent to the people who have to apply them. We prepared those guidelines after consultation, including consultation with the Australian Council of Social Service, and we have made a very substantial effort to achieve a satisfactory situation in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Grimes has now raised the fact that appeals are coming before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and that some of these appeals succeed. He has asked whether this does not indicate that things are still wrong. I can only say to the Committee again that I would have thought that it was common ground that the whole point of having an appeal system was to have something which subjects our administrative processes to external check. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal in its jurisdiction in this area will have proved to have been rather fruitless if, over the years in a range of areas, it does not tell us that on occasions our administration is not correct, that on occasions we are not applying the law correctly, and so on. It has been given that jurisdiction precisely to perform that task. If one got a pattern in the cases coming before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which suggested that the administration was not in accordance with the law or that wrong decisions were being made, then of course one would have to look to the administrative processes to see what ought to be changed to remove the objection. </PARA>
<PARA> The Panke case was raised. That was one of the early invalid pension cases to come before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It is my view, after looking at the records of that case, and the view of my advisers, that nothing in the decision which was made by the Tribunal in that case conflicts with the guidelines of eligibility which we released in May of this year. It cannot be said that the decision totally endorses the guidelines; it does not necessarily cover all aspects of the guidelines. Therefore we cannot say that they are for all time to be accepted as the proper guide to the meaning of the Act. But on the issues which are dealt with by the Tribunal it appears to us that the Tribunal's views are consistent with the guidelines which we laid down in May. The fact that the Tribunal overturned the decision of the Department in the Panke case indicates the proposition that the guidelines had not been correctly applied in that case. Again, I say that the Tribunal is there to pick up those cases where there is some administrative error and hence some detriment to the subject. </PARA>
<PARA> In light of the decision, officers of the Department are currently consulting with officers of the Department of Health, for two reasons. They may have completed these consultations now; the last advice I had was that they were in the process of consultation. They wanted firstly to see whether any other matters awaiting hearing before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal might be settled prior to hearing and, secondly, to review administrative procedures for the application of the guidelines so as to further increase the probability of their being correctly and consistently applied. </PARA>
<PARA> I see the AAT as being a very valuable safeguard for the citizen, a means whereby the Department and the Minister as required are reminded of how the law should be applied. I believe that it will be a very valuable improvement to the system. I say that I do not believe that it will be productive to complain about the fact that when one puts a formal appeal mechanism into place formal steps are taken in the way that steps have to be taken in the lead-up to a formal hearing with the briefing of counsel, the further checking of evidence and the obtaining of further evidence where that is thought necessary by the appellant or by the respondent. </PARA>
<PARA> It will also be true that cases will be settled before hearing when that pre-trial or pre-hearing examination shows that perhaps there is some defect, something has been overlooked or some fresh evidence has come to light. So the steps which were outlined by Senator Grimes when he was referring to a case referred to in the Legal Service Bulletin are steps which are familiar to anybody who has been engaged in the process of litigation or in the process of appeal, and of necessity they are the sorts of steps which occur now that we have that formal avenue of appeal for people who feel that the social security system has not given them the decision to which they are entitled. </PARA>
<PARA> I can assure the Committee, however, and I assure Senator Grimes, that the decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will be carefully watched by my Department and where they indicate deficiencies in administration of course those deficiencies will be addressed. I believe it is too early to say that the changes to the guidelines which were introduced in May will overcome deficiencies. I do not rule out that possibility for the future. That may, of course, occur. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the matters raised by Senator Coates are concerned, I cannot give him the sort of detail that he would like about the costs of the administration of the scheme simply because it would be impossible at this stage. The Department sought and obtained temporary staff cover for the administration of the scheme. My recollection is that we got cover in the order of 660 officers. That was the high point of the temporary cover that we obtained for the scheme. As I have said in this chamber over recent days, I think it is common ground that the cover was generous. In fact, it provided more officers than were required for the administration of that scheme. The Department is at present dealing with reducing the cover for that scheme. One could not say what it is costing in a per client sense, or in any other sense, I believe, until we get to the point at which there is a stable situation and there are measurable costs which can be assigned to this scheme. I suspect we will be in a better position this time next year to answer the points raised by Senator Coates. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coates also asked whether I would give him detailed figures on a State by State basis on the number of unsuccessful claims. I do not think it will surprise him when I say I cannot do that in the Committee today. I will find out whether those detailed records can be extracted. If they can I will provide them to him. I am, however, able to give him a little more detail than I gave the Committee when last we discussed the appropriations. I indicated then that the total number of claims received by the close of business on 6 November 1981 was 118,511. Of that number, 14,103 were immigrant claims and 104,408 were low income claims. I am also able to give him the total number of inquiries the Department had to that time. The number is 445,497, which is a very much larger number than the number of claims. I will see what breakdown of that figure is possible. I am sure some breakdown is available because clearly it is an exact figure, the aggregation of material from around Australia that has been put together by the Department. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand it includes a very large number of inquiries that were received over the phone as part of the hot line arrangement. I was about to say that, on the basis of what I can only describe as a very small sample, namely the sample which I myself took over the telephone while watching how that hotline operated, a very substantial number of the calls I took were from people who knew what their entitlements were but wanted to discuss particular aspects of their entitlement. That may have been a bad sample because I think a number of them knew that by ringing at a particular time they could get me and they may have been more inclined to ring up just to have a chat about the scheme itself. The Department may be able to give me some rather broader sample. My impression, on the basis of a fairly small sample, as I have said, was that a very substantial number of the inquirers knew a good deal about the scheme from their general reading but were ringing to check on a particular point or to query some point of detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to the cost item we say that the main cost-that is why I referred to the fact that we have not got to a stable staffing level for the scheme-of administering the scheme is, as with most things, the cost of staff salaries, overheads, including printing of cards, computer time, postage and telephones, and would be fairly low. At the moment I cannot extract those figures. Some of them would not be extractable from the general administrative costs of the Department. I will ask the Department to see whether we are able to give some clearer indication of costs in this area in the Supplementary Estimates next year. I have no doubt this will be of continuing interest to Senator Coates. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coates also raised the question of the tabling statement. I am glad he did because I meant to say to the Senate this morning that I have received some documentation from the Department following my undertaking to table the statement. In light of the fact that the Senate is sitting next week, I have asked that there be further consultations between the relevant departments. I think Senator Coates's request specifically was that we should make sure that the Australian Development Assistance Bureau and the Department of Health and so on were all in agreement that the statement represented a final position, or a present position anyway. I am proposing to table something next week, unless the document comes back to my office between now and when the House rises, in which case I might make it available. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps it would be a good idea if the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) were to conduct a hotline every week so that we could have a mini-Estimates committee over the phone to keep up with the information and save lengthening this discussion. I have one further aspect on invalid pensions to bring up. I would like to comment briefly on what the Minister said. Of course, I am not critical of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the judicial procedure of appeal which has been established there. I supported it in this Parliament when the Government of which I was a supporter introduced the scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My concern was, firstly, that the Minister and the Department should take note of the criticisms that have been made by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I am glad that he says they have noted them and that they will do so in the future. It is a useful means of review of the operation of the system. My criticism in the Stefyn case was that, in fact, from the time of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in April, up until, I think, September there was this protracted episode which culminated in the Department backing off the day before the appeal. I think, in cases involving invalid pensioners one should be critical if that happened very often and one really should be critical that that happened at all. One would have thought that in that time the Department could have come to a decision about what its attitude was rather than leaving it right to the death-knell when all the arrangements had been made. I know that that frequently happens in other courts where I have been a medical witness myself and it is the bane of doctors' lives, but I do not think it should occur where it affects invalid pensions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister expressed the concern one hears quite frequently, particularly from conservative sides of parliament and other areas in this country, that there is no reason that the invalid pension rate should increase with, for instance, the unemployment rate in the community. I suggest that, in fact, there is a very good reason why that should occur and why one should expect it to occur. We have a system of invalid pensions which I do not agree with-I do not know that the Minister agrees with it-where we have this sort of artificial figure of 85 per cent incapacity which no doctor, not even Dr Baume, can define. We have the requirement that the invalidity be considered permanent by someone who also has to make that sort of judgment. We now have in the new guidelines the fact that social factors, family factors and the work force should be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple fact is that in times of full employment, of very low employment rates such as one per cent, or over full employment that we have had in the past, all sorts of people can get employment because of the shortage of people in the work force. When unemployment goes up it goes up disproportionately for the disabled. It is always easier for the able to get employment than for the disabled. Under those circumstances, with the sort of judgments we have to make, in fact the invalid pension rate would rise. I do not think anyone should be surpised at that. I do not think it indicates that one is malingering or doing any such thing. It is a situation which will always exist while we have the present system of invalid pensions and measurement of eligibility for invalid pensions. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Estimates Committee a month ago and in the Senate two or three weeks ago I raised the matter of the difficulty suffered by Greek-Australian pensioners whose pensions were removed in the course of the 1978 inquiries in Greece which followed the onset of the alleged social security frauds in Sydney. I remember that the Minister at the time promised to take seriously the point that many of these same pensioners found it difficult or impossible to return to Australia to establish their right to a pension. If they did so they had the monumental task of trying to repay loans for supporting their families and travelling back to Australia. The Government was giving them no help. They were getting help from their organisations in Greece. At the time, I pointed out the large percentage of people who in fact had come back to Australia and who, though declared ineligible in Greece for pensions, on their return to Australia had been found eligible. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask: Has the Minister given any consideration to the calls of the Greek-Australian pensioner society in Athens to re-assess pensioners still in Greece who may need to be reassessed, particularly those who have the medical evidence from Greek doctors that they are considered to be invalid? Has the Minister given any consideration of how to reimburse some pensioners who may have returned here in the last two years, and successfully re-claimed their pensions? I particularly remember the case of Mr Papamichos, whose problems I referred to a month ago, who has a very ill wife in Greece and who himself is considered to be at risk. I think this case which goes on and on has all sorts of ramifications and is one we should really ensure comes to a satisfactory conclusion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to deal with the matter of the practice of boiler maintenance at repatriation hospitals. I am indebted to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) for a letter he sent me on 17 November which is probably a prologue to my story. The Minister is aware of the letter, which I showed him yesterday. The letter traces the history of the Concord Repatriation General Hospital that was constructed in 1941. The boilers in question were manufactured by Babcock and Wilcox Aust. Ltd, a fairly reputable manufacturer of pressure vessels. The boilers are forty years old. The point I want to make concerns maintenance procedures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In most hospitals in most States the local departments of labour and industry which certify the boiler firemen are also the agencies that look at safe maintenance and working of boilers. As the letter points out, in the case of the Commonwealth Government the idea was that the annual maintenance that was needed and desired involved an arrangement by the Commonwealth Department of Housing and Construction in conjunction with Babcock and Wilcox to engage a private consultant who in turn would utilise a duly qualified boiler inspector. That, in itself, does not seem to mean a lot. I do not want my remarks to be construed as those of a rabid States' righter-far from it. I want to look at the other side when a malfunction or accident occurs. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot speak for Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital in Queensland or Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital in Victoria but what I am saying has the blessing of the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association of Australasia which covers boiler attendants. The Association is a little apprehensive because of boiler mishaps that have occurred. In fact, at the Lady Davidson Hospital, which is another Commonwealth establishment, there was a fatality some years ago. There was a first class demarcation dispute. The boiler attendants' jobs were on the line. The union, naturally, was anxious to protect its members, and rightly so. The question of jurisdiction and whether the Department of Labour and Industry inspector should inspect the boilers came up. It was a case of closing the stable door after the horse had escaped. I understand that an officer of the Concord Repatriation Hospital declined to let an inspector of the Department of Labour and Industry in New South Wales inspect the boilers there, following the uproar about the Lady Davidson Hospital episode, and subsequently blocked the New South Wales Department of Labour and Industry inspector entry to Concord General Hospital for the same purpose. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GM7">Senator MULVIHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was at the time of the Lady Davidson fatality. My informant is Clive Healey, M.L.C., the counterpart of our Chairman of Committees, and a man very knowledgeable in pressure vessels. He has had long service in the boilermaker industry. He takes the view that there was a panic move. After the fatality at the Lady Davidson Hospital the Department of Labour and Industry inspectors wanted to inspect the boilers at Concord Hospital, as I have said. I am not questioning the integrity of the consultant cum private boiler inspectors or, for that matter, the workmanship of Babcock and Wilcox but I want to see the matter through the eyes of the trade union operator. If there is some malfunction and his judgment is at stake, it is really a matter of appealing from Caesar to Caesar. The boiler inspector gets his certificate of competency from the Department of Labour and Industry or its equivalent whether he is in Brisbane, Melbourne or Sydney. In effect, whatever practice he follows is based on what he has been taught in order to get his certificate. I would like to know how the operator would be protected in the case of another Lady Davidson episode. That is the concern of the FED&amp;FA. The boiler inspector, via the Department of Housing and Construction, uses a consultant and not a Department of Labor and Industry inspector. With all due respect, he is a normal man. If he turned on Babcock and Wilcox and said that there were malfunctions, and the boiler mishap was not due to the operator, I have a shewd idea that he would never get a job again as a consultant. It is as simple as that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am suggesting the transfer of the monitoring of boilers to a different instrumentality, that is, the Department of Labour and Industry. I know that suggestion may be repugnant. Normally I would not advance it but I am concerned about trade union rights in addition to safety. I will give a classic precedent. In New South Wales in the early 1950s overhead crane drivers in railway workshops were lifting boilers and other equipment to a capacity of 35 tons. I was one of them myself. We were concerned that, if there were a mishap, an appeal by us would be from Caesar to Caesar. Our certificates of competency were issued by the New South Wales Railways Commissioner. The New South Wales branch of the Australian Railways Union and the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association were successful in a joint application made with the concurrence of the then Minister for Labour and Industry in New South Wales and the Transport Minister. We had been issued with tickets of competency by the Department of Labour and Industry. Any mishaps with a crane driver or boiler attendant were very rare. If these occurred, there was a board of reference. The Railway Commissioner had one nominee and the union had another. The Department of Labour and Industry provided a chairman. The blueprint which applies in the New South Wales railways to my mind could and should apply in the relations of the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Housing and Construction with people in FED&amp;FA grades in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. I say that advisedly. There have been no more mishaps since the Lady Davidson episode. Of course, if I had the drive and tenacity of my illustrious South Australian colleague, Senator McLaren, I would have had a copy of the coroner's report and would have blasted all and sundry. I do not have the time to do that. However, I think that ought to have been a salutory lesson that those sorts of matters should be handed over to the various State departments dealing with labour and industry matters because they are specialists in the field. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us be fair about this. If an inspector, when he goes out on a job, has the backing of a State or Commonwealth department he can stand up to the Babcocks and Wilcoxes or their equivalents, or the bureaucracy in the various departments. I live adjacent to the Concord Repatriation General Hospital. I think the repatriation officers know that I am not a vindictive man. But I like to believe that, first and foremost, I am watching that the rights of trade union members are preserved, in this case the rights of members of the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association of Australasia. I thank the Minister for the position paper he has provided. However, it prompts me to raise the question of what will happen in the future if we have another Lady Davidson type of episode and a board of reference or something like that has to be set up. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that if a man-be he a boiler attendant, an overhead crane driver or anyone in a job with similar classifications-loses his ticket he loses his job or he is demoted. That is a thought-I would like to believe it is a constructive thought-that I leave with the Minister. Mr Chairman, at this stage I think I could do no better than to ask that this letter, signed by the Minister, Senator Anthony J. Messner, be incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>MINISTER FOR VETERANS' AFFAIRS PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA A.C.T. 2600 17 November 1981</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Mulvihill,</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that you have been making enquiries about the question of boilers at Concord Repatriation General Hospital and I am writing to you in anticipation that the information I have will satisfy your requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> I would point out firstly that, technically speaking, the questions relate more to the Department of Housing and Construction where funds for the operation and maintenance of boilers are provided, than to my Department. However, my officers have been in touch with officers of that Department and the information I have set out below is based on the information given to us by Department of Housing and Construction officers. </PARA>
<PARA> The boilers at Concord are about 40 years old and were installed in 1941. They are in good repair and are overhauled annually by Babcock Australia Limited, the original installers of the boilers. The requirements of the New South Wales State Department are that all pressure vessels must be certified each year for worthiness and the Department of Housing and Construction engages a private contractor to report on the condition of those boilers in order to gain the necessary certification. The method adopted for inspection is the same as that which would be employed in a State or private hospital elsewhere in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that you were also interested in the aspect of current wage negotiations for boiler attendants employed at Repatriation General Hospitals. The Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association had lodged a wage claim and on 6 November 1981 the Public Service Board made an offer to the Association for boiler attendants, certain operators of major plant and all other members. As at the time of writing I understand the Association had not accepted the Board's offer and have applied work bans in support of their claim for a higher increase for all their members than that offered. </PARA>
<PARA> I trust that this information is of assistance and answers the questions which have been concerning you. I would be pleased to supply information if there are any other matters you wish clarified. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,  (Anthony J. Messner)</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GM7">Senator MULVIHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other matter I refer to concerns the Public Service Board's attitude to industrial relations. There has been a considerable amount of talk on that in the Press lately. In fact, the Public Service Board has been termed the Bourbons of old-they never forget anything and they never learn anything. I notice in the fourth paragraph of the letter that has just been incorporated in Hansard that the Minister refers to wage negotiations for boiler attendants employed at repatriation general hospitals. He talks about claims and counterclaims. I am curious about this. I do not expect the Minister to have the answer on the tip of his tongue. My information is that a boiler fireman's current rate of pay at Concord General Hospital is $203 a week. By current wage standards this seems to be an abnormally low amount considering they do shift work. It might be argued that with a clerical occupation a miscalculation could be made, but with some of these manual jobs if there is a lack of judgment there can be fatalities. I am curious about what offer over and above the $203 a week will be made when the current award runs out. Again, I do not blame the repatriation officers one bit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently an Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commissioner made some revelations. I am sure that there is a reasonable amount of give and take between the organisers of the FEDFA-I encompass in that the national officers, brothers, Canbourne and Fitzgerald, and their State counterparts-and people in the industrial office of the repatriation departments. I always believe the Public Service Board is imbued with the theories of a prominent member of the Treasury named Stone. It has this idea of Stone by name and stone by nature. It is hard and tightfisted-I am not talking about the repatriation people. This is where we find bad industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that the Minister referred to the fact that bans have been applied by the Federated Engine Drivers and Fireman's Association. I know most of its officials. They are extremely pragmatic men. They want a solution. Again, it was helpful of the Minister to give me this position paper. However, it would not mean relinquishing Commonwealth powers if, on the matter of safety in the FEDFA classifications-categories, if you like-we could have better understanding between the Commonwealth and the local labour and industry departments. Those departments could play a much more effective role than these consultants. I leave it at that with a subtle warning to the Minister that I might have to follow this up and emulate my colleague Senator McLaren by going back to what the coroner said on the Lady Davidson fatality. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address some remarks to Senator Mulvihill on the matters he raised. Firstly, the problem to which he referred is very largely in the hands of the Department of Housing and Construction. In fact, the employees-the boiler attendants and so on-who look after the boilers at the Concord Repatriation Hospital and, for that matter, at Lady Davidson Hospital are employees of that Department. The points that he raised are correct. I can confirm that a contractor undertakes the work within the Department of Veterans' Affairs to check out the boilers each year and to certify their worthiness.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that the honourable senator is right. It sounds as though there is a very good relationship, at least on some levels with the operators within the Department at Concord. Of course, those pressure vessels which are operated at Concord are subject to checks each year and are certified as to their worthiness. As to the degree to which there is an appeal in the circumstances the honourable senator has outlined, I must say at this point that I have been unable so far to confirm the reference to the fatality at Lady Davidson, but I undertake to check that matter further with the Department of Housing and Construction. In fact, those circumstances are very important and I think that all honourable senators would be concerned to ensure that proper safety practices are carried out and that there is an opportunity for people to have their standards of practice reviewed by an independent body. I undertake to refer that matter to the Department of Housing and Construction on behalf of Senator Mulvihill to see whether we may be able to obtain a paper from the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) as to the way in which we could approach that problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am unable to confirm off hand the level of wage presently payable to a boiler attendant. I note that negotiations are currently going forward and that the Public Service Board has made an offer to members of the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemens Association of Australasia of $21 per week for boiler attendants and certain operators of major plant, and $15 a week for other members. As at a week ago the union had not accepted the Board's offer and had applied work bans in support of its claim for $27-$6 more than the figure which had been offered. That is where we are on that issue at present, but I will endeavour to keep Senator Mulvihill informed of developments in that area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) a general question which is a bit hard to relate to a specific part of the Estimates, but which was precipitated by a Press statement issued by the Vietnam Veterans Association. I preface it by reminding the Minister that he is, of course, in a difficult position to answer these things. The Australian Labor Party was in office for most of World War I and in World War II the Labor Party had to take over and we were able to manage these things. But the Vietnam war was wholly and solely the responsibility of a conservative government and the people who suffered in that war are getting a raw deal. In 1972, of course, when Labor came into office we took the troops out of Vietnam. I draw the Minister's attention to a Press statement issued by the Vietnam Veterans Association yesterday. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Vietnam Veterans have been disadvantaged before the Senate Inquiry into our claims has even started. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been offered only one-and-a-half hours before the Senate Science and Environment Committee, whereas various organisations representing the Government have been given at least six hours--</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, they have been given 25 per cent of the time given to other people-</PARA>
<PARA>At the initial hearings in Sydney on 8 and 9 December 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The next hearings will not take place until February 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> While we do not wish to denigrate the commitment of the individual Senators who are members of the Standing Committee, it is clear that these delays will continue, and that Vietnam Veterans claims will be further delayed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is precisely this problem (which we have repeatedly referred to in the past) which forces us once again to call on the Government to establish a judicial inquiry to examine our claims. </PARA>
<PARA>That complaint by the Vietnam veterans is very valid. We seem to be coming up against these walls of brick, or silence, all along the line. I do not blame the Senate Standing Committee for this proposition. Undoubtedly it has been leaned on by the Government to give the Vietnam veterans the least possible assistance to air their complaints publicly. I ask the Minister through you, Mr Chairman, whether he will review this situation to ensure that the people who want to present the evidence on behalf of the Vietnam veterans are placed in a situation in which they can air their problems. The Government will not set up a judicial inquiry, which the Opposition has also advocated. This is the next best suggestion. I suggest that the proposition be implemented. This problem is spread across the board. During the last week or two I referred to the Minister the case of a man who was employed at Maralinga who is obviously suffering from the effects of radiation. The man saw numerous doctors who either did not know anything about radiation or were unable to help him. We have now appealed to the Minister. I hope that the case will receive priority attention from the Minister and his Department. Unfortunately, we cannot produce the five witnesses who worked with this gentleman because they died of cancer-obviously as a result of their employment at Maralinga. </PARA>
<PARA> In two or three areas there has been a strange reluctance by the Government to do anything to help people who have suffered as a result of their involvement, either in a civilian or a Service capacity, in the indiscriminate distribution of herbicides in Vietnam or from service at Monte Bello, Maralinga and other places where radiation has obviously caused problems. I refer back to a period when the Government refused to give the 1914-18 War veterans repatriation hospital treatment. I am talking about the Minister's Government; not our Government. We did give them that. The Government continually refused, even though there was a high incidence of cancer in World War II veterans, to give them hospital treatment without tags being applied. That right has now been achieved. I would like to see it extended to allow repatriation benefits also to be granted to people among whom there is a high incidence of cancer as a result of service in foreign areas. I ask the Minister to make a comment on the matter and to see that the Vietnam veterans get a fair go. </PARA>

Whether they did or not is the question that needs to be answered by this study. As I understand it, that work is going forward. Nevertheless, I must add that I have had discussions with the Nuclear Veterans Association of Australia, in Queensland in particular with regard to the various problems faced by veterans who claim to have been exposed at Maralinga and in other places. They include those who claim that they were in fact present in Japan at the time of the bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima at the end of World War II. I have given advice to individuals as to how they might pursue their rights under either the repatriation legislation or the legislation affecting Defence Force retirement funds and benefits. Generally speaking, the Government is prepared to examine individual cases as they are raised from time to time. Certainly it has no reluctance in that regard.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to ask the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) a question. Following the decison of the High Court, in the Perth widow case, that, contrary to the previous understanding, the onus of proof lay with the Government to show that there was no causal link between the illness, the disability or the poor condition of the veteran and war service. Previously the link had to be proved by the veteran. A couple of weeks ago in this chamber I asked whether the Government had requested of the Attorney-General's Department a paper showing what amendment might be pursued to section 47 of the Repatriation Act in order to overcome the expenditure of many hundreds of millions of dollars which the Minister, in his answer, admitted might be expected to flow from this decision. I think it is fair to say that the Minister, in answering the question said that he did not have the terms of reference at his fingertips, but that an options paper, as he put it, had been sought from the Department, rather than a particular method of amending section 47. As a supplementary question I then asked whether the options paper excluded the amendment of section 47. The Minister, not having the terms of reference at his fingertips, said that he would have to clarify the situation later; he could not recall it offhand. Is the Minister now able to make the terms of reference available to the chamber? Can he say whether the terms of reference exclude the possibility of an alteration to section 47? I now ask a more general question: Has any refinement been done of the figures as to the expected call on Commonwealth revenue as a result of the cases which have banked up before individual tribunals and boards of review, awaiting the outcome of the High Court decision?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Tate for his question. I must say that no specific terms were drawn for this reference to the Attorney-General's Department. Rather, the Government sought from that Department advice on the implications of the decision. The honourable senator may recall, if he has read the judgment, that it had several confusing aspects. In fact, it was clarification of those aspects which the Government required in making the reference. As to the question of any amendment of section 47 of the Repatriation Act, the Government would have to consider that in a totally different context following receipt of advice on the implications of the High Court decision. No decision has yet been taken by the Government upon any matter of that kind. In fact, it has not addressed itself to the implications of the decision. It still has the matter very much under study. I have no further information that I can give the honourable senator on the costs of the case. I did say at the time that there was no reliable estimate as to what the issue may cost eventually. It is true, however, that, as the law stands, people are entitled to lodge claims with the Department. Naturally we are interested to see to what degree the normal patterns of lodgments change. It is fair to say that in this early stage there have not been significant changes in the pattern of lodgments. But again, it is terribly early days to know whether that should be a firm judgment or not.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The appropriation for the Department of Veterans' Affairs, an amount of $530m, stands fourth in the allocations for departments. Obviously, it is, in any estimation, an extremely large amount of money and one which, I believe, should have careful attention paid to it. However, as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) readily acknowledges, there are still enormous problems in relation to many of the claims that veterans put forward to the Department, to the Remuneration Tribunal or to the Repatriation Review Tribunal. Apart from those people who served in our armed forces but did not see active service, there are still approximately 636,000 veterans alive today in Australia who did see active service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When one goes through case after case of delays in this area-this is not a matter which I raise as a criticism of the present Minister, though I must say that I am not so charitable towards his predecessors-it seems that somewhere along the line there must have been an extreme lack of thrust, to put it clearly, from the very top to get the work done or a lack of any desire to try to unravel the problem or approach it in a new way. Obviously there are thousands of veterans in the system seeking to have their claims dealt with by the various tribunals and boards, thoroughly and sympathetically and to receive what are, they believe, their just entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of time that an individual spends in the system seems to be excessive in terms of a number of factors. Firstly, many veterans surely do not need to be there. I will elaborate on that point in a moment. Secondly, unlike Senator Tate, I believe, and this was the decision of the High Court of Australia, that the established situation was as it was set down in the Repatriation Act; that is, that the onus of proof has never been on the veteran to prove his case but in fact has been on the Department and upon the Repatriation Commission to prove that the disability was not war caused and therefore show quite clearly and plainly to the veteran that he was not entitled to benefit. The fact that it has been done the other way has nothing to do with the legislation, as we now know from the High Court, but has to do with maladministration. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that we could alleviate the costs to the taxpayer and the anxiety caused to veterans if we approached this problem from another angle and looked quite carefully at the various categories that come before the Remuneration Tribunal and considered whether they should be there. In other words, there should be automatic entitlement to pensions for certain categories of veterans upon application. This may seem as though it were a licence to spend money but, indeed, I believe that in many cases it could effectively save money. Other countries-I draw the Minister's attention in particular to an Act of the Canadian Parliament in relation to prisoners-of-war-indeed, have automatic entitlement. I will seek, probably in the next session, to bring forward a private member's Bill in relation to that if we cannot get any action in looking at categories of veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is not only prisoners-of-war from campaigns such as World War I, World War II, Korea and Malaya who could be given automatic entitlement. Surely we could also give that entitlement to certain categories of injuries such as severe arthritis, arising out of World War II or the Korean engagement. I believe that one way of doing this might very well be to review in a systematic way the various claims that have been approved. If there is upwards of a reasonable percentage-that may be argued about-we could see whether these people could be granted automatic entitlement. For the sake of argument let us take 75 per cent of claims of veterans who came from a particular theatre of war with a particular range of complaints. If 75 per cent of these claims, say, in the last five or 10 years, have been successful why not take that group of veterans and, if any further people from that theatre of war apply with claims that fall basically within those areas, grant them automatic entitlement?</PARA>
<PARA> In other words, let us unclog the system. Unless something is done I believe extreme hardship will continue to be visited on many of our veterans who feel disillusioned with the system. I am quite sure that every honourable senator is aware of this. I know that the Minister is well aware of this and is attempting, as well he might, to unclog the system, so I am not criticising. I am merely raising the point that we could all reply to the letters we all get from various veterans who served their country in, say, the the First World War, the Second World War or whatever, which state that they have fought for two and a half years, three years, or four years to get a claim heard and that it has been adjourned, brought up again and adjourned again. I believe that with the best will in the world the system as it operates at the moment probably does not have much flexibility in it. Indeed, it cannot move much further to accommodate the veterans. We have to look at taking some of the veterans out of the system by having automatic entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that one voice in the community would be raised against such an action. I think it is only by taking such a bold type of initiative in this area that we may be able to give justice to those veterans and set about refining our procedures so that never again will we get into a situation where somebody has to wait more than a maximum of six months to have his claim heard and reviewed. I believe that should be the maximum length of time taken within the system, given the fact that from now on we can keep much more comprehensive records within the Department of Defence and that we will be able to understand the problems of veterans much more sympathetically and in much more depth. Even if these types of things occur we may very well see in years to come the appropriation for the Department of Veterans' Affairs shrinking if not down to the bottom of the list, then well down to the bottom. I believe that spending more and more money on the veterans and less and less on the administration and operation of the Department and the various boards would be not only in the interests of the taxpayer but also very much in the interests of the veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the idea to the Minister that we may look at those types of possibilities and any others that may come up. I am quite sure that all honourable senators would be very much relieved if, in fact, they were able to respond in a much more productive way to these cries for help from our veterans by saying: 'Your type of problem will automatically entitle you to a pension, but if not straight automatic pension then, when you go to the Department, you will not have to wait any more than a couple of months to find out your entitlement'. That is the optimum towards which the Minister and every honourable senator here would like to work. I wonder whether or not we have to be a little more venturesome and a little more innovative and stop using the time-honoured system which has broken the back of so many of our veterans and has brought the entire system into such disrepute. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to follow up some of the matters raised by Senator Tate a few minutes ago. The Minister for Veteran's Affairs (Senator Messner) mentioned in relation to the judgment handed down by the High Court of Australia that there were several confusing aspects on which he or his Department had sought clarification. I have read the judgment, as have a number of honourable senators. Not being legally trained I suppose I did not see the confusing aspects. Could the Minister outline some of these confusing aspects and what sort of clarification is required? I notice that the Minister almost winced under the weight of that question. Perhaps it is not something that he could do here today. A number of honourable senators would be interested in finding out what sort of report might come from the Attorney-General's Department concerning this case. Perhaps in the future the Minister might be able to outline some of the questions that have been asked. He might even wait until the report has been received from the Attorney-General's Department so that there is no slight on the Attorney-General's Department for having outlined the questions before it has reported. A number of honourable senators would be interested. I did not intend to raise that matter but, as an answer was given to Senator Tate, I thought I should mention it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to ask the Minister this question: Were a number of cases set aside awaiting the judgment on the Nancy Law case? If so, how many? I think the Minister may have mentioned in this chamber that there were about 800 such cases. If those cases were set aside awaiting the judgment from the High Court, are proceedings now under way to conclude them before a report comes from the Attorney-General's Department? In other words, is the report from the Attorney-General's Department separate from the cases that are awaiting decision? Are those cases proceeding? If those cases are proceeding, could the Minister give any indication of how many have now been dealt with?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Dealing firstly with Senator Colston's questions, in regard to the implications of the case he has mentioned I have said that we are endeavouring to get some further advice on the matter. It is still before the Government so I am unable really to comment on it. I would be prepared to meet with the honourable senator's group of interested persons to discuss the judgment at any time. If the honourable senator would like to contact me I will see whether that meeting could be arranged. Perhaps a briefing by departmental officers could be arranged on the judgment and matters surrounding it. I would be quite happy to arrange such a meeting for the honourable senator if he thinks that would be useful to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I mentioned on an earlier occasion in the Senate that some 800 cases were outstanding-I think the number is nearer 880; nearly 900 cases. They were set aside during the period the case was being heard and until the decision was given by the High Court of Australia. The Department has taken steps to increase, as soon as possible, the number of persons available in the review bodies to make decisions about those cases. We hope that in the next few months we will clear that backlog of cases. There is no question of them being held over for any further action at this stage of the game. We are moving straight ahead with the determination of those matters following the judgment.</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the matters raised by Senator Macklin. The difficulties in the appeals system are fundamental to the system and, of course, are of the greatest concern to not only me as Minister but also officers in my Department. It is true that over the years there has been a substantial growth in the time it has taken to process, through the various levels of appeal within the Department, various applications for pensions and/or treatment. I think we need to review the history of this matter over the last few years in order to get it into proper perspective. In 1977 there was a very substantial change to the repatriation system as a result of the Toose report which was, I think, initially commissioned by the Whitlam Labor Government in 1972. This change involved the provision of reasons in respect of individual cases being heard by repatriation boards and the Repatriation Commission and, of course, that led to a very substantial amount of extra work being loaded on to the members of those appeal bodies in such a way that it very substantially slowed down the operation and decision making processes of the bodies. There was also a superimposition, if you like, upon the then appeal system which went no further than the Repatriation Commission at that time, of a further appeal system which was made up of the Repatriation Review Tribunal composed of semi-judicial people. Of course references now can go further to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, from there to the Federal Court of Australia and eventually to the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am pointing out to honourable senators is that the enormous changes that have occurred in the appeal system over the last five or six years have led to a different kind of appeal system to the one that previously applied. From memory, I can quote some rather graphic statistics to show honourable senators what differences this has caused. As I recall, at the Repatriation Board level, in 1970, the number of cases processed was some 30,000. In the latest year that I have in my mind the number processed was about 13,000, a drop of almost two-thirds. At that same time the number of people handling cases at the board level increased, I think, from three to nine. If those numbers are not correct they are of that order. The point about this is that there has been a very substantial fall in the number of cases being heard through the system and a very substantial increase in the number of people handling appeals within the Department, yet the number of days taken in order to process the appeals at all levels in the system has grown very substantially. </PARA>
<PARA> This indicates that there have been major changes and the effects of those changes have been to take the system further out than previously applied and this has led to the kinds of problems that we now see. The reasons for the changes have been substantially supported by ex-service organisations because these changes do bring benefits to the ex-serviceman. I think Senator Macklin would acknowledge that the system, rather than being inflexible, is full of opportunities for people to test their eligibility at various levels to an extent greater than would have applied before the amendments in 1977. Consequently, it is not without some concern that the result has been the extension of time to process these individual cases. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said all that and, I hope, having set out the background of the problem I acknowledge that there is substantial difficulty and that we need to address our minds to this problem. Along those lines, my Department is having discussions with the ex-service organisations, particularly the Returned Services League, in regard to methods by which we can change this process and in some way improve the situation. More particularly, in recent times we have appointed more people to repatriation boards, created more boards and established single delegates at the Commission level in order to be able to handle applications more quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> I take on board the points Senator Macklin made. They are matters which I think deserve examination. I assure him that I have no closed mind about any of the matters that might need to be examined in order to try to speed up the process. I mention too that in recent months there has been a substantial change in the way in which we handle medical opinions at the Repatriation Review Tribunal level. In May the Parliament passed an amendment to the law which States that if new medical opinions were offered at the RRT level there would be no automatic need to refer that information back to the Repatriation Commission before it could be further heard by that Tribunal. That, I hope, will lead to a substantial improvement in the processing of medical opinions at that level and will contribute to an improvement in the situation as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to pursue further a matter which I pursued during the Senate Estimates Committee hearings. It relates to the Department of Administrative Services and to a telephone connection for Mr Nixon, the Minister for Primary Industry, at his holiday home at Cape Conran in south-eastern Gippsland, Victoria. When I asked a question about this matter during the Estimates Committee consideration of the estimates of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, I was told that any telephone connections for Ministers was the responsibility of the department which the Minister represented. When I raised the matter under the Estimates Committee consideration of the Department of Administrative Services I was told:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Department of Administrative Services has no record of any such acquisition of an easement for a telephone line on behalf of either the Department of Primary Industry or Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA>I was seeking information from the Department of Administrative Services which is responsible for acquiring or buying land for any construction carried out for the Commonwealth Government. The answer I was given was that, no, it had no record of it. During debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Is it the sole responsibility of the Department of Administrative Services to purchase land or property for all Government requirements, or may land be purchased, or an agreement entered into, for an easement by some other department?</PARA>
<PARA>In the same debate, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, the Minister in charge of that the Department, said:</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the second matter-</PARA>
<PARA>That is the one to which I referred-</PARA>
<PARA>the acquisition of land or an easement for the installation of a telephone, the Department of Administrative Services is the department that handles all acquisition proposals for the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Attachment 'B' at page 5 of the report of Senate Estimates Committee H, which contains written replies to questions asked during the Committee's examination this year, states:</PARA>
<PARA> The following question was asked at page 576:</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLaren</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;' . . .but the report that I have received is that a private telephone service was connected at Mr Nixon's holiday house at an estimated cost of $10,000. . . '.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I interpose that the holiday house is at Cape Conran in south-east Gippsland. The document continued:</PARA>
<PARA> 'If it is not in these estimates, can I be told if it was in the previous estimates and whether there has been a charge on this Department of that installation?'</PARA>
<PARA> The answer is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1980-81 the standard connection fee of $120.00 was paid from Division 490-2, Item 03, administered by the Department of Primary Industry. </PARA>
<PARA>So we have the answer that in fact the Department of Primary Industry did pay $120 for the connection of a telephone to the holiday house at Cape Conran. The information I am seeking is: Who in fact paid for the cable which would have had to be run from Marlo to Cape Conran? Was that a charge on the Department of Primary Industry as I was led to believe by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle during previous estimates committee hearings, who said that when a telephone is connected for a Minister the charge is levelled at his Department? If that is not so, is that charge being borne by the Department of Communications which is under the administration of Mr Sinclair?</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we know that Mr Sinclair, another National Country Party Minister, is involved in interfering with the telecommunications system by paving the way to have telephone connections made at Lord Howe Island. So here we have National Country Party Ministers again involved. They are getting themselves very good perks at the taxpayer's expense. We revealed in the Parliament last week and again this week that they have purchased houses in the Australian Capital Territory with 45-year loans on which they are paying very low interest rates. All I am asking the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) is: At whose expense was the cable laid from the nearest connection at Marlo to Cape Conran? Was the cost borne by the Department of Communications and then passed on to every telephone subscriber or was it levelled against the Department of Primary Industry which again means that the cost has to be borne by the taxpayer? I would like to have an answer from the Minister before I pursue the matter further at some length. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have several questions which I would like to ask. Rather than put them all together I prefer to put some of them, at least, sequentially. Before putting the first question I observe that it is 19 November, the Appropriation Bills have not been passed and the Government does not have control of the Senate. It is indeed unfortunate for the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that the Governor-General is not a toady of the Opposition as the then Governor-General in 1975 was a toady of the then Opposition. Mr Fraser is indeed unfortunate that that is not the case. I observe also that the situation as perceived by most of the media today, with the Appropriation Bills not passed on 19 November and the Government not in control of the Senate, is very different from the situation as perceived in 1975 when the Appropriation Bills were not passed on 11 November.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I move to a few specific questions. I understand that on the morning prior to the meeting of Senate Estimates Committee H, which was on Monday, 12 October, what might be called a dry run was organised and presided over by the Secretary to the Department of Primary Industry at which all the first assistant secretaries were lined up and presented with the sorts of questions which it was anticipated they might receive from the Senate Estimates Committee. I ask: Is it customary for this Department to conduct such dry runs? If it is not customary to hold such dry runs of this nature why was it done on this occasion? Was it to make it as certain as possible that the first assistant secretaries got their lines straight and did not reveal some information which might be embarrassing to either the present Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) or one of the previous National Country Party Ministers? The second question concerns Mr Wallace who was not present at that Estimates Committee hearing. For as far back as I can remember Mr Wallace has been the representative from the dairy division at all Estimates committee meetings. I just seek some information as to whether Mr Wallace was on leave at that time and, if he was not on leave, the reason for his absence from Senate Estimates Committee H on 12 October. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several items in the appropriations which I could raise; for example, item 309-Rural re-establishment loans for veterans. Many of the veterans settled on the land after World War II were, of course, settled in the Riverland area of South Australia, an area which has had substantial economic problems for many years and which has a particular problem at this stage because of the very heavy production of canned fruit last year, both factors in the area having produced an extraordinarily large stockpile, and the diminishing overseas sales of canned fruit. I am informed that the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon), at a meeting in the Riverland last Monday, gave two reasons in response to questions from the fruit growers assembled as to why the Government had not up to this stage taken any action and, indeed, only a couple of weeks ago had got around to sending a reference on canned fruit to the Industries Assistance Commission. Perhaps I should more accurately say that he gave two excuses. The first was that the Government could not take any action and could not send off a reference to the IAC because the industry could not agree on what it wanted. Of course, that is the oldest Country Party subterfuge in the book. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, and more importantly, he said that the Government's hands were tied because of the Industries Assistance Commission Act and the requirement under the Act for matters to be referred to the Commission for investigation, inquiry and report prior to new forms of assistance being granted to industry. That might have been superficially a valid reason but it conflicts with one historical precedent and one contemporary precedent. The historical precedent was set in 1977 when on the eve of an election, without any reference to the IAC, the Government suddenly introduced its stupid $10 a head of stock assistance to beef producers. That $10 a head was paid to beef producers for, amongst other things, sterilising female cattle. Less than two years later there was a heavy demand and extremely high prices for cattle, the sterilisation of which the Government had subsidised in 1977-78, which should have been mated so that their progeny would be ready for the market in 1978-79. That is the sort of crass incompetence we expect from this Government, with its Ministry dominated by the rednecks of the National Country Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, that is not the real issue. The real issue is that in 1977 the constraints of the Industries Assistance Commission Act were not at all important. Straight off the top of Malcolm Fraser's head, the source of all the most crass schemes which this Government has introduced, came this beef industry assistance scheme which in the end cost a cool $117m. It was pointed out at the meeting last Monday that it was done then, and Richard-I am sorry, Peter-Nixon replied that that was done during an election campaign. I presume that the implication of that remark is that the law of the land is suspended when the Fraser Government is in the midst of an election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> The contemporary precedent is that there will be introduced into the Parliament-it has been deferred by the Government until the autumn session-a Dried Sultanas Production Underwriting Bill. No reference was given to the IAC as to whether such an underwriting scheme could be introduced without prior IAC inquiry and report. Senator Durack was asked yesterday by Senator McLaren whether the Minister for Primary Indusry or anyone else has sought an opinion on the legality of that Dried Sultanas Production Underwriting Bill vis-a-vis the Industries Assistance Commission Act. Senator Durack said he could not answer a question like that off the top of his head, which is not surprising. Senator McLaren then asked him whether he could bring an answer into the Senate today. Senator Durack said he would initiate inquiries and do his best. It has not yet arrived. The defence that I anticipated from the Government was that a general inquiry into fruit growing was conducted by the Industries Assistance Commission in 1975 and that that inquiry satisfies the requirements of the Industries Assistance Commission Act so far as the Dried Sultanas Underwriting Bill is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I pass no opinion about whether that would be an adequate response but I put on the record that the Government cannot have it both ways. If 'Richard' Nixon is to use the 1975 general reference on fruit growing as a justification, a validation, of the Dried Sultanas Underwriting Bill, it could be argued with equal validity that some assistance to canned fruit growers could have been initiated by the Government without further reference to the IAC for inquiry and report. In other words, Mr Nixon at that stage was following the time-honoured custom of National Country Party Ministers when caught in difficult positions-that is, to say anything that comes into their heads if it looks as if it will get them off the hook for the time being, then, when they are next cornered, to repeat the process. I have some other matters to raise but I think the officers and the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) have now had sufficient time in which to consult before answering the couple of questions which I put forward at the beginning of my remarks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before Senator Walsh rose I think Senator McLaren was asking further questions about the telephone connection to Mr Nixon's holiday residence. A written answer was provided, which was, I think, referred to by the honourable senator. I was on my way to the chamber when he was speaking so I may not have picked up the full gist of what he was saying. The written answer provided states that in 1980-81 the standard connection fee of $120 was paid from Division 490.2, item 03, administered by the Department of Primary Industry. Senator McLaren asked what was the actual cost of connection. The simple position is that the standard rule was applied. The connection was made within 16 kilometres of an exchange, hence the telephone was connected for the standard connection fee. The rules, which have been revised over the years gradually to ease the position of those subscribers who are not jammed next to a telephone exchange, have provided for some time now that if a person lives within 16 kilometres of an exchange that person pays the standard connection fee. Since that was the position in Mr Nixon's case the Department which was responsible for installing the telephone paid the standard connection fee and that was the end of the matter. I suppose that the actual cost of connection varies according to where the connection is made-its distance from the exchange, the terrain and all the other factors. Presumably that sort of detailed information would be available to Telecom Australia, which carried out the connection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Walsh has asked a series of questions which I will answer as I am able at this stage. He was concerned about what he described as a dry run prior to the Estimates committee hearings. My advice is that there was a discussion between officers concerned with the estimates before they appeared before the Estimates committee. I would not have thought that there was anything particularly unusual in that, but my advice is that there is a new secretary and a new deputy secretary to the Department of Primary Industry. They went through the documents, examining them and talking about their contents, prior to appearing before the committee. I do not see anything vaguely wrong with that. I suppose that if the reverse were the case the criticism might be made that people coming before the Estimates committees were ill-prepared or not prepared. A large number of people are brought into this chamber and into the other rooms where the Estimates committee hearings are held. They are expected as far as possible to have answers ready on the wide range of subjects on which they can be questioned. If the new secretary to the Department thought it desirable to have the sort of arrangement to which Senator Walsh referred, I can see no objection to it. As far as the presence of Mr Wallace is concerned, I understand that he was not here for the Estimates committee hearing; nor was the First Assistant Secretary (Fisheries). But Mr Wallace attended an Estimates committee debate in the House of Represenatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The sending of a reference on canned fruit to the Industries Assistance Commission was also referred to by Senator Walsh. The position was in part covered by Senator Walsh in what he had to say. In July the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) discussed with a delegation from the Australian Canning Fruitgrowers Association the possibility of an IAC reference but-this was the point adverted to by Senator Walsh-at that time there were differences of opinion within the industry concerning the need for an inquiry. It was agreed at that meeting that the matter should be discussed further within the industry and that the Minister would be advised of the outcome in due course. Since then there has been a further meeting, on 22 October, between industry representatives and the Minister and the industry representatives have now asked for an IAC inquiry. That request is being considered by the Government at the moment. I do not have access to a legal opinion of the sort requested yesterday by Senator McLaren. I do not know whether that opinion is available as yet. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the position in the beef industry in 1977 is concerned, it is all very well with the blessed wisdom of hindsight for one to be so clear in one's knowledge of what was a sensible thing to do at that time. In any event, it is now claimed by Senator Walsh that he accurately predicted the market for beef over subsequent years. If he did so, I congratulate him for either his perspicacity or his good fortune. Those honourable senators who cast their minds back to the position in 1977 will recall that that was a period when beef growers were in considerable difficulties in many parts of Australia. As I recall it there were both seasonal and market reasons-I speak from recollection-for the beef industry in Australia being in difficulty in that year. As a result, the Government took action which provided for payments to beef growers only under very limited circumstances. To be eligible, a beef producer had to have carried out one or more of certain specified animal health or husbandry procedures. There was a payment of $10 a head up to a maximum of $2,000 per producer and it applied only to those who were defined as eligible beef producers; that is, people who at that time were the owners of 50 or more cattle kept for beef production. With hindsight, as I have said, it is very easy to be critical of that measure, but I think it was welcomed at the time and in the circumstances at the time it was appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> Since I rose to my feet I have been advised that advice was provided by the Attorney-General's Department to the Department of Primary Industry on the matter raised by Senator McLaren but that it is not the practice to disclose the nature of the legal advice provided by the Attorney-General's Department in these circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise one matter in relation to the estimates for the Department of Primary Industry under division 494, which is entitled 'Bureau of Animal Health-including export inspection services-meat'. On 24 September I raised this matter in this place with Senator Chaney as the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry and I received a reply from him on 10 November. It relates to media reports at about that time that there had been the discovery of further meat switching at a certain meatworks in Melbourne. In my question I asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (b) Is the company named-Steigers Meat Supply Pty Ltd of Northcote-the same company mentioned by me on 8 March 1978?</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Had the company prior to March 1978 been the subject of a police investigation over allegations of a similiar nature?</PARA>
<PARA> (d) What, if any, Department of Primary Industry surveillance has been kept on the company in the intervening years?</PARA>
<PARA>In the reply which came from the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) through Senator Chaney the answer to the first part of the question, which related to media reports, stated that there had been the discovery of horse meat in a product labelled 'Establishment No. 775'. I understand from my own inquiries that the discovery came about as a result of the finding of horse bone in a meat separator. The answer to question (b) was yes. The Minister confirmed that it was the same company I mentioned in 1978. The answer to question (c) was yes, the company had been under Commonwealth Police investigation and that as a result Mr Egan of Bambra Exports Pty Ltd was convicted of offences under the Customs Act. It is more because of the answer supplied to question (d) that I am standing here now. In question (d) I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> What, if any, Department of Primary Industry surveillance has been kept on the company in the intervening years?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer supplied is:</PARA>
<PARA> In early 1979, the number of full time inspectors supervising the operations of Steigers was increased from one to two. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpose to say that from my trade information it is believed that even two inspectors are quite insufficient to supervise an establishment as large as Steigers Meat Supply (Aust.) Pty Ltd of Northcote. The answer continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Inspectors allocated to Steigers have been selected because of their experience in boning operations and were instructed to be alert to any indicators of illegal activity. Although allegations have been made in the past, investigations of the premises by inspection staff during pre-operational hygiene inspection over a long period have failed to reveal any indications of out-of-hours activity. </PARA>
<PARA>Unless I am terribly dumb, that does not tie in with the reported discovery of horse meat in product. I note that in the Melbourne Sun of 13 October this year the Company secretary, Mr Balcerek, claimed that that company had been done a disservice. The Sun reported:</PARA>
<PARA> The cartons were found in an establishment which was neither owned by nor under the control of Steigers Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA>Somewhere along the line there is confusion. The Minister is probably as confused as I am. Will the Minister take the matter on notice and supply an answer at some time in the future? We have in answer to question (d), a statement saying that over a long period the inspectors had failed to reveal any indications of out of hours activity. It could be presumed that the misdemeanour occurred in hours; I do not know. Supporting that, we have the company secretary claiming that the cartons were found in an establishment which was neither owned by nor under the control of Steigers. I was wondering whether I may have that matter cleared up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In reply to my question about the telephone connection for the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) stated that that telephone connection came within the guidelines, which I think he said provided that it had to be within 16 kilometres of the nearest telephone exchange. I have had representations from many people who live within that distance yet have had to wait a very long time to get a telephone connection. It appears to me that National Country Party Ministers in this Government get some special privileges. Revealed recently were the long term low interest home loan enjoyed by this particular Country Party Minister and what took place on Lord Howe Island when the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) was able to upset the scheduled program of Telecom Australia. I am wondering whether the Telecom program had already been upset by the telephone connection to a Minister's holiday house. Many members of parliament find it difficult to get from Telecom telephone connections for people, particularly farmers, who are in a permanent residence and come within the 16-kilometre guideline. Yet the Minister says that Mr Nixon's holiday house at Cape Conran in south-eastern Gippsland was able to get a connection because it came within that guideline. All that was needed was for his Department to pay a fee of $120 for the connection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What prompted me to raise the matter some time ago was that a State parliamentary committee from Victoria was in that area and saw the trench being dug. Having asked some questions about it the committee was informed that the work was to lay a cable so that Mr Nixon's holiday house could be connected. On asking what the cost would be the committee members were told-by people who should know because they are engaged in this work all the time-that it would cost in the vicinity of $10,000. Of course, I think this is a very cheap connection for Mr Nixon because it is not costing him anything. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister has said-before he came into the chamber-I read from the document from which he quoted the Department paid the $120 to connect the phone. It looks as though the taxpayer will have to pay the rest. The subscribers to Telecom have to share the whole cost. I put this matter on notice now to the Minister because we have already considered the estimates for the Department of Communications. This is one of the problems I have spoken about many times in Parliament. We have to run from one department to another to try to get a final answer. I cannot understand why the Department of Primary Industry did not have the answer today knowing that I raised the matter on three occasions. One was at the Estimates Committee. I raised the matter again last week during the debate on the appropriations for the Department of Administrative Services and I also raised the matter during consideration of the estimates for the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. Therefore, plenty of notice has been given. Yet today we find that the Minister cannot come up with an answer. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not blaming the present Minister because I do not think he would concur with those things which are being indulged in by National Country Party Ministers. I give notice that when we come to consideration of Additional Estimates for the Department of Communications in the autumn session I will seek an answer as to the cost of this installation of a telephone at a Country Party Minister's holiday home, away down in the back blocks in south-east Gippsland. Of course, I will also want to know whether another hotline has been installed. We were told by Senator Guilfoyle that all Cabinet Ministers now have a separate hotline installed to their homes-again at taxpayers' expense. When I asked the Minister about this she said: 'It will not be any additional cost as we will be able to use the facilities already there'. </PARA>
<PARA> When I make application for telephone connections on behalf of constituents who come to me particularly in built up areas, I am told that telephone connections cannot be made available because, what is known in Telecom language as a pair, is not available. If all pairs are taken up there can be no extra telephone communication until that pair becomes available; in effect that means when someone cancels a telephone service or when extra pairs are laid. In this case, so far as Ministers are concerned, overnight Telecom was able to find these extra telephone connections, known as hotlines, so that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcom Fraser) can keep in touch with a Minister at a minute's notice. I am not going to project why that needs to be so. It is a situation that has come about only in recent times. I am concerned as to whether this hotline has also been installed in the holiday house so when Mr Nixon's family happens to be on the phone and Mr Fraser wants to get in touch with the Minister he can do so by using the other line known as the hotline. That means that there are two phones in the house. </PARA>
<PARA> It all boils down to the fact that extra cost is being incurred by Country Party Ministers at the expense of the Australian taxpayer. We want an answer to this question. I warn the Minister now that I will be pursuing this matter. I think he knows that I am very tenacious in these things. I keep going until I get an answer. I will do this with some vigour unless an answer is provided before we come to the Additional Estimates in the autumn session. I give warning now that we require those answers. The Minister might recall that it took quite a few years to get a breakdown on the cost of official establishments. The Prime Minister always said that this was never done. He was also able to do it in answer to a Dorothy Dixer. This year, because of the changed numbers in the Senate, those answers were provided. I warn the Minister now that, with the changed numbers in the Senate, we want the answers. If they cannot be provided during the summer recess I ask that they be available when we come back here to look at the Additional Estimates in the autumn. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I invite Sentor McLaren to use some of his well-known tenacity by devoting himself to getting my telephone cut off. It is an unfortunate aspect of my life that I have a telephone. At any time of the day or night anyone who wishes to pick up the telephone book may ring me and talk with me. I do not regard that as a tremendous privilege. I regard it as an unfortunate adjunct of being a member of the Government. I very much doubt whether anyone in this country would think it at all strange that members of the Cabinet require to be in telephone communication with other people. It is thought to be necessary to ensure that when Ministers are away from their homes or offices they can be contacted. I doubt that it is likely to become much of a cause celebre. I would have thought that most Ministers of the Crown would be quite cheerful to think they could be insulated from the telephone occasionally but that is just not possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the risk of wasting the precious time of the Senate, I say that I doubt that I will ever get another holiday booking at Rottnest Island because there are no private telephones there. The manager of the island was woken up at 6 o'clock one morning and had to get me out of my cottage and take me back to his home to answer the phone. I have not got a booking since. It is highly unlikely, unless I can talk Telecom Australia, the Government or somebody into installing a telephone in one of the Rottnest cottages, that I will ever have the pleasure of a holiday on the island again. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing secret or sinister about the matter that Senator McLaren raised. Mr Nixon is a member of the Cabinet. He is apparently connected by telephone. The telephone was connected for the standard fee of $120 because it is within 16 kilometres of the exchange. The costs presumably are known to Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator has indicated that he intends to pursue this matter when the estimates for the Department of Communications are next before the parliament if an answer is not forthcoming sooner. I will refer those comments to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume), who represents the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) in this place, by raising my voice slightly and pointing in his direction. We will see whether an early reply can be obtained, as irrelevant as the question may be to the general national welfare. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a couple of observations about the Minister's reply. I am not doubting that Senator Chaney does not know the answers but I do not think that any effort has been made to find out. If Mr Wallace had been on leave I would have expected that, as the Committee met only a little over a month ago, a few people, or at least those close to the Department, would remember it. I will assume, for the time being at least, that Mr Wallace was not on leave and investigate some of the possible reasons why that was so. Mr Wallace, as we know, had a rather unhappy time before the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. It was obviously distressing to Mr Wallace. It was ultimately, of course, very much more distressing to his former Minister. I cannot recall the precise words used in the Senate Committee report but it said, in effect, that Mr Wallace was so evasive, among other things, that the Committee could not take his answers very seriously. There is a good reason for that; Mr Wallace was covering up for his Minister. With that unhappy experience for both-</PARA></TALK.START>

I know that the debate on the Estimates is wide ranging and that we have before us the Estimates for the whole of the Government's activities but I fail to connect the matters which are currently being raised by Senator Walsh with any item in the Estimates. I fail to see the relevance of the attendance of any public servant, unless it is said that questions which were asked could not be answered because of his non-attendance. I was the Minister at the table during that Estimates Committee hearing. I have no recollection of a question being put which could not be answered because a particular First Assistant Secretary or, indeed, any other officer was not present. Of course, there were questions which had to be followed up, but that is not at all unusual. Written answers have been provided for them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first matter I raise is that of the apprehension of Taiwanese fishermen who infringe Australian laws. During Estimates committee hearings I asked some questions about the apprehension of Taiwanese fishermen and the cost to the Australian taxpayer of that apprehension. An article in today's Canberra Times states that a Taiwanese fisherman faces gaol because he is unable to pay fines totalling $6,000 imposed by a court in Queensland. He has infringed Australian laws relating to fishing within Australian fishing zones. He will face a gaol term of six months if he cannot find that $6,000. One of the answers to my queries during the hearings of this Estimates Committee was that it cost the Australian taxpayer about $9,000 to apprehend these people. So even with this fine of $6,000 there is a discrepancy of $3,000 between the fine and the cost of apprehension.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Peter Baume" NAMEID="ME4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is probably some deterrent value.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apparently it is not of deterrent value because these people continually breach our fishing laws. By doing that they are depriving Australian fishermen of their living, in addition to the fact that in many cases they are fishing out many of the areas on which our own fishermen depend. I think the Government should take some action to see that these penalties are very much increased. I also ask whether any money is recovered by the Australian Government from the sale of these confiscated vessels. I was told that in some cases-I am speaking only from memory now-the captains of these vessels were able to buy them back by tender. So it does not appear to me that the fines that are imposed are a deterrent to these people. They seem to be continually breaching our fishing laws. Has the Government, through the Department of Primary Industry, which handles the fishing industry in Australia, given any consideration to tightening up the laws and to making these penalties much greater so that we will have a deterrent, as was suggested by Senator Baume, to prevent these people depriving our fishermen of a living not only in the short term but also in the long term because many of these areas will be fished out?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point put forward by Senator McLaren is an interesting variation on the user pays principle. It might be termed the 'abuser pays principle'. He is suggesting that we should ensure that penalties imposed on these offenders are adequate to ensure recovery of costs. He points to the present case where, he says, there is a cost of apprehension of $9,000 and a fine imposed of $6,000. He asks: Does that really not show inadequate penalties? To some extent Senator McLaren answered the question himself because he also suggested that in the instant case the fisherman cannot pay, or may not be able to pay, and then faces a term of imprisonment of some six months. I suppose the consolation we have is that had he been fined $12,000 he might have faced a term of imprisonment of one year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, if he cannot pay, the cost of imprisonment will be added to the very considerable costs of apprehension and, no doubt, of prosecution. So there is no guarantee that, simply by imposing a stiff monetary penalty, one will get to the position where there is a recovery of costs because, as in the example put forward by Senator McLaren in Committee today, it may well be that that simply increases ultimately the cost charged to the Australian taxpayer for care, maintenance and sustenance over a period of imprisonment. I do not have any recent figures as to the cost of imprisonment. Senator Evans, who used to take an interest in these matters, might have something he can contribute. I know that the cost is considerable. It is somewhere between the costs of being in an aged persons hostel and in a hospital. It is not cheap; and if imprisonment follows, undoubtedly there will be a considerable added impost to the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer provided in writing to the Estimates Committee following the questions asked by Senator Archer, with subsequent follow-up questions by Senator McLaren, about the costs of apprehension of a fishing vessel picked up the fact that revenue of $91,000 was obtained from the sale of two vessels, the Hwa Herng Nos 51 and 52, with this revenue being collected by the Department of Administrative Services. Notwithstanding that there were charges against that under other votes, it would appear that there is a substantial accrual to revenue in that particular transaction. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the final point I wish to make is simply that the Government, of course, is concerned that there should be adequate penalties in areas where they perhaps get historically out of date. I cannot say on the run whether there is that problem under the legislation that applies in these cases. I will refer Senator McLaren's suggestions to the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) and ask him to examine whether the penalties are adequate, given the seriousness of these offences. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment on the answer of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney). He referred to the added cost to the Australian taxpayers if these people were gaoled for a longer term. The very thing we want is some deterrent. I think that it would be a cheap price to pay in the long run. With the imposition of more severe penalties and perhaps longer gaol terms the message might seep back to Taiwan of the treatment that these people will receive if they infringe our laws. The Minister has reminded me of the very severe penalties which are imposed in Thailand when Australians are caught trying to smuggle drugs out of that country. I think that the incidence of this is not as great now that the message has got through to young Australians that some of their countrymen are suffering very severe consequences and very long gaol sentences in Thailand. That is a good warning and a deterrent such as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Peter Baume, spoke about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The same sort of penalty ought to be applied to these fishermen from Taiwan, and anywhere else for that matter, who poach in our waters. It is a very serious matter. If the average person were to pick up the newspaper and see the headline which I have quoted 'Taiwanese fisherman faces jail'-he was unable to pay a fine of $6,000-it would just go over his or her head because such a person is not interested in that aspect. But a lot of people are interested, particularly the people who make their livelihood out of fishing. That is something which we as members of parliament have to do all we can to protect. We have to protect the livelihood of those fishermen. At this stage I am talking only of fishermen. Now that the Minister has stated that what I have said will be drawn to the attention of the proper authorities, I hope that some action will be taken to overcome the problem with which fishermen, particularly in northern Australia, are faced. Every time one of these persons is apprehended, as we have been told, it costs about $9,000 to run them down. Then there are the court costs and, on top of that, the extra costs involved in keeping them in custody. The sooner we can put a stop to this the better. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter which I wish to raise-my colleague Senator Walsh has referred to it-is the problem facing the canned fruit industry in South Australia, particularly in the Riverland area at Renmark. Over the years that I have been a member of this place, I have pleaded with the Government to liquidate some of the loans that were made to the canning industry in South Australia, which the Dunstan Labor Government did when it was in office, to help the growers over a stile. We were able to write off the loan and did not ask for it to be repaid. To my knowledge, despite my many pleas in this place, the Commonwealth Government has never been prepared to do that-not that it would have solved the problem which now faces the cannery at Berri. The cannery is in desperate trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> My State colleague Mr Brian Chatterton, a member of the Legislative Council in South Australia, who was the Minister of Agriculture prior to the 1979 election and is now the Opposition spokesman on primary industry, had a few pertinent comments to make this week. Yesterday's Adelaide Advertiser reports Mr Chatterton as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The IAC should not confine its enquiry just to growers,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> 'If there is going to be a reduction in canned fruits production in Australia this will mean a reduction in cannery throughputs which will affect cannery workers and the rest of the community who are dependent on their spending.'</PARA>
<PARA>There are many local people in the Riverland area of South Australia who depend on employment by the Riverland cannery. If this cannery ceases operation, there will be desperate problems. The Department of Social Security-Senator Chaney's Department-will be called upon to find a great deal of money to allow these people even to exist. The Advertiser went on to report:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Chatterton said he was worried that a lot of growers were pinning their faith on a tree-pull scheme to resolve their problems. </PARA>
<PARA> 'I don't think this alone is the answer,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> 'While there does not at present appear to be any future for many growers to continue producing canning fruit, there is also very little room for them in other traditional horticultural industries.'</PARA>
<PARA> 'Just helping them to pull out trees would not restore their properties to commercial viability'. </PARA>
<PARA> He said the Federal Government's decision to delay consideration of assistance until late next year would impose heavy strains on growers and cannery workers, who had been told on Monday by the Australian Canning Fruit Corporation of heavy cuts in fruit intake this season, and a probable 50 per cent surplus of unsold fruit as a result. </PARA>
<PARA>That problem will be compounded by the situation that now exists in South Africa. Yesterday at a rural Press Club meeting, I happened to sit beside a South African. He told me that his country has problems of over production and declining markets. Therefore, having been told that and knowing the problems that we face locally, it does not appear to me that the canned fruit growers of South Australia have a very rosy future. Possibly the same situation faces fruit growers in the Shepparton area of Victoria. As Mr Chatterton said, even if the Government refers this matter to the Industries Assistance Commission it will be well into next year before the Commission makes any recommendations and an even longer period before any such recommendations could be implemented. Therefore, I hope that the Government is forewarned about the problem that exists. The Government created difficulties in the South Australian Riverland, for wine grape growers in particular, when it increased massively the excise on brandy, raising it to a level of 83 per cent. Many hundreds of growers in that area are still suffering the effects of that impost. As I said recently, when we were dealing with the report of the Australian Wine Board, the production of brandy in the Riverland of South Australia is at a very low ebb. That is a problem in itself. People who were growing grapes for the manufacture of brandy suffered a severe blow as a result of the level of excise being increased to 83 per cent. The Government subsequently reduced that figure by 3 1/2 per cent or 4 per cent and its supporters went round the country claiming that it had reduced the excise on brandy. They did not explain that the Government had first raised the level to 83 per cent. Some tried to explain away that action by stating that there had been a savage increase in brandy excise when the Whitlam Government was in office. Any such increase was not so severe as to put any grower off his block or to place him in a desperate financial situation. However, when a massive, additional increase occurs and the level is raised to 83 per cent, a real problem occurs. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, many of those who are affected are mixed growers. They produce not only grapes but also fruits for canning such as apricots and peaches, and are now to be faced with another problem. Also, the cannery workers face the loss of their jobs. If that happens it will have an effect on the small business people in the Riverland. Thus, we face a very chaotic and serious situation. I hope that the Government takes some note of what has been said, especially by Senator Walsh earlier and by me in repeating what my colleague in South Australia, Mr Chatterton, has said, and that remedial action will be taken to ease the suffering of the residents of the Riverland of South Australia. </PARA>

<PARA>I move this amendment because tonight is General Business night, a night for the consideration of General Business by the Senate. The amendment that I moved, in fact, involves some matters of Government Business and gives them some priority over what would normally be considered General Business. The amendment that I have moved was, in fact, a proposal, as I understand it, which was agreed to and received some agreement this morning at a meeting between the Whips. In fact, the order of General Business motion moved by Senator Chaney was later altered to suit the desires of the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I think the first principle involved is that General Business is the business of the whole Parliament and not just the business of the Government. The Government's proposal involves a resumption of debate on ministerial papers. About 11 minutes of debating time remains for those papers. We certainly have no objection to that. It is then proposed by the Government that for an hour and 20 minutes we deal with the notices of motion which are on the Notice Paper. I am not denying that they are important notices of motion. In fact, the first one is Senator Chipp's, I believe. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chipp does not particularly want to talk about it. But if it were to be debated properly it would involve a debate running for much longer than an hour and 20 minutes. It is then proposed to break into this and go back to Senator Missen's motion on the proposed Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills, et cetera. We believe that it is more appropriate and more sensible to do what the Whips proposed-that is, to deal with Order of the Day No. 1 on the Parliament's appropriation and staffing, a matter which could be considered a government matter because it involves a select committee of the Senate on which the Government had a majority. This is a matter which we consider important to the future running of this Parliament and the running of this House. We have said that many times and we believe it is appropriate that that be discussed first. We believe that Senator Missen's Order of the Day No. 176 relating to the proposed standing committee for the scrutiny of Bills is also important to the operations of this whole Parliament and, indeed, of this chamber. It is something that should be discussed. It is more appropriate to discuss it next. The fourth item is more or less a machinery motion, although it may provoke some debate, relating to the monitoring of proceedings in the Senate to assist the Whips in their job. I am sure some differences of opinion, which will cross party lines, will be expressed on that matter on both sides of the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Chaney has come into the chamber, moved this motion and given no explanation for this really clumsy procedure whereby we would go on to deal with ministerial papers for an hour and 20 minutes, which is a derisory time for consideration of the subject matter of Senator Chipp's first notice of motion let alone the other matters on the Notice Paper.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I could clarify the situation by pointing out the position as I understand it. Normally, Thursday night is devoted essentially to General Business and we proceed with General Business by going down the Notice Paper. In the course of the last week two matters arose which, by general consensus, were to be part of this evening's debate. One matter concerned a motion moved by Senator Missen and the other concerned Senator Jessop's Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing. Normally, as we have done before with Senator Missen, we try to find a time slot during the General Business time for matters such as these to come on. I wish to make it perfectly clear that precisely that arrangement was made by me and both Senator Missen and Senator Jessop agreed that the time slot in which they would be placed tonight was acceptable to them. It has been my clear understanding throughout today, it having been confirmed with me, that they were perfectly happy that that should be so. I understand that earlier today the Australian Democrats indicated that they were happy with the order of General Business and the 9.30 p.m. situation but changed their minds later, as they are entitled to do. I simply say that the order of business as presented to the Senate is absolutely normal; that is, that we have General Business tonight but we permit the intervention of two matters that came up during the week. Normally, as far as possible on General Business night we go down the Notice Paper and every honourable senator has the right to indicate whether he desires to have his motion debated. If my recollection is correct, I was informed that Senator Chipp wanted to debate the first motion but not the second motion. That is my understanding of the matter. If there is any confusion about this matter, I regret it. It certainly is not of my making. This motion was put forward with absolute good will to meet the wishes of the Senate. I commend to the Senate the motion as moved.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will continue the remarks I was making before the suspension of the sitting for dinner. As far as the Australian Democrats are concerned, I promise that we will give Senator Carrick and the Government the good will that he has asked for in rearranging the business paper. I am sure that such good will will be forthcoming from the Australian Labor Party. Senator Carrick has said, quite properly, that Thursday night is not the night for Government Business; it is private members' night, to coin a phrase. I should have thought that it would be the wish of the Senate, the majority of the senators from all parties being private members, to determine what we debate tonight and what we do not debate. Senator Carrick may want certain items to be dealt with first, but the rest of the Senate may disagree with that. With great respect-I do not mean this offensively-this is none of Senator Carrick's business. In saying that, I mean that this is none of the Government's business. This is the business night of the Senate and it is for the back benchers in the Senate to determine what business shall be discussed and in what order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the business paper stands at the moment, acceptance of the original motion as moved by Senator Chaney will mean that General Business will proceed. It so happens that I have the first call. I have a brilliant speech already prepared on the first item on the agenda. But in my judgment there are other important matters that have arisen. My matter-the civil defence of Australia in the case of a disaster-has been on the Notice Paper for, I think, over a year and would certainly need more than 1 hour 20 minutes, the only time allotted tonight, to debate. There is no urgency about it but I believe there is some urgency about the matter Senator Jessop, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Paliament's Appropriations and Staffing, wishes to put before the Senate and that of equal importance is the matter that Senator Missen wishes to put before the Senate this evening. As eager as I am to have my motion debated, I would be happy to forgo that because I believe there are other more important matters for the Senate to debate for the good of back benchers or private members of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the matters which Senator Jessop and Senator Missen wish to raise? I do not want to pre-empt what they may have to say, but Senator Jessop has chaired a most important committee which deals with the rights of the Senate, the rights of private senators and how the appropriations and staffing of the Senate shall be determined. It is a matter of high principle as to whether the Executive, which is supposed to be separate from the Parliament under our Westminster system, shall determine what we have, how much and how often or whether those determinations should be made by this chamber. All of the 64 honourable senators, who sit here as individuals, maybe less the six Ministers who are--</PARA>

I think that that is a question of paramount importance. Seeing that the report of this Committee, on which I understand all parties were represented, has been presented to the Parliament and is ready to be debated, I cannot think of a more urgent matter to debate this evening. Senator Missen also has a matter to bring forward to which one of his colleagues will move an amendment. The Democrats are privy to that and we will support the Missen motion together with the amendment moved by his colleague. I understand that the Labor Party also will do that. Senator Missen proposes the setting up a committee to look at the sort of legislation which can erode civil liberties and to report on such legislation to the Senate. It is an incredibly important matter. It is the judgment of the Democrats that those matters are more important and should take precedence. We are not speaking now as a political party; we are speaking as five private members of the Senate. I understand that Senator Grimes has already spoken on behalf of 27 private members of the Labor Party. We are in agreement. Therefore we will support the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to enter into any disputation with Senator Carrick on this matter. We have so many important matters to debate tonight. It could be settled in a very short time and I hope it will be.

Very briefly let me put on the record that I just happened, being a hoarder by nature, to have kept a piece of paper that was brought to my desk at mid-morning today. It was a supplementary order of business of the Senate which came from Senator Carrick's office. It states: 'At 8 p.m.' Firstly, there are 11 minutes of ministerial papers. Secondly, there are orders of the day listed. Senator Jessop's report is first up after the papers. Then there is the scrutiny of Bills, the Missen matter, and so on. I have a note from a member of my staff dated today and timed at 12.50 p.m.-just before 1 o'clock. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Chipp, Senator Macklin has notified me to say that the Government has rearranged business after 8 p.m. Your notice of motion is now first after approximately 10 minutes of papers. Is this OK? Do we need to oppose it? Please advise. </PARA>
<PARA>Are these the words of a man-Senator Macklin-who has made a deal with the Government Whip? Are these the words of a person who has made a deal with Senator Kilgariff and who immediately comes down to my office and asks me as Leader of the Party: 'Do we go ahead with the Government or not?' I do not want to score points on this. Mr President, I ask Senator Carrick through you: Can we leave this at best as a misunderstanding and not tell people in this place that they have changed their minds, that they have changed grounds, or that it is a matter of record that we have gone back on an agreement? I reluctantly put that on the record because there are far more important things for the Senate to debate tonight. I shall resume my seat after having put the view very strongly that I believe that after the continuation of the presentation of papers the Senate ought to afford Senator Jessop the opportunity of speaking to the excellent report the Committee has produced. It has done tremendous work. The Senate should allow other members of that Committee and other honourable senators to speak and vote on that report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to enter into this debate for a very short period to make a comment or two about what was said before dinner and subsequently, and to tell the Senate that I appreciate the courtesy and the interest that the whole of the Senate is displaying towards the report that has been presented by the tripartite committee, the Senate Select Commitee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing, that I was privileged to chair. It is good to know that there is some sort of unanimity in the Senate with respect to the need to change the system of appropriations and staffing of Parliament and to put the control of these important aspects in the hands of the Parliament, which is a proper action to take. It reflects the opinions that have been voiced on both sides of both Houses of Parliament over 21 years. I think it is a very important document that ought to be discussed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also very important for us to remember that in order to maximise the impact of that report the Government's view should be obtained. I think the last time I spoke on this subject I suggested that it was a matter of courtesy that the Government should respond to this in order that what we are suggesting is given the maximum support and co-operation of the Government, which I think is a very important matter. I am pleased to hear, and I appreciate very much, the courtesy that was extended to me today by Senator Macklin who asked me whether this debate should ensue earlier or later in the evening. Unfortunately, when I tried to get back to Senator Macklin he was in this place making a speech. Senator Chipp had the courtesy to ring my office, and my research officer quite properly indicated to Senator Chipp's secretary, or whoever took the message, that I had arranged for the select committee members who are present here, including Senator Mason, to have a discussion with Senator Carrick in his office at 5.15 p.m. Subsequently, if my memory is correct, Senator Mason rang me. I told him that I believed it was important that we have a discussion with the Leader of the Government at 5.15 p.m. and that perhaps we would come to some arrangement subsequently. Senator Chipp mentioned earlier that he had not had a response from me. I apologise for that, but it was not negligence on my part. I am happy to get up here and respond to that. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that originally some arrangement was made that the item we all regard as very important would be first on the list of business tonight. But early today I was presented with a revised list with which I agreed, believing that there was a need for some rearrangement of the business. I agreed to go ahead with the proposition that was put to me by the Government Whip. In the meantime, I responded to a request from the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Chipp) and the Democrats' Whip to indicate my views before 8 o'clock. I think I did that at about 6.15 p.m. I told Senator Chipp over the phone of the previous occurrence when I had been shown the rearrangement of business by my Whip. Believing that that matter had been discussed, I agreed to it. I stand by that explanation and I honour my commitment to the Whip and say I am prepared--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very happy about that. I am breathlessly awaiting the opportunity to present my case. Another point I should mention is this: In discussion we learned that the Government had agreed in principle with many of the matters that are implicit in the report and its recommendations. There are some areas that perhaps need some negotiation. The Government, I think quite properly, suggested to the Leader of the Australian Democrats that he should talk to the President. The President has one or two problems associated with the report that I think can be easily overcome. It is only a question of talking with him and explaining in a little greater detail what the Committee's report intends.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Regrettably the House of Representatives is not sitting at the moment. Therefore, it is unfortunate that the Leader has not been able to consult with the Speaker. After all, the recommendations of this report involve the House of Representatives. The Government has made some comments to our committee in private with which I do not agree. I am quite sure that the Committee does not agree with them. But the Leader of the Government (Senator Carrick) has indicated that he is prepared to discuss them. He is flexible enough to deal with this matter. Therefore I think it is fair to suggest, although I want the debate to proceed tonight, and the Leader of the Government is anxious that this should happen-I believe he is interested--</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I would not for a minute suggest that there is anything wrong with the figures that are contained in the document. I have no doubt as to their accuracy. I merely say that they really are quite useless and provide none of the answers which many of us would think should be provided by such a set of figures. The reason why they do not do so is that the accounts are not set out in a way that clearly identifies those accounts which are national accounts, those which are State-like and those which are local. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to note that the Commonwealth Grants Commission Amendment Bill is before the Senate. I certainly hope that it will be passed before the Senate rises. I refer to the Statement of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The unique nature of Government in the Territory, where the Commonwealth is at the same time responsible for the State, Local Government and National functions, means that the Government has a responsibility to the residents of the territory as well as the whole Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>It is important that the Grants Commission get on with the inquiry into Australian Capital Territory finances as soon as possible. I hope it may be done in time for the Government to see that next year's accounts of receipts and expenditure are presented in a way that shows not only the people of the Australian Capital Territory but also the people of Australia, and particularly their representatives in this place, what the true financial position is, whatever in fact that may be. The statement shows that there is an excess of expenditure over receipts of $387,413,172. That is the sort of figure that, in the short time in which I have been here, I have come to see as being in a sense misquoted and misused in this place without which of the expenditures of the Commonwealth it relates to being in any way identified. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall not develop the matter further tonight because there are other matters which clearly need to be spoken about. It is time that we had statements which tell us which property is ratable and what proportion of the rates is paid by the citizens, which property is not ratable because it belongs either to embassies or to the Commonwealth and how much of the cost of running the Lower Molonglo Water Control Centre is reasonable in light of the size of the population. A number of other questions needs to be answered. I welcome the Bill to which I have referred. I hope that, next year, we can have statements that are meaningful and helpful and not merely series of figures in a book as we have before us at present. </PARA>

<PARA> (2) That the foregoing Resolution be communicated to the House of Representatives by Message. </PARA>
<PARA>On 29 June this year, Senator Douglas McClelland, the Deputy Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing, and I released the report of the Committee. For many years now honourable senators and honourable members on both sides of the Senate and House of Representatives chambers have been concerned that to fulfil and maintain its function properly, the Parliament should make such arrangements as are necessary to achieve its proper constitutional relationship with the Executive, in practice as well as in theory. Indeed, the Select Committee discovered that a common source of concern to most parliaments throughout the world was the growing imbalance in the relationship between Parliament and the Executive, the rapidly increasing power and influence of the Executive, the need for Parliament to strengthen its oversight and check of Executive activity, and the concurrent need for the Parliament to regain or assert greater independence and autonomy in regard to its own internal arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate first drew attention to this matter as long ago as 1965, and the report of the Select Committee traces the history since then. That history shows widespread concern that has continued unabated to the present day. It has, for example, been almost a recurring theme of the reports of Senate Estimates Committee A. The report of the Select Committee now gives the Senate a chance to do something about the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Select Committee recognised that the present constitutional arrangements place financial initiative firmly in the hands of the Executive and concluded that this is a proper arrangement for Government appropriations, but not for the appropriations for the Parliament. The arrangement which best recognises the relationship between the Parliament and the Executive is for the appropriations for each House to be contained in a separate amendable Bill which would not require a Governor-General's message and which would be capable of introduction in either House. This arrangement would underpin the independence of the Parliament and yet would still allow the Executive the opportunity to influence each House's appropriations on the floor of the respective chambers. I think that is an important point to remember. The Committee has not, of course, suggested that the machinery to amend the Constitution be now put in motion. However, a proposal to seek such an amendment could well be added to other proposals when the occasion next arises. In the meantime, and within the limitations imposed by the Constitution, it is still possible to make new arrangements to achieve a desirable measure of autonomy for the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has recommended that the appropriations for the Parliament be removed from the Bill for the ordinary annual services of the Government and included in a separate Appropriation Bill. In addition, it has recommended that each House establish a committee, with provision for representation of the Executive, charged with the task of examining the parliamentary estimates and agreeing to them with or without modification prior to their inclusion in the Parliamentary Appropriation Bill. This arrangement produces both a desirable level of autonomy for the Parliament and also preserves the Government's examination from the standpoint of its budgetary policy. The Select Committee's investigation concerning staffing confirmed the cause for alarm which has been expressed in the past. The administrative procedure imposed by government has meant that, without the agreement of the Public Service Board, a staffing proposal has virtually no chance of approval by the Executive Council. The history of the debate surrounding this matter shows that the Senate, in particular, believes that the Board is not qualified in matters concerning staffing of the Parliament to be given what virtually amounts to a power of veto over the Parliament's proposals. It was partly with the problems of staffing the Parliamentary departments in mind that the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration developed proposals for the enactment of common legislation to cover Commonwealth employment generally. The Royal Commission stated that Parliament might consider the appropriateness of taking advantage of the provisions it had proposed so that the two Houses could apply the main features of Commonwealth employment to the parliamentary service, while reserving, for special determination by each House power to develop particular features. </PARA>
<PARA> The Public Service Board's submission to the Committee concluded with a list of features that a possible revision of Parliament's control of its own staffing might include. The Select Committee endorsed the proposals with the exception of the suggestion that it be mandatory for the Presiding Officers to obtain and consider the advice of the Board on rates of pay and terms and conditions of service. To make this suggestion shows a disregard for the position of the Board in relation to the Parliament. The view of the Royal Commission is far more enlightened: That the Parliament should have access to the Public Service Board for advice whenever that was considered necessary or desirable by the Presiding Officer. The Select Committee has pointed out that these changes can be achieved by a simple amendment to the Public Service Act. For reasons of time I will not canvass the details of the other two recommendations. Suffice it to say that they complete a reasoned and responsible approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the evidence that, in the majority of countries throughout the world, the respective parliaments and Executives have made arrangements which provide for real autonomy in relation to parliamentary appropriations and staffing, the Select Committee could understand that there may be a reluctance on the part of the Government to agree to an immediate total reform package. In addition, the House of Representatives may determine that in some areas, other arrangements may be more suitable for its administration. The Committee was mindful of the need for an experimental approach to be adopted in making any new arrangements for appropriations and staffing, especially in a bicameral parliament where there is a sharing of certain services such as the Library, the Reporting Staff and those areas administered by the Joint House Department. For these reasons the Committee believed that the Senate, and where appropriate the Government, should agree to a trial of the proposed arrangements. Mr Temporary Chairman, there is nothing radical or sinister about the Committee's recommendations. The United Kingdom has had similar arrangements in operation for three years; the United States of America has had similar arrangements in operation for 60 years and Canada has had similar arrangements in operation for 114 years. The report of the Select Committee points the way for the Senate, and ultimately the Parliament, to now achieve a real measure of independence and autonomy in regard to its appropriations and staffing. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable senators have a good look at the number of witnesses that we examined during our inquiry they will observe that quite eminent people from outside this organisation who are interested in Parliament appeared. For example, I think Professor Reid worked within the precincts of this Parliament, in the House of Representatives, for a number of years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I think the Speaker was talking about single line appropriations. We do not suggest that. We have a model Bill that provides for an appropriate line dealing with various estimates of the different parts of this Parliament. Those particular lines in the Estimates would be subject to dissection and examination by the Senate as a whole. All honourable senators and members of the House of Representatives would be able to scrutinise the various elements within the administrative control of the Senate and the House of Representatives. There is nothing to fear in the Committee report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It may be interesting to the Senate to know that as part of my education in the methods being adopted overseas I journeyed to Canada and the United Kingdom. Senator Missen had a private consultation with the Speaker of the House of Commons when he was out here a year or two ago. The system is working well in the United Kingdom and it is working well in Canada. The secretary to the Committee, Mr Peter Murdoch, with our research officer, Mr Cleaver Elliot, have been magnificent in providing the research necessary for the Committee. I pay a tribute to them for the work they have done. As a matter of courtesy I instructed the secretary to forward copies of the report to the Parliament of Canada. I think the Committee can feel quite proud of the fact that the administrative officer or the Speaker of the Canadian Parliament requested an additional 24 copies of that document. Perhaps the example we have set in this report may well be emulated by the Canadian Parliament. Though it has persisted with a system such as this for 114 years I believe it can learn something in this regard from the Senate Select Committee report. I was able to speak with the administrative officers and Deputy Speaker of the Parliament in the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, the Speaker of the Parliament was not present at the time I was there. He had Asian flu or something of that nature and was on sick leave. </PARA>

It is quite anxious to learn something of the progressive move implicit in the document we are discussing tonight. After all, it is an historic document because nothing has happened since Federation to improve the position of the Parliament with respect to the important subject that we are discussing. I was encouraged to find that since 1978 the British House of Commons-the Westminster system that we occasionally claim to be the mother of this Parliament-has adopted a similar sort of system and it is working well. Certainly, in the first stages of the administrative changes there were some bugs associated with it. We would expect that to happen here. The Government may well have some reservations about some of the suggestions in the report. Senator McClelland, Senator Robertson, Senator Mason and I appreciate that. We want to demonstrate to the Government of Australia that we are unanimous in our intent to have this reform initiated and brought into effect. We think that it is appropriate for the Senate to demonstrate the example to the House of Representatives over a trial period. I believe that the House of Representatives will be anxious to do something about it. I see that my time is up. I have a letter from Senator Rae, who posed certain questions relating to the report, and a copy of my reply to his questions. I seek leave to incorporate those two letters in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>8 September 1981 Senator D. S. Jessop,</PARA>
<PARA>Chairman,</PARA>
<PARA>Senate Standing Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing,</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra, ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Jessop,</PARA>
<PARA> I read with interest the very good Report of your Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I would like to add some suggestions for consideration:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. I believe that a simpler title for the proposed Committee would be 'The Senate Standing Committee on Administration', rather than the proposed title of 'Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing'. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. With regard to the proposal that the President should chair the Committee, I would point out that it is also proposed that the Committee would examine and consider the proposals of the President and Officers of the Senate in relation to the Estimates, and also would advise the President by recommendation to him in relation to staffing. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances, it would seem inappropriate for the President to be the Chairman of the Committee, and also the person whose Estimates are examined and to whom the recommendations are made. </PARA>
<PARA> It would seem to me to be more appropriate that the Chairman of the Committee should be in a position to advise the President, rather than talk to himself. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. I note that it is proposed that the two leaders, (of the Government and of the Opposition), should be members of the Committee. The experience of the Standing Orders Committee has been that it becomes difficult to arrange suitable meeting times where you have a Committee so constituted, and I would suggest that provision be made for the leaders to nominate other Senators to represent them. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. It seems to me that the Report does not make clear the proposed procedure for the Committee's enquiries-for instance, would the Committee advertise its hearings, call for submissions at large, take evidence from any person who wished to be heard, or would there be limitations, and if so, what limitations. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. It would seem to me to be important that this Committee should be considered within the structure of the total Senate Committee organisational system which it is proposed should be discussed and determined before the end of this Session. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. It does not appear clear from the Report the way in which matters involving the Joint House Department will be dealt with, and whilst I acknowledge that this is a Senate Committee, dealing with the Senate Department, it does seem that it would be desirable to give some appropriate thought to the inter-relationship with the Joint House Department, particularly in view of the likelihood that new technology will be introduced into the Parliamentary sphere. Such new technology is expensive, and questions arise as to by whom it would be administered, and just how it would be used. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope you find the foregoing comments constructive, and may I congratulate the Committee on their Report. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,  PETER RAE</PARA>
<PARA>24 September 1981 Senator Peter Rae,</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra, ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Rae,</PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for your letter of 8 September 1981 concerning the Report of the Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing. </PARA>
<PARA> I have now read your suggestions with interest and, whilst I can not speak for the other Senators who served on the Committee, I propose to circulate your letter and my response for their information. </PARA>
<PARA>Comment No. 1: I would have no objection to the Committee being called the Administration Committee rather than the Appropriation and Staffing Committee, should that be preferred. </PARA>
<PARA>Comment No. 2: I do not see any difficulty in the President being the Chairman of the Committee. As he is the political head of the Department of the Senate, the Committee regarded it as most desirable that he be a member of the Committee so that he would be party to decisions all of which, to varying degrees, would affect his administration of the Department. In addition, should the President not be a member of the Committee, I feel there is a real danger of an adversary situation developing between the President and the Committee especially as the President, by virtue of Section 9 of the Public Service Act, as it now exists and as proposed for amendment, is empowered with the statutory authority to implement the Committee's decisions relating to staffing matters. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee was satisfied that the experience of other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Canada where similar Committees are chaired by the Presiding Officer, shows that the arrangement can work satisfactorily. </PARA>
<PARA>Comment No. 3: I agree. When the Resolution to establish the Committee is being drafted, I will seek the appropriate amendment. </PARA>
<PARA>Comment No. 4: It was envisaged that most if not all meetings of the Committee would be held in private. However, the draft resolution at Appendix 10 of the Report was made sufficiently flexible so that the proposed Committee could tailor its arrangements, after actual working experience, to suit any circumstances which arose. </PARA>
<PARA>The actual procedures for the Committee's enquiries, were envisaged, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to the estimates, both Budget and Additional, the proposals of the Clerk of the Senate for the Senate and its Committees would be submitted to the proposed Committee through the President as Chairman. </PARA>
<PARA>A programme of deliberative meetings of the Committee would then follow, open to all interested Senators, during which the Clerk's estimates would be examined, added to, deleted or reduced, as thought necessary. In addition, other proposals from Senators or groups of Senators could be considered for inclusion in the Estimates of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>The Estimates as finally agreed upon by the Committee would then be submitted by the President to the Minister for Finance for inclusion, without modification, in a separate Parliamentary Appropriation Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee would then prepare a report covering its deliberations concerning the Estimates for use by the Senate when considering the Parliamentary Appropriation Bill, after its receipt from the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA>In relation to staffing, the Committee would examine proposals seeking to vary the organisational structure of the Senate and its Committees, and staffing and recruitment policies. </PARA>
<PARA>These proposals would emanate, according to circumstances, from Senators, groups of Senators, officers of the Senate or even from the Senate itself. </PARA>
<PARA>Once again, a programme of deliberative meetings would then follow, which would be open to all interested Senators. </PARA>
<PARA>In the event that the decision of the Committee required statutory action e.g., creation or abolition of positions, the President, who is vested with recommendatory powers under the existing section 9 of the Public Service Act or approval powers under the amended Section 9 as proposed by the Committee, would then take the appropriate action. </PARA>
<PARA>Provision is also made for the Committee to report to the Senate on any matter it considers necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>As mentioned earlier, the above procedures were those envisaged by the Committee. However, it would clearly be appropriate for the proposed Committee or the Senate, after actual working experience, to vary the arrangements should this prove necessary. Nonetheless, the important point at this stage is to become operational to enable the trial to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA>Comment No. 5: I agree, but not if it means delay in bringing the proposals of the Select Committee before the Senate for determination. </PARA>
<PARA>Comment No. 6: The Committee's approach to this point is covered by paragraphs 6.1 to 6.4 on page 21 of the Report. Basically, what we have proposed is that the Senate trial the arrangements and, should the House of Representatives decide to make similar arrangements, then the Committees of each House could meet jointly to consider the estimates and staffing proposals for the Library, Hansard and Joint House. In the meantime, however, the current arrangements for the Joint departments would continue. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, may I thank you for your kind remarks concerning the Report of the Committee. It is obviously a subject of real interest for you and I look forward to your support when the matter comes before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the motion that has been moved by Senator Jessop. The Australian Labour Party was a party to the establishment of the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing. As one of the representatives of the Labor Party on that Committee, along with my friend and colleague Senator Robertson, I took part in the deliberations of the Committee. We heard the evidence and we deliberated on the Committee's recommendations. We now recommend the implementation of those recommendations. They are basically in accordance with the policy of the Labor Party on the future operations of the Senate. We believe that there is no reason why the proposals should not be implemented by the Parliament or, for that matter, by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regard this report as one of the most important select committee reports that the Senate has considered in my service of nearly 20 years in this place. For the past two decades at least honourable senators on both sides of the Parliament have been fighting to preserve the supremacy of the Parliament over the Executive and the bureaucracy and to get the Executive and the bureaucracy to take some notice of the workings of Parliament. As I understand it-I do not profess to be a lawyer by any stretch of the imagination-certain constitutional issues are involved concerning the Parliament in these recommendations. I refer, firstly, to the form of the presentation of the annual Appropriation Bills. Included in the Budget Papers that Parliament considers each year when the Budget is brought down are two documents. One is the particulars of proposed expenditure relating to the ordinary annual services of the Government. The other document relates to the particulars of proposed provision for certain other expenditure. Put in the simplest possible way, as I understand it the purpose of the division of the annual appropriations into two or more Bills is to protect the powers of the Parliament. To appreciate this, note must be taken of section 53 of the Constitution, which provides that the Senate may not amend proposed laws appropriating moneys for the ordinary annual services of the government. If all appropriations were deemed to be for the purpose of the ordinary annual services of the Government, as I understand it, the Senate would have no power to amend appropriations and could only request the House of Representatives to make any such amendment. This, of course, was the subject of scrutiny that began long ago. My service in this place began 17 or 18 years ago when senators such as the then Senator Murphy of the Australian Labor Party and the then Senator Cormack of the Liberal Party of Australia were involved in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, as I understand it, well before that, at the beginning of Federation at the turn of the century, the then Senate insisted that certain expenditure, such as that proposed for Federal works and buildings, should not be included in the Appropriation Bill for the ordinary annual services of the Government, but that there should be a second Appropriation Bill. The Government of the day acceded to the then Senate's claim and the practice was adopted of including in the main Appropriation Bill only matters relating to expenditure for the other annual services of the Government which may be described as being, or may be related to, expenditure concerning the salaries of public servants and other general or ancillary matters. Appropriations for public works and for buildings were included, as they are still included, in a separate Bill-the second Appropriation Bill, which of course is subject to amendment by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> It was argued by the early Senate that only with that amending power could the Senate prevent a disproportionate amount of Commonwealth money from being appropriated for public works in certain States to the disadvantage of other States. That type of classification, as I understand it, was adopted from what is known as the South Australian Compact of 1857 and that is, I believe, the origin and the reason for the presentation today of two Appropriation Bills. But in 1964 the then Government senators-it was the same type of government then as is in existence today-in their report on the annual Appropriation Bills, which were tabled in the Senate and which the Senate endorsed, had this to say in paragraph 98:</PARA>
<PARA> During the 1964 debate in the Senate on the contents of the annual Appropriation Bills, it was questioned whether the Parliament was one of the services of the Government. It was suggested that it may be ordinary, it may be annual and that it may even be regarded as a service-but not a service of the Government. It was suggested that it was inconsistent with the concept of the separation of powers and the supremacy of the Parliament to treat the provision made for the Parliament as being an ordinary annual service of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The point was also made in the debate that the officers and staff of the Parliament were not officers and staff of the Government but were responsible to the Parliament. In respect of appropriations for the Parliament being included in the first Appropriation Bill-that is the Bill relating to the ordinary annual services of the Government-the then Senator Murphy, now His Honour Mr Justice Murphy of the High Court, had this to say in 1964:</PARA>
<PARA> The Officers and Staff of the Parliament are not officers and staff of the Government. These persons are responsible to the Parliament. Procedures may have been adopted and there may be definitions in acts which treat them differently, but that no more alters the true position than does the description of senators and members as employees in the Income Tax and Social Services Assessment Contribution Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know how it came about at some previous time that such a definition got into the act in relation to senators and members, but sometimes these things happen. What has happened does not alter the position. Members and senators are not employees of any one. Certainly they are not employees of the Government. Neither are the officers of this Parliament employees of the Government. They are officers and staff of the Parliament, and the sooner the position is regularized the better. If there needs to be an amendment of procedures, regulations, or even of an act, the sooner the amendment is made the better so that the position can be clarified. </PARA>
<PARA> That was in 1964. Now the Senate Select Committee-a tripartite select committee, to use Senator Jessop's words-is endeavouring to implement the situation as Senator Murphy professed it to be in 1964. I know that the wheels of Government turn slowly but this, I suggest is a ridiculous situation. It makes one wonder what power, if any, the Parliament-in this case, the Senate-may have over its own destiny and where, if anywhere, the Parliament, or the nation believing in the concept of parliamentary democracy, may be headed. I have already quoted Senator Murphy of the Australian Labor Party in 1964. Senator Cormack, as he then was, of the Liberal Party-a distinguished former President of the Senate-in 1968 on this subject had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, I would observe, just to make it clear, that in respect of the ordinary annual services of the Government, the Senate has no right of amendment but only the right of request. Yet, in dealing with its own housekeeping, its own integrity as a chamber in the bicameral system, the Senate itself, in relation to the appropriations which are required for the maintenance of the Senate as an institution of Parliament, has only the lightest of control. </PARA>
<PARA>The 1980 Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing, which has been commonly referred to as the Jessop Committee, has again reached the not unexpected but inescapable conclusion that Parliament, as it exists today under the Appropriation Bill, is not an ordinary annual service of the Government. Such classification is inconsistent with the concept of the separation of powers and supremacy of parliament. The Committee has said that the arrangement which best recognises the proper relationship between Parliament and the Executive is for the appropriations for each House to be included in a separate Appropriation Bill and for provision to be made for an advance to the President of the Senate-dealing with the Senate only in this instance-on the same basis as the Advance to the Minister for Finance for the ordinary annual services of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We say that a flexible approach is required rather than the rigid, structured approach which is in operation at the moment and which the Parliament has been forced by government to wear, as it were, like a strait-jacket. We have said that a desirable level of autonomy will be achieved for the Parliament if, in addition to the separate Appropriation Bill, each House establishes a committee with Executive representation to examine and to modify, if necessary, the parliamentary estimates. Much time and effort has been put into guidelines for parliamentary budgeting on a national and international level, so that any excuse that the regulation or deregulation has to be explored simply will not wash. If the Government wants to take note of any evidence in that regard, I would suggest that it looks at the report of the Secretary-General of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Bonn of 1978 and the report of the then Clerk of the Senate, Mr Odgers, when he attended that IPU meeting as a representative of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The strangling administrative procedures imposed by government have meant that any staffing proposal or change has little chance, if any, of obtaining approval. I suggest, as the Committee suggests, that it is highly ridiculous for non-elected people-officers of the Department of Finance, the Department of the Treasury and the Commonwealth Public Service Board-to have a power of veto over decisions of the Parliament, decisions that the Parliament may make for its fuller function and the fuller and effective function of the parliamentary committee system. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the conclusions and recommendations of the Select Committee. The recommendations are set out at paragraph 6.5 of the Committee's report. As a first step we recommend that the Senate establish a standing committee to be known as the Senate appropriations and staffing committee. It is proposed that the Committee would be chaired by the President of the Senate and would comprise six other members-the Leader of the Government in the Senate, representing the Executive; two other Government senators, presumably back benchers; the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate; and two other senators, not members of the Government. We suggest that the standing committee would be charged with responsibility for the consideration of the proposed estimates for the Senate and the consideration of staffing proposals affecting the Senate and its committees. As I said at the outset, the Australian Labor Party has considered the matter as a whole. Senator Robertson and I had the honour to represent our party on the Committee. We believe the recommendations and the proposals of the Committee are practical and are capable of implementation. They are embodied in the terms of Senator Jessop's motion. We give our support to the terms of the motion which was moved by him this evening. We support the proposal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will support this motion as a beginning to a process which we hope will free the Senate from the constraints now placed on it, and which have been placed on it for so long. The motion does not give the Senate the freedom of determining its own fate that we would like, especially with regard to its money appropriations. That point has been made by Senator Douglas McClelland. That is why we see this motion as a beginning. Later some honourable senators may care to propose amendments to what has been put before us. Frankly, any amendments I would be likely to move would be too radical for general acceptance at this stage, so I will leave it to somebody who perhaps appreciates the necessity for gradualism in this matter more than I do to do that. The Australian Democrats and I will look forward with great interest to the way in which this debate proceeds and what it reveals as it proceeds, particularly in relation to the viewpoint of the Government and the Executive-if we hear that expressed in due course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a fact that the situation of many decades in which this House, the Senate, has been virtually held in a strait-jacket by the Executive must end, no matter how difficult and protracted that labour might be. The Senate is only now, the Australian Democrats believe, beginning to exercise the influence and significance it owes to the Australian people and which the architects of the Constitution intended. If those architects had expected this place to be a mere rubber stamp of the Executive they would have created something like the Canadian Senate, all the members of which are appointed by the Prime Minister of Canada, which is virtually nothing more than a pale imitation of the House of Lords-a very pale imitation. It is an establishment House; in particular, a business establishment House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But that was not the intention. Our founding fathers created a House of virtually equal powers to the House of Representatives, elected by one of the most representative and enlightened voting systems in the world. The system is recognised as such. The vicious effects of the two party system have not, until recently, allowed the Senate to evolve along the lines of the House upon which it was so plainly modelled-that is the Senate of the United States of America, which is now, for very good reasons, a more important House than the House of Representatives. That is not to say that the Senate has all the powers of that House. Indeed, it has not. But I believe that certainly it was intended by the architects of the Constitution of this country to have considerably more power than it has exercised in the past. The question of the role of the Australian Senate and the extent to which it has not yet realised its destiny is highly relevant to this debate. Hence I would like to quote a little from a classic reference, Lindsay Roger's The American Senate, to point out some analogies. Rogers says that where there is a second, revising chamber it must have real authority. He continues, at page 90:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two chambers of equal powers permit and even invite deadlocks. This is the price that the congressional system pays for an upper house that represents the States, and believers in throttling down the government machine will consider it a small price. </PARA>
<PARA>The effects of the United States Senate in refining and altering hastily put together legislation is very great. In one review of the tax laws the United States Senate proposed 833 amendments, all but seven of which were accepted by the United States House of Representatives. It is, I think, relevant that the Bill was debated in the House of Representatives for four days and in the Senate for six weeks. That is because the Senate is there regarded as the refining house for legislation. At page 118, Rogers says:</PARA>
<PARA> The voluntary submission of the House of Representatives to the Executive is increasing rather than diminishing. It profoundly affects the character of American government and adds greatly to the influence of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>There is an interesting quotation which I propose to cite to honourable senators in full because I think it contains a certain irony. It refers to the American House of Representatives and states:</PARA>
<PARA> The leaders of a legislative body must be able to have their programme acted upon, but to accomplish this there must be frequent curtailment of debate. Taciturnity is rarely a characteristic of a person chosen to represent constituents, and there is thus a fairly constant tendency for those who control the procedure of a legislative assembly to sacrifice discussion to their timetable and to deal more and more ruthlessly with the rights of their own followers and of opposing minorities. Changes of rules have had two principal objectives. They have been designed, in the first place, to make it certain that the majority steam-roller would proceed and not be stopped by the minority; and, secondly, to prevent the course of the steam-roller from being diverted through members of the majority venturing to repudiate the leaders and their programme. These two objectives are distinct. Rules of procedure which simply provide for expeditious and businesslike attention to Bills may be justified to the extent that they accomplish this purpose, while they become objectionable if, in limiting debate, they stifle deliberation and reduce the assembly to a position where it must act as a rubber stamp. </PARA>
<PARA>Later at page 132, Rogers states:</PARA>
<PARA> The House is kept from making a 'wrong' decision by being kept from making any decision except the one which the leaders desire it to make. </PARA>
<PARA>These words, which originally were written to justify the primacy of the United States Senate, have an ironic enough ring. I suggest that in many respects they could apply with increasing force to the Australian House of Representatives where indeed we see the Executive dominance virtually carried out par excellence. I complete the analogy with Rogers' words on page 161:</PARA>
<PARA> It is the willingness of the House of Representatives to be a rubber stamp that contributes so largely to the greater power of the Senate. The second chamber is really the first chamber. </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting that that has happened in the world's largest and greatest democracy, one with which we in this place, all of us, would not see any great incompatibility. That is then, perhaps, how this country's legislature should evolve. Already I believe, in recent weeks, we have seen a greater questioning in this House of the powers of the Executive and a greater assertion of the powers of the Senate, an elected House of the people, to do that. Indeed that is a duty and responsibility of this House. It would be shirking that duty if it did not so act. That great task, which took in the United States many generations to achieve-the acknowledgment of the Senate as a House of genuine review of legislation-may also take some considerable time to achieve here. It will be achieved, as in the United States, to the extent that senators of integrity and dedication, who think beyond party, allow it to do so. Honourable senators who know the history of the United States Senate will know that my words describe exactly what has happened in that place over the decades and, indeed, centuries. </PARA>
<PARA> What then should we do in Australia? Should we see a similar situation arise here? Where has the problem been? I think that to some extent it has been due to an attempt to graft the Westminster system of the United Kingdom onto a political dynamic in Australia which is essentially foreign to it. The Westminster system suits the United Kingdom because the House of Lords is and always has been a thoroughly undemocratic House, positions to which are inherited or appointed by the Executive. That is not so in the Australian Senate. This is a freely elected House of great potential power; not power to make and break governments, or to block and obstruct. It is none of those things which are all bad, unconstructive and negative. It has power to do positive things-to guide, reform, amend and generally curb excesses and ill-judgments of the lower House if and when they should occur. I am not criticising the lower House in saying that. I am merely saying that it has been the experience of the world that first chambers with the competition, perhaps the short electoral terms and other pressures applied on them, sometimes tend to legislate hastily or, perhaps, not necessarily for all the motives that would be desired. </PARA>
<PARA> I and the Australian Democrats are thoroughly sick of this sort of weird cult that has grown up in Australia that the Senate is a kind of supernumerary House which blocks things. That is absolute rubbish. The Senate, granted the numbers, must extend its powers until they come closer in some respects-not all respects-to those of the United States Senate which it closely resembles in its basic character. The key mechanism of the United States Senate is worth looking at because it has a great relevance to what we are discussing at this time. It is the legislative committees to which virtually all Bills are referred which, as a machine of the United States Senate, have been so effective and so useful. A more recent authority than the one I quoted, Lindsay Rogers, is Dodd and Oppenheimer's Congress Revisited. It notes on page 16 that an ever increasing legislative work load has had a major impact on the Senate and that the committee staffs of roughly 300 in the eighty-fifth congress-that is, in 1957-58-had grown to over 1,000 committee staff by the ninety-fourth congress in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> We note, on information that I have, that the Senate has 64 members as against the American Senate which has 100 or 102. Our committee staff numbers do not even approach 50. How can this House possibly exercise the powers which it properly should exercise and which it owes the people in terms of its mere existence? Dodd and Oppenheimer in their book note that the expansion of staff has allowed senators to cope more easily with more work and greater responsibilities. They noted the greater flexibility and pointed out that the previous situation where the committee chairmen dominated the appointment of staff in the 1970s had disappeared so that even deputy sub-committee chairmen had the right to hire and fire staff. Of course, the American Senate does have the right of its own appropriation and a complete right of its own hiring and firing of staff and control over the numbers of staff. It must justify that, of course, just as any other House must do to the electorate which will judge it on the work it has done compared with what it cost. It is wrong, iniquitous and improper that another House of parliament or the Executive should decide what a freely elected House should do in terms of, firstly, what it spends and, secondly, what staff it needs to do the work it believes it is prepared to carry out and which it sees as its responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The characteristics of the United States Senate are typified by its unwillingness to allow the gag or guillotining of debate even after the 1975 reforms of the closure or cloture rules as they are called. Three-fifths of all members of the Senate must vote to gag a debate. There is a very interesting quotation from Senator Mansfield which might interest honourable senators. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> You can get the closure when you have a case, but when you have a bill of goods to sell to the Senate, a bill of goods that is under suspicion and not in the national interest, it should not be sold. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that these are words which we, in this House, ought to take to heart. We might see something of our own duty in those words of a distinguished American senator. Page 11 of the Select Committee's report in relation to the United States states:. </PARA>
<PARA> The autonomy of the Senate and the House with regard to appropriations is reflected in the ability of both chambers to appoint staff as required. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to committee staffs, there is a commitment and an acceptance of the need to match the expanding government programmes and expenditures with increased staffing levels. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate is having increasing numbers of select committees. If we are to have those select committees it is our duty and responsibility to carry out the tasks effectively. How can we do the work of those committees effectively when the Executive, which may not necessarily agree with its legislation being referred to select committees, or any matters being referred to select committees, says: 'No. We will retain the right to say that you will be starved of money. We will retain the right to say that you cannot have more than a certain staff ceiling'. Surely it must be the other way round? Once this House has taken on a certain amount of work, surely it must decide what staff it will need. </PARA>
<PARA> The general idea that an independent equal house of parliament elected by the people should be hamstrung in its work by staff ceilings-as a Public Service department is-or, indeed from lack of funds, is absurd. It is like saying: 'You will economise'-I know that economy might be brought forward as a point in this matter-'in a railway network by buying no locomotives'. It is obvious that there has to be control over funding. But, as with many other things, it should eventually and ultimately be a matter between this Senate and the electorate. It would depend also on the amount of value which the electorate placed upon the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic point is that the Senate has a role to perform; it has to take a second cool look at law. An executive government in a modern democracy, I think, should be willing to recognise and concede the rightness of that role. It should not obstruct it and should not say to the Senate that it is a blocker if it does or says anything whatsoever which might not suit the Executive. But it should assist that process in the cause of a proper and reasonable advancing democracy in this country. I end with a quote from Measure for Measure. What Lindsay Rogers very wisely said legislators everywhere, I think, should remember is this:</PARA>
<PARA> Oh! It is excellent</PARA>
<PARA>To have a giant's strength, but it is tyrannous</PARA>
<PARA>To use it like a giant. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pleasure in supporting the recommendations in the report of the Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing. As a member who is engaged in the deliberations of this Committee, I can say only that the report 'Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing' is one which has my full support. I believe that it is necessary for the Senate to take action-I hope with the co-operation of the Government-to secure some situation, as far as the financing and staffing of the Senate is concerned, on a par with similar houses of parliament in other parts of the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight, a number of honourable senators have spoken of the situation in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States of America which examples were studied during the course of this inquiry. It is clear, it has been accepted and it has been said-sometimes for a 150 years or more-that appropriations ought to be determined by the house of parliament knowing what are its needs and in which direction it wants to go. The appropriations should not be determined by a government or, as is more often the case, by public servants who make recommendations and decide that such and such is the appropriate amount for that house of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it can be said that this is not one of the ordinary annual services of the Government. I think this has already been said tonight. But I remind honourable senators of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in June 1976. This was a report on the ordinary annual services of the Government. We referred there, of course, to the agreement-the compact, as it is known-of 1965 following a report by a committee of Government senators under the chairmanship of the then Senator Cormack. Subsequently his committee's report became Parliamentary Paper No. 55 of 1967. </PARA>
<PARA> In the summary of the Committee's recommendations is the following very simple statement:</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Parliament-Appropriations for the purposes of Parliament should not be included in the Appropriation Bill for the ordinary annual services of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, was agreed to by the then Government. The Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs recommended that that compact be affirmed. The Committee corresponded with the then Treasurer, Sir Phillip Lynch, who confirmed the acceptance of the compact in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the terms of the 1965 compact and confirm that there is no present intention of seeking a change in its terms, i.e., we propose to follow it in the preparation of future appropriation legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>There had, of course, been some criticism by Estimates committees and others of aspects of the Appropriation Bills. But the Government has confirmed that it accepts that view. It is important that neither House of Parliament be treated as one of the ordinary annual services of the Government. Parliament is not a service of the Government; it is a separate part of the administration in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the questions included in this report in regard to staffing are important but the appropriation matters are even more important. One is supplementary to the other. A very important issue that must be considered is not just a question of whether the Senate, which has a committee to determine what its needs are, should determine how it will be paid and what moneys will be needed for each of its separate organisations; but of course the total amount-the global figure as it is sometimes called-to be paid for Parliament must be determined. Is this to be a figure which, on the recommendations of the Senate organisation, needs to be higher this year? Should it be in the hands of the Government to determine that it be chopped back? I think that is an important question in this whole issue. Unfortunately the motion we have before us does not include that question. At the end of my speech I will move to adjourn the debate tonight because it is my opinion that the motion, both in its preamble and in its body, needs a specific reference to that issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have received undertakings that his matter can come on next week for further debate. Consequently, I feel it would be very desirable in the next few days to have the opportunity both of fixing up the motion and also of discussing this matter further with the Government. As all honourable senators know, discusions have been held and suggestions made. At the moment there is some lack of clarity as to exactly where we are going. To demonstrate the point I make, I point out that honourable senators will see in the motion these words:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the Committee of the Whole, having considered the Report . . .-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) endorses the conclusions of the Committee summarised on pages (viii) and (ix) of its Report. </PARA>
<PARA>In that section of the report there are some references to this question, but only in an oblique way and only in relation to what is wrong with the present system. Conclusion 4 states:</PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, after we have put the constitutional arrangements on a better footing--</PARA>
<PARA>it is still possible to make new arrangements to achieve a desirable measure of autonomy for the Parliament . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So there is a reference to autonomy, and that means control over money matters. Conclusion 5 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The present procedure for Parliament's appropriations is unsatisfactory as it involves Parliament making bids about which the Executive may apply a qualitative judgement and thereby restrict the ability of the Legislature to discharge its constitutional duties . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That obviously suggests that we should be setting out some other system which is not based on bids but in which a determination is made by the Parliament; but the conclusions do not go on to talk about that. That matter is dealt with in chapter 6. The Committee's recommendation 6.8, which describes how a Senate appropriations and staffing committee would work, reads:</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the Estimates, the Committee would examine the proposals of the President and the officers of the Senate at, unless otherwise ordered, public hearings. The Estimates as finally agreed by the Committee would be submitted to the Minister for Finance for inclusion in a separate Parliamentary Appropriation Bill. The Minister would then introduce the Bill in the House of Representatives in accordance with current practice. The Senate, upon receipt of the Bill from the House of Representatives, would consider its provisions in the normal way and, at that time, would also have before it a report from the Appropriations and Staffing Committee covering its deliberations concerning the Estimates. </PARA>
<PARA>There is an indication in that quotation that it is intended that the expenditures recommended by the Committee to be set up would be included in the separate parliamentary Bill. To make the position quite clear, paragraph 6.9 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Should the Government of the day be opposed to any of the Estimates as agreed to by the Committee and included in the Parliamentary Appropriation Bill, it has the opportunity (on matters affecting the Senate) to seek amendments in the Bill during the Committee of the Whole stage on the floor of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is clear from the recommendations that it is intended by the Committee that that important aim should be achieved. As the evidence set out in the Committee's report shows, in practically all parliaments around the world the determination of these things are done essentially by committees and not, as has been the case in Australia for many years, by the Executive government. I think that is consequently a very important part to be included in the resolutions that the Committee shall adopt. In his speech in support of the motion, Senator Jessop obviously had this very much in mind because he said:</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, it has recommended that each House establish a committee, with provision for representation of the Executive, charged with the task of examining the parliamentary estimates and agreeing to them with or without modification prior to their inclusion in the Parliamentary Appropriation Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>That seems, of course, to accord with the recommendation of the Committee but unfortunately it is not yet in the motion before the Chair. Consequently, supporting the motion as I do and feeling that this is a matter that desirably must be pressed forward by the Parliament, and by this House in particular, I think we should put the matter in a perfectly sound and accurate manner. Therefore, I think it would be wise if we had a few days in which to tidy up the details of the motion. It is for this reason that I have spoken to the Opposition parties because we are assured that this matter can come back for debate next week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. In any event, it is in fact a matter for which I have responsibility on behalf of the Government and Senator Chaney was handling it on the other occasion in my absence. The matter, as far as the Government is concerned, is my responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This matter, of course, has received a good deal of consideration already from honourable senators in that it was the subject of recommendations by a Senate committee to which I responded on behalf of the Government some time ago. The reasons that were given by the Government to oppose the establishment of another standing committee of the Senate for the specific purpose as outlined in Senator Missen's motion were set out in that earlier response. The arguments that have been advanced by Senator Missen and Senator Tate in support of the motion are ones which, without any disrespect to those arguments, were considered by the Government and members of this chamber during the previous debate. Indeed, wide discussion has taken place on this matter for some time. Therefore, I do not think I ought to detain the Senate at any great length this evening in responding to this motion. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Chaney already has said, the Government is opposed to the motion because it does not believe there is a case for a special consideration of these matters either by any of the existing committees or by the establishment of a new committee. In the Government's view there are already ample opportunities for the examination of legislation that comes before the Parliament to ensure that human rights and civil liberties are protected and that any provisions which might be objectionable on these scores are brought to the Parliament's attention. </PARA>
<PARA> I would just like to recapitulate the processes by which these matters are attended in the development of legislation. I will then move to the record this Senate in particular has in dealing with matters of this kind. I think we would all agree that the question of legislation infringing basic human rights or civil liberties is a most important one that should be in the minds of all members of parliament when they consider legislation. We would all agree that legislation ought to be passed in such a form that there is not any undue invasion of these rights. I think that in fact is the phraseology of the motion. It does not say that legislation cannot trespass sometimes on rights or liberties. Obviously a lot of legislation does restrict liberties and existing rights. It is important to note that Senator Missen's motion simply requires consideration of whether legislation trespasses unduly on personal rights and liberties. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Missen" NAMEID="YL7">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I appreciate that. But I want to make that point because I do not think we ought to be deluding ourselves into thinking that somehow or other we are going to be able to protect absolutely rights and liberties because that simply is not consistent with a great deal of legislation that for various good reasons is passed by parliaments and proposed to parliaments by members of all political parties and all governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Both sides of this Parliament are on common ground in the belief that there should be very good reasons before legislation is allowed to restrict liberties or existing rights. Such legislation should be passed only if there are good reasons to do so. In the process of formulating legislation these matters are, in fact, well within the mind and attention of government and its advisors. The processes begin, I suppose, even during the period of getting instructions for legislation to parliamentary counsel. I can assure the Senate that parliamentary counsel are particularly alert to these questions. From my experience as Attorney-General I know that in the drafting process they draw these questions to my attention and no doubt to that of other people if they feel that the instructions they have provide an undue trespass on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the legislation is ever presented to Parliament it is looked at by a legislation committee of Cabinet. Under a system which has been in existence for some time, legislation goes to the back bench party committees on the Government side and when it is introduced it goes to similar Opposition committees. There is now built into the system, both at the government level and at the parliamentary level, every opportunity, I believe, for a close examination of legislation even before it is debated in the Parliament. In the House of Representatives a number of Bills now go to the legislation committees. Debate which would have taken place in the Committee of the whole now takes place in a committee atmosphere which is perhaps more conducive to consideration of these matters than the set piece second reading debate. Probably most importantly of all we have provision in the Senate for the consideration of many Bills in detail in the Committee stage. I think that the Senate has established over the years a very high reputation for having regard to these matters and giving particular attention to them. Over the years matters of this kind have been raised time and again in the Senate and many amendments have been made to legislation because these matters have been raised by honourable senators in debate on the floor of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I am making is that there are, in fact, a great many opportunities for these matters to be considered in the process of developing legislation and its consideration before debate in the Parliament and during debate in the Parliament. Not only are there these opportunities but also these opportunities are, in fact, made extensive use of by senators and members. The Senate has, I think, developed a high reputation for the work that it has done in being a watchdog on these questions. In the Government's view there is no necessity at all for a special committee to take on the responsiblity of examining these questions. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from that, I believe that it is invidious for the Parliament to establish committees to do this. It seems to me that questions of this kind should be the responsibility of at least a number of senators and members, if not all senators and members. In fact, as I have said, there have always been a number of senators who have taken a particular interest in looking at legislation with regard to these questions. I believe that that responsibility should continue to be exercised by senators. There should not be this idea that it is the responsibility of a few senators on a committee to look at these questions. I think we devalue the role of senators, in particular, if we give any support to the view that these matters should be shunted off to a committee and that senators themselves should not continue to bear a direct and personal responsibility for these questions when the Bills are being debated in the Committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Other matters have been put forward by the Government. One is that the process of having a special committee look at these matters could be a means of unduly delaying the passage of legislation. I know that the motion proposed by Senator Missen does not build in any particular road blocks, as such; nevertheless the fact that a committee would be looking at these matters undoubtedly would have an effect on when legislation would be dealt with. It may be said: 'We have not yet had a report from the scrutiny of Bills committee on this Bill; we cannot go on and debate it because the committee has not looked at it'.The committee may have a great many matters on its plate and it may not be in a position to get around to considering a particular Bill before the Senate for other reasons wishes to get on with a consideration of it. I do not place the same importance on that argument as I do on the first argument I mounted. Nevertheless, I think it is an important consideration. I agree that the Senate could at any time ignore those questions; nevertheless I am sure that if a committee of this type were set up there would be some further delay in the process of the passage of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another argument which ought to be put. I do not know that I actually spelt it out in my previous response. It would be difficult to isolate one's judgment about these questions from the Bill as a whole and the policy and social purpose of it. Obviously these questions, in the end, are decided by the Parliament in relation to the whole Bill as well as the questions of policy that I have mentioned. I do not think it is feasible to judge whether some provision unduly trespasses on rights or liberties without having regard to the whole policy. I know that that still would be a matter for the Senate to determine in the end. The fact of the matter is that a standing committee of the Senate, considering these matters in isolation, undoubtedly would have quite an influence in the Senate debate and perhaps, unfortunately, an undue influence. It might divert attention from the consideration of the Bill as a whole. The Senate's exercise in Committee is to look at the Bill as a whole or clause by clause, but its consideration is not divorced from the purposes of the Bill or the policies behind it. </PARA>
<PARA> Although we ought to be always alert-I think we are alert-to the effect of a Bill on personal rights, civil liberties and such matters, in the end a judgment has to be made in regard to the social purpose behind the Bill. I think that to isolate it in the way proposed is a wrong way of looking at it. The whole Bill may be said to be largely dealing with personal rights and liberties. I instance the Criminal Investigation Bill, which I introduced into the Senate yesterday. It would seem quite inappropriate to have a Bill such as that considered by the proposed committee. All the questions that arise in the Bill deal with personal rights and how they are protected, matters of investigation by the police and so on. A number of Bills of that kind are presented in Parliament. It would seem to be quite inappropriate for a Bill of that sort to be dealt with in one committee whereas its policy considerations may need to be looked at by another committee and when in fact the ultimate consideration of the Bill will be given in the Committee of the Whole after the second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that many practical problems may emerge if this committee is set up. For all these reasons the Government is opposed to it. As I have said, the Government is opposed only to these matters being considered in the way that is proposed in the motion. It is not, of course, in any way to be taken to be opposed to the need for very alive and earnest consideration to be given to questions of such great importance as those relating to the personal rights and civil liberties of people affected by legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very interesting that this is the second debate that we have had tonight which deals with the rights of the Senate and its position in relation to the Executive. I think this is an area to which we have to give a great deal more attention in the future because this is one of the great problems confronting the developing Westminster system in all countries. I, like the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), am disappointed that Senator Chaney could not be here tonight to conduct a spirited campaign in favour of the Government's rejection of a scrutiny of Bills committee. It would be very difficult for him to do so, seeing that as a back bencher he was the originator of the idea, but I am sure that he would have struggled nobly to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Attorney-General gave us in answer substantially the same reply he gave two years ago when rejecting the recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs for the establishment of a joint committee of both Houses of Parliament to scrutinise Bills. The trouble is that the case presented is, in my view, a defective one. The Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee proposed that a joint committee be set up to examine all Bills in much the same way as the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances examines subordinate legislation to see that it does not trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties, that it provides an adequate review of administrative powers and decisions and that it does not unduly delegate legislative powers without proper parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of the Committee-I think the Attorney-General misunderstood the role as I envisage it anyway-would merely be to draw the attention of the Parliament to apparent breaches of these principles so that they could be debated. In the case of the Criminal Investigation Bill, which the Attorney-General cited, I imagine that the scrutiny of Bills committee would merely draw the whole Bill to the attention of the Parliament. It has to see that these things do not slip through unnoticed. The role of the committee in relation to Bills such as the Criminal Investigation Bill would be almost superfluous. There would be no need for the committee to draw such a Bill to the attention of the Senate because we would all be well aware of and would have all these aspects in mind. I do not think that would be a large task for the committee. I think it would be one with which it could deal in about 10 seconds. It could just commit the whole Bill to the attention of the Senate as one that had potential areas of conflict concerning personal rights and liberties. </PARA>

It should merely say: 'This is an area at which the Senate should look'. I think that to do any more than that would be improper. That would be the committee's role. I do not think it should go further. By the way, it was also realised by the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee that factors other than those listed should sometimes be involved and that it might sometimes be necessary on balance to accept restrictions on personal rights and liberties, but at least Parliament should make such a decision with its eyes open.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In giving the Government's reasons for rejecting the Committee's proposal the Attorney-General said that the present parliamentary procedures provide ample opportunity for the necessary scrutiny. He went on to list the opportunities. The first two he listed were consultation between the Parliamentary Counsel and the Department concerned, and consideration by the Cabinet Legislation Committee. Both points are, with respect, totally irrelevant to the issue we are debating. We are not talking about the Executive's scrutiny of itself. We are talking about parliamentary scrutiny of the Executive; an entirely different matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General also referred to the Legislation Committees of the House of Representatives. I do not want to cast too many adverse judgments on their performance but one thing is quite clear and that is that they are not effective for this role. They look at only a very small proportion of the legislation that is passed by the House of Representatives. What we want is a committee that will draw the attention of the Parliament to obscure Bills, the ones that pass unnoticed, perhaps are even scarcely debated, not the contentious ones. The contentious ones are looked at. It is the small Bills that are liable to contain provisions that may subsequently be found to be objectionable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General, in his earlier statement of two years ago-he repeated some of the same words this evening-went on to argue that the Bills are examined closely and with the principles the Senate Committee is concerned with very much in mind in the traditional Senate Committee debate. I think this is absolute nonsense. Traditional Senate debates do no such thing. How could they? We sometimes pass 30 or 40 Bills a week. For the Senate to perform the role the Attorney-General apparently thinks it already does would require a radical restructuring of Senate procedures on lines I have advocated both inside and outside this chamber but which I understand the Government still opposes. The Attorney-General then said in his original statement:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the law and Government Committee of the Government parties is invited to give close scrutiny to legislation that may raise questions in the light of the principles that the Senate Committee proposed. </PARA>

Before we take such a step, for a new committee would tend to have an indefinite life of its own, I think the Senate should have a chance to judge how useful the new committee system would be from practical experience. What we should do, therefore, is to conduct an experiment, after which we could judge whether we wish it to continue. It may be-I do not think it is-that the Government is right that the present procedures are adequate and a new committee would turn up nothing new. Let us find out before we take the extreme and fairly permanent step of setting up a new standing committee. Rather than setting up a new committee, I think we should refer the scrutiny task to one of our existing committees for a trial, and I will be moving to this effect in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For a committee to perform this scrutiny function I suggest it needs a regular meeting date, a membership which contains some legal expertise, and a permanent legal counsel who would have the responsibility of examining all Bills as soon as they are introduced and promptly drawing the Committee's attention to any suspect areas. The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances meets these criteria. The report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs sets out the arguments in favour of using the Regulations and Ordinances Committee for this scrutiny of Bills role, but finally comes down against this solution because scrutiny of principal legislation, as that Committee put it, 'would constantly overshadow the scrutiny of delegated legislation' and, as it goes on to say, it might 'overload the Committee to such an extent that their existing work would be imperilled'. Although I think this exaggerates the amount of work involved and although I think the Regulations and Ordinances Committee will ultimately be found to be the most suitable body to do this scrutiny task, in view of these remarks I do not think we should burden this Committee with this role until we have some idea of the size of the task we propose to give it. </PARA>
<PARA> Some time ago I asked for a survey to be made of a typical period to get an idea of how many Bills a legal counsel might bring to the attention of a scrutiny of Bills committee. A list, prepared by the staff of the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee has been circulated to senators. It covers the Bills passed during 1980. It listed 80 queries on 31 Bills. I think it probably overstates the work load. Twenty-six of the queries related to discretions given to the Commissioner of Taxation. There is a very elaborate appeal procedure against the Commissioner's decisions. I do not think the Senate or the scrutiny of Bills committee will be likely to want to remove his discretions. But even assuming that the list is representative, the Committee would be required to consider only an average of two or three Bills a sitting week to determine whether there were any aspects of sufficient importance to justify reference to the Senate by merely drawing the attention of the Senate to the fact that there was a possible problem here, expressing no concluded view, just drawing the Senate's attention to a possible problem area. This does not seem to me to be an excessive work load. </PARA>
<PARA> The question is: Who should do the trial? The Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee raised this issue and is, I understand, prepared to conduct a trial. I propose, therefore, that the members of the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee should be the scrutiny of Bills committee for a trial six months period during which they could assess the work load involved and report to the Senate on this work load. We, all of us senators, could assess the value to us of having our attention drawn to possible breaches of the scrutiny criteria. Then we could decide whether or not we wish to set up a permanent organisation to scrutinise Bills and, if so, who should do it. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> After paragraph 9, insert the following new paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> 9. (a) That notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Resolution, the members of the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs be the members of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills until the thirtieth day of June 1982 and that, prior to that time, the said Committee report to the Senate on the work of the Committee and the need, if any, for a separately constituted Standing Committee. </PARA>

In so doing, I would like to say briefly that the Australian Democrats are attracted to the notion of the scrutiny of bills coming into this place in relation to undue violation of human rights. The problem that we had with it I think is amply satisfied by the suggestions of Senator Hamer in that we were concerned at the practicality of the matter and feel that the method of sending it to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs should, indeed, enable us to have a fair and adequate estimation of what might happen, or what might be seen to be happening in future to a committee which has to undertake a task such as this. We believe that by allowing the Bills in the autumn session to undergo this type of scrutiny by the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, that Standing Committee will be well placed at the time set down in the motion of Senator Hamer to advise the Senate on the need, if any, for a separate standing committee. I believe that in this way we are able to accept the principle and also to test the practicality. It is an admirable compromise and we support it whole-heartedly.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No one can actually accuse the Parliament of rushing headlong into the change that is embodied in Senator Missen's motion tonight. It is three years now since the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs recommending this kind of change was brought down. Indeed, I now find that there are something like four previous occasions on which I have addressed the Senate in support of this matter. The accumulated canon can be found in Hansard on 23 November 1978, 1 March 1979, 22 November 1979 and again on 6 March 1980. I do not propose to repeat the arguments which I advanced at nauseous length on all those previous occasions. I simply make the point that we are dealing here with what is clearly a significant innovation into the practice and procedure not only of this chamber but also of this Parliament, an innovation which should improve and enhance the quality and, in many ways, the legitimacy of all the legislation which is in fact passed by this Parliament, whichever party is in power. The reality, as all of us are only too well aware, is that there is far too little effective scrutiny not so much of the policy of Bills but of the details of Bills that pass through our hands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under these circumstances it is really quite extraordinary that there has been so much opposition expressed by the Government. I put it to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), as the representative of the Government, that there is really no need for the kind of nervousness demonstrated here tonight and indeed over the events of recent weeks and months-in fact the last three years-when one looks at the very limited role it is proposed that the Committee in practice will play. In this respect I will repeat-I will do so in no more than a sentence-the points that have been made so amply and adequately by Senator Missen, Senator Hamer and Senator Tate. What is proposed is simply that the Committee look at the detail of legislative proposals which might otherwise not be subject to scrutiny by reference to these particular civil liberty and excessive delegation criteria. That is what is involved here; that is the way the Committee will operate. There is simply no reason for the kind of nervousness about an intrusion into governmental prerogatives which seems to have been advanced here tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for the Government's resistance to this matter seems essentially to be psychological. This Government really does prefer rhetoric to reality when it comes to human rights matters. It feels much more comfortable when it is merely talking about the majesty of the common law and the majesty of parliamentary procedures and the way in which we can in fact rely, as good, sturdy Anglo-Saxon successors to the glories of Westminster, upon the humanity and the wisdom of our legislators, the draftsmen who stand behind them and, of course, down the line, the judges who interpret the law and the bureaucrats and police who actually enforce it. This Government is happier with this kind of mythology that there is no need for substantial legislative protection of human rights-constitutional protection for rights-and parliamentary procedural protection for human rights of the kind contemplated here. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that this mythology about the Anglo-Saxon parliamentary and common law tradition is simply just that: Legislatures cannot be trusted to get everything right when it comes to the impact upon civil liberties of the bills that they pass. Questions of Executive and administrative convenience will constantly ensure that things do slip by which are manifestly unattractive unless they are very closely scrutinised by a committee of the kind that is contemplated here. It is simply bizarre for the Attorney to say, as he has said tonight and on previous occasions, that, among the various safety nets we can anticipate operating around the place, the government party committees of the day will have the opportunity to closely scrutinise the details of the Bills that they are in fact endorsing. That is like saying the lions of ancient Rome had the opportunity-as indeed they did-to scrutinise closely the Christians they were just about to eat. That is the kind of scrutiny that the government party committees can be expected to apply to legislation embodying interferences with civil liberties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I spoke particularly in regard to the kind of committees that exist under the present Government. I have much greater confidence in the party committees which might be expected to operate under a Labor government. But there are occasions inevitably when, through inadvertence or pressure of time, considerations of this kind may in fact slip through the kind of dragnet that committees would otherwise be minded to apply. The question remains: What kind of committee is it most appropriate to set up? The original recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs was in fact to establish not just a committee of this Senate but a joint committee of the Parliament with representation from both Houses and procedures to ensure that this committee was able to look at Bills before they were considered by either House of the Parliament, not just when they wended ultimately their weary way into this chamber. That is still a concept and proposition which I very much prefer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been far too much chauvinism in the Parliament by members of both Houses about the prerogative of each vis-a-vis the other. Far too much nonsense has been talked by members of the House of Representatives about the folloy of joint committees. The Senate can play a useful role and fulfil a review function. That is something that I am very willing to acknowledge. Even more nonsense has been talked about the interference with the prerogatives and powers of the Senate by lending its participation to joint committees. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that a joint committee is the admirable solution for the kind of procedural innovation claimed here. I hope that we do not, in the course of adopting Senator Missen's modification of the proposal, lose sight of that ultimate objective. I certainly have not and the Opposition certainly has not. The proposal, however, is to be further modified, if Senator Hamer has his way, by the amendment which he has moved tonight, not even to establish at this stage a separate and distinct Senate committee but simply to allocate for the next six months the proposed functions to the existing Constiutional and Legal Affairs Committee. That is an amendment which, on balance, and after careful consideration, the Opposition is prepared to accept reasonably cheerfully. Not only has a deal been done to accept it, but also is it quite a rational proposal in the sense that it will allow a relatively new innovation to work itself out through our practice and procedures as well as some better assessment to be made than we are able to make at the moment about the kind of staff allocation that may be needed to support this function. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion moved by Senator Missen seems to have generated in recent days and weeks quite a remarkable amount of hyperbole-that is, exaggeration-which is in fact unmerited by the substance of the proposal before us. It is a significant proposal, as I readily acknowledge and as I would claim, but essentially it is quite a small procedural change that is before us now. It should be added-this is my final point-that the change is simply a logical corollary of the change which was introduced in 1931 in this chamber relating to delegated legislation. A procedure was introduced to ensure that the Parliament did not overlook invasions of liberty, perhaps inadvertently, by delegated legislation. All that is proposed here tonight is that this chamber, on behalf of the Parliament as a whole, now creates a procedure which will ensure that there are no invasions of liberty or excessive conferrals of Executive power by full scale legislation, again by way of inadvertence. The only occasion for concern that the Parliament or the nation should have about the passage of Senator Missen's motion tonight is the way in which the Government seems to be losing in its opposition to this motion whatever remains of its sense of perspective. For all those reasons, I indicate, as Senator Tate has before me, that the Opposition will support both Senator Missen's motion to establish this committee and also Senator Hamer's amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to indicate briefly that I support what my colleague, Senator Missen, has proposed. At the outset, I wish to respond to a remark made by my colleague on the other side of the chamber. He said that this chamber is made up of Anglo-Saxons. I make it quite clear that it is not made up entirely of Anglo-Saxons any more than it is made up of WASPs, that is white Anglo-Saxon protestants. There are other people in the chamber. I make the point very clear. What my colleague, Senator Missen, is endeavouring to do in proposing this motion is nothing, in my opinion, of which the Government or any member of this chamber should be afraid. The proposed committee would be very little more than our Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. The proposed committee would be examining legislation in minute detail and reporting back to the Senate. The Senate could then look at the points that have been raised. That system could operate in the same manner as the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances operates. In that Committee we have counsel who examines the regulation or ordinance before the Committee and points out those parts of it that infringe civil liberties and the individual rights of people. The Committee looks at the points raised and the Chairman of the Committee reports to honourable senators in this chanber. Honourable senators collectively can then look at those points and, if they think the regulation or ordinance concerned is wrong, they can disallow it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Missen is not seeking to go even that far in his proposal to set up a standing committee for the scrutiny of Bills. All he is proposing is that such a committee should look at legislation, should examine it in minute detail and should report back to the Senate on it. The Senate would then have the power to decide whether the points raised by the committee should be looked at more closely in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that what my colleague the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has said tonight has no bearing on what my colleague Senator Missen proposes in setting up such a committee. I think the Government should welcome such a proposal. With such a committee the Government would know that legislation introduced into this Parliament could be examined by that committee. When the chairman of the committee reported to the Senate the Senate could go through the bad points in the legislation. The Government would then have the opportunity of saying: Okay; the committee has looked at the legislation and the Senate has looked at it. We should change it to make it a good piece of legislation'. </PARA>
<PARA> For those reasons, I support the proposal of my colleague Senator Missen. I believe that the amendment moved by another of my colleagues, Senator Hamer, could provide a means whereby legislation could be examined promptly by a committee; namely, the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. If, after that Committee has had an opportunity to look at legislation and to report to the Senate on it, such a system is proved worthwhile, we could set up what my colleague Senator Missen really wants; namely, a permanent standing committee to examine legislation that comes to this Senate. However, in the short term, perhaps Senator Hamer's proposal is the best course of action for us to adopt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That may well be. If we do that the debate in this chamber will be of less value. In recent years the incidence of a lack of full attendance in the Senate has increased, except for very few periods during a division or when Question Time is in progress. Even then, towards the end of Question Time, some honourable senators leave the chamber. I do not believe that the Senate can sustain 35 committees. The committee proposed by Senator Missen, whilst it would have the best of intentions, does not need to be set up. Individual senators are continuously vigilant about civil rights and about any possible invasion of individual liberty. A special committee does not need to be set up to do that work. If we over-topple the Senate with committees we will put in jeopardy the excellence of the committee structure, particularly as it was developed in the late 1960s. At the moment we have several select committees as well as the standing committees, joint committees and Estimates committees. It is difficult to fill the places on those committees. At the moment one select committee is not meeting, is not going about its business, because there is a lack of senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we put the committee system in disrepute by having too many committees, we will put in jeopardy one of the very real strengths of the Senate. I do not believe it has been established that we need a thirty-fifth committee. If we are to have a committee to look at the invasion of civil liberties of individual Australians, why not have three or four other committees. What about a committee to look at the impact of any legislation on families in Australia? Let us have a family impact statements committee of the Senate. Alternatively, let us look at the efficiency of operation of some programs. Why can we not have some honourble senators meeting to look at what a Bill proposes, be it a new program or a strengthening of a program? Such a committee could look at the efficiency of legislation to see whether there was any duplication in it and to make sure that inefficiencies and duplication were erased from it. </PARA>
<PARA> Why do we not have another committee to look at whether or not there are particular State advantages subtly involved in the wording of any particular legislation? This is a States House. Let the Senate have another committee to try to eliminate any particular State advantage which may need to be brought to the attention of honourable senators so that we can be all the more alert. Let us have another committee which maximises individual citizens' participation in any program which legislation sets forth. Many honourable senators believe that individual Australians ought to be involed in public affairs. Any program that is set up ought to consider how we can involve more people, rather than have elitists sitting behind closed doors and forming little bureaucracies remote from the people. Let us have a committee to see how we can maximise public participation in decisions which the Senate makes. A long list of various values which honourable senators have could be examined against all of the legisltion which passes through the Senate to see whether those values are vigilantly being maintained by that legislation. Whilst I am not arguing against the admirable intention of such a committee as the one proposed, I believe there are other contenders of just as much importance. Why should we add unnecessarily to the paraphernalia and bureaucracy with which honourable senators are increasingly becoming involved?</PARA>
<PARA> I do not see in the Senate any lack of attention by honourable senators to the question of civil liberties. How have we managed in the Senate for 81 years without such a committee? Why is it that after 81 years all of a sudden we have to bring into being this new committee? I believe the great majority of Government senators see this as just another step that may delay and complicate the procedures for decision within this place. If we bring the excellent committee system of the Senate into disrepute by overburdening it, we will be dong the Senate a great disservice. I do not support the proposal for the committee and I do not support Senator Hamer's amendment that it be given, as an overburdening, to one of our standing committees. Therefore, I urge honourable senators not to vote with those few honourable senators who have proposed this committee, but to vote with the majority of Government senators who are opposed to it and with the majority of silent members of the Senate who, I believe, are also not persuaded that it should be adopted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take note of the fact that we have only six minutes until the Senate is due to adjourn. It is not my intention to talk this motion out; I think we should debate it this evening. Nevertheless, I take the opportunity to speak briefly because I think the position of Government senators has been misrepresented this evening. This is not a question for the Government or for the Opposition. It is a question for the Senate. If one were to pursue the argument just put to the Senate, I think we would have an excellent argument for abolishing the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. We had put to us the general principle that we ought to have a very particular type of scrutiny of Bills which relates to the rights, liberties and obligations of government and of our position in the Senate. It is incumbent on all honourable senators when they vote on this motion and on the amendment to bear in mind that they are first and foremost parliamentarians and only secondly representatives of parties or, indeed, of States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is an argument to be put for all sorts of committees of the Senate. We could have commitees that scrutinise from the point of view of the States and so on. If honourable senators want to move a motion to that effect, if they think it is of equal significance to this one, they have an equal right to do so. I will vote for this motion because I think it is important in a parliamentary sense that we have a standing committee that is established which can oversight legislation in the way that is proposed for this standing committee in Senator Missen's motion. I am not entirely pursuaded that we need to delay in the way that Senator Hamer's amendment would require.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to reply very briefly. I thank my colleagues who have spoken in support of this motion. I think that they have replied quite substantially to the argument by the Government. Two matters were raised by the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, that do call for slight reply. He argued that it would be invidious to establish this committee and that it should be the responsibility of a number of honourable senators, or all honourable senators, actually to do the scrutiny work. Of course, it is the obligation of all honourable senators to do that. The facts that I have produced, the investigation which was undertaken in 1980 and our experience have shown that, unfortunately, quite a lot of it has not been done. We only have to be honest with ourselves to admit that. This committee is not designed to take away the responsibility or to lessen the responsibility of senators, but it is designed to arm them with information, to have a counsel and a committee that will look into these matters and draw them to the attention of honourable senators. As I see myself now as being the chairman of this committee-if the motion is carried-in my double capacity, I assure the Senate that where there is a Bill which is of concern to another standing committee we would draw its attention to what seem to be defects, just as the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances does to the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory when matters relate to that committee. Of course there will be that communication and no lessening of the obligation of other members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to the second point. A new argument has been put forward tonight that it is difficult to isolate one's judgment from a Bill as a whole and its social purpose; if we have this sort of committee which is being given this type of recommendation then the committee might have too much influence and decisions might be made on different questions. This is the very problem that exists at the moment. Often these minor or smaller points are not seen because of the overwhelming debate on other matters. That problem will be overcome. I do not take it further. This is part of the task which the Senate ought to do. I believe that the motion has the support of most honourable senators. I trust Senator Hamer's amendment, which I think is a sensible and practical one, and the motion, as amended, will be carried. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I wish to outline some of the less satisfactory aspects of the television service to some remote areas in Queensland which are now receiving television for the first time. The areas to which I shall refer are those receiving television programs by way of the Intelsat IV international communications satellite. Programs are beamed to this satellite from two places in Australia-from Carnarvon in Western Australia and from Moree in New South Wales. Three States, South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland, and the Northern Territory receive television services through the Moree station. These television programs originate in Sydney. A land link takes the programs from Sydney's Australian Broadcasting Commission studios to Moree. This means that Sydney programs are beamed to the Northern Territory and to States which have nothing in common with Sydney. Some people might say: 'What is wrong with that? A TV program is a TV program'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will outline some of the things that are wrong with it so far as Queensland is concerned. Firstly, there is a time difference of one hour when New South Wales fiddles with the time in summer, as is the case now. Therefore, programs are one hour ahead of time when they are shown in Queensland if they originate in Sydney. In addition to this, sports programs which are seen by people who receive television in this way have a New South Wales bias. Whilst this might not necessarily be something that one should be terribly concerned about, people in Queensland would much rather see Queensland programs, such as a rugby league game from Brisbane rather than a rugby league game from Sydney. In addition to this a number of people who are receiving these programs complain to me that they cannot receive race results as other people in Queensland can. People in one particular place-I imagine there are more-have difficulty receiving radio programs and therefore they cannot receive the race results they would like. Scarcely anything is said about the main Queensland race meetings on programs that originate in Sydney. I believe that Sydney gives the race results for the daily treble in Brisbane but that is about all. In addition to this one must think of news broadcasts. First of all they are at a different time when we have summer time in New South Wales. Also there is a New South Wales bias towards news programs that people receive, say, in northern Queensland. People in northern Queensland tell me that they are not particularly interested in the regional news that comes on before the main news because the regional news comes from northern New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> If the centres served by satellite in Queensland were fewer than they were in New South Wales, there might be some justification for Queensland having to receive the New South Wales program. But I will outline how many remote areas are being served in the various States by the satellite. In New South Wales there are 7 centres, in Queensland 17, in South Australia 4, and in the Northern Territory 4. I did not mention Western Australia because all Western Australian programs originate in that State, where there are 19 areas. I will go back to the New South Wales programs that originate in Sydney. The Queensland centres that receive television via the satellite are far greater than they are in New South Wales. In fact they are greater than the centres in New South Wales, South Australia and the Northern Territory combined. Therefore I ask these questions: Why should the centres in Queensland have to receive New South Wales programs? Why not have a link from Brisbane to Moree rather than a link from Sydney to Moree? I ask these questions on behalf of the suffering Queensland viewers: Is it possible to service Moree with a line from Brisbane? If not why is it not possible? Is it possible for Moree to send two signals, a New South Wales signal and a Queensland signal, to the satellite? I do not know whether this is technically possible. It may or may not be possible to beam them down separately. If Queensland cannot be adequately serviced, is it possible to build a further communications station to beam Queensland programs to a satellite and then beam them down to Queensland viewers?</PARA>
<PARA> I realise that these are probably fairly technical questions which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) may not be be able to answer tonight. If he is not able to do so, I would be pleased if he would find the answers so that I can pass them on to the people in Queensland who would like to see some local programs, programs that originate in Queensland. Even though some of them are far distant from Brisbane they would be satisfied if they could have some programs that originate in Brisbane because at least they would be able to receive news services from there and sports results that pertain to Queensland and their television service would become much richer than it is at the moment. I would be pleased if the Minister were able to give me some information and perhaps give me some further information when officers from the Department are able to provide it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Colston raised the question of really a more appropriate kind of programming for some of the remote communities in Queensland which are dependent upon Intelstat for their television reception. A considerable advance has been given by the introduction of the Intelsat IV program and it has meant that many of these remote communities now have a television reception which they previously did not have. Senator Colston is correct that for the television viewers in Queensland, South Australia, the Northern Territory and New South Wales the programs are produced in Sydney and carried by conventional linkage to Moree and beamed from there to the satellite and back to the earth receiving stations. I am informed, however, that the answer which the honourable senator is seeking may in fact come to pass.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that what is called by the Department of Communications the Eastern States Program, to distinguish it from the program in Western Australia to which Senator Colston referred, will eventually originate not from Sydney but from the Australian Broadcasting Commission in Brisbane when Telecom Australia can provide a terrestrial circuit between Brisbane and Moree. So the matter referred to in the question asked by Senator Colston is in fact intended to take place by the Department of Communications under the Remote Area Television Service. Of course, the initial program is not the final product. It represents an initial step; perhaps a trade-off. Senator Colston is quite correct. People in Quilpie, perhaps, who are receiving Moree local news may feel it has no relevance to them, but it is still television reception which they did not have previously. It is an advance and of benefit to them. The fact that it is intended that eventually there should be a link from Brisbane to Moree, exactly as Senator Colston asked, is something which should be of some interest to him. The system is one which is evolving and the present situation is not one that will last. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have a time frame but I have been told-and I just repeat the words-'when Telecom can provide a terrestrial circuit between Brisbane and Moree'. That at least takes up the point that concerns Senator Colston. I recall having been at Bamaga not so long ago. Senator Colston may know that there is a horse called Prince Ruling, a very good race horse, owned by the Queensland Minister for Aboriginal and Islander Affairs. It was racing that day somewhere in Sydney. We discovered to our horror that no matter how we worked on the local radios-I was not so concerned but my colleague was-and no matter how we looked to our colleagues and friends in Bamaga for help, there was no way he could hear Prince Ruling race in Sydney. Of course what made it even sadder was that the horse, a very good horse, won that race quite easily. So he was certainly well aware of the need for remote area reception. The Government is aware of it. The program is coming into place.
