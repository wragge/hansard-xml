<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. I refer the Minister to the report in the Canberra Times today which claims that according to some sources the Australian Taxation Office may be forgoing very large sums of money because of staff shortages and that these shortages are to be made even more severe by the further cuts announced last week. I further refer the Minister to the Auditor-General's report which is strewn with examples of false economies where staff ceilings have cost the Commonwealth more in uncollected revenue than it has saved. What action is proposed to ascertain further the seriousness of this problem? What action is proposed to remedy it in connection with particular departments?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I understand that there is a claim in the Press today with regard to $1,000m worth of taxes not being collected because of staff shortages. In response to a Press query this morning, the Treasurer stated that there was no factual evidence to support that allegation and that he could not substantiate a figure of that magnitude with regard to uncollected taxes caused by staff shortages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the more general question raised by Senator Button in connection with comments in the Auditor-General's report, the recent announcements by the Government on staff measures through the Cabinet Review of Commonwealth Functions are matters to be discussed between the heads of departments, the Ministers and the Public Service Board. What this will require is that the staff that is available in the departments will be there to give the service that is required. If some rearrangement of duties within a department is necessary, I feel that the heads of departments will undertake to provide required services, particularly those required by the Auditor-General.</PARA>

Is it correct that Mr Lance Barnard, a former Deputy Prime Minister in the Whitlam Labor Government, has been appointed by this Government to the position of Director of the Office of Australian War Graves in Canberra? Has this reported appointment been criticised by some people as an example of jobs for the boys or has it been correctly seen as the appointment of a former senior parliamentarian with both experience and ability to a position of responsibility?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Young has drawn attention to this very important appointment in my Department of the Director of the Office of Australian War Graves. It is correct that Mr Barnard has been appointed to that position. It is true that Mr Barnard was Deputy Prime Minister in the Labor Government of which the Prime Minister was Mr Whitlam. It is also true that there has been very wide acceptance of the appointment of a very able person who served Australia as the Ambassador to Sweden and in other places, as well as holding the office of Deputy Prime Minister with distinction. Obviously we expect to see service of that kind offered in my Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also indicate that as far as I am aware there has not been a great deal of criticism on the matter except from Senator Walsh. I noticed that he was reported as drawing attention to the jobs for the boys proposals in the Press at the same time as the announcement was made about Mr Barnard's appointment. I can only deprecate that viewpoint, and I am sorry that he sees it in that light. As I understand it, on the whole, the appointment has been well accepted in the community.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Yesterday the Minister answered a question from Senator Cavanagh about Kakadu National Park in which he said that there was a desire to change the boundaries of the Park to allow mining of the Koongarra deposit to proceed, but that the Minister would like to consult further with the traditional owners and the Northern Land Council. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It would be desirable . . . if the Government can move that way . . . with the agreement of the Aboriginal people . . .</PARA>
<PARA>How does the Minister reconcile this statement with his letter to the Northern Land Council, dated 28 April, which advised that the Federal Government had decided to excise a further area from the Kakadu National Park, in response to Denison, with no consultation?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1639" SPEAKER="Baume Sen The Hon P.E." NAMEID="ME4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no question that either the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs or the Commonwealth Government is giving away any Aboriginal land or is excising Aboriginal land for a mining company in the Alligator Rivers Region in the Northern Territory. It is quite untrue. The statement released, I think recently, by traditional owners on this matter derives from their concern about the Government's intention to realign the Koongarra project area and to exclude that project area from the Kakadu National Park.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It should be understood that regardless of whether the project area is inside the National Park or excluded from the National Park it will remain Aboriginal land, and no mining can take place on it unless the proper consent procedures are followed and unless proper consent is obtained from the traditional owners. I think that is a central point: The status of the land as Aboriginal land is not under threat and is not in question. Moreover, no mining lease can be granted over the area until the Aboriginals have concluded an agreement with the mining company in accordance with the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. The honourable senator asked about the proposed realignment.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the realignment of the proposed excision area. That is correct. This is consistent with long-standing and publicly stated Government policy to exclude the project area, should mining be approved, from the National Park. This intention was made known by the Government in 1977 when it announced its decision to permit the mining of uranium following the Ranger inquiry. The net effect of the proposed realignment of the excision area would be to make it a smaller excision area, to make the area of the National Park greater and to exclude the escarpment completely from the proposed project area. It would in fact enable some environmentally important areas to be returned to the National Park.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator is quite correct; the next step is extensive consultation with the Northern Land Council and with traditional owners. In fact I really could not communicate where we want to start from until we have a Government decision as to what we wanted to propose. But I am scheduled to visit Darwin next Sunday and Monday and I propose to take that opportunity to meet representatives of the Northern Land Council and traditional owners of the Koongarra project area to talk about their concerns and, I hope, to clarify some of the issues which have been raised.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister whether it is a fact that, prior to 1973, former members of the Parliament holding government appointed positions were entitled to only half of the ordinary parliamentary superannuation entitlements? Is it a fact that in 1973 a committee headed by former Senator Willesee recommended-a recommendation that was accepted by the Government-that on the basis of equity such appointees should receive full superannuation entitlements? Are there former members of the Parliament, other than Government members, who hold government-appointed positions-I do not ask for their names-and who receive parliamentary superannuation? Are the Commonwealth provisions similar to those which Mr Wran, the Premier of New South Wales, is currently proposing to adopt in that State?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1640" SPEAKER="Guilfoyle Sen The Hon Dame M.G.C." NAMEID="6D7" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; A number of comments have been made on this subject. It ought to be said that the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act does provide that the retiring allowance payable to a former member shall be reduced by the amount of any salary or pension payable to that member as a result of service in a State parliament or in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, and it may be reduced at the discretion of the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Trust if the member is in receipt of another Commonwealth pension, other than a social security or repatriation pension. A provision requiring a retiring allowance to be reduced where the former member was in receipt of remuneration as the holder of an office under, or from employment by, the Commonwealth or a State, or an authority of the Commonwealth or a State, was removed from the Act by the Labor Government in 1973. I think that what has been said by Senator Sim accurately explains the way in which that operated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Willesee, in his second reading speech of 31 May 1973, said that this change would bring the Act into line with the Superannuation Act and the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act, from which corresponding re-employment provisions were removed in 1965. I have seen in the Press a report to the effect that the Government of New South Wales is considering making changes to that State's parliamentary superannuation scheme, but I have no details of the proposed changes. However, the matter referred to by Senator Sim concerns the superannuation Act which, of course, applies to members of all parties. The payments that are made to any retired member are in accordance with the Act. Where necessary, the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Trust exercises its discretion and makes a decision. A number of distinguished former parliamentarians from both sides of the Parliament hold offices of profit under the Crown and have their parliamentary superannuation paid entirely in accordance with the Act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that certain questions were asked in the Senate recently concerning new restrictions on certain items of cosmetic surgery which are not carried out pursuant to medical indications. I might just note that those procedures, when medically required, can still attract benefits. I have not seen any suggestion that a further set of procedures such as those identified now by the honourable senator-I think he referred to varicose vein operations, hyster- ectomies and sterilisation-are not to be included on the list of benefits. I know of no reason why that question might have arisen.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some information from the Minister for the Capital Territory on this matter and, if the Senate will bear with me, I will seek to put as much of it as I can on the record. The Minister is aware of the meeting held last night with regard to the Belconnen Mall. I understand that over 200 persons attended that meeting and that it was resolved that a request should be made for strata titles to be issued. I am further informed that a deputation from the Australian Association for Independent Businesses, representing in particular the Belconnen Traders Association, will be meeting the Minister for the Capital Territory today. I understand that the discussions will surround the proposals which came forward from last night's meeting. I also understand that the Minister, in implementing the Government's decision to sell the Belconnen Mall and to wind up the Canberra Commercial Development Authority, will be appointing a consultant from the private sector to advise and assist the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposal posed in the question is most interesting. The Minister has informed me that he will be giving it most careful consideration, along with other proposals which no doubt will come before him. The Minister has also advised that whilst there is no legal obstacle to subdividing the complex under the Unit Titles Ordinance, it would be a most unusual course in this circumstance. Indeed, the Minister is informed that no major shopping centre anywhere in Australia currently operates under that method, although I understand that the practice has been adopted in some places overseas. The Minister wishes to give the assurance that the proposals forwarded by the Belconnen shopkeepers will be given most careful and detailed consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> In principle it can be stated that the concept of private ownership accords with this Government's philosophy and with the motivation behind the decision of the Government to release the Belconnen Mall to the private sector. The Minister understands that the deputation this afternoon will let him have a detailed written submission on the matter, and naturally he will have to take that into account in making final recommendations on the matter. The Minister also wanted me to note that the leader of the Australian Labor Party in the House of Assembly has already announced a firm commitment by the Labor Party, if elected, to buy back Belconnen Mall. That would create a fairly interesting situation if strata titles had been entered into. Finally, I should indicate that it is a matter of very detailed concern, but one which accords with the Government's philosophy. It certainly will be one which the Minister will be taking very seriously.</PARA>

I would have thought that in any case it would be made at the Prime Ministerial level. I am not aware of any such approaches but I will check to see whether any have been made.

<PARA> The Northern Territory is faced with a considerable dilemma. It does not have a source of coal. It has a very antiquated power station which is making a very severe loss of the order of $50m or $60m a year. That is an intolerable burden on Australian taxpayers. The question is as to its replacement. The Territory does not have a coal supply close by. It has been examining a number of methods of alternative supply of energy. One proposal which the Commonwealth has assisted in considering has been that in co-partnership with Western Australia a hydro-electric scheme should be developed on the Ord River and there should be a sharing of power by means of a reticulation power line to the Northern Territory. I understand that experts say that such a scheme would be technically possible and economic. That proposal is still under practical consideration. The Northern Territory has been looking to see whether it could attract major industries to build up its base load of power. The size of a power station and its type of generation depend very much upon its base load. I understand that it has been unable to attract industries of the size of an alumina smelter or a similar kind of industry. Therefore a coal-based power station automatically pre-selects itself. There have been some reports in the Press that the Northern Territory Government has looked at the possibility of using nuclear energy.

The fact of the matter is that anybody who understands nuclear power would know that if we were to have a nuclear power station, in order to have economies of scale it would have to be a very large one indeed. That would be completely out of consideration in the Northern Territory context. The matter did not have any factual basis from the start. It would require enormous redevelopment of industry in the Northern Territory. There has been no discussion on the matter with me. There have been numerous and continuous discussions with my Department. I do not doubt that Northern Territory officers have raised with officers of my Department the feasibility of nuclear power generation. Indeed, there has been a running dialogue. But, taken in context, in the areas of Australia where we have cheap coal the use of coal for the generation of power would be immensely cheaper than the use of nuclear energy and there would be no necessity for more expensive or complex power generation. It is true that the availability of coal in Western Australia is limited basically to the Collie area. Nevertheless, natural gas is coming ashore. I know that there have been some discussions within Western Australia, but I do not know of any that are immediately current.

Since the commencement of the new DFRDB Scheme annual pension increases have been granted to former Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Scheme pensioners, that is, those who retired before October 1972.

<PARA> It is true that the MANS committee was a Joint Commonwealth-State committee and that prior to reaching its final conclusions the State officials withdrew on the instructions of their Government. It is true also that the Commonwealth officers on that committee recommended that there be a close-spaced parallel runway. I presume that the withdrawal of the State officials signifies that they did not support that proposal. So that is factual. But what I want to make perfectly clear is that the New South Wales Government has at least as much responsibility as the Commonwealth Government to determine what is to be the solution for Sydney and New South Wales for the next decade or two decades and it has done nothing to indicate what that solution should be. It is no solution at all to point to an area like Bringelly or elsewhere and say: 'In 20 years time we will have an international airport'. What I said yesterday-I repeat it now-is that we are already denying the people of Sydney valuable work and valuable tourist ingress by the fact that because of this impasse we now have to deflect international airline flights to Brisbane and Melbourne. That will continue. We are facing an incapacity to deal with wide-bodied jets. Far more importantly, unless the State Government is willing to face up to the matter, the commuter airlines from all country districts will face a limitation and an ultimate near or total exclusion. The real fact of the matter is that the State has not put up any solution whatsoever of the problem in the next decade or two decades. It is no solution at all to talk about a second international airport. The only solution which has been put up is the close-spaced parallel runway. There is no other solution. That is the one which the Commonwealth is advocating that the State now support so that it can get on with the job to see that Sydney is not further deprived and that the country people of New South Wales are not denied their commuter services.</PARA>

In seeking this objective we acknowledge the important role to be played in the non-government sphere by organisations such as Amnesty International.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Several days ago, I think in response to Senator Georges, I outlined the situation regarding Bobby Sands. I think it does not help at all to cause a controversy on the matter. The fact is that the problems of Northern Ireland are both complex and tragic and, as the Prime Minister said on 29 April, they are properly the responsibility of the United Kingdom Government. There has been some question about the status of Bobby Sands as a prisoner. He was not a political prisoner as such. In the past, Bobby Sands had been convicted for an offence of armed robbery and had served a sentence for that. He was subsequently convicted of being in possession of weapons and was serving a gaol sentence. Nobody looks with anything other than great sadness on the fact that he chose to take his own life. Nobody looks with anything but utter misery on the plight of that torn apart country of Northern Ireland today. But it does not help for us to add to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that the man, in the ordinary processes of law-I think no one disputes that they were the ordinary processes of law-was convicted and was in gaol. The fact is that the man, while in gaol, elected not to take nourishment and to face the inevitable consequence of that by surrendering his own life. That was a choice that he chose to make. It could have been rectified at any time. He sought to do that and he has done that. I suggest that what we should do is direct our attentions to how we can help to resolve the overall problem of a country which, for some hundreds of years, has been torn apart by civil war and internal fighting. Everybody regards this as ugly and horrible. I would not want to say a single thing that would exacerbate that problem.</PARA>

The Minister, to whom the first person pronouns apply, has replied as follows: On 28 April Senator Button asked for information concerning the level of Australia's overseas aid. I wish to assure the honourable senator that the Government remains committed to achieving the target set by the United Nations General Assembly for developed countries to contribute 0.7 per cent each year of their gross national product towards official development assistance for less developed countries. At the United Nations General Assembly in 1980 Australia undertook to make its best efforts to reach the target by 1990 and continues to maintain this position. As the honourable senator indicated, Australia's ODA for 1980-81 amounts to about 0.43 per cent of forecast GNP. This is the same percentage as that recorded in the previous year and at $553m represents an overall increase of 10.6 per cent over net expenditure last financial year.

The thrust of the Government's decision is to encourage people back to health insurance. On this basis the decision was made that the concessional rebate arrangement of 32c in the dollar outside the $1,590 block would apply to premiums for basic hospital and medical insurance. So two kinds of rebateability are available-one for everyone in terms of basic hospital and medical insurance and one for those who have net expenses.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(Victoria-Leader of the Opposition) (3.44)-Mr President, as I understand it, the Senate was to debate three issues today. Whatever procedures have been announced, I intend to do so. They are the Government's health statement, the statement on taxation and the statement on the ministerial Review of Commonwealth Functions which was carried out by the so-called razor gang. As far as the Opposition is concerned, these three statements illustrate the essential style of the Fraser Government. I characterise that essential style as muddled, incompetent, dishonest and destroying the political integrity and trust in the political system. There has been a charade of broken promises. The other feature which one can add to the description of 'muddled, incompetent and dishonest' is that the Government is stoned out of its collective mind with crude ideology. I wish to illustrate those points. They are quite substantial points-I ask Senator Walters who is trying to interject to bear the pain of waiting for a minute-which are easily illustrated in the context of the three statemens which are now before the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, let me turn to the question of health. When I use the expression 'integrity in government', I think that all honourable senators will recall the promise of the Fraser Government to maintain Medibank. This is the fifth attempt by the Fraser Government to dishonour that promise to maintain Medibank. It is muddled, incompetent, and dishonest. It is also the fifth attempt to dishonour that promise. It means increased health charges for the ordinary citizen of Australia. It means that, far from the promised freedom of choice which the Fraser Government offers, the citizens of Australia will be conscripted into private health funds and have no choice in relation to that matter. It means an inevitable increase in the size of the Australian bureacracy-in the Department of Social Security-or total inefficiency in the assessment of the disadvantaged under the new proposals. It also means that it is not the final attempt to dishonour the promise in relation to Medibank, because it will have to be done again. </PARA>
<PARA> That is justified in terms of the slogan 'the user pays', as if the users of health care services were in exactly the same category as people choosing a motor car, be it a Jaguar, a Holden or whatever their choice might be. That is not so in relation to any mortal who cannot determine what his health situation is going to be. It is a proposal which, again, illustrates incompetence in the fact that it was being changed up to an hour before it was given in the House of Representatives last week by the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar). </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there is the statement on taxation which illustrates the same points and in which Senator Walters, having exhibited a bit of bravado at the beginning of my remarks, has now lost interest. The statement on taxation also flows from the breaking of a promise which was made by the Fraser Government in 1975, accompanied by the brave rhetorical explanation that in the view of the Government tax indexation was necessary to keep governments honest. That promise was half honoured two years later. It has now been abandoned completely. Five years later honesty is the last thing that the Fraser Government wants as a criterion for its activities. Again, the news of that undertaking to abandon tax indexation did not get to the back bench of the Government parties until a few hours before it was given, if at all. This is another feature of the Fraser Government's style. Years ago Andrew Peacock used to have a club called the mushroom club. The whole of the Liberal Party is now a mushroom club. It is kept in the dark and fed on Fraser rhetoric. The Standing Orders prevent me from using another word which every honourable senator knows. It is a fact that the party is kept in the dark by the Fraser Government and fed on fresh bursts of ideology from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the so-called razor gang. The report of the so-called razor gang is one which is full of sound and fury. It signifies very little except the flowering of Fraser Government ideology. It also represents, in a sense, a mad experiment in social engineering in which the Australian people are the guinea pigs designated for vivisection by this Government. It reminds me of the early horror films in which a deranged and deregistered doctor performed operations on innocent victims in the hope of creating some perfect human being and ended up creating a Frankenstein monster. The Cabinet of Malcolm Fraser is the Cabinet of Dr Calligari of the early horror films. The Fraser Government is experimenting in a social sense with an ideology which is totally unproven and which has no basic rationale, other than a series of slogans. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me not be misunderstood. I am not for a moment saying that it is not appropriate to have a review of Commonwealth Government functions. Of course it is appropriate to have such a review. I am not saying that institutions of the Commonwealth Government and past practices of the Commonwealth Government are in any sense sacrosanct. They are not. They should be subject to regular and sensible examination. I am merely saying that the latest activity-the razor gang's report-displays incompetence and muddling, and does not direct itself to the essential questions of good government. How could it direct itself to the essential questions of good government if the rationale for it is a series of unproven cliches and unproven slogans? It is said that the private sector will take up the slack. Will it do that as an act of faith? It is said that there will be more elbow room for the private sector as a result of the razor gang's deliberations. Another slogan used by the razor gang is that the user will pay. How much will the user pay? We will look at that in a moment. How much will the user pay in terms of export incentives given to companies as deductions and so on? Will the user pay only in respect of health services? As an experiment in government, the notion of the razor gang is absurd. It is advocating across the board cuts in the Public Service. That is a matter of rhetoric and ideology. What the razor gang has not done, and this is where the incompetence arises, has been to look at the functions of government in particular circumstances-for example, the returning to the States or private enterprise of the functions of government as an act of faith, not as a rational explanation of what the Government is about in terms of policy and decision-making. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me illustrate the point I am making by reference to education. The education services which a community provides are a function of education philosophy and education policy. They are not and should not be susceptible to crude ideology across the board. If, as the razor gang says, there is to be a further restriction on the eligibility of students to obtain tertiary education assistance, any decision on that should be about access to tertiary education. It is not a decision to be dealt with in a crude way by the so-called razor gang. It involves important questions of social policy. The same applies to the colleges of advanced education which it is said will be abolished. We all know that none of them will really be abolished. The question involved in restricting eligibility for the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme is a question which relates to access to education. It is a matter which will determine the future shape and quality of the society in which we live. It should not be determined by a group of political stuntmen, as the razor gang is. It should have been determined as a matter of Government education policy, not as a question of Fraser Government stunts. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the areas of productivity, innovation, technological assessment and transfer. Properly handled, they are very important and vital functions of government in a modern economy. Indeed, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) thought so himself a few years ago. In relation to these matters of productivity, innovation, technological transfer, in answer to a question in the House of Representatives on 9 November 1976, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the problems relating to productivity, management, labour and new technologies are matters that have always been there. They are long-term issues; they do not go away. </PARA>
<PARA>They went away last week as far as the Commonwealth Government is concerned. In the razor gang's report there were very significant cuts and a winding down of government initiatives in relation to all these matters, as a stunt in preparation for the next election. The Prime Minister was right when he said that in 1976. I am not a person who takes a biased or one-eyed view of the Prime Minister. He is sometimes right and he was right in 1976 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> They are long-term issues; they do not go away. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course what has happened with this report is that the long-term issues are no longer being considered. As with education, productivity and technology, they are no longer being considered. This Government thinks no further than the next election and that is bad government. </PARA>
<PARA> I next look at the Commonwealth Employment Service. As a result of the abolition of CES statistics announced by the razor gang, a detailed breakdown of employment figures in the regions will no longer be available. That means that if we want to get detailed employment figures for places such as the Hunter Valley, Gladstone, the Latrobe Valley or Ballarat they will not be obtainable. Are these figures no longer important to this Government? Maybe it is very important to it not to have the unemployment figures for those places, but is it no longer important to the Government not to know the detailed breakdown of employment figures in those regions? If it is important, as this Government says, that the resources boom be handled properly, is it not vital to know the employment pattern in particular areas in Australia? Is it not vitally important to good government, as distinct from mad ideological government in the hands of a bunch of hillbillies meeting here in Parliament House?</PARA>
<PARA> The same thing can be said about the research functions of the Commonwealth Government which have been consistently wound down and are now being wound down further. These functions relate to the future of Australia and, of course, do not relate to the next election. That is why they have been wound down. But the future of Australia is more important than the next election and returning Malcolm Fraser to government at that election. That is what this document is about. All these things are examples of bad decision-making and lack of understanding of the function of government. It is the functions of government which have not been looked at by the so-called razor gang. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to some of the decisions of this Government revealed by the razor gang to be wasteful, incompetent and/or dishonest. I will give some examples. I refer to the Broadcasting Information Service. A big sum of money is not involved but let us look at the history of that institution. It was a 1977 election promise of the Fraser Government to establish the Broadcasting Information Service. The Government had a mandate to establish that Service, but it did not have a mandate for anything which is in this report. A year ago it established the Broadcasting Information Service and appointed Mr Ian Fairweather at a salary of $30,000 a year to run that Service. For 12 months Mr Ian Fairweather was given nothing to do. He sat on his block-if honourable senators will pardon the colloquialism-earnt $30,000 and last week his job was abolished. Is that an example of competent government? Is that an example of careful government? I refer to other examples which are equally as bad. Only a month ago-this relates to questions of function in which Senator Walters will be interested-the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) opened the new building for the Australian Curriculum Development Centre in Canberra. I will quote from his speech given at the grand opening and launching of the Curriculum Development Centre. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> In the five years since its establishment the Curriculum Development Centre has undertaken a formidable array of projects which have resulted in an enrichment of the fabric of Australian education. </PARA>
<PARA>The whole speech was like that but that is one passage that I picked out. That speech was made on 18 March. Five weeks later the Curriculum Development Centre, whose new building was opened by the Minister with all those glorious expressions of what a great thing it was, was abolished. What did that little exercise cost the taxpayers of Australia? What did that new building and all the activities associated with its opening cost the peope of Australia? Is that good government? Is it not the function of the Minister for Education to determine what shall be done about these issues, or is it the function of the razor government? Of course the Minister for Education is a mouse compared with the razor gang, the heavies, who carry out all these silly decisions. I refer to the decision not to proceed with the electrification of the Sydney-Melbourne railway line. The razor gang says that it is not to proceed as it is not a worthwhile project. I refer to what the Prime Minister said last year about the electrification of the Sydney-Melbourne railway line. I will quote from his electorate talk given on 29 June 1980. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has also offered to fund half the cost of electrifying the Sydney-Melbourne railway line. </PARA>
<PARA>A couple of paragraphs on he said:</PARA>
<PARA> All these projects are a dramatic illustration of our commitment to Australia's national development, and of our desire to channel Government spending into directions that will build the basic strength of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>In June 1980 the Prime Minister of this country made a virtue out of electrification of the Sydney-Melboure railway line. What happened to him was that the States said that it was a silly, wasteful program and knocked it back. Ten days ago, the Prime Minister makes a virtue out of changing that decision. Where now is the commitment to develop Australia's national institutions and to channel government expenditure to build the basic strength of Australia? Is that to be abandoned too? This is a now you see it, now you don't aspect of Fraser Government policy. It is a great sleight of hand. The Government produced the electrification of the railway line before the election, said what a good thing it was and made a virtue of that, but after the election it abolished it and said what a great thing that was. Now you see it, now you don't. </PARA>
<PARA> I will refer to some other quite silly things which have been done. I single out the area of communications. All these matters to which I am referring are designed basically to illustrate incompetence and that is what the razor gang report is. It is an incompetent document. The razor gang is a group of Ministers pulling not only the Parliament by the nose but also all honourable senators on the Government side. They have not read the review closely. They are so hepped up and steamed up with rhetoric. I refer to the communications decisions of the razor gang report. The decision of the Government on the Australian Broadcasting Commission is that there is scope for rationalisation of existing ABC locations. That sounds pretty important. It seems as though the Government will save a lot of money and that sounds very good. For the last three years the report of the Australian Broadcasting Commission to this Parliament and this Government has said: 'We want to rationalise our building facilities, but we do not have enough money to do it. Will you give us money to let us rationalise our building facilities?' The big razor gang came along and said: 'You have to rationalise your building facilities. Are we not a thoughtful group of good housekeepers in telling you what to do?' For three years the Commission has asked the Government to do that. Did the razor gang know nothing about that? Did it not consult with the ABC about that, or did it make this decision as do so many others-off the top of their silly heads? Secondly the Broadcasting Information Service, to which I have already referred, was created, a salary was paid to a man who was given nothing to do and then it was abolished. The Australia Post Courier Service, grandiosely says the razor gang, will be abolished and replaced by another body called something else. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have it in front of me. The honourable senator should not pick on me because I did not have my glasses on. That is unkind of the honourable senator with his natural generosity. The Australia Post Courier Service will be abolished. If honourable senators examine that they will see that what it really means is that the vans will be repainted. At what cost will this be to the Australian taxpayer? It will be called something else and basically it will carry out the same functions. It is described by the razor gang as some sort of government economy and saving. All that will happen is that the vans will be repainted at great cost. No doubt the work will go to the private sector so everybody will be all right. Rolf Harris or somebody will do it. The next decision of the razor gang relates to Telecom Australia. An inquiry into the functions of Telecom will be set up. Of course that inquiry is a sham in the context in which it is being announced. It is a sham because this Government has already stated its views about Telecom and they are pretty clear. I will indicate briefly the nature of those decisions which have been made about Telecom. The decision to set up an inquiry into Telecom is justified by the ideological, hobgoblin stuff of user payers. Let us look at the user pay principle in respect of Telecom. It is the only enterprise in Australia which has not increased its charges since 1975. No business in the private sector of the community can say that. Anybody who is listening to this debate will know that there is no business from the corner store to the great emporium that has not increased charges since 1975, other than Telecom. Telecom employs a lot of people and it is a profitable organisation. So the beady eyes of the private enterprise entrepeneurs fix on Telecom. The entrepreneurs say: 'Bits of that are pretty profitable. We ought to have that because we are interested in profits'. That is a legitimate activity, I suppose, for those people to engage in. But let me deal with the justification for this inquiry, that is, the ideology of user payers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The profitable sector of the work done by Telecom subsidises the unprofitable sector, namely, the development of the country telephone network. It did so to the extent of $218m last year. Will honourable senators opposite go into the country electorates and say to the people-'We are selling the profitable part of Telecom because we believe in private enterprise and we are going to put your telephone services to tender for public enterprise'? The people out in the bush know that nobody interested in profits will buy that part of the telephone service. What is the Government really saying about that? It is saying that the profitable sector of Telecom can be taken away from it and given to its friends in private enterprise and that the taxpayers can pay for the country networks from now on. Is that the intention?</PARA>
<PARA> I am intrigued to see that post offices are to become organisations for the distribution of Government information brochures. Does not the Government have enough organisations working for it already at taxpayers expense trying to explain silly decisions like the decisions of the razor gang? I would have thought so. It has the Government Information Unit and all these other bodies such as Project Australia already working for it. Why does the Government want the poor post offices to distribute information to try to explain its policies? What will this cost? The razor gang does not tell us how much it will cost. I refer to other gobblydegook such as the decision that the High Court of Australia is to continue to have its reports published by private enterprise. It has been doing that for donkey's years. What is new about that? Another decision is that the Darwin university will not now be built; an eminently sensible decision, if I might say so. But there was never any commitment to build Darwin university. What is the Government doing by cluttering up the report with that sort of thing? That just adds additional costs for the Government Printer. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from these silly sorts of expenditure cuts which illustrate imcompetence and bad government, a whole lot of extravagances which have been maintained are private extravagances of the Prime Minister. Andrew Peacock put his finger on this 10 or 14 days ago when he said that the Prime Minister had an obsession to get his own way. He got his own way with a few of these funny little organisations that have been abolished by the razor gang and others. But he also got his own way with things that were not examined, such as his own two private Boeing aircraft which cost $40m; the racing circuit which is to be built in Canberra-his pet hobby-at a cost of $2m; the Industrial Relations Bureau which costs $4m a year, I think, the abolition of which was recommended by the former Minister for Industrial Relations; and the defence academy known as Casey University which is to cost $80m-a private aberration of the Prime Minister-and something which was said by a joint committee of this Parliament, comprising Liberal, Labor and National Country Party representatives, to be an extravagance and unnecessary. The razor gang ignored the view of this Parliament on that issue and instead took the view of the Prime Minister. Other areas include Project Australia in respect of which there is a total commitment of $4m for a lot of rubbishy stuff which is put out basically in an attempt to tell the people of Australia that their problems are their own fault rather than the fault of the Fraser Government. The Government Information Unit and the octopus of the Department of Defence have received the gentle hand. One could mention the 101 tax rorts which the razor gang does not talk about. The sad fact is that many Ministers in this Government know nothing about all of this. They are told about it at the last moment. </PARA>
<PARA> This statement of the razor gang, so-called, does nothing to reduce the size of Government in Australia in any significant way. It is not a statement which affects the Commonwealth Budget to more than perhaps 0.5 per cent in recurrent Government expenditure. But the cost of implementing the proposals is significant. This statement is supported by flimsy rhetoric in which there is an incompetent display of an understanding by the Prime Minister of the functions of government in Australia and how these functions should be exercised. There is a good deal of rhetoric at the beginning of the statement about the Government's commitment to prevent centralisation of power in Australia. Under this Government in the last five years this country has moved more and more towards a corporate state. Small businesses are in a worse position than they have ever been. Honourable senators only have to look at their neighbourhoods to see the corner stores disappearing day after day in favour of multinational companies like BP, for example, which are running grocery stores. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister can go through the list of multinationals until he is black and blue in the face as far as I am concerned. I am talking about the multinationals which operate grocery stores in Australia and are putting small businesses out of business. There has been a great centralisation of power. There is no better example of this than in the Prime Minister's own Department where staff has increased by 17 per cent since his tenure of office; Treasury has grown by 10 per cent; the staff of the Public Service Board has grown by 5 per cent; and the Commonwealth Police force has increased by 40 per cent. That is centralisation of power within government. Mr Peacock's charges about that are absolutely substantiated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One could go on to deal with a number of other things which illustrate the Fraser Government's incapacity even to think out its own commitment on some of these matters. There is no consistent philosophy in the statement. The impact will be on the less fortunate members of the community who need resources and on the future of Australia 10 and 20 years beyond the next election. This report in no way applies itself to the proper functions of Government. We of the Opposition are not upset about these sorts of exercises except to say that they illustrate incompetent government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is easy to fool the honourable senator. He is a sucker for that. We are not concerned that these inquiries should take place. What we are concerned about is that they should be handled competently and they should address themselves to the real functions of government. In the overall context of the Australian economy, this is what the Labor Party considers to be the proper function of the public sector: To promote the welfare of the most needy in this country; to provide information for the Australian community and the private sector; to intervene in the economy to stimulate competition and to promote efficiency and social justice, not to water down the provisions of the trade practices legislation; and to promote the genuine decentralisation of power in this country. The razor gang report addresses itself to none of those questions. As I said, its basic characteristics are incompetence and shallowness. For those reasons, it is to be condemned.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating, as Senator Button has admitted, the general philosophies of two parties. The ideology of the Opposition, as its supporters themselves state, is one of socialism. The ideology of our Government is one of private enterprise. Socialism, of course, is the individual being subservient to the state. Private enterprise is the state being subservient to the individual. Senator Button has referred to the beady eyes of private enterprise being on anything that makes a dollar. But what is the function of government? Senator Button obviously has a totally different impression of the function of government from what we on this side of the chamber have. On that side of the chamber he believes that the function of government is to make a profit. He says: 'Let's make a profit; let's go into areas which could well be conducted by private enterprise; let's own Belconnen Mall, for instance'. During the Whitlam reign this Mall was built. The Government held on to it and made a profit out of it. Senator Button objects to its being sold. He objects to the people buying Belconnen Mall, running their own affairs and doing things which we on this side of the House believe private enterprise and the people can do far more efficiently and far more effectively.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Evans was reported as wanting the best of both worlds. He wants the ideology of socialism retained in his party but he does not want us to know about it. He does not want it to be highlighted. He wants it to be low. He suggests that it be taken out of the written policy of the Opposition because it does not appear to be too popular at election time. There has been centralisation versus decentralisation. Right from the very beginning when this Government came to power in 1975 it brought in the concept of decentralisation of power. We believe the States, which are nearer to the people, should have the power, in accord with the provisions of the Constitution, to look after matters in a much better fashion than can the Government in Canberra. This is anathema to the Labor Party. It wants all the power centralised in Canberra. It is certainly bucking now at the razor gang's decentralisation program which has been brought forward in a bigger way than any other government has done in this country. We have underlined our policy and put it to the people, as we have done at the last three elections, and the people have supported us and said yes, this is what they want. They have rejected the socialism power policy of the Opposition. They rejected it in 1975 by the largest majority this country has ever seen and in the most positive way possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The whole philosophy of that report was in our election policy.

Our election promise was for smaller government. This is a positive step towards smaller government. But this matter was debated very thoroughly in this place yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to deal in the main with the health statement put forward by the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar). I believe it is the best policy that we have had since our health system was interfered with by the Whitlam Government-that is, since Medibank. I agree with the Opposition when it ways that the previous systems which we introduced were half-baked. I agree entirely with any statements along those lines. This policy is not half-baked; it is responsible health policy. I do not believe for one instant that Senator Grimes, who is certainly knowledgeable in the health cost field, would not admit that health costs were going off the map. Every single Opposition senator knows that health costs have escalated beyond reason. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has stated eight separate areas in relation to health, and I wish to refer to those areas. First, the Commonwealth Government's responsibility is to protect those in genuine need. I believe that is most important. Secondly, Australians should be more responsible for their own health through looking after their lifestyles in a more responsible fashion and that they should be made more aware of the costs of ill-health to taxpayers. Thirdly, the Government believes that those who can afford to pay should be required to pay and should not rely on others to pay for them. Fourthly, the Government believes it should be willing to assist those who can afford to pay and who do pay, but should not assist those who can pay but are not willing to pay. Fifthly, health insurance should be available to everyone at a reasonable cost. Sixthly, the private hospital sector should be acknowledged as a vital part of our health scheme. I am sure the Opposition would disagree with that principle, as it has done on many occasions. Seventhly, all those involved in providing health care services should be made more aware of the costs that they generate. Eighthly, the States must accept their constitutional responsibility for their health services. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall refer one by one to those eight statements which the Minister made. Firstly, honourable senators should look at the Commonwealth Government's responsibility to protect those genuinely in need. The Government believes that this is the area for which it, and not the States, should be responsible. As a result, it has taken on the responsibility of those who are disadvantaged. I shall read what the term 'disadvantaged' covers, because there has not been much discussion on this matter and the detail of it has not been put forward. Firstly, for migrants and refugees, in their first six months settling in period, the Government believes there should be no test. The Government will look after their health costs. The currently unemployed and special beneficiaries, including their dependants, with incomes below the pensioner health benefits limits, will not be classed as pensioners but will qualify under the health benefit but not the other fringe benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to a married couple-this is a new departure; it is not just in respect of pensioners and beneficiaries-for those who have a joint income less than the cut-out point for unemployment benefit for a married couple this would equal about $160 a week, plus $20 for each child. Therefore, for a married couple with three children the cut-out point would be $220 a week. On top of that $160 a week for that married couple, $20 is allowed for each child. That is an income which the Government believes should enable them to take over responsibility for their health care. For a sole parent with one child the income limit would be the same as for a married couple, that is $160, and again there would be an additional $20 for each child. For single people without dependants, the income limit will be sixty per cent of the income of a married couple, that is, $96 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> Over one million people will be classified as disadvantaged. The Commonwealth medical benefits scheme limit will now be 85 per cent as opposed to the 75 per cent for the disadvantaged which was previously suggested. This figure of 85 per cent is equal to the pensioner health card arrangements. A patient in this classification will be able to take his doctor's bill to any fund for payment. All he will have to do is show his identifying card, and the costs will be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area I referred to was that every Australian should be made more responsible for his own health and should be made fully aware of the costs. It was suggested to our back bench committee when it was looking at this scheme that public hospitals should, when presenting a bill to a patient, print on the patient's bill the actual cost of the patient's stay in hospital. For instance, if a person has been in a big public teaching hospital in Sydney or Melbourne for five days at $250 a day, which is a rough estimate of the per day bed charge in such a hospital, that fact should be noted-the amount $1,250 should appear on the bill. Then the patient will be fully aware that the cost was much more than he or she is actually paying. Charges for pathology or other treatment should be added. In that way the patient will become aware that ill health is a costly business. It is also suggested that from this overall total the subsidy should be subtracted and the patient shown that what he or she pays is just a drop in the ocean compared with the actual cost. That would be a very commendable process and I would appreciate it if the State governments took up the suggestion. I believe that people are not fully aware of the heavy costs that these big hospitals undertake on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area of Government concern is that those who can afford to pay should be required to contribute. I doubt that many members of the Opposition would suggest that the more wealthy members of our community should be able to use our public hospitals and obtain health care completely free of charge while many pensioners, because of their particular priorities and feelings of responsibility towards their health care, do without other things in order to pay for insurance. Many pensioners do exactly that. I believe it is an anomaly that pensioners should contribute to health insurance while wealthy people are allowed to use public hospitals completely free of charge. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth area flows from what I have just said. The Government believes that, of those who can afford to insure, it should assist only those who are willing to do so. Because of its firm belief that people should be responsible for their own health care the Government has decided that medical benefits shall go to only those who care to insure themselves. Anyone who decides to go it alone and not insure will have to meet the full bill. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not produce compulsory insurance at all. It represents a choice that some people may well make. Many Australians are gamblers at heart and will gamble that they will not have any health costs. They can do that. If they do, they should be fully aware of what they are undertaking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Fifthly, health insurance should be available to everyone at a reasonable cost. The Government is fully aware of the complications inherent in joining the various health funds-the numerous tables, levels, ancillary services and additional services. It has insisted that only two tables be involved. First, there would be a basic table which would cover public hospital care and basic medical costs. It would represent relatively cheap insurance. The other table would embrace additional costs such as private hospital care and ancillary services. I believe that the use of these two tables will simplify health insurance for the majority of the community and will avoid the tremendous concern as to which table one should insure under, a factor that has worried so many of us in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Government has decided that basic hospital costs should attract a tax rebate. Once again, according to the policy that those less able to pay should not be disadvantaged, the Government has decided that there is to be a rebate of 32c in the dollar across the board for expenditure on basic tables; that means everyone will get the same rebate; that those who take out additional health insurance will not receive an added rebate in that respect. Whatever table one insures under one will still receive the same rebate. Those who take on the responsibility of insuring themselves should receive recompense by way of tax rebates. </PARA>
<PARA> Sixthly, the private hospital sector should be acknowledged as a vital part of our health scheme. The Government is aware that, as a rule, the small private hospitals are far more cost effective than are the big teaching hospitals or the bigger public hospitals. The Government is very concerned that such hospitals should be able to operate in an effective and efficient manner. The $16 a day bed subsidy that the Government has given to these private hospitals for so many years has been increased in respect of surgical hospital beds, which are the more expensive, to $28 a day. That proposal has been welcomed by private hospitals, which see it as contributing to a vital part of their viability. </PARA>
<PARA> Seventhly, all involved in providing health care services should be made more aware of the costs that they generate. Since the introduction by the Opposition of the first Whitlam or Hayden Medibank scheme people have been brainwashed into believing that there is such a thing as free medicine. There is no such thing as free medicine, free hospitals or free health. Since then the taxpayers have become aware that there can be no free health, that we must pay for it. With the new technology, the cost of health has grown tremendously. Medical students, from the beginning, should be made aware of the costs that they will generate when they complete their training. Committees have examined this problem of providers of health care being kept aware of rising health costs and have made many recommendations and the medical schools have taken these up. And a tremendous amount of education in this regard has taken place. An example of this is that, a couple of years ago, when the Government introduced a new scheme in respect of pathology, under which a doctor does not merely tick off from a prepared list the pathology services that he requires but makes out his own list, the temptation to tick more services than were necessary was done away with. That has been very successful. It is one way in which many costs have been saved. There is still a long way to go in this matter because, even if insurance companies meet the costs, doctors tend to over-utilise some pathology and diagnostic services. That fact should be driven home even more. </PARA>
<PARA> Eightly, and finally, the States must accept their contributional responsibility for the health services. There are two ways in which we could go about promoting this. The Jamison report said clearly that there was gross inefficiency in the public hospitals sector. Perhaps I could quite briefly from that report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Cost-Sharing Agreements . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is, the 50-50 agreements that are in place at the moment-</PARA>
<PARA>have rewarded the expensive and punished the efficient and have perpetuated rather than solved some of the main problems in Australia's health system. </PARA>
<PARA>Today the community cannot be expected continually to support by way of taxation and their own personal expenditure any wasteful and inefficient public hospital systems in Australia. We know that when nobody is responsible for the payment of a thing inefficiency occurs; no one is particularly interested in saving money in that case. We know, even amongst ourselves, that if we pay only half the bill we tend to add a few extra dollars. The States have indulged in that practice over many years. It has been particularly obvious in my State, and the hospital system in Tasmania is in a diabolical state at the moment. I put that down to the fact that no one is interested in paying the whole of the cost. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the Commonwealth constitutionally was not responsible for the hospitals, its hands were tied; and under the 50-50 sharing arrangements the State decided the amount it wanted and the Commonwealth was obliged to pay 50 per cent of that amount. As I said there are two possible methods of funding hospitals. Firstly, the Government could give to the States an amount of money which could be absorbed totally into the general revenue grants and the States could take that money and use it in any way they liked. They could use it for roads or for any other of their priorities. The other method is to fund by way of tied grants. The Government would give a certain amount of money to the States and the States would have to use that amount on hospitals and could add to it if they so desired. The Government has decided that funds for public hospitals, community health programs and the school dental scheme should be included in general revenue grants, but because radical and extensive change should not be made overnight the Government has decided that at the moment it will hasten slowly and that in the short term the money will be earmarked. The general idea is that it will eventually go into general purpose grants. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreements with the Tasmanian and South Australian governments do not expire until 1985. The 50-50 agreements between the Commonwealth and the other States expire this year. Tasmania and South Australia will have to decide whether they are going to take up this new system or whether they will continue the 50-50 agreement until 1985. I only hope that Tasmania takes up the new agreement, because if it does not the present scheme will continue. In Tasmania at the moment wards are being closed, pregnant women are being denied access to hospitals purely because they are insured, those responsible enough to be insured are being denied access to hospitals, surgical times are being cut in half and surgical patients are being denied access to these hospitals. Many pitiful examples of urgent cases that have not been able to go into hospital at the required time have been brought to the notice of the media, and that sort of thing is completely unforgivable. The States must end up by taking up this option from the Government. They have been given permission, if they so desire, to charge in public hospitals and to charge outpatients, so that people who are on high incomes must pay when they go into private hospitals. People will insure themselves if the State decides to do that. I believe it is important for our Premiers to look very closely at what the Government is offering. I sincerely hope that he does so. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I come back to the philosophies of the two parties. The health statement and the Review of Commonwealth Functions are philosophical matters. The debate today is purely an ideological and philosophical matter. The difference between the two sides must be clearly pointed out to the people of Australia. If the people do not want the cuts that this Government has suggested, the efficiences that have been underlined, the amalgamation of overlapping committees, the sale of the Belconnen Mall, for example-if they want socialism-then they can object to our policies. But let them understand very clearly that the Australian Labor Party at times in its history has tried to nationalise all sorts of institutions in this country. It tried to nationalise the banks. It tried to nationalise the insurance industry. Let us not be mistaken: The Opposition is a dedicated socialist party whose aim is nationalisation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was concerned about that but there is no problem. Since moving this amendment to proposed new section 98BE of the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill late last night, I have had the chance to make further inquiries about its implications, including inquiries of officials of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. As a result, I am now even more concerned about the legislation as it now stands. I think it is fair enough to say that I do not think the Government amendment to be moved later, a copy of which I have seen, improves the position very much. However, I shall address my remarks to my own amendment. To give some background, basically this Bill sets up a Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal to set pharmacists' fees for dispensing prescriptions under the National Health Scheme. The Australian Democrats obviously agree with that. A necessary mechanism is being created which has not existed in that form before. It is high time it did exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is essential for everybody in Australia who is using health care or who may need it-after all, that means all of us-that there should be a fair, smooth-running system of dispensing the medicines which are such an important element of treatment. This is the job of the pharmacies. They have traditionally done this for a long time and there is no question of their not continuing to do so. They are involved intimately in the medical process and its proper procedure. Australia's 5,000 pharmacies deal with millions of Australians every year, dispensing, I understand, 100 million prescriptions in that time. So it is not a small business that we are talking about. It is a very large business and one that affects every man, woman and child in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether these pharmacies can remain viable businesses making a reasonable profit is very much the business of this Tribunal. It is established to see that there is a reasonable profit margin in the area and that there is not an unreasonable profit. But it is also established to see that a continuous situation is provided which will allow the pharmacies to carry out this work they do on behalf of the community. At this stage I think it is important to stress that they do not have any option but to accept what the Tribunal says. Unlike doctors, pharmacists cannot say: 'Fees have been set at this amount but we are going to charge more'. That kind of situation will not obtain. I think it is fairly important to be aware of that. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole of this Bill has implications, as I have said, for all Australians because it involves the health process working properly. It has implications for those people in our society who are unfortunate enough to be ill, particularly for those who are unfortunate enough to be chronically ill and who depend utterly on these drugs and their availability freely at the time they need them. I suggest that this also is an important aspect of the general economics of the situation. Pharmacists who are not making a profit and who have heavy overdrafts will get to the stage where they might not carry stocks of various drugs which they would otherwise carry. Their service to the community at large-an urgent and important one-might be diminished to that extent. </PARA>
<PARA> For some perverse reason, which has still not been explained to honourable senators or, I gather, to anybody else-certainly not to the Pharmacy Guild-the Government has introduced a catch-22 situation into the small print of this Bill that severely and unfairly disadvantages the pharmacists. Those words in the Bill-they are the ones the Australian Democrats want taken out and they are the subject of the amendment we are talking about-in effect prevent the Tribunal from backdating its decisions. The position is as simple as that. I understand that no other tribunals or commissions are affected by provisions such as proposed new section 98BE which places these kinds of restraints on determinations. </PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that the existing Joint Committee of Public Accounts which sets remunerations for pharmacists in this area does have authority to make its decision retrospective. Almost invariably, all the increases it has granted have been backdated. There are very good reasons for this. It is not really possible to decide what the costs of things will be until a subsequent date. Unfortunately, in the second reading debate last night the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Baume, said that there will not be any retrospectivity. The Government does not foresee any possibility of retrospectivity in this case. Senator Tate raised the question that perhaps the Tribunal had the power to make its decision retrospective anyway. We now know that that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume mentioned that medical tribunals set their levels of benefits payable without their decisions being retrospective. Of course, this is true. But the situation of the people concerned in those cases, as I mentioned a few minutes ago-it is worth stressing-is quite different from the pharmacists' situation. For example, once the appropriate tribunal has set the level of medical benefits that will be paid, doctors can and do raise their fees to cover past costs. Optometrists act in a similar fashion. This proposed new section, worst of all, ignores the fact that cost statistics can really be collated only after the event. Generally there has to be some kind of time-lag to discover actual increases in costs. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to give an example of what might happen. For instance, the Tribunal might make a determination on 1 July 1982. On 10 July there might be a large increase granted under the award for work value for pharmacists' staff. So there is a significant increase in costs for the pharmacists. At that point the pharmacists have to prepare a case for the Tribunal to open an inquiry if one is not scheduled. That takes time. Presumably the Tribunal considers this case. The Tribunal announces that it will conduct an inquiry, say, on 1 November-a not unreasonable space of time. Any resulting decision by the Tribunal cannot set a fee to recover the pharmacists' costs between 10 July and 1 November of that year. Those costs could be very great-large enough to make what were previously profitable businesses completely unprofitable. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken to chemists in my office and they have told me that their shops have become unprofitable in recent months as a result of the erosion of the value of the fees paid for these benefits. I think that is an extremely valid complaint on the part of the Pharmacy Guild. I think its case is in all ways eminently reasonable. Many pharmacists-as I have said, there are 5,000 such small businessmen in Australia-have been having a very rough time financially in recent years and especially in recent months. The Australian Democrats believe that they rightly object to this unfair provision in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I make an appeal to Liberal Party senators in particular to support this amendment simply on the grounds that it is fair and right that they should do so. It is the job of everybody elected to this place to do what is fair and right. The duty of honourable senators to the people who elected them and their duty to the community at large should go beyond any duty they have to any party structure. It is time for it to be said again and again in this country that no pressure group of any kind, be it the Liberal Party of Australia, the Australian Democrats or the Australian Labor Party, has any right to dictate to its members how they should vote on a matter of justice. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe this is a matter which should transcend politics and on which the Government should allow its senators a free vote. It should not start wielding big sticks at them over a matter which is very straightfoward and with which a number of Liberal Party senators have said they agree. We should not have the Gilbertian tragic situation that because of Government pressure on them they are to do something which is against their interests, against the pharmacists' interests and, indeed, against the interests of the community at large. I appeal to Liberal Party senators to support this amendment simply on the grounds that it is fair and right to do so. Liberals claim also to represent small business and that should be an additional reason for them to support the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically, it is fair and reasonable to remove those words and unfair and unreasonable to leave them in. All honourable senators know that full well. Why should the pharmacists have to carry a burden which they assess might be as much as $10m in a year? There is a further implication. Pharmacies are businesses. They have to make a profit of some sort or go to the wall. The higher their real costs are, the higher also must be the prices they charge the general public. That is the other implication of this rather stupid error in this legislation. I am convinced that that is what it is. It is no more than an error which has been perpetrated for some reason I cannot understand. This burden is being imposed unnecessarily on pharmacies. It will be passed on to every family in the nation. So the Government need not stand up and say that it is saving anybody any money by bringing forward this legislation because that is not the case. The burden will still be there, no matter how it is shifted around, and it will still be passed on to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat: The Government has given no reason for this legislation. I appeal to the Minister at this Committee stage of the Bill please to give the pharmacy industry, the public, the Australian Democrats and the Senate a reason for this absurd refusal to allow this amendment. I understand that the Labor Party will vote for the amendment. I hope so. The Australian Democrats, of course, certainly will, and we ask Senator Harradine, in all courtesy and respect, also to support it as he supported my second reading amendment to the same effect last night. </PARA>
<PARA> I now issue a direct challenge to Liberal senators. There are perhaps a few of them who are indeed genuinely liberals, genuine supporters of free enterprise, of private business and of small business. In that case, they will vote for this amendment and they will be respected and thanked for it. Or will they cringe away before the big stick of their master in the other place and meekly vote as the master has directed them to vote-against the amendment?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support this amendment, as I did last night, and in so doing I wish to comment on how we have arrived at this situation. We have a Bill which both sides of the chamber recognise is an urgent piece of legislation. Both sides of the chamber have co-operated in putting it through as quickly as possible. It went through the House of Representatives, with the agreement of the Opposition, in one day. It was intended yesterday that the Bill would go through this place in one day but, as Senator Mason has said, what seems to us to be a deficiency in the legislation-proposed new section 98BE-was drawn to our attention by the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. This is a provision which, in an otherwise very worthy piece of legislation, a piece of legislation to set up an independent tribunal to overcome the difficulties which have been experienced in the past in determining pharmacists' remuneration, has put a limitation on the powers of that tribunal in that the tribunal cannot give recognition to retrospective costs and cannot bring down a retrospective determination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think people on both sides of this chamber last night, when we debated this legislation for some 2 1/2 hours because of the Government's intransigence on this matter, asked the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) for an explanation as to why this particular restriction was put into proposed new section 98BE. I suggest, as did Senator Mason, that we just have not been given a satisfactory explanation for that. We have been told two things. We have been told that it was a deliberate Government decision, but we have not been told why. We have been told that another tribunal, the medical tribunal which considers medical fees, has a similar provision in its legislation. I assume that is so; I have not had time to look it up. But that is irrelevant because doctors and optometrists, unlike pharmacists, can alter their fees at will and do so, and frequently ignore the provisions of the tribunal, something which the pharmacists simply cannot do. It has been suggested that the terms of reference of the legislation are so wide that in fact the tribunal can take into account retrospective increases in costs. We know that, of necessity, the determination of costs lags behind the actual infliction of those costs. So, I assume from Senator Peter Baume's explanation last night that we have the situation whereby the tribunal builds into its decisions actual figures on past costs and, I would assume to be just, estimates of future costs. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it was Senator Watson who said that this is a terribly messy way in which to go about things. Why not do it simply? Why not do it in a more just manner by allowing the tribunal to assess past costs and to bring down a decision which will pay back the pharmacists for those cost increases in the previous 12 months or six months. Another messy alternative would be for the tribunal to meet every two months, every three months or every four months, if necessary, in times of high inflation, or of unusual increasing costs. Why do it this way? Why, in this legislation of all legislation, in the words of the Minister, deliberately put in this restriction in proposed new section 98BE? Conversely, indeed, why not accept this amendment? Why not take out this provision?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has distributed to us a further amendment. It is an amendment which clears up another question which was raised last night by honourable senators in this place and which was denied by the Minister as being a problem but which now obviously, it has been decided, is a problem. This amendment will clarify another section but it does nothing for the effect of porposed new section 98BE and it does not affect the amendment which has been moved. It seems to us and, I am sure, to many other people that what Senator Mason described as a Gilbertian situation has arisen, because of the stubborn- ness of the Government and the stubbornness of the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar), because of the Minister's refusal to admit that this restriction is unnecessary and that this restrictive proposed new section is in fact not only unnecessary but unjust. We all admit that this legislation has been unnecessarily delayed but we all admit that it is necessary for the justice of the pharmacists that it go through today or in the next couple of days. So why not accept this simple amendment which will do no more than make the work of the tribunal easy, much simpler than it is at present, and which will make things clear to the pharmacists and to everybody else in the community that in this piece of legislation justice is not only being done but is being seen to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason we will persist in our support of the amendment, an amendment which, as I said last night, was originally going to be moved from the Government side but which at the last minute was not moved from that side. It was taken up on this side of the chamber after I had led for the Opposition in the second reading debate. The whole procedure demonstrates the uncertainty of the Government, the problems it is having in the health area in general and its failure to come to grips with problems in this area. It is a small matter in the overall picture, but it is an important matter in this sort of legislation. We persist in our support for the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We debated this matter at some length last night and I do not wish to go into any detail this afternoon other than to try to identify the two ways in which to go about achieving a result which is intended to ensure that, so far as the chemists of Australia are concerned, and so far as the members of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and those other chemists who are not members of the Pharmacy Guild are concerned, they receive a reasonable opportunity for regular review of the payments which they receive from the Commonwealth in respect of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One way which might have assisted and which last night some of us were considering was the proposal which has been put forward by Senator Mason. It is not the only way. There is another way in which what many people believe is a reasonable and a reasonably clear result can be achieved. That is a package which clarifies the matters which were debated last evening and which avoids the problem of retrospectivity. It can perhaps best be described in this way: Up to the first finding and determination by the new Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal there will, pursuant to the transitional provisions set out in clause 10, sub-clause (2) of the Bill, be the opportunity for full retrospectivity to 1 May last year. So the first determination does not then raise the problem which has been a matter of debate in this chamber. It is only from the second determination onwards that there is a question about this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of honourable senators were concerned that there was potential ambiguity in the provisions of proposed new section 98BA, particularly when read in conjunction with proposed new section 98B. They were concerned about the effect of a provision which stated that inquiries should be conducted at intervals of not more than 12 months but which did not provide for determinations to be given at least every 12 months. If there is a provision which ensures that there is at least an annual determination as to whether the Commonwealth price of all or any pharmaceutical benefits should be varied, that will ensure that a period of no greater than 12 months will go by without an adjustment. There is also the need to clarify what may be taken into account by the Tribunal in determining the way in which it operates. I must say that until I had the opportunity to study the Bill in greater detail than I had studied it when we debated it last evening I was unhappy about the way in which the Tribunal was to operate under this legislation. I am only slightly less happy from a drafting point of view. I think the problem could have been got around in a better way, but I see the urgency, and I now see the practicality, of going ahead with the proposal which has been foreshadowed in the proposed amendment circulated by Senator Peter Baume. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator RAE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tate interjects: 'So did the Bill'. Perhaps that is not a universal view. The proposed amendment will ensure that it is a universal view and not a matter for debate. It was a matter for debate last evening. The third aspect is whether there can be any cost catch-up. Senator Mason in particular referred to the fact that there can be cost increases and that there may be periods in which the chemists suffer increases but do not get a determination which will cover those increases. It is my understanding from the statements which were made last night and which I understand can be reaffirmed that there is nothing in the proposed legislation which prevents the Tribunal from taking past costs into account and that a ministerial statement has made it clear that it is the Government's intention that the Tribunal will be able to take them into account in making a determination which will provide for a past costs catch-up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is further provision that the Tribunal may inquire whenever it is determined by the Chairman to be necessary. So, one imagines that it will be possible to have adjustments made from time to time throughout the year. Let us take a situation such as that which has developed in the wages scene. When a national wage case decision imposes an increase in respect of the costs to employers, the State wages boards meet immediately and pass on a similar benefit to State employees, and a whole lot of other cost fixing bodies, charges bodies, also meet to pass it on. So it automatically follows, I imagine, that there should not be any difficulty in the chairman of this Tribunal being able to ensure that, whenever that type of sudden cost increase arises, it can be passed on virtually immediately. The Bill does seem to retain the flexibility for the Tribunal to be able to meet whenever necessary. The chemists are assured that there will not be a lengthy period in which they have to carry costs. There is an assurance that past costs catch-up can be taken into account in a determination. The objectives sought by the Government in the first place, by those who spoke in the chamber last night and by the chemists of Australia, particularly members of the Pharmacy Guild, are met by what is proposed. It has the added virtue of being acceptable to the Government. It seems to me that the purposes sought can be achieved and that there is agreement by those involved. On that basis, I conclude what whilst the Pharmacy Guild, as I understand it, would have preferred its proposal it is quite prepared to accept the proposal which I have outlined and which the Government proposes to move in the form of an amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised because last night I believe several Liberal senators showed acceptance of the view that was put on this side of the chamber about the unfairness of this legislation to pharmacists and were prepared to look favourably at the logic that at that stage had not been answered by honourable senators on the Government side. As I listened to Senator Rae speaking, I thought not only of the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill, which we are now debating, but also of a far deeper question-the significance of the Senate. Does it have any significance nowadays? Do those people who spout the rhetoric that this chamber is a House of review that provides a necessary check and balance on the House of Representatives, that it is here to improve legislation, really mean what they say? Today senator after senator on the Government side of the chamber has stood up and said: 'This amendment should be carried but the Government will not accept it. Therefore we will not vote for it.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For many years the Australian Labor Party had the abolition of the Senate as part of its platform. That is no longer part of its platform. I understand that it disappeared two, three or more years ago. Why do I mention that? I mention that because every time the abolition of the Senate was mentioned at a Liberal Party conference there were cries from outraged Liberals that this would be a dreadful thing for our country, that if the Senate were abolished the little person would lose its protection against the extravagances and excesses of an autocratic Prime Minister or an all-powerful political party in the House of Representatives which had the numbers to push through legislation by sheer party discipline. The Liberals said that the Senate provided protection for the little person. This Bill happens to be about the little person in the sense that pharmacists are small business people. They are a classic description of a small business person whose cause, I would have thought, the Liberal Party espouses and champions. It is rather strange that we now have the Liberal Party, jacked up by the discipline of the party room, voting against an amendment for the only reason that the Government will not accept the amendment. </PARA>

We are not talking about some rich, powerful lobby group, such as the doctors, who can and do unscrupulously raise fees, rip-off people and charge whatever fees they want. We are talking about a group of professional people whom I admire for undertaking such lengthy studies, at great sacrifice, to achieve professionalism in their field. They have to surmount numerous hurdles to become qualified in their profession. They have to have guts and courage to set themselves up in business, at massive capital outlay, only to find that a great percentage of their income is determined by politicians-by honourable senators and by members of the House of Representatives-who vote on Bills such as the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill that we are debating at the moment. A large part of their income is in our hands. They operate small businesses-the name that almost every politician, no matter what party he belongs to, grabs at every opportunity on the hustings and at every election campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is the Senate, by the sheer weight of party numbers, going to do to these 5,000 small business people throughout Australia who fill 100 million prescriptions per year? This legislation seeks to establish a tribunal to fix the price for prescribing medicines. I commend the Government for its wisdom in introducing this legislation. Every speaker on this side of the chamber has similarly commended the Government for that. It is a good move. The Government ought to be congratulated, and I congratulate it. But what are we doing? Because of some drafting error in the legislation-there is a drafting error; that is the only conceivable reason for this provision being there-we have the Government instructing the proposed Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration that whenever it sits and receives evidence after its first determination it must not back date any price increase that it determines. In other words, the Tribunal may find that there have been cost increases because of circumstances outside the control of a pharmacist-namely, a massive increase in the salary or wage of his assistant or some other increase in costs, such as increased rent costs, workers' compensation costs, or whatever, but all the Tribunal can say is: 'Although you have been losing money for the last five years, the Government has said that because of an amendment to section 98BE of the legislation we are not allowed to back date any price increases'. </PARA>
<PARA> All that the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party are trying to do is to give the Tribunal such flexibility that if it believes that an increase should be back dated a month, five weeks, or whatever, it should be able to do that. That is all that this debate is about. We debated this matter for two hours last night, we have debated it for an hour today and we will probably bebate it for another hour, and that is all that the debate is about. Not one honourable senator opposite, including the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume), has given us one good reason why this amendment should not be accepted by the Government. Senator Rae said-I quote him almost verbatim-that there is nothing in the legislation to prevent the Tribunal from taking past costs into account. I agree with that, but he is making sure that there is nothing in the legislation to give the Tribunal power to back date increases. In other words, Senator Rae concedes the merit of the point that is being put on this side of the chamber but will not agree to a simple amendment about a simple omission of words which will ensure the pharmacists' position. </PARA>
<PARA> An amendment to proposed section 98BA has been circulated by the Minister. In answer to my interjection, Senator Rae said that this amendment will fix it, that it will be satisfactory to the pharmacists. I tell him now that it is not satisfactory to the pharmacists. The amendment which will be moved by the Minister states:</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Tribunal shall ensure that its findings resulting from its second or any subsequent inquiry, and the reasons for them, are issued not later than 12 months after the date on which the Tribunal issued its findings resulting from its first inquiry or from the last inquiry held by it, as the case may be. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask Senator Rae, Senator Jessop or whoever follows me to correct me if I am wrong in what I am about to say about my assessment of what that amendment means. My understanding of that amendment is that the Tribunal cannot go farther back than 12 months from the date of the last determination before it issues a new determination. My understanding is that it could go back 11 months and 29 days and then make a determination and fulfil the requirements of the legislation. During that 11 months and 29 days every pharmacist in the country could be losing his or her shirt because of price increases that the Tribunal cannot back date. If I am incorrect in my assumption and my interpretation of that amendment, I plead with Senator Watson or whoever follows me to tell me that that is not true. </PARA>

If the intention of Senator Baume, Senator Rae and Senator Watson is as they have interjected, then it is perfectly sound. Their intentions are totally in line with those of honourable senators on this side of the chamber. I concede that their goodwill is present. The way in which the Government's amendment is designed, will not achieve what we both want. Is it through pig headedness or through a long established practice-a sickening practice in Canberra-that governments never accept amendments moved by Oppositions because it is a face-losing exercise? That seems the only conceivable reason why there is opposition to this amendment.

He might say that the Government will encourage the Tribunal to take into account past cost check-up or future price rises. But Senator Baume well knows-I am surprised that Senator Rae does not know-that a legally constituted tribunal, under an Act of Parliament, need not be influenced by what a Minister says in a second reading speech in this chamber. For that reason I am again amazed at the intractability of the Government on this question. I can only conclude that Senator Cavanagh had the answer last night. He said that it does not matter whether the matter was discussed in the party room, it does not matter whether this Senate debates any issue until it is blue in the face, it does not matter whether the Senate, with the combined wisdom of honourable senators from all sides of the chamber, makes a sensible and helpful amendment to legislation, the Government will not accept that amendment because the mechanisms of the system do not allow it. The Minister in this place will not, or cannot, go back to the Minister in the other place who is involved. That Minister would not make a decision by himself. He would have to take it back to Cabinet and that is just too much trouble. I end this contribution as I began it: What the hell is the use of the Senate? Why do we come here and look at legislation? Why do we try to amend legislation to make life better for 14 million Australians? What we put up is unanswerable, in logic, by the Government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee is debating whether payments which are to be determined by the Tribunal which is to be set up, can be backdated. Honourable senators should forget the first determination because that is a special case. Following last night's extensive debate and the adjournment debate which we supported, we obviously went back and examined a number of matters which were raised. The amendments which I will move later, and to which reference has been made, are the results of discussions which took place between a number of honourable senators regarding one of the points about which they were uncertain. These amendments are germane because they are to reassure certain honourable senators that determinations will, in fact, come down no less frequently than 12 months. There was a concern that, as the clause was written, the determinations might be delayed longer. Last night my advice and my belief was that as the clause is presently written, it will result in a determination each 12 months. The purpose of this later amendment is to put that beyond any doubt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question that is being debated now is whether payments should be retrospective. Let us not lose sight of the fact that this is legislation to establish a tribunal which has not existed before. It is to replace a mechanism which has been gravely deficient in terms of equity and efficiency to pharmacists. In the mechanism which has existed up until now retrospective payments have been necessary because the determinations have been delayed so long. Under the new Tribunal the determinations will not be delayed. Determinations must occur at least every 12 months. Pharmacists in Australia will be better off than they have ever been. This will be an independent tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important fact is that the Tribunal's determinations will be binding upon government and pharmacists. These are all tremendous gains for pharmacists. They have been welcomed by the pharmacists and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. Let us not forget these things just as we should not forget the fact that the Tribunal, in making its determination, can take into account-I think Senator Rae drew attention to some of the ways it can proceed-a whole range of cost movements that have occurred since the last determination. It is the regularity of the determinations to be made which builds a degree of equity into the system and that regularity has been lacking up until now. It is that lack of regularity which has been the main source of complaint for pharmacists with whom I have spoken over the years. I observe once again that no other group in the community, with the same kind of fee structures-whether it is optometrists or doctors-has retrospectivity built into the determinations of the fees received from this kind of tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has carefully considered the words which are proposed to be removed by Senator Mason's amendment. The words in the proposed amendment have been put there deliberately and the Government believes that they are in keeping with the principles that it has applied to other groups which receive determinations from a tribunal of this kind. We believe that the gains to pharmacists are very great and that this is a minor point. I urge honourable senators to go back to what Senator Rae said when he tried to set down some of the ways in which the Tribunal will move to make its determinations. </PARA>

We on the Opposition side want to know whether under the legislation it is lawful for the Tribunal to do so.

In other words, it will be lawful for and within the power of the Tribunal to determine that 2c perhaps should be added to fees payable to chemists in the future, given increases in the preceding year in the cost of dispensing prescriptions and the handling of pharmaceutical benefit prescriptions on behalf of the community. In that case why cannot the Government accept the amendment that has been put from this side of the chamber which, if accepted, would allow the Tribunal to add 2c to the fees payable to chemists in respect of prescriptions that are dispensed in the preceding period?</PARA></TALK.START>

Of course, some accounting and actuarial principles would have to be taken into account. Why should not power be given to the Tribunal to make an addition to the fees already paid in respect of the preceding period as has been requested by the chemists? If it is in fact the case that it is lawful and proper for the Tribunal to take into account past increases when determining fees to be paid to chemists in the period following the determination, I do not see why it cannot make a determination on additional payments in respect of fees paid under the old determination. Why is it that the Government cannot accept that proposition?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to go over the ground which was traversed in the speeches that were made last night. I would just like to suggest to the Australian Democrats that in my view they have been posturing on this matter by challenging honourable senators on this side of the chamber in order to curry favour with pharmacists and to big note themselves by claiming to be the defenders of small business. I remind honourable senators that if it had not been for the Liberal Party senators, this legislation would have been passed last night without amendment and the pharmacists would have had to suffer any odium that may be attached to it. I suggest that because of the willingness of the advocates on this side of the chamber who support the pharmacists, we have been able to achieve results that have been very effective. I personally negotiated with Ministers on the matter of the amendment to proposed new section 98BE. I have been told that the Government is quite determined to reject that amendment. This would mean that if we voted for the Opposition amendment, which we possibly could do, the legislation would be sent back to the House of Representatives where it would be rejected and the pharmacists would be back to square one and, as a result, be disadvantaged. So I suggest to the Australian Democrats that they ought to pay some tribute to those honourable senators on this side of the chamber who have intervened in this matter and achieved a result that I believe is far better than what was in the original legislation and certainly opens up possibilities for the pharmacists in future which were never available to them in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the pharmacists find three months after a determination has been made that cost pressures are such that they are disadvantaged, it is up to them to go to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal to plead their case in order to persuade the Tribunal that a reconsideration of the determination is justified. If, having repeatedly taken that action and the Tribunal rejects the submissions, they then have recourse to the Minister. They can ask him to consider their case and require the Tribunal to give their case further consideration. I think we have achieved much this afternoon. As the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) has said, there is flexibility in this matter. The Tribunal may examine past cost increases and take them into consideration. The Minister indicated that last night and reiterated it today. The Tribunal must have regard to a possible increase in costs that can be foreshadowed by the pharmacists in their representations to the Tribunal, and there are many. Many unforeseen matters could arise. For example, there could be increases in award wages for pharmacy staff, increases in rent, changes in interest rates on money borrowed, changes in the terms of wholesalers discounts to chemists, State indirect taxes, motor vehicle registration charges, insurance costs and all those sorts of things which can be anticipated and taken into account. I think it is up to the pharmacists to point out those matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I am anxious to draw the Minister's attention to the need to keep this legislation under review. It may well be that some weaknesses will show up as a result of experience. I suggest that if a situation arises whereby the Tribunal for one reason or other may take three or four months to arrive at a determination-I do not think that ought to be tolerated in any case-a retrospective requirement should be laid down. I am just foreshadowing problems that may arise. I think the Government should have a look at that suggestion. I think I have covered all that I want to say at this stage. But I remind Senator Chipp and his Australian Democrat colleague that if it had not been for the efforts of honourable senators on this side of the chamber the legislation would have been passed last night without amendment. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="757">Senator CAVANAGH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. Despite all the assurances of the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) and of Senator Rae that this is a better package, there is no concern by the Minister whether there is justice. Senator Jessop says that he argued there was not. There is an attitude of take this or take nothing or take something less. Here is the honest man who, in his simplicity, disclosed the whole position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the matter. I have sympathy for Senator Rae because I think he had the hardest brief of his career today to sell this proposal to us. He could not sell such an argument to a learned judge but he hopes that he can get away with it in this Committee. Everyone admits that there is justification for any increase in costs to be passed onto consumers. Everyone agrees with that argument. Everyone agree that, in the case of such an increase, chemists will not get paid the equivalent of that increase until the Tribunal has made a determination. The honourable senator argues that the Tribunal may make determinations as frequently as it likes and that there will not be a long delay. But it might be slow in acting. If it appears that there is disadvantage it can make an allowance for cost trends. We had a system to allow for trends in wage rates one year and it was found too cumbersome. Increased costs can be taken into consideration in fixing the future price of the service of the pharmacist. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone forgets the plea which Senator Chipp made about the thousands of small pharmacists who are struggling to exist. They are waiting for the determination which will give them justice but are going broke in the meantime. Therefore, the increase is paid as a result of the consideration of future trends to a group which suffered no loss. But those who have gone broke as a result of the inability to grant retrospectivity will not benefit from the future price increase. Obviously, the only way to deal with the question is to consider applying increases retrospectively from the occasion when the costs went up. The Tribunal, in its wisdom, makes a decision and says: 'Yes, the cost of drugs or labour increased two months ago'. If we believe that chemists are entitled to payment for their services they should be paid and not have to finance a scheme because the Tribunal has not met. The Tribunal, in making its decision, says: 'We agree to an increase in the costs because something which happened in March of this year justifies an increase in chemist fees.' Therefore it can apply the increase as from the date from which the increase is justified. I still have to be convinced how the circulated amendment will make any difference to the provisions of the present Bill. It definitely does not cover the problem of the chemist who is working at a loss and who may achieve an increase in profit as a result of the determination handed down by the Tribunal when it finally meets. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the benefit of those who are trying to determine the theme of the debate tonight, the Committee is discussing cognately two Bills, namely, the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill and the Repatriation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill. Before the adjournment of this chamber last night, the Government decided that it would accept a motion by Senator Chipp to report progress. Honourable senators may recall that there was a great deal of agonising, last night, in regard to certain provisions of the Bill. I take this opportunity to thank the Government, and in particular Senator Peter Baume who had the arduous task of trying to get this Bill through this chamber fairly quickly. I also take the opportunity to thank the Minister for Health, Mr MacKellar. The reporting of progress last night enabled us to go to the Minister and to look at some alternative ways of overcoming some of the deep-seated problems which some of us on this side of the chamber had.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must disagree with the speeches of one or two Opposition senators who felt that this chamber had been used as a rubber stamp. I believe that last night the true worth of the chamber was demonstrated. People, such as Senator Rae and my colleague from South Australia, Senator Jessop, were prepared to put their heads on the chopping block. They were prepared to stick with us in very difficult circumstances. I contend that we were able to convince the Government and our colleagues of a degree of justice in the representations put forward in this chamber not only by members on this side but by members of the Australian Democrats and by members of the Australian Labor Party. Basically, those who spoke last night generally spoke on the same theme. Now we have been able to come up with some suitable amendments which will be moved by Senator Peter Baume. I believe that these amendments overcome some of the major difficulties which were really worrying us last night and which I believe would have caused some deep concern to the members of the pharmaceutical profession. We have overcome these problems, I believe. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators may ask why I am reluctant to support the amendment proposed by Senator Mason. I believe that it lacked a degree of practicality. I can see that Senator Peter Baume's proposals are a far better way of overcoming the problem. Honourable senators who listened to the whole debate last night may recall that one of the major problems which worried us about proposed section 98BA was the holding of an inquiry every 12 months. As we pointed out, an inquiry could be held every 12 months but its determination might be delayed a further six months or 12 months. The history of making quick determintions has not been good. This amendment ensures that the determinations are made every 12 months--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Rae" NAMEID="0P7">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator Rae</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the most.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I thank Senator Rae. That is the maximum. This was one of our problems. We wanted to bring back this maximum period but at the same time ensure that at the discretion of the chairman frequent inquiries may be held, depending on cost movements such as wages and rents or the intervention of State governments by putting certain charges on pharmaceutical products. There is flexibility and, as a result of this amendment, there is now a means of ensuring justice for chemists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I again commend the Government for acknowledging the importance of the deliberations which take place in this chamber. To achieve the degree of justice which was recognised by the majority of people here this legislation is to be amended. This will require the legislation to go back to the House of Representatives for the amendments to be approved. Basically what has been achieved, I think, has been done expeditiously and this indicates that amendments can be accepted in this place and that that action does not unduly hold up a legislative program. I believe that, provided we carry on in the spirit in which the debate which took place last night was conducted we can do much in this chamber to improve the legislative performance of government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to point out that when I opened the debate on the second reading of the Bills last night I did so in the certain knowledge that one of the honourable senators who this afternoon has been pontificating about the attitude of people on this side of the chamber intended to move the very amendment that Senator Mason has moved. He did not do so, but he had told not only me but also the representatives of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia that he intended to do so. It ill becomes that honourable senator to pontificate in speeches and interjections about how his side has achieved the merits of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are dealing with two factors this afternoon. The first is the amendment moved by Senator Mason and the second is the amendment of Senator Baume. Senator Baume has already told us that all his amendment will do is clarify the intent of proposed new section 98BA of the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill-something which people on this side did not really think needed clarification. The amendment moved by Senator Mason relates to how the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal will proceed. All we are saying is that this independent tribunal should be allowed to look at the cost increases of pharmacies and, if necessary, make a retrospective determination as can the arbitration tribunals. A special case exists for the pharmacists; they cannot vary their fees in the way that doctors and optometrists can. We believe that this amendment-I do not think there has been any denial of what I am about to say from anyone on the other side-will provide that the Tribunal can sit every six months, or every year if necessary-but probably every six months-and make retrospective adjustments simply and on the demonstrated facts. </PARA>
<PARA> An alternative proposal was put to us by Senator Rae. Senator Rae is usually very concise in his speeches but he took about ten minutes to explain his alternative proposal which shows how difficult it is. The alternative will be that the Tribunal will take into consideration retrospective cost increases. We presume it will take into consideration prospective cost increases and come to some formula on future payments through that complicated mechanism to recompense the pharmacists. I suggest the difference between the two porposals is that one is a simple method, a method which learned members of the Tribunal will be able to apply twice a year or three times a year if necessary, and the other is a complicated method which will involve the Tribunal making all sorts of calculations which one can bet will cause disputation. I believe Senator Jessop has anticipated quite correctly that disputations will occur and the Government will have to look again at this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment moved by Senator Mason really has nothing to do with the amendment of Senator Baume. We will not oppose it because it clarifies the situation. All we are asking is that this independent tribunal, this tribunal of independent and learned people, should have its job made easier. The legislation may even cut the costs of the Tribunal because, with respect, I believe it may not have to sit so often if it can make retrospective judgments. It is a matter of a simple method and a complicated method. I believe the only reason that the Government can refuse the amendment, which originally was to be moved by one of its members who for his own reasons backed out, is pride, stubbornness or some other aspect of government which we see so often. For that reason I persist in support of my amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I consider it a great privilege and responsibility to have been elected to the Senate of Australia. I wish to place on record my sincere thanks and appreciation to the people of Queensland for their confidence, expressed in me at the ballot box; to the National Party for selecting me as one of its candidates; to all who worked for me; and to the members of my family for their encouragement and support. I would also like to express my appreciation to you, Mr President, and to honourable senators for the kindness and courtesy shown to me as a new member of this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this my maiden speech there are a number of matters that I would like to put on record or correct. They concern my election as a senator and events in the Queensland Parliament which resulted in my coming to the Senate early. Firstly, it must be stressed that I stood for selection in the normal way. Like the other candidates, I had to face the National Party's governing body and put before it my arguments for selection as a Senate candidate. I must say here that but for a decision by the Liberal Party State Executive in Queensland to have a separate Senate ticket, the question of my being here might never have arisen at all. The National Party, by secret ballot, chose Senator Maunsell, Senator Sheil and me as its candidates for last year's Senate election. By another secret ballot at a State conference later, the party decided that I should head its Senate ticket. At the subsequent election, I topped the poll on the Government side and the National Party outpolled the Liberal Party. The National Party received 26.8 per cent of the overall vote, compared with 23 per cent for the Liberal Party. It is a matter for the public record also that, but for a leakage of 20.5 per cent of Liberal preferences, Senator Sheil would have been returned to the Senate. It should perhaps be stressed that the National Party certainly is not responsible for the Government losing control of the Senate after July. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been widespread comment, not all of it well informed or objective, on the background of my early entry into the Senate following the resignation of Senator Sheil to contest the 21 February by-election for the division of McPherson. The Queensland Government, as it is required to do constitutionally, had the task of choosing someone to fill the casual vacancy caused by Senator Sheil's resignation. It decided that I should enter the Senate at this time. The media soon carried reports about a superannuation windfall which I was supposed to gain because of the Queensland Parliament's decision. What people sometimes fail to recognise is that six years is a long time, especially when you are not really too young. I guess I have always adopted the attitude that God gives us one day at a time, and who knows what may happen. One has only to think of the death of Senator Knight. I am not alone in this position as far as the superannuation aspect is concerned, even in the Senate now, let alone after 1 July. Honourable senators will all know that I was not a member of this House when the relevant legislation on superannuation entitlements was conceived, considered and passed. Those provisions have been public knowledge since April 1980 when the legislation was passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate. However, the provisions were not discovered by the media until after the Queensland Parliament's decision, on 12 March, that I would fill the casual Senate vacancy. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to point out that some of my most vocal critics in this matter, including at least one Opposition member of the Senate from Queensland, have been strangely quite since Easter, when the new media discoveries in relation to superannuation entitlements were reported. I can assure the Senate and the people of Queensland whom I represent here that when I stood for selection I had not even inquired what a senator's salary was, let alone what were the superannuation entitlements. That was not the purpose of my standing. I would like to think that every honourable senator is interested in what he or she can do for our country rather than in what it can do for him or her. That is my attitude. I am in the unusual position of having been elected by the people of Queensland to take my place in this House from July next, and to have been selected unanimously by the Parliament of Queensland, comprising National, Liberal and Labor Party members, to replace former Senator Glen Sheil. No one can say in honesty that either process was not properly conducted. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I want to pay tribute to the work done for the people of Queensland by former Senator Glen Sheil. During his service to the Senate he was a hard-working senator who travelled Queensland widely and often and was interested in all the people and their problems. One problem that he was very concerned about and worked on was the matter of individual pensioners being allowed to earn $50 a week without either their pensions or their fringe benefits being affected. Let me say that I will be continuing Dr Sheil's strong advocacy in this regard. I do hope that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), whom I am glad to see sitting in the Senate chamber tonight, will be able to make provision for such a change when the Budget is brought down later this year. I have a wonderful opportunity tonight to tell him about that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The State that I have the privilege to represent is very decentralised and diversified. It stretches some 2,400 kilometres from Brisbane to the islands of the Torres Strait beyond Cape York. The wealth that Queensland's development and productivity represents today is the envy of many States and of many people overseas. From the far-flung north to the northern, central and western inland, right down the coastal regions, Queenslanders and Queensland's projects in regard to cattle, grain, sugar, minerals, tourism and many other industries are contributing enormously to the welfare of the nation. The State is experiencing an unprecedented resource development boom, one which will be vitally important in meeting Australia's and the world's energy needs in the years ahead. I was interested to read in the Australian a couple of days ago, in regard to the resources boom, that the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors had predicted that the biggest expansion in the construction industry would occur in Queensland, which has the lion's share of the nation's planned projects. Projects worth $16,000m will begin in Queensland before 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> Geographically we may be an island, but we cannot isolate ourselves from the rest of the world and from the world energy scene in terms of harnessing and applying, for the general good, the abundant resources which God has given us. Our coal is no good to anyone if it is in the ground. It becomes of value to society only when it is mined or otherwise extracted and used, as do our uranium, our oil and gas, our oil shales and so on. I do not think anyone would seriously suggest that there should be a development at all costs approach, either in resource developments or anything else. But governments owe it to society to ensure that developments which are in the public interest are not stopped, slowed down, prevented or costed out of the range of people they could benefit by unrealistic government attitudes, regulations, restrictions or controls on foreign involvement or investment and actual development, export and conservation practices. </PARA>
<PARA> In the primary industry field it is generally acknowledged that Australia could immeasurably improve its productivity and its economic performance and safeguard itself against the vagaries of the seasons by stepping up considerably its commitment to water resource development. This should be part of the Government's overall view and policy on energy and resource development. I think we need only look at the tremendous drought in part of the south-west of Queensland-I heard today about the tremendous drought in parts of western New South Wales-to realise just how important this matter of water conservation really is. The Burdekin Dam scheme in north Queensland, some 40 years on the drawing board, is at last becoming a reality and will have tremendous long term benefits for the primary industries and the people relying on those industries in that part of our State. The scheme, when fully functional, will in fact transform the primary industry picture over a large area of the north. The people of Israel and California have shown the world that one can grow almost anything almost anywhere provided one has the water and applies it properly. In Queensland we certainly have the water-at least in a good season-which could be harnessed and applied more effectively if we as a federal government were committed more tangibly to confronting and beating the problems of drought, flood and rural productivity. In the research area there is concern about natural water storage levels in parts of central and south-western Queensland, but more extensive research is required to provide all the answers that are needed. </PARA>
<PARA> Tourism in Queensland, as in many other parts of Australia, is on the crest of a wave. In fact our tourist Minister said over the weekend that tourism in Queensland could produce more than 50,000 jobs by 1985. He said that eventually it would become the number one industry in Queensland. I think he has a long way to go but, never mind, it sounds as though the Queensland tourist industry really is booming. The Tourist and Travel Corporation, headed by Mr Frank Moore, is promoting Queensland tourism around the world as never before. The Government's decision to allow a direct approach to Townsville by Qantas Airways Ltd is very welcome but there is a real demand for more airlines to be allowed to bring tourists from around the world directly into our State. From Kagoshima, Japan, direct to Townsville is only seven hours flying. This route could bring hundreds of thousands of people to Queensland to spend their money and to see the wonders of our tourist areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Sixteen hundred kilometres to the west is Birdsville-and one is still in Queensland. Birdsville's greatest population influx comes each year with its race day for the Flying Doctor Service. What would the far flung parts of all Australia do without that wonderful service, initiated in Queensland as the brainchild of the late Dr John Flynn aided by Alfred Traeger and the pedal wireless system? In the far south-west of Queensland there are many cattle and sheep properties whose main enemy is drought. The Federal Government should recognise their plight by giving them taxation exemptions for a number of years when they commence to produce again after a good season. I am afraid out there they have not too much hope of water conservation. The present income averaging provisions simply do not meet the needs of the inland. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite those problems everything adds up to a great State that we know as Queensland, a State that provides more than one quarter of the nation's export earning wealth from only 15 per cent of the population. I point out that that money goes to the benefit of the whole of Australia. Queenslanders see little of it. On top of that, Queenslanders have to pay tariffs on a wide range of goods to prop up industries based in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. It is very disappointing to know that Queensland will be $130m poorer in real revenues from the Commonwealth after the Premiers Conference held here this week. The injustice is that Queenslanders are still paying taxes for those services, which taxes the Federal Government is going to keep while demanding that the States impose their own taxes. I would like to know just by how much the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is going to reduce the tax burden on the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year's figures showed that more than 50,000 new settlers came to Queensland to live and work and many of those came from southern States and from New Zealand. They came because of greater opportunities and no doubt also because of good coalition government. Queensland has more towns with more than 30,000 people than any other State. It is growing so rapidly. In fact Queenland's population is increasing at a rate of 2.29 per cent a year compared with an average of 1.34 per cent for Australia as a whole. It is a State which I love and whose people I know so well. Over the past 10 or 11 years I have travelled from north to south and east to west meeting the people and talking with them. As a senator it is my intention to continue doing that in the years that I am privileged to be one of Queensland's representatives in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one matter I would like to speak about which I feel should be of concern to all Australians; that is, the need for adequate defence and adequate expenditure on defence. We need to be able to defend Australia. We have a very long coastline and a very big country. When we consider all the Russian ships in the Indian Ocean and Russia's aggressive attitude around the world-I think of Poland and Afghanistan, to name just two places at present-we are only deluding ourselves if we declare the Indian Ocean an area of peace. The only thing that Russia respects is strength. As far as American bases in Australia are concerned, I support our Government's policy of working with America in the defence systems that that country has in Australia. I feel that the Australian Labor Party stands condemned for its attitude in this regard, particularly for the recent performances of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hayden. I remind Mr Hayden that the people of Australia fortunately have not elected him and his party to govern and to make those decisions of which he is now so critical or vocal. That power rests with Mr Fraser and this Government, of which I am happy to be a part. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of social welfare, now a budgetary monster, let us not forget that it was a previous Labor government which created the monster and let it loose and we, as a government, now still face the problem of achieving the services we need and can afford rather than those that are demanded. I have long advocated that people ought to do the equivalent of the so-called dole payment in work. This work could be done either for local authorities or for private enterprise where the full basic wage would be provided. If the Government would agree to do it on this basis for, say, six months, many of the people now on the dole could become absorbed into the work force. I believe the great majority of people would like to work and play a useful role in the community. Unfortunately the International Labour Organisation says that we cannot direct people where they have to work. </PARA>
<PARA> Road funding is a vexed question which I know worries many motorists and authorities in all States. Last year Queensland motorists paid the Commonwealth Government $667m in fuel taxes, yet Canberra returned only $117.5m in road funding to Queensland. Senator Carrick, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, told me in a reply to a question that all taxes go into a common pool. I do not feel that that is justice when one considers that Queensland-just listen to this-has an area larger than Great Britain, France, East and West Germany and Italy combined. I would like to remind my Victorian senator friends that Victoria will fit into Queensland seven times. The Queensland road network covers 192,000 kilometres, including 42,000 kilometres of declared roads which are the direct responsibility of the Main Roads Department. No wonder the Queensland Government and the Minister in Queensland are continually registering complaints about the Federal Government's refusal to recognise this fact. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to raise the issue of family life in Australia. Despite claims to the contrary, the family still remains the best way of caring for Australia's children and guiding them to adulthood. I was very interested to listen to Senator John Martyr make his maiden speech last week-it was a very good speech-and to include in it reference to the value of life, born and unborn. I feel that in some sections of society babies are becoming an endangered species. We talk about saving the whale and saving the seal. I have gone down the corridors of this building and seen signs about these matters on some of the members' office doors. We talk about saving the kangaroo and saving the elephant, but alas, not the babies to help our population growth. It seems to me that we, as a government, are making it more difficult, not easier, for families. </PARA>
<PARA> All parties acknowledge that the single income family is being hit hardest by rising living costs and higher taxation. We need positive measures to help families and we need them now. The system of family allowances introduced by this Government goes part of the way. However, I point out that these allowances have not been updated since 1976 and their value has been eroded. However, I believe that the simplest and most efficient way to help single income families is through a system of income splitting for taxation purposes, with the husband and wife dividing their income and paying tax accordingly. It is becoming increasingly difficult for single--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ND4">Senator BJELKE-PETERSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to flat rate tax afterwards. It is becoming increasingly difficult for single income families to meet education, health, housing, transport, clothing and other costs of the family to keep the family together. The cost of maintaining an average wife-notice I say 'average wife'-including housing, clothing, food, electricity and medical expenses, et cetera, would have to be in excess of $2,500 a year. Children vary in age and numbers within the family and the cost for them could range between $1,000 and $2,000 a year. Costs for a working husband would average $3,000 a year. What is left over is disposable income or, in crude terms, excess income and therefore it should be taxed accordingly, probably on a rate in excess of that which now applies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the moment, the money used to care for the necessities of life is taxed and, regrettably, even more severely in the case of families. It seems a poor society that will allow deductions for a businessman's car but will not allow them for the country's young. If correct tax deductions are applied, the family will no longer be at such a great disadvantage and the family unit will actually be encouraged. However, at the moment, under the existing tax scales, the single person has a far greater disposable income than that of the family unit. However, income splitting offers the prospect of providing some meaningful relief for single income families. It is an option that I feel the Government should look at. </PARA>
<PARA> During the Senate election I campaigned on the platform of flat rate tax. I intend to continue that campaign. I will tell honourable senators a bit more about that. It is a fact that the present system of progressive income tax penalises Australia's productive people. It is a disincentive to work, to save and to enterprise and eventually it will destroy the nation. Alternatively, it will turn it into a socialist nation, destroying private enterprise. Every Federal government since that of Sir Robert Menzies has promised tax reform and done little about real reform. The vast majority of Australians are in what might be termed the middle class and they are paying for the majority of the services. They are getting disillusioned with the fact that the Government will not recognise that they are being overtaxed. They want less tax, less regulation and less government. </PARA>
<PARA> Successive Federal treasuries, of course, have a nice little thing going in their favour because inflation silently keeps pushing more and more people into higher and higher tax brackets. This has meant more and more taxation revenue. To the sceptics who have criticised me and the National Party over flat rate tax, I say that there is nothing mysterious or even radical about flat rate taxation. In Australia every tax levied by the Federal Government is a flat tax, except personal income tax. Yet the idea of flat rate personal income tax has brought cries of alarm from a curious coalition of opponents. The socialists, of course, are horrified that government income will be reduced. I can understand their reaction because they make no secret of their expansionist policies and plans. But on this side of the political fence, the opposition is more puzzling. Big government and big taxes do not go with free enterprise. We constantly hear about encouraging investment in Australia, giving the small shareholder a go, boosting consumer spending and spurring on the building industry. Yet we, as a government, seem to make sure that the average Australian does not have too much left to do all these desirable things. </PARA>
<PARA> If we had flat rate personal income taxation, what would Australians do with their tax savings-bury them in their back yards? Of course not. They would put them into the bank. They would buy those things they need or they would invest the savings in the resources boom they have heard so much about. One can argue about the size of the flat tax rate, but there is no doubt in my mind that it is a far better scheme than the present tax system, with the proviso that pensioners and other people living on small fixed incomes, such as superannuation, are protected. Flat rate personal income tax would not necessarily reduce the income of the Federal Government in the long term. In fact, the income would build up because of greater growth in productivity, employment and the economy. It would give people greater personal freedom in the spending of their incomes. My plea is that we reduce the number of tax scales from seven to three. Let us hasten up the process and get down to a single, flat rate tax scale quickly to restore incentive to the wage-earning and taxation processes. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone who supports our free enterprise society would agree that we need meaningful tax reform now and a flat rate tax is the concept which an increasing number of leading economists in Australia are coming to accept and support. Even Milton Friedman agreed that it was a worthwhile suggestion. I remember when it was said that death duties could not be eliminated until Queensland did it and showed how it could be done. The net result has been an increase in income for the Government in my State and increased employment and prosperity for Queensland. There are also arguments against tax cuts, but I remind the Senate that President Reagan has firm plans to do just this. With the greatest deficit of all time and high inflation and unemployment rates, President Reagan still believes and knows that the solution lies in lower taxes to give greater incentive to the people. He has to convince Congress of that just as our party has to convince the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> If anybody cares to read the history of the great Ford motor organisation during the great Depression years, he will find that the original Mr Ford reduced the price of his cars to the point where he received only 13/6d profit per car. As a consequence, he gained enormously. He not only kept his company viable but built it up as well. Other car manufacturers of that time did the opposite. They increased the prices of their cars. As a result they sold fewer cars, reduced profits and added to unemployment. I believe that we need not just a reshaping of the tax system but a new tax system. This should be followed by a constitutional referendum giving a fixed percentage of revenue to each level of government as a right, not as a matter of bartering to agree on a percentage. All three levels of government could plan with confidence and know that they must live within their percentage allocations. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I say that I am glad to be a member of this Senate. I regard myself as an Australian from Queensland. It is my intention to represent my State, as I believe it is the intention of all honourable senators to represent their States, but also to play my part for our nation. The motto on our national Coat of Arms is 'Advance Australia'. That, too, is my aim. </PARA>

<PARA> I present Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1980-81 in which appropriations totalling $88.3m, additional to those made by Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1980-81, are sought for capital works and services, payments to or for the States and other services. The proposed appropriations are needed to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures for which provision was not made in Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> I now mention some of the major items in respect of which Additional Appropriations are sought in the Bill. An amount of $3m is required under the Department of the Capital Territory for the purchase of improvements on two leases surrendered to it during 1980-81-the Deakin Health Spa and Young Men's Christian Association Hostel at Bruce, Australian Capital Territory. An amount of $4m is sought under the Department of the Capital Territory to cover labour and material costs increases on works being undertaken by the National Capital Development Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Under Department of Finance $53.8m is required for natural disaster relief and restoration mainly as a result of deteriorating drought conditions in New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania. There is a requirement under Department of Social Security of $2.5m mainly to cover increased costs and revised funding arrangements for certain services under the Children's Services Program. </PARA>
<PARA> An amount of $2.4m is required for the Department of the Treasury, principally resulting from the transfer of certain Aboriginal programs to the Northern Territory. A further $3.2m is sought for that Department in relation to increased debt charges assistance to the Northern Territory. This will be fully offset by an increase in debt charges payments by the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Other additional appropriations of significance include: $1m for the Department of Home Affairs and Environment for a new program of construction of international standard sports facilities with the States, on a dollar for dollar matching basis; $1.5m under the Department of Housing and Construction, for payment to Queensland to assist in re-housing of Cribb Island residents affected by extension of the Brisbane Airport, and $1m for the Department of Industry and Commerce for machinery and plant required to accelerate modernisation of the Government factories.

<PARA>Mr President, I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to enable the Government to implement important elements of a new policy for industrial research and development grants. It will also allow another five-year program for industrial research and development incentives. The Bill is part of the Government's response to the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia announced in the House on 18 September 1980. Our general objective is to make the Australian manufacturing sector more export oriented and more competitive against imports. A major factor in achieving this objective will be the success of the Government's general economic policy. As well, the Government's general industry policy approach has two broad strands: Firstly, to give encouragement to activities which are efficient, internationally competitive and export oriented via such measures as export, innovation and investment incentives, and secondly, to achieve, in the long-term, an industry structure requiring minimum levels of government support. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing Act, which expires on 30 June this year, was introduced in 1976 and provides for funding commencement and project grants as well as projects of industrial research considered to be in the public interest. This Government believes it is vital to encourage industrial research and development. Funding has risen from $14m in 1977-78 to $54m in 1980-81-nearly a four-fold rise within three years, despite the need for continuing expenditure restraints. Under the new program, commencement and project grants and public interest projects are to continue for a further five years. However, they are to be brought more into line with the other aims of the industry development policy. Project grants will remain the main focus of the new program. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently the Government has been urged to stimulate industrial research and development by a number of expert committees including, the Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia-CITCA-and the Australian Science and Technology Council-ASTEC. Their advice was taken into consideration in developing the program which I am about to announce. Basically the Government has decided to become more selective in providing assistance. The rationale for government assistance rests on the proposition that there are disparities between the private and national returns from research and development expenditure. The market does not provide enough incentives for firms to undertake research and development. The result is a national under-investment in industrial research and development and a tendency for firms to concentrate on relatively short-term industrial research and development. The fundamental purpose of the program is to correct this market failure. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this background, the Government has decided that, in future, an industrial research and development project will be supported only where it involves a substantial degree of risk or where a firm is unable to gain enough of the profits generated by the industrial research and development to justify the project. The Government has also decided that policy measures should be cost-effective, be designed to improve rather than impede the operations of the market and that objectives should be spelled out clearly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes that regulations be promulgated to ensure that project grants applications are ranked according to their potential contribution to industry policy objectives. However, for practical timing and flexibility reasons, it is proposed initially that these guidelines be issued to the Board as directions under section 19 of the principal Act. Firms will be required to maintain a sizeable financial stake in subsidised industrial research and development to ensure their motivation for success is not diminished. </PARA>
<PARA> To compensate for inflation as well as to strengthen the incentive to firms to undertake the industrial research and development, the Government proposes to increase ceilings from $500,000 to $750,000 per year for project grants and from $25,000 to $40,000 per year for commencement grants. The grants will remain taxable. For ongoing commencement grants the rate for the following year will be announced on March 31 and will not exceed 50 per cent. The project grant rate shall not exceed 50 per cent without ministerial approval. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill makes provision for the inclusion of industrial research and development related to and carried out at the site of a building and is retrospective to 1 July 1980. Eligibility does not extend to more general operations in the industry such as works. The Bill allows computer software research and development to be eligible for project grant assistance under the Act but only when it is relevant to the objectives of the Act. It must relate directly to new products of, and new or improved processes employed in manufacturing, mining or eligible on-site building or construction activities.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's intention is to encourage the application of new or innovative software techniques to the development of such products or processes. However, where computer software research and development has been eligible under the commencement grant scheme, this eligibility will be retained after 1 July 1981. In accordance with CITCA recommendations and with Government decisions on that report, the Bill includes a section on the Board's powers and functions. In broad terms, these are: To authorise the payment of industrial research and development commencement grants to eligible companies; to enter into agreements for projects of industrial research and development carried out or proposed to be carried out by eligible companies; and to enter into contracts for projects of industrial research in a field of science and technology where the Minister considers this to be in the public interest. The Board will be restructured and chaired by someone outside the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains provisions to enable the Board to obtain specialised advice in technical and commercial areas. The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) shall obtain advice, on the selection of public interest projects by a re-constituted Industrial Research and Development Incentives Advisory Committee. The Advisory Committee shall take into account guidelines. The project must, firstly, be of high priority in terms of Government policy objectives; secondly, have substantial social and economic benefit to the community; thirdly, normally involve the commercial development of public sector or non-profit research institutions; and fourthly, be of major importance and likely to command widespread public support. As well, the guidelines will specify that funding should be for industrial research and development and should not be in the place of other funding sources. </PARA>
<PARA> Ownership of the results of public interest projects will be vested in the Commonwealth Government with commercially viable prospects being exploited on normal business terms. In future the Board's annual report will include statements of the names of companies with which the Board has made arrangements, the progress of their projects, and, payments to those companies. Directions from the Minister to the Board also will be included in the report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill repeals the Industrial Research and Development Grants Act 1967. The Government will be monitoring the operation of the new scheme to evaluate its effectiveness against the principles which I have just outlined prior to the Act's expiry in 1986. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

We do not oppose the legislation just as we do not oppose the other legislation introduced in conjunction with this matter. As you know, Mr President, yesterday it was proposed that the Senate should deal with the Patents Amendment Bill cognately with this Bill. As I understand it, that Bill has now been taken out of the list and debate on it has been adjourned until a subsequent date. In a sense, a lot of what one might want to say about the Patents Amendment Bill has equal application to the Trade Marks Amendment Bill and also to the Designs Amendment Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main purpose of the Trade Marks Amendment Bill is to rewrite section 103. This legislation expands the provisions of section 103 in a way which is very cumbersome. Section 103 was a section of some 31 lines. It has now been expanded to about 10 times that size. It seeks to implement a series of recommendations made by a committee under the chairmanship of Mr John Stonier. I think I can fairly describe him as something of an expert in the field of industrial property. He has been very active in researching and developing industrial property concepts in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an extraordinary piece of drafting, in the view of the Opposition. A dramatic illustration of the problems with the drafting of the Bill is that each of the members addressing themselves to this Bill in the House of Representatives had a different interpretation of what it in fact meant. We are prepared to take a somewhat charitable interpretation and to decide that it means what the Government's advisers say that it means and to rely on that interpretation for the purposes of giving the Bill our support.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Designs Amendment Bill. I wish to make a few necessarily brief comments about it. We regret the fact that over a considerable period there has been delay in bringing this legislation forward in the Parliament. I think this matter goes back a number of years, and that is unfortunate. But now the legislation is here we welcome it. I might say that tonight the Government has been very quick in bringing the Bill before the Senate; the Government did not actually tell us that it was coming on. The Designs Law Review Committee, headed by Mr Justice Franki, was set up in 1970-more than ten years ago-and reported in 1973. Years later, legislation resulting from that Committee's deliberations now surfaces.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to bring the principal Act, which was first passed in 1906, into conformity with changes in the law elsewhere and in particular with changes in Great Britain that have resulted from case law in that country. The effect of proposed new section 18 of the Act is to ensure that designs which can be judged by the eye because of their features or shape will not now be excluded from being registered as designs merely because shape or configuration features serve a functional purpose. Anybody who is listening to this debate and who does not understand the foregoing is in almost the same category as I am. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to say something about the attitudes of this country, which I regard as being unfortunate, to questions of industrial property generally and to design matters in particular. We have always had the problem in Australia of trying to determine what we should consider our country to be. Should we consider it as a developed country, an undeveloped country or a lesser developed country-an LDC as such countries are sometimes called? Australia conventionally fancies itself as a rather developed country. It has the high living and educational standards of countries which can claim to be well developed or highly developed. We are European and Western in culture and outlook. But the real question is whether, in terms of national government and standards in relation to the matters which are the subject of this Bill and the other two related Bills, Australia is in fact a developed country or whether we are perhaps kidding ourselves a little in that regard. Culturally, we came to assume the semblance of being a developed country by virtue of our history, but economically it was on the basis of the great pastoral and mining industries in Australia that we attained the degree of economic sophistication that we have today. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia was and is an important source of raw materials. Exports of those raw materials paved the way for the development of the infrastructure of service industries, and later manufacturing industries, which our political and cultural structure demands. This was all very fine while the population was smaller, while the influence of multinational corporations was much smaller than it is today and while the greater part of the rest of the world was much less developed than it is today. It was also fine while we were not competing with the growing and increasingly sophisticated economies of South East Asia. I refer particularly to such countries as Korea, the social experiments of which we might not like to follow-I would not particularly like to follow them-but aspects of the economic development of which contain some lessons for a country like Australia. While in days gone by we were not competing with these growing economies of South East Asia our position was much easier. It meant, for example, that a policy of import substitution and fragmented growth was workable for manufacturing industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Times have now changed. Countries such as Korea, to which I have pointed, are moving up the economic scales and are developing relatively sophisticated methods of handling the introduction of new technology-not, as I have said, on the social side, but in relation to technological transfer-so that it benefits others besides the multinational corporations which take it to such a country as Korea. I would argue that in relation to the matters which are the subject of the three Bills which were originally to be dealt with cognately we should look very much to the examples set by countries such as Korea, Sweden and, perhaps more particularly, Norway. I do not mean that we should necessarily accept the social and political order of those countries, but Australia, as a recipient of multinational corporation capital and technology, should look at what these countries are doing in relation to the transfer of technology. We must recognise that Australia has a lot in common with them and that it has a sort of hybrid character in that it is in some ways a highly developed country-certainly in terms of aspirations-and, in other ways, it is a much less developed country. It is in relation to these matters that I think this type of legislation, and its subject matter, is important. I think we have to recognise that Australia is not in the big league of economic performance in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer the Senate to two views which have been put forward. One was put forward in a paper by Dr Paul Grant of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation which was read at the Australian Mining and Petroleum Law Association conference in Sydney recently. It dealt with the international transfer of technology for the secondary processing of minerals in Australia. This is an important topic because mining development, in spite of protestations to the contrary in this Senate, will not provide all the jobs that Australia needs, and secondary processing and manufacturing based on it could go much further towards the production of jobs and, indeed, permament wealth arising from the extractive industries. Dr Grant argued in that paper that we pay too much for overseas technology and that we allow multinational corporations to import it in package deals, which are tightly controlled, so that it is available to them and not to others. This casts some doubt on our hitherto solid support for a patent system which operates basically to the advantage of industrially developed nations and not to the advantage of a lesser developed nation such as Australia. This matter is very important in relation to secondary processing. </PARA>
<PARA> I have referred also to the Korean experiment. It has been argued successfully in that country that an industrially undeveloped country should put research last in development, after engineering and adaptation of overseas technology. That requires the wringing of some concessions from the providers of multinational capital in Australia, which this Government has never been prepared to do. Changes in our patent law may be necessary to adapt to that sort of system. We should also adopt a more aggressive stance in bargaining with transnational companies in relation to the importation of technology into Australia. The whole realm of industrial property law and industrial property practices is relevant to these questions of technology import. They are important matters to be considered in the light of the general subject of this Bill. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that in some ways it is unfortunate that this second reading debate does not address all three related Bills insofar as we could have had a wideranging debate on the whole question which Senator Button has opened up and to which I think he has certainly contributed in many ways tonight. However, the Designs Amendment Bill addresses itself to a particular need for an amendment following the 1973 report of the Designs Law Review Committee, headed by Mr Justice Franki. Several matters emanate from the amendment that flows from that report in respect of the procedures relating to designs. The history of the matter to which Senator Button referred in relation to proposed new section 18 of the Bill goes back, I believe, to the case in the United Kingdom in 1963 in which a design was defined as being limited only to the aesthetic features of a particular design. Proposed section 18 of the Bill seeks to extend the definition of design to include the functional purposes of that object. Senator Button addressed himself to that matter early in his discussion and asked for an explanation of its meaning. I hope I have been able to help in that regard to some extent. As there are a number of other matters on the agenda tonight, I wish the Bill a speedy passage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a brief reference to clause 9 of the Bill. I am attracted to making some comments on that by the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney). Clause 9 states how new or original designs may be registered. The second reading speech states that design registrations being sought and obtained range from air conditioners, barbecues, boat hulls, chairs and display cabinets to roof tiles, toys, wash-basins and yo-yos. The reference to yo-yos would be of particular interest to Mr President because today Senator Mason likened honourable senators to yo-yos when trying to get the call from Mr President. I am wondering whether under this Bill we might be able to register honourable senators as yo-yos. Perhaps Mr President will take on board what Senator Mason said and in future we will be termed senators, not yo-yos.</PARA></TALK.START>

I want to respond to a question which was raised by an honourable senator when he drew attention to proposed section 98B (5) of the Bill, which states, inter alia, that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal shall have regard to any principles determined, from time to time, by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission as being appropriate for the fixation of award wages or salaries. I rose only to assure honourable senators that it is not the Government's intention that this sub-section should prevent the Tribunal from taking into account anticipated cost increases in making its determinations. It is quite competent for the Tribunal to look at anticipated cost increases when it is making its determinations. That is one question to which I thought I should respond.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was trapped in the Chair earlier and I was not able to participate in this debate. There are some points that I wish to raise concerning the amendment proposed by Senator Mason and the rather fantastic amendment which has been produced by the Government and which has received the support-I find this quite strange having listened to last night's debate-of Senator Watson, Senator Jessop and Senator Rae. It seems to me that the simple amendment proposed by Senator Mason would solve the problem which the pharmacists face. I do not think there has been proper understanding of the industry in the debate which is taking place and which in some way will determine the time that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal will take to make a determination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Each determination that the Tribunal will make will be subject to surveys of the industry, which is a complex one. It is not an industry which just provides and dispenses prescriptions. Unfortunately, the industry has been in some way distorted-I might even say corrupted-by having to take on commercial enterprises to survive, commercial enterprises which have nothing whatsoever to do with the prescribing or selling of pharmaceutical items. </PARA>

<PARA> This country has allowed the sale of drugs to fall into the hands of the general commercial merchandising outlets, and very much to its cost. I draw upon my experience as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse, which found that the greatest area of abuse of drugs in this country was in the area of analgesics. It seemed to me that if the sale of analgesics had been confined to pharmacists there would have been some control over their misuse. But what has happened is that we have allowed the sale of a whole variety of pharmaceutical items to be subject to the pressure sales of the great disturbing outlets, the great grocery merchandising chains. </PARA>

Surely the advisers will support my view that it is a long, tortuous and difficult process. That situation will not change under this legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose is to try to develop new methods, yet the honourable senator has ignored the second recommendation of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The first recommendation was for the establishment of this Tribunal and it is being established by this legislation. For the life of me I cannot understand why honourable senators opposite are not prepared to accept Senator Mason's amendment. The second leg of the recommendation was for the establishment of a bureau of health economics to carry out these surveys. Are honourable senators saying that the Tribunal must go through this exercise? How else will it determine the profitability of pharmacy? How will it relate the sale of general merchandising items, such as rubber ducks and pantyhose? How will it assess the profitability of one section of a pharmacy against other sections so that it can come up with a determination on how much it will pay for each prescription that the pharmacy makes up? I am serious about this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A pharmacy has a certain area in which it sells a variety of items some of which I have mentioned. It can go into chocolates and a variety of other items as well. The Tribunal must determine the profitability of one item against another.

If the honourable senator does not believe me he can look at the evidence that came before the Public Accounts Committee. We were astounded at the complexity of the exercise engaged in to determine the profitability of one item against another. All I am saying is that the Tribunal will be faced with the same necessity to carry out the same investigation which will take time. If it takes time, it will delay payment to pharmacists. If it delays the payment to pharmacists some element must be introduced into this legislation which will allow for retrospective payment. That is exactly what Senator Mason's amendment is aimed at. His is a simple amendment which will enable the Tribunal to take as much time as it thinks necessary to make a determination without disadvantaging the pharmacist. If the Tribunal takes nine months to come to a determination, then, under Senator Mason's amendment, it will be possible to make payments retrospective over that nine-moth period.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Senator D. S. Jessop,</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra, ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA> You will be aware that this Bill was rushed through all stages in the House of Representatives last Thursday and is to be considered by the Senate this week. Hence the short notice of these representations. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation is to establish an independent public Tribunal to determine the amount of money paid by the Government to chemists as reimbursement of their out-of-pocket expenses incurred in dispensing pharmaceutical benefits prescriptions. </PARA>
<PARA> In principle, The Pharmacy Guild of Australia welcomes the legislation. Chemists have had no effective increase in their fee since 1977 during which time the CPI has increased by nearly 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> However, Australia's 5,000 chemists are opposed to the legislation in its present form. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past, the method mutually agreed by the Government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia for adjusting chemists' remuneration was to allow them to recover the average cost of dispensing pharmaceutical benefits prescriptions. The arrangement was to establish as far as possible the increases in the average actual cost of dispensing after the event and to adjust payments to chemists for the relevant period. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the current bill under Section 98BE specifically precludes the Tribunal from making such adjustments. </PARA>
<PARA> It will enshrine in legislation a system of reimbursement to chemists where the level will always fall short of their actual costs incurred by the amount of inflation since the last determination. </PARA>
<PARA> May I re-emphasise that what we are talking about is not the payment by the Government of a wage or salary but the recovery of costs incurred by chemists in maintaining a critical element in Australia's health care system, that is, the dispensing of 100 million prescriptions per year. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, my Guild recommends that the Bill be amended as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Delete from Section 98BE all words after and including ''not'' in the second line of the Section (See Attachment). </PARA>
<PARA> This would otherwise preclude the Tribunal from adjusting determinations to match chemists' actual increases in costs. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Bill is not thus amended, then the Parliament will have placed constraints on what is supposed to be an independent Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Tribunal, not the Government, which should determine the level of remuneration and from what date that remuneration should apply. </PARA>
<PARA> In its present form the legislation is asking chemists to provide, out of their own pockets, a continuing subsidy of the Government's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme of over $10 million per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that you will appreciate the unreasonableness of the legislation in its present form and of the vital need for it to be amended by the Senate, if this essential element of Australia's health care system is not to be placed in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jessop has expressed concern about this matter and intends to raise it in the party room. I ask you to give the matter your earnest consideration and I look forward to your support for the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Another matter of which I want to remind the Committee is that it is very important that we get this legislation through without undue delay because the Government wants to obtain royal assent to this measure to ensure that the chairman of the Tribunal is appointed so that he can determine pharmaceutical fees by 1 July. I would just like to say in mild criticism of the haste with which we are putting this legislation through, what I said last night. It will be very difficult for a chairman of the Tribunal who is appointed tomorrow or the day after to come to grips with the problems that are associated with determining fees so that pharmacists get a fair deal. That is another point which the Australian Democrats have chosen to disregard. If the Government accepted the amendment proposed by the Australian Democrats, it would be impossible to appoint a chairman and make it even more difficult to make a judgment on the fairness of prescription fees payable to pharmacists.</PARA></TALK.START>

I have no idea why he incorporated this letter in Hansard. I received a similar letter and other members of the Opposition received a similar letter from the Guild, but the letter to us did not name Senator Jessop. The Guild obviously has sent a letter to Government senators different from the one which it sent to Opposition senators. The letter to Government senators gives Senator Jessop an honourable mention but the letter to Opposition senators does not mention him. It certainly was not on the basis of any letter from the Pharmacy Guild that I was led to believe that Senator Jessop intended to move the amendment. I suggest that Senator Jessop knows perfectly well how I knew, why I thought he intended to move the amendment and why other people in this place thought he would move the amendment. I have no hesitation in saying that. Senator Jessop claims to have been affronted. I had no intention of naming him as any stage and I had no intention of naming any Government senator until certain Government senators, including Senator Jessop, pontificated in this place about the great work Senator Jessop had done to get this amendment to the legislation accepted, an amendment which does nothing to solve the problems which have been raised by the Pharmacy Guild and which have been raised by honourable senators on this side of the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I just wish to repeat, without unduly delaying the committee, that the argument just put forward by Senator Jessop that one of the reasons the Government has accepted this amendment is to expedite the passage of this legislation is nonsense. The legislation, I repeat, was passed through the House of Representatives in one day. It could have been passed through here in another day. It could have gone through this place in an amended form in one day, gone back to the House of Representatives and gone through this place again in a similar time. There was no reason why this could not have been done. It is typical for Government members in this place to breath fire and brimstone one night, then suddenly, en masse, back off when they are heavied by their Executive colleagues. For the record and to demonstrate that the letters are different, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the letter from the Pharmacy Guild of Australia which was received by me and other members of the Opposition, a letter which is different from the letter obviously received by Senator Jessop and Government senators. </PARA>

<PARA> In principle, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia welcomes the legislation. Chemists have had no effective increase in their fee since 1977 during which time the CPI has increased by nearly 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> However, Australia's 5,000 chemists are opposed to the legislation in its present form. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past, the method mutually agreed by the Government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia for adjusting chemists' remuneration was to allow them to recover the average cost of dispensing pharmaceutical benefits prescriptions. The arrangement was to establish as far as possible the increases in the average actual cost of dispensing after the event and to adjust payments to chemists for the relevant period. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the current bill under Section 98BE specifically precludes the Tribunal from making such adjustments. </PARA>
<PARA> It will enshrine in legislation a system of reimbursement to chemists where the level will always fall short of their actual costs incurred by the amount of inflation since the last determination. </PARA>
<PARA> May I re-emphasise that what we are talking about is not the payment by the Government of a wage or salary but the recovery of costs incurred by chemists in maintaining a critical element in Australia's health care system, that is, the dispensing of 100 million presriptions per year. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly my Guild recommends that the Bill be amended as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Delete from Section 98BE all words after and including 'not' in the second line of the Section (See Attachment). </PARA>
<PARA> This would otherwise preclude the Tribunal from adjusting determinations to match chemists' actual increases in costs. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Bill is not thus amended, then the Parliament will have placed constraints on what is supposed to be an independent Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Tribunal, not the Government, which should determine the level of remuneration and from what date that remuneration should apply. </PARA>
<PARA> In its present form the legislation is asking chemists to provide, out of their own pockets, a continuing subsidy of the Government's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme of over $10 million per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that you will appreciate the unreasonableness of the legislation in its present form and of the vital need for it to be amended by the Senate, if this essential element of Australia's health care system is not to be placed in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA> I look forward to your support of the amendment. </PARA>

I refer to the real difference between the two proposed amendments. I will put it this way: With either approach, it all depends on the Tribunal as to determining whether there will be some past cost catch-up-in other words, whether the Tribunal will have the capacity to backdate the determination retrospectively or whether it can include past costs incurred as part of the price fixing for the--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. In either event it depends on the Tribunal and the Tribunal's approach as to whether it is prepared to do that. Some of the differences that have been discussed can perhaps best be described in this way. In respect of Senator Mason's amendment, I ask this question: Who would make the decision as to retrospectivity? The answer is, the Tribunal would make the decision. In respect of Senator Baume's amendment and under the legislation as it otherwise stands, I ask the question: Who would make the decision for the Tribunal to sit with whatever is regarded as the necessary frequency to enable any adjustments to be made and who would apply the past cost catch-up principle? The answer is identical in both cases-the Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know the honourable senator's point. I tried to shorthand it. The point is well known that there are what are regarded as pharmaceutical sales and general commercial sales which take place. There is a problem in balancing the two types of sales. He said this is a reason why all the inquiries that are conducted by the Tribunal will be lengthy. I would have thought that once the first inquiry had been conducted and some principle or formula had been adopted or determined all the rest of the inquiries would be able to be carried out relatively expeditiously. The point which people are overlooking entirely is that the first inquiry, under the provisions of clause 10 of this legislation, will be able to be backdated to May 1980 in its effect as a result of the inquiry. Retrospectivity will apply in respect of the first and maybe lengthy inquiry. From then on it will be a matter of fine tuning from time to time, according to the discretion of the Tribunal, but with a guarantee under our proposed amendment to ensure that it will not be longer than every 12 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should have thought that it is patently clear that what has been developed and negotiated as a result of the further consideration which this matter has received since yesterday is something which improves it in a way which is better than the proposal put forward by Senator Mason, which is better than the original Bill and is one in regard to which the people who are the chemists of Australia can rest assured that the Committee has attempted to apply itself to how best a fair and workable system can be developed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the point raised by Senator Rae first. It seems to me that the amendment that he says will solve these problems merely says: 'The Tribunal shall ensure that its findings resulting from its second or any subsequent inquiry,'-I agree with him on the first point-'and the reasons for them, are issued not later than 12 months after the date on which the Tribunal issued its findings resulting from its first inquiry or from the last inquiry held by it, as the case may be.' All that amendment does is to make provisions on the issuing of findings in terms of time. I reiterate that it has nothing to do with the amendment I have moved. I resent the imputations made that in some way this is a sort of patch-up or fix-up solution for the same problem. I cannot see how it possibly can be. Even in common semantic terms, any human being would realise that an amendment which states that its findings have to be released within a certain time can have no possible consistency with an amendment which states that a provision now standing in the legislation which directs the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, in effect, not to introduce a retrospective provision-that is what it says: 'not being a date earlier than the date on which the statement setting out the terms of determination of the Tribunal in accordance with section 98BD-are the same. The only way in which a simple solution to this problem can be achieved is by passing my amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to Senator Rae's earlier speech in Committee, in which he said-I would like serious consideration of this-that if indeed the Tribunal finds that a serious situation arises, where perhaps there has been a wage increase or the increase in cost of some imported product from overseas, it can have another hearing. I should have thought that Senator Rae was the person in this place who was against quangos and things such as that. I thought he was the person who was against tribunals sitting continuously time and time again; yet here he is in this place recommending a virtually continuous operation of a tribunal with all the expenses involved in it. I would like Senator Rae to answer that point. I should have thought that it was much easier for a tribunal to look at costs subsequent to their having occurred when they can be asessed properly, then apply-as is the case with chemists; Senator Rae is aware of this-a decision backed by the knowledge thus gained. But, no, Senator Rae has said it is much better to have a situation in which indeed, even if half a dozen, 15 or 20 cost factors occur in a year, the Tribunal will sit 15 or 20 times. I suggest to him that this is really reductio ad absurdum. It is a situation in which the Government is proposing to try to rationalise the fantastic, stupid stand which it has taken. It will have a tribunal working almost continuously to have to take cognisance of events as they happen rather than sitting once or twice a year, assessing all those things which have happened over that time and then saying: 'We will in retrospect agree with those things'. I have not heard anything tonight, and I do not believe that the Senate has heard anything, which would in any way alter the effect of the amendment which I have proposed and which, after all, was originally proposed by the Pharmacy Guild of Australia saying simply that the answer to this problem is that the Government will remove from the legislation that provision which, for some perverse reason, it put in-and we have still not been told what that reason is--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Peter Baume says: 'Let us vote on it' because he does not want to tell us the reason. It has become abundantly obvious during this debate. Why do honourable senators think we are keeping at this? It is because we want to know. There is some reason why the Government is doing this, and I would like to know what it is. What is the perverse reason which has inspired the Government to say that it will not say why it is doing somthing which it wants to make into law. I am an elected senator. I have a right to ask that question and I have a right to get a reply to it. I want that reply. I would like honourable senators to think about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point I make is in relation to Senator Jessop's comments. Senator Jessop has accused the Australian Democrats of intransigence over this matter. I see no reason why he should have taken that view. We have taken the view that the motion and the letter proposed to us by the Pharmacy Guild were reasonable. That is the only stand we have taken. I have never debated in this place a more simple issue than this one. It appals me that the Government has been able to string this matter out into four hours of debate, because the matter is really very simple. Are we to allow a situation in which people who reasonably incur costs in their business, are to be compensated for them at the time at which they incurred them? The Government's answer is no; it will not do that: But it will not tell us why. I would like that answer, please. </PARA>

<PARA>In all the hours of debate last night and today I have heard nothing which changes my mind from what I said in two minutes last night. I feel that it is reasonable that the words should be deleted in order to enable the tribunal before which the evidence is to be advanced to determine the issues in accordance with that evidence. Mr Justice Terry Ludeke has been dealing with this matter; I take the opportunity of saying that there are, in the industrial relations arena, a large number of people who do not appreciate the Government's hiving off highly experienced presidential members of the Commission such as His Honour to inquiries such as this. I expect the Government to consider very seriously whether it will follow that course in appointing the Chairman of the Tribunal. Surely there are people who do not have the industrial experience-which is needed elsewhere if the Government is fair dinkum in its industrial policy-who can deal with the issues involved and make the necessary determinations under the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, in all of the hours of debate on this matter I have heard nothing to convince me that it is of a terribly major nature. I believe that it involves, rather, semantics and nitpicking. I do not accuse the Government of delaying this measure. I suppose that if one considered the procedures followed one would say that it has not. I congratulate the Government on its drafting of the other parts of the legislation. I agree with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) that we should get on with the business of the Senate. The debate has produced in me, and I know in a number of other senators, symptoms for which medicine ought to be prescribed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before addressing my remarks to the ministerial statement on the Review of Commonwealth Functions, I must do my duty and acknowledge the maiden speech made tonight by Senator Bjelke-Petersen. I think the speech will be read with great interest by the Treasurer, Mr Howard, and the head of the Department of the Treasury, Mr Stone. I must thank the good senator for helping us. Too much in the past we have put up with hurt and angered speeches from the Government benches about Opposition speakers who have made provocative remarks in their maiden speeches. I believe that she has set a very sensible precedent in ignoring a tradition. It was certainly the most provocative maiden speech I have heard for some time, perhaps since Senator Walsh's maiden speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Review of Commonwealth Functions presented in this ministerial statement, I believe, should be considered in the context of the Government's stated philosophy which seems to be that this country would benefit from a massive withdrawal of the Commonwealth from the public sector by transferring functions to the private sector and, in fact, to the States. It also should be viewed in association with other actions of what must be the most conservative Government in this country for the last 60-odd years. It is therefore appropriate that in the debate on this matter I follow Senator Walters, as I often seem to do in this place. There seems to be a plot to keep Tasmanians together. The honourable senator, of course, gave us a lecture of her views on socialism. She apparently believes that socialism means subservience of the individual. Whatever her philosophy is-she did not give it a name-it means the subservience of the state. It is a pity that she sometimes does not listen to the words of her leader the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). </PARA>
<PARA> One week ago I was in Amsterdam at a meeting of the Socialist International. The chairman of that meeting was Willy Brandt. The representatives from the West German Government included three Ministers. There was an apology from Helmut Schmidt, who is the Chancellor of West Germany. They are all good socialists. We have frequently heard the Prime Minister of this country in fact praising the socialist Government of West Germany. We have heard other members praise the socialist Government of Austria which, of course, has a much better economic performance than our Government. I well remember one magnificent photograph of Prime Minister Fraser, Helmut Schmidt, Michael Manley and James Callaghan-all members of Socialist International and all socialists-all enjoying themselves and all expressing their views, which were the same, on the world's problems at the time. Of course, Mr Fraser's support for another avowed socialist, Mr Mugabe, who is not a member of the Socialist International, is well known. Perhaps Senator Walters should get her facts right. Perhaps she should do some reading. Perhaps she should, in fact, find out just what democratic socialists are, and who they are and she should look at some of the countries in this world which have democratic socialist governments. Then she may not be as critical, as blind or as narrow as she demonstrated herself to be. </PARA>
<PARA> As I was saying, this review committee represents a transfer of the functions of the national government to either the State governments or the private sector. It even brings about the abolition of some functions completely. It does not, in fact, represent a great reduction in expenditure in this country in relative terms but it does fit in with the general abrogation of the Government's responsibilities to provide for national standards for some aspects of the quality of life for ordinary citizens, in particular, disadvantaged citizens. If we proceed on this path this national Parliament will be reduced to considering defence, foreign affairs, and perhaps some pensions. Senator Martyr may well agree with that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He may well agree that that is all we should do in this place and that all this national Parliament should do, unlike all other national parliaments in the world, is sit here and waffle about foreign affairs, defence and perhaps a few pensions to salve our consciences. I think it is worth quoting from the first page of the review committee report. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Review's starting point is that Australia's greatest resource is the Australian people and that the role of government is to enable people to exercise their abilities, their skills, their imaginations and their enterprise. When this happens the result is economic growth, more jobs, higher incomes and a better life for all. If we ask why it is that the free and democratic nations of the West provide the best way of life for ordinary people, the unmistakable answer is that it is because people who live in these societies are free to build for themselves the kind of life that suits them best. </PARA>
<PARA>The assumption in this sort of nonsense and the assumption by the Government is that government activity and public services, in fact, are necessarily bad, that they are against economic development and that they are against sound economic management. We hear frequently from Government spokesmen that Australia is particularly badly affected by an excess of public expenditure and by an excess of government involvement in the lives of the people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The truth is, of course, that on the international scale we do not have a large public sector. We are in the bottom league of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries and many of the great Western democracies to which this review committee refers. They perform much better than we do when the usual economic parameters of inflation, unemployment and economic growth are measured. They do this, despite lacking the resources that we have. All have much larger public sectors. One can look at West Germany, Senator Martyr, which has an even greater deficit that we have when compared with the gross domestic product. Particularly in the welfare field they are far more generous than we are. There is no correlation between the size of the public sector and the economic performance of these countries. There is no correlation between the size of the public sector and the freedom and ability of people in these countries to control and develop their own lives.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The OECD papers. I shall quote them any time and produce them for the honourable senator. The determination is, in fact-Senator Martyr is well known for this-to turn back the clock to the mythical, good old days when so-called market forces and a lack of government intervention will somehow bring us a new paradise. It ignores the historical reasons for the development of these services. Public services in this and other Western countries were developed because they were not provided. Those services were not provided by the private sector because it was either unwilling to do so or unable to do so at a cost which some citizens, through no fault of their own, could afford.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the case of public health and public health care in general, there had developed a general acceptance of the community rating principle whereby it was believed that, because the need for such care was by and large out of the control of the patient, the citizen, and that no civilised nation should fail to provide access to health care for all citizens, we should, in fact, have the principle of community rating. I have heard the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) who is in the chamber tonight espouse that view in this place. This government has broken this principle. It wishes to introduce what is called the user pays principle, the end result of which inevitably is that the chronically ill and the large families with children who need health care more often than others, will pay more than the more fortunate people in the community and they will have less access to health care. They will be limited in their access to health care by financial means. As an aside, it is worthwhile remembering that the United States of America spends a higher percentage of its gross domestic product on health care than do the other Western democracies, and with great inequities and with no better results-in fact, with worse results in most cases. </PARA>
<PARA> This action and other actions of the Government represent an attack on public sector expenditure and public sector services, which means, in fact, an attack on the living standards of the disadvantaged members of this community. There can be no getting away from that. The actions represent an attack on the opportunities for such citizens to take part in society fully and to gain access to adequate housing, adequate health care and to a system of justice and education. In other words, this is an attack on their ability to improve their lot. We often hear, as a justification for withdrawal from the public sector in this way, that taxes can be reduced thereby increasing the freedom of some of us to spend our own income. But under this Government and under other governments which have taken similar action, these tax cuts inevitably occur so that the high income earners get the greatest benefit from the taxation cuts. That is, in fact, what happened in the last two series of tax cuts in this country. So the more affluent marginally increase their freedom to spend their money, whereas the withdrawal of services and at times the withdrawal of income from the poor-that has occurred also under this Government, in particular to the single unemployed and the young unemployed-represent an even greater attack on their freedom of choice. Such moves represent a great attack on the freedom of choice of the poorest in the community to make decisions which affect their own lives. Small cuts in income to the poor and the withdrawal of services to them severely restrict the freedom and the ability to act of the poor migrant, of the unemployed, of the supporting mother and of the low income family. </PARA>
<PARA> It is said that this argument-Senator Walters repeated it-which has arisen from this Government's philosophy and from the philosophy which is espoused in this document is in fact an argument about big government versus small government. It is not. It is an argument between a fair society and an efficient and an adequate government and a divided society and an uncaring government. To revert to the sort of laissez-faire state that Senator Martyr and his colleagues apparently wish to return to is to return to the times of public squalor and private affluence. This will be the inevitable result if we have a government which is, as this Government is, hostile and indifferent to the public sector and which at the same time encourages and subsidises some sections of the private sector. Such an outlook ignores the historical development of our society and it results, I suggest, from a very blinkered view of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> We can look at some of the statements in the document which superficially are unobjectionable and which superficially can be accepted by all sorts of people but which, when considered in conjunction with the actions of this Government, in fact are not much help at all to the community. We hear that only individuals have full knowledge of their own needs, wants and priorities and that politicians, officials and bureaucrats do not have this knowledge and can never have it. Apart from the simplistic nonsense represented in the statement which ignores the fact that politicians, officials and bureaucrats are themselves individuals, the statement ignores the fact that individuals have needs which they express such as the need for accessible health care and, in the case of migrants, the need for interpreters and for child care facilities. But what is the point of such knowledge if the services are not available or if politicians do what politicians in this Government do and ignore those needs? Another comment from the statement is: We are all better off in a social, political and material sense by limiting government. This may be so in some degree but not if it inflicts unnecessary austerity and unnecessary hardship on people because of lack of government services and lack of government support. One of the interesting comments in the statement is: The benefits of our program are now visible for everyone to see. How visible are they to those who are becoming unemployed in greater numbers than ever before? How visible are they to those who have been confused by five changes to the health system, who are unable to get care and who are uncertain about how to go about preparing to get that care. How visible are they to those on low incomes who have seen their family allowances eroded in value by some 60 per cent? These people have been badly treated by this much vaunted program. I suggest that if the Government continues in its present vein those people will continue to be badly treated. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look briefly at some of the aspects of the Government's program which have arisen out of this document and out of recent statements in this Parliament. Senator Walters, when she was not attacking Senator Button, Senator Evans and other honourable senators on this side of the chamber for things they did not say and making her own interpretation of what people think and what people say, spent her whole time talking about the health system. The simple fact, as has been pointed out not only by the Opposition but also by obvservers in this community-by people involved in health care-is that the changes will result in less efficiency. They will result in less efficiency despite the five changes that preceded them and despite the half a million dollars which was spent, for instance, on the Jamison report into the efficiency of hospitals in this country. The whole direction of the health system now is to prop up the private health funds, to extend the private hospital services, to extend the private fee-for-service system to the detriment of the public hospital system and to remove the access of all people to the public hospital out-patient specialist facilities and in-patient facilities in this country. It is no wonder that this statement has been greeted with great glee by the private health funds which, according to today's paper, expect some two million to three million more people to join their funds, those people having been forced into such funds, they believe, by the changes to the present system. </PARA>
<PARA> The user pays principle in health is inappropriate. It is only appropriate in a situation where the user and the seller have equal knowledge of the system. That does not occur in the health system. Patients have very little knowldege of what is being done to them and of what can be done to them. They have neither the technical knowldege nor the skills to make the sort of judgment that people who are buying ordinary materials can make. To suggest, as Senator Walters did, that by charging people in public hospitals they will become aware of the cost of health and therefore use the hospitals less, is nonsense. Patients do not put themselves into hospitals; docors put them into hospitals. To suggest that by charging people for pathological and diagnostic tests which are used in medical treatment in this day and age, this will mean that patients will somehow be able to control the costs and have some idea of the situation, is nonsense. Doctors order those tests. Patients do not understand what the tests are about and it is a brave patient who questions the necessity of such tests by any doctor. It is a false situation. It does not apply. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walters, to back up her words, talked about the increasing costs of health care in this community. She blamed those increasing costs of health care on the Labor Government and the Medibank system. The first investigations into the health insurance system in this country in fact were initiated by Mr Gorton and his Liberal-Country Party Government in 1969. They were continued by Mr McMahon and his Government until 1972. There was great concern then about increases in the costs of health care in this community. That concern continued through 1972 and into 1973 and 1974 when the Labor Government was in power. Health costs did rise and that is why the community came to accept the need for Medibank which was introduced in July 1975. The great increases in health costs in this country occurred before the introduction of Medibank. I am sure that Senator Martyr, being an astute man, will know that the increases in costs levelled out after the introduction of Medibank and as a result of it. It was, in fact, nothing to do with the Labor Government or with Medibank that caused that escalation in costs from 1969 to 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> We will shortly be debating legislation to effect changes to the present health system. This will be the sixth time that I, as the shadow spokesman in the Senate on health, will have to debate this issue. It will not be the last time, because the people in this community will again become dis- satisfied with the extraordinary increase in the cost of covering their own health care which will arise out of this system. They will also be concerned about the diminution of services in the public hospitals. The States will be dissatisfied. Senator Walters apparently believes that to transfer these functions from the Federal Government to the State governments in what she described as a careful economic measure is the proper thing to do and that it will somehow result in decentralisation. Is Perth to the people in the northern part of Western Australia any further away in real terms than Canberra is?</PARA>
<PARA> Tonight the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has been in the embarrassing situation of demonstrating that he considers it all a game. He gloated about having played a little trick on the Premiers, saying that it was not a serious business at all and that, if they had pushed him harder, they would have got more money. This whole exercise is not serious to the Prime Minister; it is a game. The Premiers, four of whom are of the same political persuasion as the Prime Minister, do not think it is a game. </PARA>
<PARA> To have a free society, and a society in which people can make these choices and judgments about which the Prime Minister is always going on, we need to have information on which to base community services. The Government, realising this and not wanting people to make judgments and to have this sort of knowledge, has immediately attacked the information services in the community in its statement. We are told that the capacity of the Government Printer is to be limited to that required for Parliament and the urgent confidential needs of government. The remaining work is to be transferred to the private sector and the Australian Government Publishing Service Bookshops are to be leased to the private sector. This means that fewer reports will be printed because the market will be too small to make them viable commercial propositions. The private sector will not take on small runs of important statistical and research material because it will be unprofitable. In order to be profitable, the bookshops will have to take on more commercial and less informative books; otherwise they will close. There will be a clamping down on information in this area. It will be more difficult for people to make the sorts of judgments that we should be able to make in this society. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of employment and youth affairs, regular collections and publication of Commonwealth Employment Service statistics on persons registered for unemployment and on unfilled vacancies will be discontinued. The registered unemployed will be part of the hidden unemployed. We will no longer know what proportion of the registered unemployed is receiving benefits, what proportion falls into certain age groups and so on. We will not know where they are. We will have to rely on the Bureau of Statistics figures, samples for which are too small to indicate just where these people live, what people's ages are and what percentage of juniors will be unemployed in sections of Tasmania or South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole issue will be clouded. We will have to rely on Bureau of Statistics figures, which are not only based on a very small sample but also allow a large margin of error. For instance, the Bureau of Statistics estimate of 6,000 unemployed in Tasmania involves a standard error of plus or minus 530 people. We will not know the regional figures in that decentralised State-the figures for Burnie, Launceston or Hobart. We will just have gross figures for the State. Of course, that is what the Government wants. It does not want to make public the sorts of details which are so embarrassing and which have become increasingly embarrassing to it in the last five or six years. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of immigration and ethnic affairs, the production of certain publications is to be terminated and the production of others is to be rationalised. The information role of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is to be rationalised. As we all know, the word 'rationalisation' is a euphenism for being reduced or cut out. Funding for the National Groups Directory is to be discontinued. This is not only a restriction on information; it is also a restriction on the ability of groups to communicate with one another, to know who is doing what in the field and to know how to get in touch with groups with similar backgrounds and similar interests. The Directory is a unique publication. No other directory can take its place. How much will this small saving to the Government cost the community?</PARA>
<PARA> In the Treasury, certain lower priority statistical collections are to to eliminated or reviewed in conjunction with the States and the frequency of other collections is to be reviewed. But no details are given. Will we continue to receive educational, child care, health survey and other social publications? Will the social indicators which so many people find so useful continue to be published? It is quite clear that the Government has decided that the less people know the better. This information rundown is not accidental. It is part of the dictatorial style of the Government. It is part of the principle that the less the public knows the better it is for the government in power. If we turn to the Attorney-General's Department, with which I am sure Senator Evans will deal later, we find that the Legal Aid Commission is to be abolished. We find that the Crown Solicitor's Division will let out more work to the private sector. This will inevitably mean higher Government costs. We have only to look at the costs to the Government of the recent Greek conspiracy case, which have been listed carefully and which may be referred to by others later. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of employment and youth affairs, changes are to be made to the work test. Unemployment benefit forms and fortnightly income statements are to be returned directly to the Department of Social Security. All registered unemployed people will now be interviewed after four months' registration and the under-25 year olds will be re-interviewed after eight month's registration. This would seem to be a liberalisation of the work test and therefore of benefit and to be welcomed by many people, but in fact it is a recognition by the Government that the unemployment rate is high, will remain high and that the Government cannot do much about it. As an inevitable result of this the number of social workers and people who assist the unemployed, and the availability of assistance to the unemployed, will be reduced. After questioning Senator Chaney in the Senate and in the Estimates Committee, we have no idea of just how the new work test is to work. Senator Chaney admits that the Government has not worked it out yet. That is another scheme in this program which has not been thought through by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has been affected, again by small changes but in vital places, by a Government which frequently proclaims its interests in the ethnic communities in this country. The Assisted Passage Scheme is to be terminated forthwith. The production of publications is to be terminated in some cases and rationalised in others. The Committee on Overseas Professional Qualifications will involve the introduction of charges for the examination of qualifications. Again, this is an example of the user pays principle. Is it appropriate in this situation? The migrant hostel management is to be transferred to the private sector on a management fee basis. What control will the Government keep over conditions in hostels and charges to migrants and refugees? What virtue, if any, is there in handing this function over to private enterprise, when the responsibility is quite clearly the Government's? What virtue is there in handing over these people to private enterprise, the main concern of which in this area is to make a profit?</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth's role in the Adult Migrant and Refugee Education Program is to be restricted to arranging and co-ordinating only by relinquishing responsibility for the conduct of individual programs. This is a backward step. The program has been successful because the Federal Government has paid people to take time off work to learn language and communication skills. It has been one of the most successful Commonwealth programs. It is one which we wish to have extended to married women, who would have had less pressure to go into the job market if they had been helped to attend migrant education classes. The States will certainly not be able to take over this function. We suggest that it is foolish to have a migrant education program and then cut funds on the settlement side. It is an abdication of responsibility towards people whom the Commonwealth has wanted to attract. The translation and interpreting services are to be cut. The Telephone Interpreter Service, so vital to many people, should be expanded and not contracted as this document suggests. The Australian Ethnic Affairs Council, the Australian Population and Immigration Council and the Australian Refugees Advisory Council are to be replaced by a single advisory council. This is surely not streamlining. They have different functions entirely; they have developed different skills. Such action does not assist the migrants. </PARA>
<PARA> All areas have experienced cuts which will affect services to people who need them. The services will not be taken up by the States. The cuts will limit the ability of people to make choices about their own lives and to advance themselves in our society. That is a backward step. It demonstrates quite clearly, as Senator Walters said, the philosophical difference between the Government and Opposition parties. It shows the difference between a caring party and an uncaring party. It shows the difference between a party which wishes to follow the Western traditions of citizens being assisted by government and not return to the economic law of the jungle, the sort of social Darwinism which preceded us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I commence my speech in detail I add my congratulations to those of Senator Grimes to Senator Bjelke-Petersen on her maiden speech in this chamber tonight. It was a well delivered and thought-out speech. Senator Bjelke-Petersen once again put on record the role that Queensland plays in this Commonwealth. It is a role that I think the rest of the country is apt to forget every so often. We need a speech like that of Senator Bjelke-Petersen's to remind the rest of the people of the contribution that Queensland, which is the State which Senator Bjelke-Petersen and I represent, makes to this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the most important aspect of her speech was when she mentioned the motto 'Advance Australia'. She said that she is an Australian who happens to live in Queensland. I think that is a pretty important thing. We are all apt to be a bit parochial at times. I must confess that every so often I am not averse to giving a serve to New South Welshmen or Victorians. But we must remember that we rise or fall as Australians, and that is a pretty good thing for us always to remember. Do not let us take our parochialism too far. We are Australians first. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight I follow Senator Grimes, which is a new step for me. He mentioned the fact that he usually follows Senator Walters. Most of my contributions in this chamber are on the subject of transport and therefore I follow Senator Gietzelt. Senator Grimes and I do not usually talk on the same subjects. However, on this occasion we are considering the Government paper on the Review of Commonwealth Functions. Senator Grimes instanced the fact that he had just returned from a conference overseas. We are privileged at times to represent our country at international forums, whether it be the one that Senator Grimes has just attended, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, or the Inter-Parliamentary Union. We are privileged to attend those forums and to represent Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that I have learned from undertaking similar trips is what a great country Australia is to live in. It is a great country. There is no other country in which I should like to live permanently. Even though we live here, we have constantly to stop and take stock of our situation and to see whether we can improve things. I believe that the Commonwealth Government in this Review of Commonwealth Functions or, as it has become affectionately known, the report of the razor gang, has done just that. It has stopped and taken stock of its situation. It has stopped to take a look at itself and started to review its activities to see whether it should continue in a certain vein or whether improvements should be made. It has looked to see whether some jobs that it is doing can be done better by other sections of the community. Of course we must never forget the fact that we are but stewards of the taxpayers' money. We just handle it. It is a tremendous responsibility to see that we handle that money as best we can, that we exercise stewardship and that we get the best results from it. By getting the best results we will ultimately require less from the taxpayers to fund the various projects and organisations that a Commonwealth government finds itself having to fund. We would be abrogating our responsibilities if we did not do so. This is the first instance in my memory in which such a review has been undertaken, but I hope it is not the last one. I hope it will be an on-going thing and that we will continue to stop and take stock of our situation and recognise our stewardship. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite obvious that projects that may have been started in the Commonwealth sphere can now be abandoned. They may be done better by the States or by private enterprise. If that is the situation, let us handle it properly and move those functions into whatever sphere is required to see that the taxpayers' money is used most wisely. That means that we need less government control. It is not the Government's role to dabble its fingers in every aspect of the life of the citizens of this great country. The Government is there to provide good government, and that is all. If there is not a requirement for it to be in a certain situation or to do a certain job that it has done in the past, then let it get out. Many advisory committees have been set up in the past, and many advisory committees will be set up in the future. But once their function is concluded, let us disband them. Let us not, as has happened in the past when they have completed their functions, let them look around and find something else to do. In the meantime other advisory committees are set up. They multiply. When these committees have finished their functions, let us say: 'Thank you very much; you have done your job; you are now disbanded'. We must do that so that we do not have a proliferation of committees. </PARA>
<PARA> Some measures have been taken in the Australian Capital Territory which I must confess I am not really up with. One thing I am surprised that the Government did not do-this is always a cause of concern to many of us-is look at selling the Australian Capital Territory bus service. I do not begrudge the citizens of the Capital Territory a bus service. On the contrary, I am all in favour of efficient bus services. That is the most efficient way of using fuel and energy. But I think some other section of the community could run the service more efficiently, particularly when we look at the burgeoning losses. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="C67">Senator COLLARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe they do get run down. Maybe they get run down because we do not give enough assistance. We pour millions of dollars into the public sector for buses. The same applies to the rail transport sector. I have no quarrel with that. But if a private bus service is doing a good job it should be allowed to continue. In Brisbane, my State capital, private bus services which were making money have been taken over; they are now losing money. If there is a requirement for the bus service to be continued under private ownership, let the Government provide a subsidy instead of allowing it to continue as a local government or State function and pour money into an almost bottomless pit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have no quarrel with the reduction in the Public Service. One thing does worry me, as indeed it worried me when the cut-back in funds to the Australian Broadcasting Commission was first mentioned some considerable time ago. I think the Government should have more control over the reduction of the numbers of public servants. I do not think we are really cutting out the fat. All we are doing is saying to the heads of the departments: 'This is your staff ceiling' and leaving it to them. I think that every head of every department is a little empire builder and somehow or other he is managing not to get rid of the fat. He is probably cutting out the lower echelons, and it is usually the lower echelons in the Public Service who are providing service to the community and manning the counters and meeting the public face to face. That part of the Public Service appears to be suffering most. I think that the Commonwealth Government ought to pay more attention to this matter and make sure that the services are provided. Maybe it should look more intently at the fat that is usually evident in the middle echelon so that services are maintained at the same time as staff ceilings are reduced, thus not putting such a burden on the taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> I will mention but a few of the things-I will certainly not go through the whole list- that the Government said it wants to look at. Firstly, it wants a public inquiry into Telecom Australia. I do not see this, and never have done, as a chance to bash Telecom. Indeed, on many occasions I have gone in to bat for it. I admit that it is having problems. Anybody who has to provide a communications service in a country such as Australia which has its population situated where it is and who tries to provide it to those who need it most will have lots of trouble. Telecom, like the Government, is a massive organisation. It has done well. It has probably done more than any other private enterprise to reduce charges over recent years and at the same time it has increased the number of connections that it is providing. In certain areas the population is growing in excess of what Telecom has budgeted for and it is already having problems with its equipment not being able to handle the loads. So I welcome an inquiry into Telecom. That will enable it to stop and take stock of the situation. It does not have to be a witch hunt or anything like that. But Telecom should stop and look at itself. It should critically survey the situation and see whether its money can be better spent; see whether there can be a better deployment of staff so that we can provide the necessary communications service for the vast distances in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area which has been subject to review is education. Nobody would doubt at any time that governments, both State and Federal, are responsible to provide education. I believe that we are accepting that responsibility. But ultimately those within the education system must remember who pays the Bill. Undoubtedly there are benefits for society if all people are educated, but it is hard to pinpoint the benefits for taxpayers of educating the people who are termed professional students or the bored housewives who just want to get another degree. I have no quarrel with their doing that; that is their business. But I do not believe that it is the taxpayers' responsibility to fund the education of those people. We have a responsibility to fund the education of people who use that education to make their way in life, but the professional students or the bored housewives seeking to update their previous qualifications should foot the bill for their education. Let the taxpayers be responsible for those who will contribute to society. I would encourage the others to further their education but let them pay their fees. </PARA>
<PARA> Above all, we must assure students, some of whom are quite concerned at this stage, that it is not our desire to prevent young people from receiving a tertiary education if they desire to make their way in this world. We have not said otherwise. We have said of necessity at times that there will be a tightening up in the allowances paid to them. However, there has been some misunderstanding regarding persons studying for a second degree. If a second degree is required for a person's professional status it will be regarded as part of the deal and they will not be charged tertiary fees. We have also mentioned the loans scheme. That is not a bad idea for the young people who want to go further and who do not meet certain requirements. At least they will be able to do that and then pay back to the society what they have taken from it for their education. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look briefly at health matters. Dr Glen Sheil, a former senator, used to say that the use of anything that is free at the point of demand usually rises astronomically. That is particularly so in the case of health matters. Over a period we have forgotten that the body has its own recuperative powers. Once we would take an aspirin and go to bed or work, but it seems that when a visit to a doctor is free it is a good excuse to go there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just about to refer you to a report about taking aspros.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sentor COLLARD-I wish that Senator Georges had taken a few aspros or liver salts over the last couple of days. This place might have been a bit better off if he had. Let us examine health expenditure from 1972 until this point in time. I have the full figures but maybe the percentages will suffice. From 1972-73 to 1973-74 there was an increase of 20 per cent in the expenditure. We were not in government at that time. The Australian Labor Party was in government and it was building up towards Medibank. From 1973-74 to 1974-75 we saw an increse in health expenditure of 37.3 per cent. From 1974-75 to 1975-76 there was an increase of 35.3 per cent. In 1975 we came back to power and from 1975-76 to 1976-77 the increase in health costs was down to 14.9 per cent. The next year it was down to 13.2 per cent. In 1978-79 the increase in expenditure was only 9.3 per cent. There is no doubt that when somebody else picks up the tab it is very easy to use or misuse the system. We firmly believe that a user who can afford to pay should pay. We have stipulated from the beginning that those who cannot afford to pay for themselves will be looked after by the Government. That has been spelt out in the Government's statement. Those who cannot afford to pay certainly will not want for good health treatment, but those who can afford will have to pay their bit towards maintaining their section of the health scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is because it has a very good private hospital system which has kept everyone honest. But we have to ensure that Queensland, because of its past efficiencies, is not disadvantaged; that its relativities are maintained. That is something that my colleagues and I from Queensland will be watching very closely in regard to the split-up. As far as the free hospital scheme goes, the Commonwealth Government is saying straight out to the Queensland Government or any other government: 'You can do what you like. It is your business'. I go along with that. If Queensland, New South Wales or Western Australia wants to maintain or introduce a free health scheme, so be it. I see my role here as making sure that, because of Queensland's efficiencies in the past, its relativities are maintained, that it is not disadvantaged because of those efficiencies and that it gets an equal share of the cake in the split up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has also initiated a few changes in the transport field. One that comes to mind is the deregulation of the Australian National Railways to allow it to operate on a competitive basis. About two years ago the Government said to ANR that it hoped that in 10 years' time its revenue would exceed its expenditure. It is a credit to ANR and all its staff that they are going a long way towards achieving that objective. I think it is an example of another situation in which the Government should suggest to the States that they also should stop and take stock. Last year the railway systems in Australia lost $1,000m. In other words, $1 billion of taxpayers' money cannot be accounted for except in respect of the activities of the ANR. It is time that the States also stopped and had a look at the running of their services because that is one heck of a lot of money. I have no quarrel about subsidies being provided for railway services provided they are run efficiently and they are not used in competition with other modes of transport that are competing commercially. The railways deficit is a lot of taxpayers' money. I congratulate the ANR and the staff on what they have achieved up to this point. I hope they can keep up that sort of work. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the departmental oversight of Qantas is concerned, I can only welcome the fact that the Department of Transport is getting out of that area. Last financial year Qantas lost about $20m. About $15m of that can be attributed to the Department of the Treasury insisting on how or where Qantas borrowed its money. Qantas got caught in the revaluation of certain currencies. If Treasury keeps its hands off Qantas and lets Qantas make its own commercial judgment in that sphere it can only be to the betterment of the travelling public. Also, if the Department of Transport keeps its hands further away from Qantas the airline might be better off. I understand that the Government is to allow Qantas to make its own tariff arrangements. Having spoken with some of the officials of Qantas I understand that they do not want a minimum fare set by any government. All they want is a maximum fare and capacity arrangements. They maintain that Qantas can quite easily compete with other international airlines which fly into and out of Australia. I would like to see Qantas given a free hand so that it can make its own commercial judgment and set its own fares to enable our flag carrier to compete not only around the world but in and out of Australia, which it is finding very hard to do with the heavy hand of the Department of Transport resting on it. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to airports, maybe if the domestic and international airlines had more say in the running of our terminals we would not have some of the big monoliths that have been built, albeit with the best of intentions and at great cost which is recouped through air navigation charges. If the domestic airlines are able to build their own terminals maybe we will have something that is a bit more efficient in the long run and certainly more cost effective and with fewer charges coming back to the fare-paying public. As far as the local ownership plan is concerned, I know that many local government authorities find it hard to come to grips with this plan, but once again, provided the Commonwealth Government is prepared to assist them with maintenance, I understand that-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator has heard my statements in this place many times in relation to Trans-Australia Airlines. It does not actually come up in this debate. I think many local government authorities should look seriously at taking up this Government's offer on local ownership because certainly a government which owns an airfield and administers it from Canberra, albeit through State capitals, is only interested in running the airport, whereas if local government took over an airport it could certainly make it into an entree to that area. It could use it as the tourist entrance and do something about it, which certainly will not be done as long as it is owned and administered by the Federal Government from a great distance. I welcome the proposal that the Government will assist local authorities with maintenance but the local bodies should take over the airports and make something of them. As I said, they could make them into a good tourist entrance to their area. One such airport is Mackay, which is the entrance to the Whitsunday area and the Great Barrier Reef. It is generally recognised that most of the tourists who come into resorts fly in. Any local government that gets hold of an airport can certainly make something of it. I know that people in Cairns are trying to do something. They are now welcoming international passengers who are coming to Cairns from Port Moresby by Air Niugini. I know these people are looking at ways in which they can take over the airport. I welcome the fact that businessmen, the community and local government authorities have the initiative to want to take over these airports, to make something of them and to use them for the benefit of the tourist trade in their area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It certainly gives me a lot of pleasure to support the Government in this initiative. As I said at the outset, I think governments, not only our Government but also State governments, should all the time stop and take stock of the situation. We are but stewards of the taxpayers, money. We have to make sure that that money is spent wisely and that the taxpayer is getting good value for his money. I believe that is what the Government is trying to do now. We get continual calls for a reduction in taxes, and I guess that is natural. If some other section in the community can do something more efficiently, well let it and let us use the taxpayers, money as efficiently as we can and ultimately take the least possible tax off them. I support the Government in these initiatives. </PARA>

<PARA>The reason I seek the suspension of the Standing Orders-this is dealt with in Standing Order 448-is that this is a matter of urgent necessity in relation to the conduct of the business of this nation by the Government. The Premiers Conference ended late on Monday evening. The Premiers had been told that they could have a 9 per cent increase in tax reimbursements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These matters to which I refer go to the question of urgent necessity referred to in Standing Order 448. The Premiers were told that they could have a 9 per cent increase in tax reimbursements. They fought for hours against an offer of 8 per cent from the Treasurer, Mr Howard, and the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser. At 11 o'clock that night, after the Premiers had gone home, in an off-the-record briefing, Mr Howard, the Treasurer, told the Press a number of things. At that briefing Treasurer Howard said that if the States had been more resolute and determined they could have had an extra one per cent of tax reimbursements. This means that the Premiers could have had an extra $70m which was lost to the States. For example, that would have given New South Wales another $19m.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am not seeking to debate the other points. It is a matter of urgent necessity because the Government has misled the people of Australia and the Premiers of the States over this matter and has sought to conceal that fact. That is a matter of urgency. At the Press conference, the background briefing, the Prime Minister boasted that, before the Premiers met, Cabinet had decided that the States could get one per cent more than they actually got and that they were weak in not pursuing that extra one per cent. When that story appeared in late editions of the newspapers to which I referred this morning, the Australian Broadcasting Commission asked the Prime Minister for an interview. In the meantime, Premier Wran had made a statement that Mr Fraser's actions at the Premiers Conference were directed at giving a tax cut before the next elections. The Australian Broadcasting Commission and the commercial television stations asked Mr Fraser about the leaked story of the Commonwealth retaining the one per cent. The newspapers attributed the story to a senior Government official. The Prime Minister became very angry, as the ABC television news showed. He refused to answer questions on this matter. The reason he became angry was that he was the senior Government official referred to in the newspapers.

I want to discuss a number of issues which were dealt with in part in a debate last week, which have been dealt with in this chamber over some time and which in a sense reached a climax on 15 April 1981 when a senior Minister in the Fraser Government wrote the following letter to the Prime Minister:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hereby tender my resignation from your Cabinet. This decision is irrevocable. </PARA>

<PARA>In a later paragraph, the Minister went on:</PARA>
<PARA> It should not be thought that acts of recent days alone have forced me into this position. I believe you have cast aside the stability and sense of direction of the Government. Indeed you have a dangerous reluctance to consult Cabinet and an obstinate determination to get your own way. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on that the decision was irrevocable. In a subsequent statement to this Parliament the former Minister for Industrial Relations made a number of statements about the conduct of the Prime Minister. Earlier tonight in a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders pursuant to Standing Order 448, I sought to establish in connection with another matter that there was urgent necessity in relation to the need for that motion to be discussed. In the course of establishing urgent necessity, as I saw it, I was interrupted on a number of occasions, if I may say so with respect, Mr President, by your saying: 'You must not debate the merits of the matter, you must not debate the issue, you must not deal with the subtance, you can address your remarks only to the points of urgent necessity'. On four occasions I acceded to your ruling and directed my remarks to points of urgent necessity, in the words of Standing Order 448, rather than to the substance of the matter which I wanted to debate at a subsequent stage, if my motion had been carried. Now that the motion for the adjournment of the Senate has been put, I want to make some remarks about the substance of the matter which would have been discussed if my motion had been carried.

It is well known that prior to the recent Premiers Conference the Prime Minister made a number of macho statements about the tough line the Government would take with the Premiers when they came to Canberra. That is very interesting, but tonight on television I heard the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in the Fraser Government saying that he made a number of remarks to the Press subsequent to that Premiers Conference because the Government had said things which it did not mean-they were the Treasurer's words-in relation to the Premiers Conference which was coming up and which was finally held last Monday.

When Senator Button was speaking to the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders, Senator Peter Baume on a couple of occasions took a point of order and asked you, Mr President, to request Senator Button to confine his remarks to the reasons why Standing Orders should be suspended. You did so. Senator Button continued. You did not stop him continuing. You therefore agreed that he was confining his remarks to the reasons for the suspension of Standing Orders. We are now on the adjournment debate. The only motion before the Chair before the adjournment debate was the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. Senator Button is now speaking to a substantial matter which involves this country and which involves a State Premier of the same party as the Prime Minister and the Treasurer calling for the resignation of the Treasurer. In no way can Senator Button be said to be bringing up matters which he had brought up just before the adjournment debate. To try to stop him from debating this matter is a perversion of the functions of this chamber. If we are to proceed in this way we will be limiting discussion of important issues on the adjournment debate in future, which I suggest will be a perversion of Standing Orders. Mr President, I suggest that you must allow Senator Button to continue with the substantive issue that he is talking about.</PARA></TALK.START>

I admire Senator Button's legal approach. I am not a legal man myself. I want to see things done correctly in this place. All I am saying is that Senator Button should not revive matters raised in a previous debate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I say by way of explanation that I did not in any way seek to pursue any legal point as a result of my misfortune in having had legal training. What I was seeking to say, with respect, Mr President, was that you in the chair as a Government senator cannot have it both ways. You cannot stop me speaking about the substance of an issue when I move a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders and then subsequently say that again I cannot speak about the substance of an issue which I did not speak about on the first occassion. With respect, that is the point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I am seeking to do is to establish a number of facts first and then I will be seeking to pursue an argument in relation to those facts. I refer to the facts again. It is not, with respect, a question of identifying subject matters and then saying that they are the same things as were dealt with in the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. I made the point that after the Premiers Conference, at 11 p.m., after the Premiers had gone home, in an off the record briefing with the Press, a favourite Fraser Government ministerial device, the Treasurer, Mr Howard, said that if the States had been more resolute they would have received an extra one per cent. By that he meant they would have received an extra $70m which was lost to them as a result of the failure of the present Government to be frank with them about the money which was available. The State of New South Wales would have received an extra $19m. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night Malcolm Fraser, the Prime Minister of this country, saw journalists from the Herald and Weekly Times group of newspapers-the Sun-Pictorial, the Sydney Morning Herald, the West Australian and the Courier-Mail. In the course of that interview the Prime Minister boasted that the Cabinet-the Cabinet of Dr Caligari, as it might be called, rather than the Cabinet of Malcolm Fraser, before the Premiers had even met, had decided that the States could get one per cent more than he and the Treasurer in fact gave them. That was decided by Cabinet beforehand. </PARA>
<PARA> That story, needless to say, was published in editions of those newspapers arising from a background briefing. Ministers of this Government do not hold frank and open Press conferences anymore, at least until tonight. The Prime Minister does not hold frank and open Press conferences. He has his curbside chats in the mornings, but does not subject himself to questioning, other than Dorothy Dix questions, by journalists. In this background briefing that boast was made by the Prime Minister and it was published in the newspapers. This morning the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the national broadcasting service of this country, asked for an interview with the Prime Minister. In the meantime the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Wran, had made a statement saying that the action of the Prime Minister at the Premiers Conference was directed at giving a tax cut by the Federal Government before the next election. Mr Wran bought into the argument to that extent. </PARA>
<PARA> Next in the sequence of events, the ABC and the commercial television stations asked the Prime Minister about the leaked story of the Commonwealth retaining the one per cent-the $70m-which should have gone to the Premiers of the States. The newspaper stories attributed the leak to a senior Government official. The Prime Minister got very angry when he was asked questions about that. Anybody who saw him on the ABC television news tonight could see that he got very angry. There was all that stuff spoken in eighteenth century English meaning: 'If you want to ask me questions you have to tell me precisely what the questions are before I will even see you so that I can get an answer'. He refused to answer questions of which he had not been given prior notice. This is the macho Prime Minister of Australia who outbid, defeated and deceived the Premiers in respect of the money which was available to them. The reason why he got angry was that he was the senior Government official described in the Press. Mr Fraser, the Prime Minister, has become-now you see him, now you do not-a senior Government official. That was his pseudonym, his nom de plume for those stories which were leaked in the Press. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, Sir Charles Court, who also reads the newspapers, saw the reports about the States being cheated of an extra one per cent and promptly called for Treasurer Howard's resignation. Howard was later interviewed on the PM program. He was asked whether Fraser was the source of the story and the senior Government official, so described. He was asked about Premier Court's comments. Howard refused to deny that the Prime Minister of Australia was masquerading as a senior Government official. Howard, the Treasurer of Australia, refused to deny that the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, was the source of these leaked stories to the Press. </PARA>
<PARA> Those Government senators who have a vivid command of events in their own party will remember that it is only 14 days since the Prime Minister was accused by a former senior Minister of leaking stories to the Press about him. On this occasion he leaked stories to the Press about how he had outsmarted the Premiers of the six States of Australia. He leaked those stories under the guise of being a senior Government official. Mr Howard refused to say anything about Premier Court's call for his resignation. He waffled about that issue. Mr Howard later tried to get the ABC AM producer in Sydney to stop that interview going to air. Mr David Barnett, a person of some notoriety-if I might say that without putting it too highly-went to the ABC office in the Press Gallery three times and tried to stand over the chief of staff of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the national broadcasting service, to get him to kill the story of the interview with Fraser. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am absolutely sure of that. Mr Barnett did that because the Prime Minister was very embarrassed that he had been caught. Mr Howard, the Treasurer of Australia, looks after our money and saves us $70m by cheating the six State Premiers. We had a debate in the Senate about whether the expression 'having one's fingers in the till' is a legitimate charge to make against this Government. The man who looks after our money, Mr Howard, has his fingers in the till all the time. That is his job. He looks after our money and he saved us $70m by keeping it from the State Premiers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At a Press conference this evening Mr Howard said, in essence: 'Look, I started all this. It was my fault. I leaked this information to the Press. You really ought to ask the Prime Minister a few questions too. You really ought to ask him a few questions about stories which were leaked to the Press.' That was the essence of what Mr Howard said on television tonight. An earlier Press conference of the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, was also shown on television, and what he was trying to say was almost unintelligible. Treasurer Howard's statement on television tonight was a tragic thing. It is tragic to see a Minister in a government debasing himself publicly in this way. Some honourable senators will have read that great novel of Arthur Koestler entitled Darkness at Noon. Mr Howard was saying: 'Yes, it was my fault but the party must go on. It was my fault'. It was a case of darkness at noon for Mr Howard; darkness at noon for yet another Minister in the Fraser Government.

That is what happened to Malcolm Fraser tonight. There was nothing tough about him tonight. He got going, abandoned his Treasurer and left him hanging on a limb. He did exactly the same thing for his Treasurer as he did for Andrew Peacock three weeks ago. That is a crisis of government in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Government in the Senate should come into the chamber as soon as possible-he is here now and has the opportunity to do so-to explain the situation to this House of Parliament and not do what was done in the House of Representatives, namely, seek to stop people speaking about this issue. This matter was dealt with on a special edition of Nationwide tonight. It will be in every newspaper in Australia tomorrow. But members of the House of Representatives cannot discuss this matter because the Liberal Government will not face up to it. It was scared to discuss this matter tonight and it gagged two senior Labor members in the House of Representatives to prevent them from raising this issue. The Leader of the Government in the Senate should explain what the Prime Minister of this country is really up to. That is what people throughout this country will be concerned to know tomorrow. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The State and Territory Family Planning Associations receive two forms of grant from the Department of Health-a health program grant, which is directed towards assisting the clinical activities of the Associations, and a family planning program grant which is directed towards assisting education, information and training programs, that is, non-clinical activities.</PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the Commonwealth Government's budget strategy of continuing financial restraint and no growth in health services, it has been possible to increase the amount provided under both the family planning program and health program grant arrangements to enable broadly the continuation of existing levels of activities during 1980-81.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the family planning program, the 1980-81 level of grants reflected a minimum increase of 4 per cent over the 1979-80 grants. Approved health program grant budgets for 1980-81 provide for inflation factors of 8 per cent for salaries and wages and 9 per cent for all other items or such other amounts as are warranted to maintain activities at 1979-80 levels.</PARA>
<PARA> On this basis, and against the inescapable restraints imposed by the budget situation, there has been no crisis in funding for Family Planning Associations which could result in the closure of services previously funded during 1979-80.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be appreciated that while the Government has continued to make as large a contribution as possible to family planning activities, it has always been made clear to the Associations that there was no unlimited undertaking to underwrite those activities.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) The payment of interim family planning program grants in August and October 1980 enabled maintenance of the existing activities that attract this form of grant for all the Family Planning Associations during the first six months of 1980-81. The Family Planning Association of Tasmania was advised on 23 December 1980 of its total family planning program grant of $20,000 for 1980-81.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department delayed making recommendations to me concerning total family planning program grants for 1980-81 because of complications relating to the financial administration of two of the organisations funded under the program and the likelihood that resolution of these matters would enable grant increases to other organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> Health program grant funds are paid on a monthly basis with interim grants being made in the case of any delay in determining the appropriate level of grants for individual Associations. Associations are therefore assured of funds to the level of the approved budget being forthcoming each month under these arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> However, some problems in relation to the health program grant for the Tasmanian Family Planning Association did occur as a result of budget estimating problems on the part of the Association (approved health programs grants are based on budgets submitted by each Association). Upon my Department becoming aware of this problem further health program grant funds were quickly provided, on an interim basis, and the Association was requested to review its budget. I understand that some problem did arise in the meantime as to payment of salary of one staff member.</PARA>
<PARA> Health program grant allocations for 1980-81 for the various Associations have been determined and advised to the Associations but are, in some cases, being reviewed in the light of requests for additional funds.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) A triennial system of funding is not possible as the family planning program and the health program grant arrangements, like other health funding programs, are based on the annual appropriation of funds in the Commonwealth Budget. Consequently, annual approval is necessary for grants made under the program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Capital Territory, upon notice, on 25 March 1981:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) What was the cost in materials and labour of the 'Australian Capital Territory' signs and accompanying structures built on the Barton Highway near Hall, the Federal Highway, and on the Monaro Highway.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) What would have been the approximate cost if more traditional signs had been placed there.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) How is the building of such signs justified in view of the Government's 1975 election commitment to 'eliminate wasteful extravagance'.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1715" SPEAKER="Messner Sen The Hon A.J." NAMEID="9I4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="VIC">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator Messner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Capital Territory has provided me with the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised by the National Capital Development Commission that:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The construction of the border signs formed part of a larger lump sum contract and therefore it is not possible to separately identify the cost of the signs and accompanying structures.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In October 1975, the National Health and Medical Research Council recommended for adoption by the States, standards relating to radiation emission from television receivers. The Standards Association of Australia also has a standard on 'Electronic Sound and Vision Equipment' which gives the same radiation emission limits. This would apply to television receivers, visual display units, poker machines and other games using television tubes. The methods of testing recommended by each document differ slightly. Each State decides whether to include recommended standards in its legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> However, tests made on television receives show that radiation near the prescribed limits can only be detected under extreme fault conditions, (when viewable pictures are not sustained for any length of time). Tests on over 100 different models of visual display units show no measurable levels of radiation and accordingly are well within the standards set. Tests have not been carried out on poker machines and other television games, but as they use television tubes, their radiation levels should be no greater than from television receivers and visual display units.</PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria and New South Wales at least, each model of television receiver is monitored by electrical authorities before marketing. Local manufacturers and assemblers also do their own monitoring.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Doses received by television viewers are extremely low. Estimates made in the United Kingdom are that the annual per caput dose equivalent from colour television is 0.002 microsievert. This is one two millionth part of the radiation received normally from natural background radiation.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There have been no reported cases of children having been affected by radiation emission from television receivers. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, high emission rates were reported from the bases of some colour television receivers in the United States of America. These were caused by the rectifying valves used. Nowadays these have been replaced by solid state circuitry and such radiation emission is not possible with this.</PARA>

<PARA> I refer the Minister to the fact that in 1977 the then Minister for Post and Telecommunications, Mr Robinson, asserted in the House of Representatives the importance of a broadcasting system 'not subject to political interference' and that the same assertion was made in this House by Senator Carrick as the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications in this House. Can the Minister assure the Senate that proposed amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act will not increase the possibility of political supervision or interference with broadcasting either by way of ministerial usurpation of Australian Broadcasting Tribunal functions or by providing a way in which the Minister can alter the criteria upon which the Tribunal makes a determination in the 'public interest'?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; On 12 March 1981 (Hansard, page 566) Senator Elstob asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the following question, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Telecom Australia intends to introduce a fee of $10 for subscribers with silent numbers; that is, numbers not listed in telephone directories. Will the Minister intervene in this proposal especially on behalf of people such as members of the police force, women living alone, the legal profession, and others who may be victims of nuisance calls and who now will be punished by Telecom as well? Would it not be possible to publish in the directories the name of the subscriber, with the word 'unlisted' instead of the telephone number for persons wishing to retain a private number? Surely this scheme would save the telephone operators valuable searching time.</PARA>
<PARA> -The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised by Telecom that in line with telecommunications authorities world-wide, it is standard practice to encourage telephone subscribers to include their name, address and telephone number in the relevant telephone directory so that other people in the community who wish to contact them have at their disposal information with which to do so. Nevertheless, it is recognised that some subscribers, for privacy or other reasons, prefer that their name, address and number details not be listed. Telecom has informed me that it readily accepts such reasons and provides for silent line treatment but only after warning the applicant of the inconvenience and distress which can be occasioned to callers who genuinely desire the number in an emergency. In the case of severe nuisance calls, there are a number of services which Telecom will continue to provide without charge to assist in dealing with this problem.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom indicated however that, contrary to what might generally be thought to be the case, silent line services actually increase rather than decrease its overall operating costs. Whilst there are minor savings in directory publication costs, considerable added expense is incurred in handling Directory Assistance enquiries generated as a result of subscribers not having a listing in the appropriate telephone directory. These enquiries generally take longer to handle because of the need to explain to the enquirer why no information can be provided even in cases of emergency.</PARA>
<PARA> In recent years an increasing number of customers have chosen to have an unlisted service and Telecom advises that it considers the stage has been reached where it is no longer fair and reasonable to expect subscribers generally to meet the consequential costs involved. It has been assessed that, for the year 1979-80, silent lines generated some 1.68 million calls to Directory Assistance at a cost to Telecom of about $1.12 million. Telecom has therefore decided to introduce an annual charge of $10 for silent line services, to be applied from the publication date in respect of all telephone directories issued after 1 July 1981. The fee of $10 compares favourably with those charged in other countries, eg. the Bell System in the USA at $US18 per annum, or the New Zealand charge of $NZ15 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom has acknowledged that in certain circumstances, eg, in the case of some people in particular occupational groups, the silent line service may be considered a necessity. However, it is of the view that with services of this nature those subscribers who require them and benefit from their provision should make some contribution towards the costs incurred.</PARA>
<PARA> Concerning the possibility of publishing in the directories the name of the subscriber with the word 'unlisted' instead of the telephone number for a person wishing to have a silent line, this proposal is currently under consideration by Telecom following prior receipt of the same suggestion from another source. Telecom is researching the acceptability to silent line customers of this option, its likely effectiveness in reducing costs incurred through Directory Assistance and any problems there might be in implementing the suggestion. Telecom indicated that it will be some months before a decision is reached on the matter and, in the meantime, the charge of $10 per annum will be applied.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 8 April Senator Mason (Hansard, page 1209) asked me a question, without notice, concerning the management of radio-active materials in Australia. I undertook to check on arrangements for registration and cost recovery, and provide the following answer:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The importation of radioactive materials is subject to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations Act and requires the approval of the Australian Radiation Laboratory (ARL) if the material is for medical use, or the Australian Atomic Energy Commission (AAEC) for other uses.</PARA>
<PARA> Where the material is licensable under State legislation approvals to import are subject to possession of a State licence. Records of imported material are maintained by AAEC and ARL. In addition, the Commonwealth Air Navigation and Navigation Acts provide control over all the air transport of radionuclides, and international and interstate sea transport.</PARA>
<PARA> Control of radioactive materials within Australia is primarily a matter for States and Territory governments. The possession of radioactive materials is subject to their legislation either through specific Radiation Acts or through Regulations under Health Acts.</PARA>
<PARA> All States and the Northern Territory require institutions and/or individuals to be licensed, although materials below specified minimum activity levels may be exempted. Their legislation also covers labelling of containers of radioactive materials, and transport and disposal of radioactive materials. In the ACT, the Capital Territory Health Commission monitors the use of radioactive materials and a Radiation Ordinance is currently in preparation.</PARA>
<PARA> Co-ordination is achieved nationally through a number of expert groups:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) The National Health and Medical Research Council (NH &amp; MRC) has a long established Radiation Health Committee to assess and review the levels of exposure of the public from radioactive substances and irradiating apparatus, and to recommend appropriate procedures for minimising such exposure, including the development of uniform codes of practice. For example, the code of practice on industrial gauges is currently being updated by the Committee. NH &amp; MRC periodically makes recommendations to Governments on appropriate procedures to assist them in their implementation of their legislation relating to radioactive substances and irradiation.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Codes of practice are being developed by the Commonwealth under the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act in consultation with the States and the Northern Territory. A proposed code on transport of radioactive material has been forwarded to Ministers by the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, and has been made available for public comment. It is intended that the code be adopted under State and Commonwealth law as appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) In September 1979 the then Minister for National Development announced that the Commonwealth Government would be seeking the co-operation of State and Territory Governments in developing co-ordinated policies on the management of radioactive wastes arising from medical, research and industrial use of radionuclides. All are co-operating and the matter is under active consideration by officials.</PARA>
<PARA>Most of the imported radioactive materials and radioisotopes produced by AAEC are used in medical, research and industrial applications and not by the nuclear industry. As the possession of radioactive materials is subject to licences, which make provisions for fees, the mechanism exists for making users of radioactive substances pay for the cost of regulation.</PARA>
