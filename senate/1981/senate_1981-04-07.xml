<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the adjournment debate on Thursday, 2 April, Senator Tate sought assurances from me that Parliament House was safe for those who work in it, following allegations made that day in the media of the detection of legionella in the air conditioning water towers of Parliament House. At the first opportunity I had on Friday morning I advised Senator Tate's office in the terms of the statement made in the House of Representatives by Mr Speaker on Thursday night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now inform honourable senators that testing of air conditioning units in this House has been regularly carried out since July 1980 and has included checks on the filters of the fresh air intakes, the quality of conditioned air in certain areas and the water heating and cooling systems. Reports received from the Department of Health, which has consulted with the National Biological Standards Laboratory and the Fairfield Infectious Diseases Hospital, raised no problems with the air conditioning system until the report received by the Joint House Department on 28 February 1981. That report revealed that a water sample from the stand-by water cooling tower within the Prime Minister's suite had disclosed organisms of legionella pneumophilia. Those organisms were contained in that water cooling tower which is confined to and operates only as a stand-by system in the Prime Minister's suite. The water contained in that stand-by system is not connected with the chilled water provided from the main water cooling tower which services most of the Parliament House building.</PARA>
<PARA> Consultations between the Joint House Department and the Department of Health resulted in immediate remedial action being taken by the addition of chemicals with a capacity to destroy the bacteria discovered. Tests were also carried out on the main water cooling tower from 16 December 1980 to 19 February this year, and these proved negative. However, a water sample taken from that tower on 28 February 1981 disclosed a strain of legionella pneumophilia. That information was reported by the Department of Health to the Joint House Department on Friday, 3 April 1981-last Friday. Remedial action based on the advice of the Department of Health was taken immediately and consisted of the addition of chemicals to the main water cooling tower similar to those applied to the Prime Minister's stand-by water cooling tower. The Department of Health has advised that the monthly chemical treatment of water in all cooling towers should be increased to fortnightly frequencies, and that action has now been implemented.</PARA>
<PARA> I further inform this House that the Department of Health, in conjunction with the Joint House Department, issued a public statement on Friday last. That release is available for honourable senators but I will quote the substantive part relating to the safety of Parliament House:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no evidence to suggest that conditions in the air-conditioning system at Parliament House made the House unsafe for members, senators, staff or visitors, from the standpoint of infection.</PARA>
<PARA> Air samples tested in Parliament House had not shown serious pathogenic organisms. Legionella pneumophilia had been found only in two isolated specimens from two air-conditioning cooling towers. The organisms were not being circulated by the air-conditioners in Parliament House and so no more danger existed there than in any other building, or to the community at large.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the interest and safety of honourable senators, members of the House of Representatives, parliamentary staff and visitors to Parliament House have been the prime concern of those responsible for the tests that have taken place. I can assure honourable senators that the testing schedule on the air conditioning system will be maintained and I will make a further report to this chamber if there is any significant change in circumstances.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Thursday night, 2 April 1981, I made a statement about accommodation for the Parliamentary Library in response to a question which Senator McAuliffe had asked me earlier in the day. I have thought since that, although Senator McAuliffe did not explicitly ask for it, he may have been seeking clarification about some transfers to the Kurrajong annex during the last summer recess. As reported to the Library Committee on 5 March this year, extenuating circumstances arose as a result of extreme heat earlier this year which prompted Mr Speaker and me to agree that conditions would be better in the Kurrajong than the Canberra Hotel annex for the statistics group of the Legislative Research Service and its special equipment, some elements of the systems and co-ordination unit and the administration section of the Library. In addition to those 20 officers from the Canberra Hotel annex, five persons in the systems and co-ordination unit, who had only makeshift accommodation in Parliament House, were moved to join the rest of their unit in the Kurrajong annex. These transfers were prompted primarily by considerations of staff welfare and have been appreciated by the officers concerned. They certainly could not be described as 'major determinations on locations' and did not constitute a breach of an assurance given by me to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for National Development and Energy whether he said on 8 October last year that if Australia was to meet its energy balance within the decade we would need to have functioning by 1980 three or four enterprises of the size of the Rundle shale oil project. Did he say that output from Rundle could reach 240,000 barrels a day by 1988? What timetable does he now envisage for oil production from shale over the next 10 years?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1130" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Without being pedantic, I presume that Senator Button meant 1990 and not 1980 as he said. I do not say that in any sense of correction, but just to set the timetable. I think Senator Button has quoted faithfully from what I have said. Indeed, if Senator Button were to look at the progress of the various coal liquefaction undertakings which are emerging in the Latrobe Valley, the Rheinbraun project, the Mitsui-CSR project and the Cominic project, he would find that a series of hydrocarbon synthetic crude undertakings is starting to get into place and will aim to be in position by the 1990s and to supplement any decline that there may be in oil.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, I mentioned Rundle, along with other such projects. The fact is that one hopes strongly that oil shale will play a significant part, along with coal liquefaction and other methods, in supplying the hydrocarbon needs of Australia. I hope that all honourable senators will be wishing that Rundle and similar projects will succeed. It is immensely in the interests of all Australians that the synthetic crude projects should succeed in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> I cannot say what the timetable for Rundle will be. Yesterday's Press statement indicated that the joint venturers were now thinking of by-passing the pilot plant stage and going directly to a commercial plant. That may or may not do one of two things; it could, I understand, even expedite the coming on stream or it could delay it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer is to wait until the technical people say. Since there is a note of derision let me say that in the world at the moment some seven major oil shale projects are under way. Three of them have reached the construction stage. The technology to turn shale into oil is well known. The technology of the Exxon Corporation, the major technical partner in Rundle, is world acknowledged. I would hope that we would all encourage the success of all such projects.</PARA></TALK.START>

But perhaps because good news, at least to this side of the House, is attractive, let say that yesterday I was at the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association conference-the largest by 50 per cent in attendance and in calibre ever held in Australia, with some 950 registered delegates.

Mr President, you will remember that it was said that it would be 40c for a litre of petrol by January. Let me tell the Senate what APEA said. APEA yesterday said that the prospects for finding moderate supplies of oil and significant supplies of gas in Australia were never better. I was advised that indeed it is likely that, instead of there being a decline in Bass Strait production, extra finds of oil are likely there as indeed they are in central Australia and elsewhere. These finds will in fact help to iron out the indigenous oil supplies so that the pressure on us will not be so great in this decade as it was before.

<PARA> The fact of the matter is that shale may well be there in those kinds of quantities, but it becomes a valuable resource only when it is known that, within the capacity of our technology and within the cost structure that is available to us, it can be a useable resource. At this moment oil shale in Australia has yet to be proved to be a significant useable resource. This is why Rundle is such an imaginative and courageous undertaking-setting out, on a scale never undertaken before, to conduct this enterprise and hoping to do so in competition with the price of petrol. One cannot say that the existence of oil shale in the ground in Australia, with unknown difficulties in relation to its extraction, can be a guarantee that the world will be less oil hungry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Archer correctly advises the Senate in his question that there is no special aid provided for triplets. In fact, there is no additional assistance for twins. But it is normally the practice for act of grace payments to be made for quadruplets. Those payments are made not by the Department of Social Security but, I think, by the Department of Finance through the recent Minister for Social Security. I do take the point which is made by the honourable senator. Obviously there is a substantial additional cost in providing for multiple births.

Certainly, I believe that it was of great importance that the statement of reappraisal of the enterprise should be made. If that is reflected, however temporarily, in a decline in shares, that is what the share market should take. The fact is, as one will see from the records of my statements, that I have expressed over the months and the years a proper caution and, indeed, a cautious optimism about the development of shale and shale oil in Australia. I have never denied the fact that the project has its engineering and cost difficulties but I have wanted it to succeed, as I hope all decent Australians will want it to succeed. The technical partner in Rundle, the Exxon corporation, is world-renowned for its expertise and its integrity, both scientific and commercial. I believe that if anybody can make the project succeed, Exxon will do so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Attorney-General to the March 1981 edition of Justice, the newsletter of the International Commission of Jurists, Australian section, relating to the optional protocol to the draft convention against torture. The optional protocol will provide for nations to permit visits to places of detention within their jurisdiction by members of an international expert committee. Is it correct, as alleged in this article, that the Australian Government is opposed to the notion of an optional protocol being debated at this stage of the proceedings? If that is so, will the Attorney-General inform the Senate why the Australian Government has adopted that attitude? Does the Attorney-General agree with the claims of the International Commission of Jurists that the optional protocol provides some practical solutions to the problem of torture? If so, will consideration be given by the Government both to supporting debate on the optional protocol at the same time as the draft convention is considered and to supporting the merits of this course of action in discussion with other nations?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for National Development and Energy a question. It is not about Rundle. I refer him to the inquiry currently being undertaken by a working party of the Australian Institution of Engineers into the feasibility of constructing a four-State power grid to service Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania. Has the Minister noted the recent statement by the Premier of Victoria, Mr Hamer, that the grid proposal had the full support of the Victorian Government? Is the Minister aware that the Institution of Engineers working party has recommended the deferring of any plans for future hydro-electric power schemes in Tasmania, particularly the Franklin River, until a final decision on the grid has been made? Does the Minister recall the policy commitments made by the Liberal and National Country parties in 1975 to the preservation of the south-west Tasmanian wilderness area and the Prime Minister's statement last June that the Federal Government would be willing to help finance an enlarged south-west national park to include wilderness areas? In view of these promises, will the Government give its full moral and financial support to the grid proposal and treat it as a matter of the most urgent priority?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that Senator Chipp would know that the Government through me, as Minister, set up an inquiry under Sir David Zeidler, a very distinguished Australian, to find out the facts about a grid for south-east Australia, taking in South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales and, it is hoped-who knows-proceeding further north. In Europe and elsewhere there is plenty of information on the success of power grids. It is against that background that the inquiry is proceeding. It is an inquiry which, of course, links haves and have-nots. It links two States which have the accidental presence, which they are very happy about, of the Snowy Mountains scheme to provide, in a way, their own grid.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;South Australia and Tasmania lack that. As Senator McLaren will know, South Australia until this moment has lacked the natural resource to produce power. One hopes that the coal being found there will resolve that situation. One hopes that the supply of power in South Australia will be helped a lot. I have attended meetings of the inquiry and have urged it to strive for a successful result. I believe that this grid is a very sensible means of progress for Australia. Whether, in the first step, a cable under Bass Strait is feasible is something to be investigated; nevertheless, it is contemplated. I am aware of the submission by the Australian Institution of Engineers and its claims that the working of the grid would save in the capital and operating costs of power stations some hundreds of millions of dollars, even billions of dollars. I am aware it has given evidence as to base loads and peak loads. I have asked the Zeidler inquiry to study the submission in detail. I believe it is doing so. In my judgment the Zeidler inquiry is very significant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware of the statement made in 1975 by the Prime Minister on the south-west wilderness of Tasmania. I think that all Australians who know the place have a tremendous interest in it. I am utterly sure that the Prime Minister and the Government hold the same support. As to the general concept, it is absolutely imperative that we in Australia save electric power. The lead time to build a power station is something between seven years and 10 years and the cost today runs into something like $1 billion. If we can save the cost of building a couple of power stations we can build another couple of very large undertakings that can employ more people in Australia. So every time we can save we can advance. I commend the spirit of Senator Chipp's question.</PARA>

If the Minister cares to look at question 13 of the census form she will see that persons of other nationalities are not asked the same question.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I am interested to hear Senator Bonner's remarks in regard to the matter he has raised. Perhaps I should explain that the reason for adding to question 16 on the census form the explanatory text to which Senator Bonner has taken exception is the same as the reason for adding it to other questions; that is, that tests show that some explanation is needed for the question to be answered in a reasonably consistent fashion by those people who fill in the census form. Question 16 asks, in effect, whether individuals identify themselves as being of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander origin. Rather than being degrading-that is the way in which I think Senator Bonner referred to it-the explanatory text indicates that those people in any doubt should choose the category to which they regard themselves as belonging. I think in the case of those who identify themselves as Aboriginals or Torres Strait Islanders in this country, it is a matter of their own perception whether they belong to that category.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the Australian Bureau of Statistics consulted interested bodies on the inclusion of this question in the census all agreed that it ought to be included and also that it should be on the basis of self-identification or self-perception. The bodies consulted on this matter included the National Aboriginal Conference. Perhaps I should also point out to honourable senators that substantially the same wording as now appears on the form was included in the document entitled 'Topic Evaluation and Proposed Questions' which was tabled in the Senate on 20 November 1979.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bonner also referred to question 13. I should explain that this question relates to a matter quite different from Aboriginal origin. Question 13 relates to citizenship which is a matter of legal status and not self-perception or self-identification. Honourable senators might note that question 13 also requires some explanatory text so that it can be filled in in a consistent manner by those who are completing the census form. I have noted what Senator Bonner said about this question. I will see that the question is referred to the Treasurer for consideration of the matters that he has raised. The explanation is that the reason for the explanatory text is to achieve consistency of information. In the case of question 16, it refers to self-identification or self-perception.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did say in October that if oil parity pricing were rejected it would be very bad indeed. I did say that gimmicks were bad. Yesterday at the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association conference it was unanimously agreed that the import parity pricing policy is highly successful. It is the basis of success. But perhaps Senator Keeffe is the only one in step in the regiment. Let me say simply that the 21 nations that meet in the International Energy Agency to discuss the world policy all agree that the primary policy to overcome energy shortage is import parity pricing. Let Senator Keeffe be the only one out of step. I am now asked to endorse the Australian Labor Party's policy. Let us see what the Labor Party's policy did. In 1975-that was the last year of the Whitlam Government-25 exploration wells were drilled in Australia. We increased that to 80 last year and to 137 this year. It was 25 under Labor, 137 under us. Let us go a little better. Senator Keeffe wants to know whether I will endorse his policy. Exploration and development expenditure increased from $145m in 1975 to $780m last year and to $1,400m this year. I am being asked to support a policy under which the drilling rigs left Australia and people fled from the place. I am being asked to support a policy under which in 1975 there was only a handful of active explorers in Australia and only 112 exploration permits were on issue. Today there are nearly 300 permits and there are literally hundreds of exploration companies actively involved. The policy speaks for itself.</PARA></TALK.START>

During the whole of that period of a high level of immigration, it is true that there were very low rates of unemployment in this country. It is also true that world wide among the Western economies general levels of unemployment were lower than they are today, as were the levels of inflation. So I would be reluctant to draw too close a link between the high level of immigration and the low level of unemployment, although it seems a clear historical fact that post-war migrants played a very large part in Australian development during that period. They played their part, indeed more than their part, in manning some of the more difficult areas of Australian industry and some of the more difficult parts of Australia. I think all Australians would acknowledge that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the particular questions raised by the honourable senator, with regard to the intention of the Minister for Industrial Relations to do something to unfix the central wage fixing system, I think it is well known to all honourable senators that, quite unlike other countries, Australia has a very long tradition of the arbitration authorities playing a major role in wage fixing.

I should like to say that, as far as I am concerned, one of the interesting facets of being a representative politician in this country is the large number of people coming to my office who are temporary visitors in the country and who wish to stay permanently. One of the points they make is what great opportunities there are for people in Australia compared with opportunities in their countries of origin. I do not know whether honourable senators opposite have that experience. I have to say that it has been my regular experience over these recent years of difficult employment in this country to meet people who wish to stay because they see this as a country of great opportunity. I share that optimistic view of this country, and the very large number of people from overseas who apply annually to come here is an indication of what a very good place Australia is to live in.

The first time I was aware that there was likely to be a major reappraisal was 18 February and I reported that to the Government then. It has been our aim since then to urge the companies concerned to reach their reappraisal as fast as possible so that the public would know. I am happy to say that that has been achieved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications. There is increasing concern in the Northern Territory community that Telecom Australia is not delivering the goods. It is felt that the reason for this is the fact that Telecom, while still being administered by the South Australian section, is not progressing to align its administration with developments in the Northern Territory, particularly since the inauguration of responsible self-government. Will the Minister undertake to review Telecom's management of the Northern Territory with a view to placing Northern Territory administration in direct contact with Telecom's central administrative offices to ensure an efficient and productive operation in the Territory?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Northern Territory presents particular difficulties in the provision of telecommunication services. I understand that, although the total area of the Northern Territory is large and as a consequence there are management problems, there are at the present time approximately 22,500 subscribers, of whom 15,000 are actually located in Darwin. I understand that applications for services involving new plant this year will number about 5,500. In recognition of the problems facing the Territory, as set out in the honourable senator's question, and particularly of the problems in serving the outback areas of the Territory, Telecom Australia recently commissioned an independent study of the telecommunication needs of the Territory and of the telecommunication needs of remote and sparsely populated areas of other parts of Australia. As a result of this study Telecom now has a detailed picture of the needs of these areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised that 44,000 Australians in remote areas do not have access to modern telecommunications. I am reminded that Senator Ryan drew this matter to my attention late last year in relation to some other matters which she raised in this place. Planning for the extension of services to very remote areas is being undertaken. It emerges that conventional wire services in most cases are precluded, and Telecom is therefore evaluating a couple of systems, one of which will involve the use of satellites when a national satellite system is available. Comparative cost evaluations will be made to determine which among those is the most appropriate means for providing services.</PARA>
<PARA> I am also advised that Telecom currently has a district telecommunications manager in Darwin who is responsible for the whole of the Territory. This is something which concerns the honourable senator who asked the question and who represents the Northern Territory. This district telecommunications manager is supported by a strong engineering group headed by a supervising engineer. The district manager reports to the State manager in South Australia. Telecom has looked into the need for establishing a separate administration in the Northern Territory. At this stage of the Territory's economic and social development, Telecom feels that the additional administrative overheads in setting up a full State-like administration could not be justified. The honourable senator can rest assured, however, that Telecom is fully aware of the very high growth rates in the Northern Territory, of the developments which are occurring through both the exploitation of the Territory's mineral resources and tourism, and that these will continue to put pressure on the telecommunications system. Telecom will continue to review frequently the appropriateness of the Telecom central planning and administrative functions for the Territory.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I see no contradiction at all. The fact of the matter is that oil shale has been developed, and developed commercially, throughout the world. In fact, in some parts of the world, including Germany, some 40 years ago it was developed and developed commercially. The fact that it can be developed and can produce oil is known scientifically. Equally, it is known that in Australia there are very large potential supplies of shale. My notes of caution and cautious optimism were directed to the fact that in the course of the development of any mining venture there are necessarily reappraisals, reassessments of the nature of the venture. I have always indicated the strong hope, and indeed, belief that oil shale undertakings in Australia will succeed, that they will be massive in size and that they will contribute very significantly as from the last decade of this century towards meeting our hydrocarbon needs. Basically that remains absolutely unchanged. The Prime Minister was expressing a belief, a well-based belief, that an oil shale industry would be a large industry, that its investment as such would be of massive size and indeed that the kind of investment contemplated would be larger than that in the North West Shelf. Therefore, the Prime Minister was stating factual figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have replied in this Senate to the question regarding the Deputy Prime Minister. He was in fact referring not to what are known as the economic proven reserves but to the known reserves of shale. It is true that Australia is blessed with huge reserves of shale. What is necessary is to prove up the economic proven reserves; that is, those that may be used now. For instance, Australia has massive supplies of coal. The important thing to know is where is the coal that economically can be won now. So his figures were figures related to reserves as such and not to proven or economic reserves. I find no contradiction.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 11 March Senator Colston asked a question without notice about delays in processing applications for invalid pensions in Queensland. He raised the matter again last week. I undertook to expedite a reply. The position which he has raised is not very satisfactory. I am advised that over 700 invalid pension claims have been awaiting medical examination in Queensland for over two months. I have been advised by the Minister for Health that the total time lapse between the initial lodgment of an application with my Department and the vetting of that application by a senior medical officer in the Brisbane office of his Department and its return to my Department for final decision is about three months. This time factor is made up as follows: Time to secure an appointment for examination of the applicant by a Commonwealth Medical Officer varies from a few days to up to three weeks. Due to arrears of work, about nine weeks are required by the Department of Health to process a case from the time it is received from a regional office of my Department to the time it is returned to that office for determination. This time can be affected on occasions by the need to refer the application form back to the examining Commonwealth Medical Officer for completion so that an informed opinion can be reached. If a specialist opinion is needed an additional period of up to four weeks may be required to secure an appointment and for the specialist's report to reach the senior medical officer of my Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister has advised me that the many calls made on the services of medical officers in the Department of Health and by various departments and Commonwealth authorities necessitate priorities to be accorded from time to time. Nevertheless, the Director of Health, Brisbane, has advised that he has already taken action to overcome the present backlog of invalid pension applications waiting to be processed. Depending upon the availability of extra staff this will ensure that future delays in dealing with these cases are kept to a minimum. It should be noted, of course, that people awaiting a decision on whether they are eligible for invalid pension are almost certainly in receipt of some other benefit-usually sickness benefit-and that no-one should be experiencing hardship as a result of the delays. If Senator Colston is aware of any people experiencing hardship because of the delay he should refer them to me or my Department to see what assistance can be given. That is consistent with the view which I took in respect of the delays in appeals which have also been raised in this chamber. A direction was given to the Department that no-one was to suffer by reason of the delay.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 2 April 1981 Senator Chipp asked a question regarding the restrictions on medical benefits for cosmetic surgery. The Minister for Health has advised me as follows: It is appreciated that any decisions to restrict medical benefits will provide some difficulties to patients contemplating treatment to which the restrictions apply. As regards the restrictions on certain cosmetic surgery items, the Minister for Health foreshadowed in his address to the Sixth Australian Medical Congress in Launceston on 12 February 1981 that the Government was considering the matter. He further stated that he would announce shortly a decision on medical benefits for cosmetic surgery. This statement was given considerable publicity in the Press.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator mentioned the purchase by patients of surgical implants, that is prostheses, prior to 1 April. Such expenses are, of course, not covered by items in the medical benefits schedule and the restricting of benefits for cosmetic surgery from 1 April 1981 has no effect in relation to those items.</PARA>
<PARA> The cosmetic surgery items have been removed from only the medical benefits schedule and therefore hospital benefits continue to be applicable to these services. The question of restriction of hospital benefits for these services has not been considered. In the examples quoted by the honourable senator, that is, the removal of a disfiguring facial birthmark or certain hair transplants-other than punch grafts-medical benefits will continue to be attracted. The restrictions apply only to breast augmentations for cosmetic purposes, facelifts, eyelid reductions and punch grafts of hair. The decision to restrict payment of benefit for them is in line with the general philosophy that medical benefits shall apply only to medical services reasonably required for medical treatment. It is considered the operations mentioned are carried out primarily for purely cosmetic purposes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the following matter of public importance:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Government's energy strategy, as illustrated by the shelving of the Rundle project. </PARA>
<PARA>On 9 October last year the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) described the Rundle project as 'a classic example' of the success of the Government's energy policies. That was in an address to the National Press Club. Since February 1981 he, as Minister for National Development and Energy, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and other Ministers in the present Government have consistently talked up two speculative stocks associated with the Rundle project, namely Central Pacific Minerals NL and Southern Pacific Petroleum NL. During Question Time today Senator Carrick, sensitive about that allegation, pointed to his answer on 15 May last year, which he said indicated that he was not concerned to talk up the viability of the Rundle project in the interests of those two companies. I refer him to another passage of the answer he gave on 15 May 1980. He talked about the two companies and Esso Australia Ltd. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> On a moment's reflection one would reach the conclusion that co-partners do not go into a venture and commit billions of dollars in capital unless they are convinced of commercial viability. With a little reflection one would reach that conclusion on this situation. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Carrick went on to talk about Exxon's involvement and concluded with this statement:</PARA>
<PARA> Dr David, the technical and research vice-president of Exxon, yesterday assured me that the most conservative judgment amongst all his technical advisers is that Rundle is commercially viable through to refining. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement was made in May last year. Numerous other statements were made by Government Ministers about the Rundle project and the whole effect of them has been to make Rundle the linchpin of the Government's energy strategy, and, judging from the way Ministers have talked about it almost the linchpin of the Government's employment strategy. Rundle has been the flagship of all these projects which will employ so many thousands of Australians. Figures have been cited for the number of people it has been estimated will be employed at Rundle. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course what the Government is now concerned to do is to miss deliberately the point of what has been said by Ministers over a period of 12 to 18 months. What has been said by Ministers over that period of 12 to 18 months is that in approximately 10 years time the energy balance, as it is called in Australia, will be upset; that Bass Strait oil production, as the Prime Minister has said continually, will be running down and Rundle it is said will step into the breach, will come on stream, as that process in relation to Bass Strait oil happens. I have a bundle of documents here but I will not refer to them all. These are some of the headlines relating to statements made by Ministers about the Rundle project: 'Bonanza in shale oil-Enough to last 12,000 years, Anthony says'; 'Carrick gives guarantees'; 'We need four Rundles'; and so on. Such statements appear not only in Press statements but also in media releases on a number of occasions by the Prime Minister estimating the number which will be employed, the effect of the program and so on by the mid-1980s. I quote from a Press release, for example, by the Prime Minister in February last year in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Production from Rundle could be particularly important to Australia as current projections show that output from Bass Strait will decline progressively from the mid 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA>Time and time again Ministers in this Government have been talking about the decline of Bass Strait oil and about Rundle being the solution to all these problems. Of course that is a typically desperate sort of debating point adopted by this Government time and time again. It is a classic sort of situation. Unemployment will go away under a Fraser Government, we were told in 1975 and 1977. But when it does not look like going away we are told: 'Aha! The resources boom has arrived; that will get rid of unemployment in Australia'. Fuel energy resources in Bass Strait are running down we are told, and in the same way we are told, as they run down: 'Aha! What do we have here-Rundle. Rundle will solve our problems in relation to energy policy'. The dreadful thing about this is that it is indicative not only of no real policy and no real alternatives but also of a chronic capacity to try to mislead people about the nature of the Government's activities. The result of the talking up of speculative stocks in relation to Rundle is that investors in Australia yesterday lost $57m as a result of shares bought, with encouragement from Ministers in the Fraser Government. They lost $57m. Many of them were the poor little people whom this Government pretends to be so concerned about and in respect of whom it says: 'Look, market forces will look after these people. They are the things which operate in the best interests of people in this community'. Last week $16.4m was earned by a company in a share raid-tax free, we understand. Is that the sort of society which we feel is a just one? What did anybody in this country do to earn $16.4m in one day? Was he a very clever man, of enormous ability, that he was able to do that sort of thing? What about the people who bought shares in the Rundle partners as a result of the encouragement of this Government? The fact is that the fuel and energy policies of the Government are in ruins as a result of a decision made elsewhere in the last few days. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will hear from Senator Young, with his usual wisdom, in time. The fact is that due to the absence of alternatives and options, the fuel and energy policies of this Government are in ruins because Rundle was made, by excessively vociferous and excessively talkative Ministers, the linchpin of the Government's energy policy. The results are, as I have said, that thousands of small investors have lost money. The confidence of overseas and local investors is shattered by the connivance of the Government with the companies in question. The question which has been posed to Government Ministers is: 'Where are our fuel resources coming from after 1980? How will we correct the imbalance of energy supply which will arise?' The answer has always been Rundle. On 11 February 1980 Mr Anthony referred to the enormous resources of shale oil in Australia. On 3 March 1980 the Prime Minister said of the Esso company's participation with the two companies Southern Pacific Petroleum and Central Pacific Minerals:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . signals the start of what may well become one of Australia's greatest industries. Of particular interest is the role played by the Government's oil pricing policies in making the Rundle development possible. </PARA>
<PARA>This is true enough. On 8 October 1980 Senator Carrick said that declining domestic oil production was unlikely to be offset by any major new finds. Last night he said, of course, that he was confident that moderate supplies of oil would now be found in Bass Strait and elsewhere. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> If Australia is to meet its energy balance within the decade we would need to have functioning by the end of the decade three or four enterprises about the size of the Rundle shale oil project. I have no doubt that in the next 12 months in Australia some coal liquefaction projects will be under construction. </PARA>
<PARA>The matter was regarded as so important that the Prime Minister even took it upon himself to announce that Esso was to join the Rundle partners. The Prime Minister talked incessantly, as did the Minister for National Development and Energy, before and during the last election campaign of Rundle in the most glowing terms. Of course, it is said here today by implication at Question Time that the Labor Party is a pack of Jonahs, that it is not concerned about the development of Australia and that it does not want any of these things. If the Labor Party said nothing about the Minister's failures and about the failures of this Government in respect of its energy policy we would be accused by the Government-properly so-of neglecting our duty as an Opposition. The Opposition simply is saying that in this field of energy policy as in almost every field of major government endeavour the Government has misled the people of this country by talking up projects-all sorts of pie in the sky dreams which the Government has-which are no real solution to the problems which this country faces. We say that unless the Government is able to talk in terms of reality about the issues and to offer alternatives to Rundle, in terms of energy policy, it has failed. That is the charge we make. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the real situation in regard to synthetic oil about which Senator Carrick suddenly started to talk with new enthusiasm today? One can look at brown coal conversion. A circus is being offered the people of Australia; it is a bread and circus job. Give them bread and circuses. The costs of brown coal conversion and the amounts of money involved are just enormous having regard to present technology. It would require about 160 million tonnes of coal to produce from brown coal oil equivalent to that of Bass Strait; it would be necessary to mine 260 million tonnes of material a year. This is roughly 10 times the size of the mining operation at Yallourn in Victoria or eight times the size of the mining operation at Mount Tom Price in Western Australia. It is about five times the existing total production of the State Electricity Commission of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the sorts of figures which have to be considered. It is no good saying when Rundle seems to be going bad, 'We will look at brown coal conversion; that is the next panacea for the problems of our energy policy', without talking about those sorts of problems which are enormous. The mining of enormous tonnages of material each year would be required at Rundle to produce 200,000 barrels of oil. This is mining on a scale which has not been seen almost anywhere in the Western world up to this point. It has been said in relation to the announcement by the Rundle partners that they will go straight into production and not proceed with a pilot plant as they had announced. That is all very interesting but there are certain problems about that. The Esso-Central Pacific partners have already said that the cost of phase two of the project has escalated by a factor of three. By calling for a re-examination of the project they have all but said that in their view it is finished for the time being. Senator Carrick might debate that view and no doubt we will have an opportunity in a few months' time to debate it again. But bear in mind that we will remember what is said in this place today on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Rundle partners are, in fact, again starting an investigation only. There is no intention of going ahead to develop Rundle at this stage. Of course, one of the reasons is that those partners have been pressing this Government for a very long time for very susbtantial contributions in terms of policies for the future and underwriting of the project which they would need before they would even consider going ahead with the project. It is an act of great irresponsibility, we believe, for the Government to hold out any hope that Rundle will go ahead in even the medium term. So what happens to the equation, the balance, of Australia's energy needs in the next ten years as stated by the Minister over and over again with the Rundle project being a key factor in that balance?</PARA>
<PARA> By identifying this Government so closely with Rundle-with the risks which it involves for shareholders, with the anticipations it has encouraged in others-and by pinning all future hopes on the Rundle project, the Minister has failed this country sadly. We have no coherent national fuel and energy policy. The failure of Rundle means that the Government has no oil policy. It is no good Senator Carrick telling us how many wells were drilled in 1975 or 1980 when answering questions about his own inadequacies in 1981. It is an interesting historical exercise which might give Senator Carrick a great sense of moral self-justification; it does nothing for the country in terms of knowing what our oil policy is. This Government has no coal policy and no natural gas policy. It has no liquefied petroleum gas policy. All those policies have been victims of the ad hoc attitudes of this Government. That applies to all the Government's thinking. In this instance, the Government again went for a simple, easy solution-one big project on which it could focus as a symbol, a flagship, of a lot of false dreams to fool the people as it did before last year's election. </PARA>
<PARA> I will make one or two points about what should be done in a constructive way at this stage. I argue that the production of synthetic fuels is premature at this stage. Of course, research and development are important in a pilot study. It might be feasible to get part of our fuel supply from synthetics produced from shale and coal by, say, 1995 and not 1985 as Government Ministers have said. At present at least eight synthetic oil projects are being studied. If they went ahead as planned they would cost enormous amounts, probably between $40 billion and $100 billion. It would cause economic chaos, massive environmental dislocation and enormous oversupply of oil if all those projects were, in fact, to go ahead. But the costs would be prohibitive. The fact that they could, in theory, go ahead is a stark illustration of the so-called energy policy of this so-called national Government. The State governments which exist at present could create this ridiculous situation. </PARA>
<PARA> So we say that there should be further encouragement of conventional oil exploration. As Senator Carrick virtually said last night, one new, major, oil field would be worth half a dozen Rundles to this country at present and within the next decade, which is the period we have been talking about. Conventional oil exploration could be encouraged, of course, by a continuation of import parity pricing which would provide more encouragement for new discoveries. It could be encouraged in a sensible way by the imposition of a profit-related secondary tax using some of this tax revenue to form a government hydrocarbons corporation to boost the search for oil. In that context we believe that if these things were done, we could afford to wait before going into synthetics. </PARA>
<PARA> But more important than anything else we need national co-ordination of oil policies. We should maximise utilisation of fuels already available in Australia which are underutilised such as natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, coal and electricity. Australia is a gas-rich continent. We should substantially increase our known gas reserves. Although 80 per cent of the LPG we produce is now being exported it would help very much if it were used as transport fuel. In discussing this matter of public importance we are concerned with drawing attention to the knee-jerk responses of this approach of adopting a sort of linchpin program without adequate care as the centre of the Government's policy. The failure of that enterprise, as we see it, has led to the rug being pulled from under the Government's energy policies as a whole. We have a government which is always tempted to go for simplistic solutions. It has been sold a pup once again. The best thing we can do, of course, is to find another oil field because that is where our energy policies ought to be directed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is someone who is really trying to kill the stocks. Let Senator Button's argument die on his breath. Senator Button has set out-his front bencher, Senator Walsh, has indicated that they want this-to demolish the value of the stocks on the market. Be that on their heads. There was no such message in that notification by the companies yesterday. There was a reappraisal of whether they would by-pass a pilot plant and go on to a commercial plant. I cannot understand the un-Australian attitude of Australian Labor Party senators who want to kill a project just for their own mean-minded reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the Australian energy policy. We live in a world which is consuming oil at twice the rate at which it is finding it. Australia gets most of its oil from Bass Strait. It is 67 per cent self-sufficient. It is falling away from that level and we must find substitutes and alternatives. This Government has put into place a total energy policy based on four premises. I invite the public and the Senate to examine them. We have a policy to provide energy self-sufficiency in the years and decades ahead based upon: Firstly, the conservation of all our fuels but specifically the petroleum fuels, the saving of fuels and the using of them more economically; secondly, the conversion away from oil to alternatives such as gas, electricity, coal and, overseas, uranium; thirdly, exploration in a massive way to find more oil and gas; and, fourthly, using synthetics, synthetic crudes, ethanol and other forms of power, be it solar or wind power, to fill the gap. </PARA>
<PARA> The test is: How is this succeeding? Let us examine this because here we have a red herring. The suggestion is that because Rundle has some difficulties, the program itself does not stand. The program has achieved, in conservation, a movement from an increase in oil stocks of 2 per cent to 3 per cent in 1978 to a decrease of 5 per cent in the current period-a fall of between 7 per cent and 8 per cent in the use of petroleum; in fact, till last year, a drop from some 662,000 barrels a day to below 630,000 barrels a day. Conservation is working, and working strongly. Talking of conservation, we have an arrangement with the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries to produce more fuel efficient vehicles. In two years those more fuel efficient vehicles will be saving 5 per cent of fuel. By 1987 they will be saving 12 per cent of fuel. Let everyone take note that by that policy alone by 1987 we will be saving 14 million barrels of gasoline fuel a day. This is part of the whole program. </PARA>
<PARA> We are building pipelines to facilitate a switch away from oil and liquefied petroleum gas. Let me recite some of these success stories. The Newcastle pipeline has a potential saving estimated to be three million barrels of oil a year after a five-year lead time; Canberra, 800,000 barrels a year after a five-year lead time; and Wagga, 136,000 barrels a year after a five-year lead time. All these pipelines are in the process of being built and getting into position. Since we are talking about the success of energy policies, let me say that the proposed pipeline from the North West Shelf to Perth, which will be in position in four years, will displace 28 million barrels of oil after year five. That is a 13 per cent or 14 per cent overall saving of total oil in Australia. We are being told that we do not have an energy policy. Here is a success story on its own, and it is the very start. Alongside the North West Shelf another great field has been found, near Barrow Island. Quite clearly there will be huge finds. To save oil we are also looking at pipelines in the Goulburn Valley. </PARA>
<PARA> We can move throughout Australia and we will find that step by step we are building pipelines which will provide for Australia a complete displacement of oil. By January 1983 the Cooper Basin pipeline will be from Cooper Basin to Whyalla. That pipeline will carry something like 35,000 barrels of liquids a day. Let me put it another way. It will carry nine million barrels a year of oil and LPG-of liquids-at the start. It has a capacity for 24 million barrels. Here is a story which is ignored. It is a story of displacement, a story of bringing more oil, gas, and liquids on stream. It is a story of very great achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party wants to direct itself only to Rundle. I will come to Rundle in due course because I want to put into position the orchestration of the conservation policy which is working and which the International Energy Agency has acknowledged as being first class. Yesterday the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association conference, with a record attendance of delegates, acknowledged the huge success of the Government's energy policies in Australia. It paid tribute to the prime mover, the import parity pricing, and acknowledged the tremendous growth in exploration and the excitement that is happening in Australia. One would never guess this, from the Jeremiahs opposite. We have conservation. We have the conversion to smaller vehicles. The four-cylinder vehicles are coming in. We have the projected huge saving of 12 per cent of gasoline energy in seven years' time. We have the steady conversion towards LPG. This is not happening as fast as we would want, but we are urging more. There is evidence that there is movement now in automotive LPG. These are policies which give a price differential and which lead us to hope that in five years' time we will absorb not only what we export now but also the production from the Cooper Basin and the North West Shelf and that we will displace in automotive LPG some 14 per cent of gasoline used. </PARA>
<PARA> In Brisbane in very recent times the taxi industry has moved to 40 per cent LPG. The figure for Canberra is 90 per cent, and for Melbourne it is 80 per cent. This story is not told at all. The commercial use of LPG will move fast as more outlets are determined in the metropolitan areas, and as we produce more. Whether it is conservation by saving or whether it is conversion to other fuels, we are moving foward. I have given dramatic figures in relation to the saving of oil and how our policies are in place. Year by year we have that balance of self-sufficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button) was very sensitive when he came to exploration. Incidentally, it is important to remember what he said in his speech. He said that liquefaction of brown coal was no good, that it was too costly and could not happen. I think it is very important to keep in mind that the Labor Party has no policy on this matter. He said later that he thought synthetics were somewhat premature but they were on the way. His famous statement was that there must be further encouragement to seek oil. At Question Time today I had to remind the Senate of the Labor Party's policies in regard to seeking oil and how, when it came to office in 1972, there were 22 rigs in Australia and how, at the end of its three years in office, there was nothing working in Australia, and how exploration had fled Australia. This is the Opposition which is suggesting that its one solution is to encourage the finding of more oil. </PARA>
<PARA> I reminded the Senate at Question Time today that only 25 exploration wells were drilled in 1975 by a Labor government. Eighty wells were drilled last year and 137 this year under a Fraser Liberal government. I reminded the Senate that in 1975 a total expenditure of $145m was made on exploration and development. That figure had risen to $780m last year and to $1400m this year. Yet the Labor Party has the effrontery to suggest that it would could manage exploration. If ever there were a total failure, that was it. When I turn to the number of active explorers in Australia in 1975, I could count them on one hand. At that time only 112 applications were on issue. Today there are 300 permits on issue and hundreds of exploration companies in Australia. This year will be a record year. It will be an exciting period of exploration. The exploration industry acknowledges that this is happening because of the import parity pricing policies of this Government. It is happening here in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also putting large sums of money into solar energy research. We are working with overseas corporations in the development of solar energy. Our program is that by the turn of the century, in twenty years time, eight per cent of energy in Australia will be achieved by solar energy. We are developing wind power. We have many projects running on ethanol. We are looking towards the conversion of natural gas into methanol and thence into gasoline. All these things are running. I ask members of the Labor Party to look at the compendium of our research and development programs, which is some three inches high. They will see the vigour with which we are undertaking these programs and the direction the programs are taking. This compendium was commended by overseas countries as a first class undertaking. Now we come to the alternative situation, the need to have in the decades ahead alternative sources of oil-oil from coal and oil from shale. I ask honourable senators to bear in mind that Senator Button talked about three great principles. First of all, he talked about the shelving of the Rundle project. I will come to that later. That was a complete misstatement. Secondly, he said: 'You cannot liquefy brown coal. It is too dear and, in any case, synthetics are too premature'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Button asks me about the matter tomorrow at Question Time I will read the Hansard record. He saw the encouragement of oil exploration as the only course. Senator Button said that I had said, and I had said it, that if we were to have an energy balance for the long term future, by the turn of the decade we ought to have functioning in Australia three or four enterprises of the size of the Rundle project. I did say that. Indeed, Senator Button then proceeded to ignore the other projects in existence. He cannot but know, although he probably does not take much interest in the State from which he comes, that Rheinbraun signed an agreement with the Victorian Government on 25 November 1980 for a plant in Victoria for the development of oil from brown coal. Three stages were included in the signed agreement. The third stage involves the development and operation of a brown coal open cut mine requiring the dedication of some 1,200m tonnes of coal. It provides also for the planning, construction and operation of a plant which will provide three million tonnes per annum of liquid fuels from brown coal-an enterprise of the magnitude of the Rundle project. The agreement was signed and the stages spelt out. The Opposition believes it is an aberration. Perhaps the Opposition dismissed it because it believes brown coal is too dear. Rheinbraun, which perhaps leads the world in its knowledge and technology of coal, would be greatly invigorated to know that Senator Button, with his high technology, has a better knowledge than that company of handling coal liquefaction from brown coal. Perhaps Senator Button knows that West Germany has been doing this for 40 or 50 years. Of course, he conveniently ignored it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since we are talking about other companies, Senator Button ought to know of the Nippon Brown Coal Liquefaction Co., which signed an agreement with the Victorian Government on 8 December last year for co-operation in a pilot plant for the production of liquid fuels from Victorian brown coal in the Latrobe Valley. Time does not permit me to elaborate further. I move on to remind the Senate that Mitsui-CSR has set out-Senator Button acknowledges this-to undertake an SRC, or solvent refined coal, form of extraction. Senator Button made no mention of Gelliondale or Millmerran or any other enterprises or shale oil projects around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we have a situation in which the energy policy of Australia is queried. I have shown that by conservation, conversion, exploration and the potential putting in place of synthetics we have an orchestration. I have talked of the pipelines, the use of liquid petroleum gas and the whole thrust and parry of the situation. Senator Button did not mention any of these matters even though he said that, of course, the Rundle situation threatens the Government's energy policy. Of course it does not. Today I have talked about the fact that there is now more optimism that we will find moderate supplies of more oil. That is not sudden optimism by me. The producers themselves are displaying this optimism. Senator Button must be aware of the exciting discoveries of oil and gas around Australia. So many things are happening. I turn now to Rundle. Rundle, the frontrunner in synthetic fuels, ought to be encouraged by decent Australians and not destroyed. It will not be destroyed because it will beat the Jeremiahs of the Labor Party who want to see the project fail. What an extraordinary situation. Here in Australia we are hungry for oil but members of the Labor Party want to see this project fail. Surely, with the knowledge that the Exxon Corporation has great scientific ability and great integrity, honourable senators opposite must know that it will bring its scientific prowess to bear to make a success of the project, if success can be achieved. I would have thought that the Opposition would have been urging it on instead of attempting to destroy it. Of course, the fact is that we have in place now in Australia a capacity to produce and to maintain energy self-sufficiency well beyond this decade. We can in fact juggle the use of our various commodities such as our coal, electricity, gas and oil. We can put them together to get an energy balance. What a pity that the Jeremiahs are attempting to tear down and not build up. That is exactly what honourable senators opposite did in government. They are doing it in Opposition again with an equal degree of failure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick), like a Monty Python character, always looks on the bright side. For nearly two years he has been telling us that the solution to Australia's impending energy shortage, or energy balance as he insists on calling it, is in the Rundle project and similar projects. Now that the Rundle project has collapsed, for the foreseeable future anyway, Senator Carrick speaks as though the Government's oil conservation policy, as he likes to call it, has been so successful that Australia did not really need Rundle anyway. If he was not saying that I do not know what he was trying to say. Like the despots of old who used to behead runners who brought bad news, Senator Carrick holds the Australian Labor Party responsible for the failure of the Rundle project. According to Senator Carrick, the Labor Party is responsible for the failure of the Rundle project because it has pointed out the fact that the project has failed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The truth, of course, as the matter of public importance states, is that the Government has no energy policy and never has had an energy policy. It has a fuel taxing policy which is one facet of its deficit dogma. The fuel taxing policy is supplemented by shameless beat-ups from Senator Carrick, Mr Lynch and Mr Fraser about the exciting prospects for energy replacement projects such as Rundle. This is reflected also, of course, in such august journals as the Stock Exchange Journal of Australia, which only three months ago was also beating up the prospects of the Rundle project. Senator Carrick has the audacity now to try to deny that he has in fact been beating up Rundle's prospects over the last couple of years. Like Senator Button, I have so much material in front of me that I can use only a fraction of it, but I will give a sample. In answer to a question about the economic viability of Rundle from Senator Wriedt on 14 May last year, Senator Carrick said:</PARA>
<PARA> If I may be allowed to answer, the whole question in this matter is whether Rundle will be commercially viable, that is, whether it will be commercially viable in producing oil or whether it will be commercially viable in producing oil refined stocks. That, of course, will depend entirely upon the pursuit in this community of import parity pricing. </PARA>
<PARA>The only reservation Senator Carrick had about the commercial viability of Rundle was the continuation of import parity pricing. He said that less than a year ago. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The basis of the partners' advice to the community of Australia was that the one basis of their viability in producing oil stocks for Australia would be the sustaining of import parity pricing. </PARA>
<PARA>On 14 May last year Senator Carrick said that the only thing that could stop the Rundle project, the only thing that could destroy its commercial viability or place it in jeopardy, was the discontinuation of import parity pricing. We have still got import parity pricing. We have not got Rundle. The Minister has the audacity to claim that he is not responsible for beating it up in the first place. Just in case it is thought that that was an isolated incident, the very next day, in response to a question from Senator Wriedt, Senator Carrick said something similar to what he said today. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry that in what I think is one of the most exciting potential developments in Australia, there appears to be a tendency to denigrate this project on the part of the Opposition. The fact is that the future of Australia and the future of Australian jobs and the vocations for Australians depend very directly on our ability to produce petroleum energy. One of the main projects is Rundle. </PARA>
<PARA>At the end of the same answer he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, any venture encounters risks along the journey. Dr David, the technical and research vice-president of Exxon, yesterday assured me that the most conservative judgment amongst all his technical advisers is that Rundle is commercially viable through to refining. </PARA>
<PARA>On 14 May Senator Carrick said, without any reservations, that the only thing that could stop Rundle going ahead was the discontinuance of import parity pricing; nothing was then said about the Opposition's destroying it after it was already dead. The next day he quoted an Exxon vice-president as saying that in his judgment there was no barrier to commercial viability. On 2 March last year the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said:</PARA>
<PARA> Esso's participation with Southern Pacific Petroleum and Central Pacific Minerals to develop Rundle's massive reserves of shale oil signals the start of what may well become one of Australia's greatest industries . . . If we had not adopted a realistic pricing policy for crude oil and instead allowed oil to be sold at an artificially low price, the plans for the development of the Rundle oil shale deposits could not have proceeded as they have . . . The Government has given a very high priority to the development of indigenous sources of liquid fuels and it is pleasing to note the success of these policies in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA>On 6 July 1980 Senator Carrick, not to be outdone, issued a Press statement. It was probably issued by Laurie Power, like most of his Press statements, especially his highly political Press statements. The statement said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said that this was a most important forward step in what promised to be a great development project. Given current and expected future uncertainties about world oil supplies and the prospective run down in Bass Strait production towards the end of the decade, the development of alternative sources of liquid fuels is of immense importance . . . the companies' announcement was a further vindication of the Government's import parity pricing policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Not surprisingly, in response to that barrage of bullish pronouncements, newspaper headlines such as these were produced: 'Government endorses Rundle shale project'-the Australian Financial Review; 'Federal aid for Rundle project announced'-the Canberra Times; 'Fraser promises assistance'-the Australian Financial Review; 'PM backs shale oil extraction'-the Age; 'Rundle set for huge fuel boost'-the Brisbane Courier-Mail; 'Rundle a $2bn goer'-the Australian Financial Review; and 'Queensland's big oil boom'-the Australian. So they go on. It is not at all surprising that the bullish statements by Senator Carrick and the Prime Minister produced such a Press reaction. </PARA>
<PARA> Rundle was described on the radio this morning as the Poseidon of the 1980s, and well it might be with Senator Carrick and Mr Fraser playing the roles of Shierlaw and Hynam. What we do not know yet is who are the Burrills, the Joneses and the Crichton-Brownes. But it may be significant that questions asked by former Senator Wriedt on 21 May and 23 May last year were ducked by the Prime Minister. Senator Wriedt asked Senator Carrick whether he or any other Ministers had shares directly or indirectly in either of the Rundle partners. Senator Carrick said that he would refer the matter to the Prime Minister and then, to his very great credit, he answered:</PARA>
<PARA> But since, basically, I am the Minister for National Development and Energy and the one who relates directly to mines and energy, I simply say that I hold no shares at all, neither does my wife or family. </PARA>
<PARA>I am quite willing to accept Senator Carrick's assurance on that. But two days later nothing had been said about the other Ministers. Senator Wriedt asked Senator Carrick, as Minister representing the Prime Minister, another question on this matter. Senator Carrick gave a similar answer to that which he had given two days before-he said he would refer it to the Prime Minister. On that day, 23 May, there was inserted into the Hansard at page 2936 what purports to be the Prime Minister's answer. It is typical of the sorts of non-answers we get from the Prime Minister. It is typical of the arrogant disdain with which he treats this Parliament. The Prime Minister, through Senator Carrick, said:</PARA>
<PARA> All Ministers have made declarations of pecuniary interests in accordance with the arrangements referred to by the Deputy Prime Minister in his statement of 22 November 1979 on the Report of the Committee of Inquiry concerning Public Duty and Private Interest. </PARA>
<PARA>That may well be so; perhaps they have all made declarations. But what is disturbing about this Government, and what has been disturbing about it for many years, is that the public finds out about Ministers' conflicts of financial interests-the Government does not tell anybody about them and the Prime Minister does not do anything about them-only when they have been blown in the media. Did the Prime Minister know about Mr Lynch's Stumpy Gully land speculation activities? If he did, did he approve of them? The public was told nothing until the Age blew the story. We still have not been told by the Prime Minister whether he approved of them or whether he knew of them in advance. Incidentally, the public still has not been made privy to the report on the matter, contrary to the promises given by both Mr Fraser and Mr Lynch prior to the 1977 election. What we do know is that the procedures which this Prime Minister claims to have applied regarding ministerial conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest have not been satisfactory. The Prime Minister has been asked whether he knew about a former Minister's dividend stripping operations. He has ducked that question too. He has been asked whether he approves of the use of money which, on the Minister's own admission, was appropriated by his father as working capital for private businesses. He has dodged that question too; and he continues to dodge this one. </PARA>
<PARA> If no Ministers have interests directly or indirectly or through their families in either of the Rundle partners, why does the Prime Minister not say so? I have no evidence that they have such interests. I just note for the record, and I complain on behalf of the Opposition, that this Parliament, especially given the way in which these shares have been shamelessly beaten up over the last 18 months to two years by several Ministers in this Government, is entitled to know whether any Ministers have direct or indirect pecuniary interests in those companies. The gullible shareholders of the companies yesterday lost $57m. The market capitalisation of one of those firms fell by $57m. The shareholders are entitled to be angry at having been misled by the bullish pronouncements of numerous Ministers in this Government, of executives of Exxon and, of course, of the chairman of the two Australian companies, whose name, I think, is Mr McLennan. They are entitled to be extremely annoyed at having been misled by those bullish pronouncements into purchasing shares at what, it is now clear, were excessively high prices. While all this bullish activity was proceeding Senator Carrick was getting advice from his Department that there were quite serious technical problems. </PARA>

<PARA>the Government has indicated that it accepts in principle the idea of product sharing but that each case must be considered on its merits and, until the actual industry is so defined that we can know what its product will be both in quality and quantity, no decisions can be made on the matter. As to the specific details of Senator Grimes' question, it is quite clear that the Australian market has to be fulfilled ahead of any others. The Rundle partners know that. </PARA>
<PARA>What is that? Three weeks after Senator Carrick acknowledged having been told about these technical problems there was not a word from him to the Parliament about these technical problems. There were no doubts at all cast on his previous open-ended assurances that the economic viability of this project was assured. Perhaps he did not remember it that day. On 26 March, in answer to a question from Senator MacLaren about Rundle, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> My understanding is that at the moment there are discussions between the partners regarding any necessity to revise their estimates as to the volume of product output and the time of such production. Such an announcement has not yet been made. </PARA>
<PARA>Again there was not even a hint that the project was not commercially viable. It is not as though such information were not available. The Sydney Morning Herald of 15 March-before Senator Carrick answered that question-referred to Dr Barry Hughes of Flinders University, an economist of whom the Government could take more notice. It would be much better advised to absorb the economic analysis of Barry Hughes rather than the high tory dogma and the a priori reasoning of the Secretary to the Treasury. But on that occasion Barry Hughes said that on his calculations the cost of production of oil from Rundle was between $60 and $70 a barrel. Senator Carrick at that time was still saying it was between $40 and $50--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(New South Wales) (4.42)-Misconceptions about this Rundle shale matter are in every way regrettable-even tragic would not be an overstatement-and have done a great deal of damage already and, I suspect, will do a great deal more damage in the future. They will damage the Government's energy policy too because I cannot see, after what has happened to the shares in the Rundle twins, that many investors in Australia will again take much notice of what the Government says about the prospects for any enterprise in Australia in the future. That is tragic. Many statements which the Australian Democrats have made here in the last two years on energy I think should make it plain how great our concern is that there are other means of providing substitutes for motor spirit in Australia, if possible by the time the Bass Strait crude runs down. As we all know, that time is not very far off now-possibly another decade at best. Our key energy problem in this country is motor spirit. Let us be in no doubt about that. We are more dependent on motor spirit than is any other developed country. We do not have the railway systems, canals and things of that type to do without it so we have to have it. I raised this matter of Rundle in the Senate on 14 May 1980 in these words:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> There is no doubt about it-the development is a fraud. Virtually everything that has been said about it is a pack of lies. </PARA>
<PARA>Not unnaturally, that evoked a response from Esso Australia Ltd, and as a result of that I wrote to Esso on 18 June of last year. I stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I am concerned about the nature of the publicity Rundle has had in recent months and the resulting widely-held view among the public that as Bass Strait crude runs down Rundle shale oil will be there to solve all our problems. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be easy to say that this view was simplistic and ill-informed. The point is that public attitudes towards the whole energy problem, and the orderly assembly of a whole range of substitutes for petrol, especially as a transport fuel, is coloured by this kind of publicity. They are falsely reassured. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked a number of questions of Esso at that stage. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) What is a likely and feasible timetable for motor spirit production from Rundle on a significant scale, at prices competitive with other possibilities . . . ?</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) What cost per litre is considered feasible and on what basis?</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) What actual yield of</PARA>
<PARA> (a) oil, and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) motor spirit fractions</PARA>
<PARA>are likely from each ton of shale?</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) What power source is contemplated for mining, crushing and heat for extraction?</PARA>
<PARA> (v) How does this compare with the final energy product?</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) What actual capital cost is likely for the project, and on what basis? Figures as varying at 2 to 8 billions have been mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the case at that time. I went on to ask:</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) What amounts are budgeted to cover environment matters, especially rehabilitation of the land after stripmining, which does, of course, come rather expensive?</PARA>
<PARA> (viii) What water use is contemplated and where will the water come from?</PARA>
<PARA> (ix) What are the costs of extracting motor spirit from Rundle crude?</PARA>
<PARA>I went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> My concern is that the Parliament and the public sees the project realistically and that indeed it is slotted reasonably to its proper place-especially in terms of timing-in a sensible overall energy policy. </PARA>
<PARA> To me, this view seems only prudent. There is also this consideration: If the public are primed for undue expectations about Rundle, and these are not realised, they may not be very pleased. You might have something resembling another Poseidon on your hands. </PARA>
<PARA>I wrote that letter to Esso nearly a year ago. The reply I received, I must say, was a considered and a fairly responsible one. It was considered and responsible to the effect that most of the questions I raised in fact were admitted as not being amenable to answer. Esso's letter to me states:</PARA>
<PARA> The figures you quote of eighteen to twenty years at best for Rundle oil to be at full capacity may therefore be somewhat pessimistic, although of course, there are substantial technological and other uncertainties associated with the project which could delay development. </PARA>
<PARA>This letter was written on 14 July 1980. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> If we are able to meet the timing estimates outlined above, we would hope to have the first stage of Phase 2 of Rundle built and providing feedstock to Australian refineries by the early 1990's, so that Rundle should be making a very significant contribution to Australia's need for petrol during the 1990's. This again is somewhat earlier than your previous advice of the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA>There is another point worth quoting from the Esso letter. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> We expect that Australians will not have to pay more for petrol refined from Rundle synthetic crude oil as the latter is expected to be priced competitively with imported crude oil. There should be no difference in the price of petrol to the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA>I mentioned that paragraph because it coincides, I think, entirely with what Senator Carrick said at that time. I remember asking him a question as to whether there would be any subsidies. He answered me by saying that indeed, Rundle would have to compete with synthetics and other things on the market. Esso went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> We are unable to provide you with estimates of energy consumed during the process because of uncertainties mainly involved with hydrogenation. </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is the process of elevating the product to motor spirit. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> We have not yet carried out any significant tests on how much of the project's gas output will be required to be converted to hydrogen for upgrading the raw liquids, and how much will be available for power generation or sale. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . Esso has made preliminary estimates which indicate that costs may be significantly greater. However, over the next two years, in-depth studies will be conducted which will define the scope of the project and its costs. Upon completion of these studies, SPP/CPM and Esso will be in a better position to provide definitive cost estimates. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . I agree entirely with you that the project should be seen realistically by the Government and the public, and we will certainly be working vigorously to accomplish this, especially as our own knowledge of the project improves over the next year or so. I might mention that as a first step, we are planning to conduct several half-day Rundle informational seminars in Brisbane, Gladstone and Canberra during August for interested Government staff to ensure they are as fully informed as possible on Rundle matters and that many previously misleading perceptions are clarified in a professional and responsible manner. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, those matters apparently were not clarified. That was on 14 June. According to figures in the Australian Financial Review, in August-only the following month-Central Pacific Minerals NL shares went up to $66 and Southern Pacific Petroleum NL shares went up to $23. At the end of September-I remember this circumstance very well, as will all honourable senators; this was only two or three weeks before the Federal election-everywhere I went I heard continual statements coming from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), Senator Carrick and Mr Anthony about Rundle and how much of a linchpin it was. I remember how big an electioneering point it was and how much was made of it. I think there is very little doubt of that. That month Central Pacific shares went to $76 on the Brisbane market. Southern Pacific shares went to $29.50. Then we had the election. After that, something happened. By October the shares of Central Pacific had dropped to $9.80 and the shares of Southern Pacific had dropped to $3.70. Obviously something happened at about that time, whatever it was, to affect the confidence of the market. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That could make that extraordinary difference. Thank you very much for making that point. Nevertheless, Central Pacific shares are down to $3.50 and Southern Pacific shares are down to $1.35. The point is not so much what happened to the value of the shares subsequently, but the rise over that period. In January the shares were $4.50. They went up pretty slowly. By June they were $6.20 or $6.60. Then they went to $47 and then to $76. There was a remarkable increase in the price of those shares which coincided with the time that Rundle was being extolled by the Government for whatever reasons. Obviously, the development of Rundle was used in the election campaign because it was seen at least partially as being a central part of government energy policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats think that in view of the circumstances the Minister would be most unwise now to try to paint the prospects for Rundle in brighter colours than is justified. With all respect I suggest to the Minister that perhaps he feels he has a responsibility to the Australian public not to do that. Enough damage has already been done over this matter. Surely it is better not to have the situation dragged out and drawn on in some way in which the Australian public will feel that Rundle will still meet earlier expectations. This is not to say that it will not eventually be of value to this country. Of course it may be of value to this country. I would be the first to hope that it would be. It is essential, if there is to be any confidence at all by the public in the Government's energy policy and in investment in private enterprise, that people know over a period what they can invest in safely. I think perhaps it devolves on the Minister to get the facts as soon as he can and make a fully considered statement on how he sees the future of the Rundle project. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me from what I have read so far of the Esso statements which are reported in the Australian Financial Review of today in a fair degree of detail that the project, if it is going to be practicable at all, will not realise anything like the expectations that were predicted nor is it likely in any case to do so at an early date. That has been said pretty plainly by Esso and I do not think there is any reason for the Minister to say anything other than that. I do not think it is the time for reassurance to the public that Rundle is fine and has no problems. I do not think that is the case at all. </PARA>
<PARA> What we suggest is an urgent reappraisal of our energy program so that proven, known technology can be used to provide petroleum substitutes in Australia. The Minister and others in the Government are talking much these days about oil from coal projects. I suggest, on the information I have, if they go on doing so, that they may well be riding for another fall similar to the one they have had-and quite a tumble it has been-over the Rundle shale project. My advice is that there are grave problems about the conversion of very many Australian coals to oil, that these problems often cannot be predicted in advance and that indeed virtually a different process may be necessary in the conversion process for coal coming from different seams and areas in the same mine because of the peculiar qualities. There again we have to look with caution. Please do not let us have another Rundle shale debacle over oil from coal. I do not agree with the Labor Party that we can rely on finding another oil field. It would be great if we could, but as far as one can see and the best opinions one can derive show that we are not likely to be able to find another major oil field in this country. I wish we could, but we cannot depend on it in a country where we need motor spirit so much. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an area of great promise and I have raised it time and again in this Senate over the last three years and that is the conversion of methanol from natural gas, of which we have a great deal in Australia, along the lines that are being pursued by the New Zealand Government in the Maui field. The Minister has responded to questions that I have asked him from time to time by saying: 'We are looking at it'. How well are we looking at it? We have natural gas. It is a known technology. It can be costed. It can also be demonstrated to be very favourably priced in terms of the present imported cost of Middle East crude. Why are we not going ahead? Why do we not insist that the North West Shelf consortium and possibly our other gas people go ahead with the production of methanol along the lines of this technology so that at least we can get a 10 per cent additive to our fuel and we are covered to that extent? I would dearly like to know-perhaps Senator Young can tell me-why production of this sort which is being pushed all over the world, is being ignored in Australia and why we are dragging the chain when we know that time is against us so much in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that it would be no wonder after the performance of the shares of the Rundle twins and the whole of the history of the project so far if Australian investors shied clear of energy developments in future. If the shares on Rundle were talked up it will be darn hard to talk up shares again on anything else, I think that is for sure. Then our Government will cry: 'We cannot get local investment. Local people will not invest in these sorts of things. We will have to go over to some foreign corporation'. What we need now is a respectable well-thought out energy program which takes into account all the areas of possible assistance to this country. None of these things alone-methanol, ethanol and oil from coal-can support us, but all of them put together may well provide us with a policy which will give us the means of providing ourselves with a reasonable quantity of motor spirit if some problem emerges. We could get a problem in the Middle East at any time, as we know. It could drop on us within a matter of months, weeks or days. I think we should be ready for it. We are not ready for it now. The Minister talks about conservation. I draw his attention to a report in today's Australian under the heading 'A waste of energy' in the 'Executive Suite' section. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Is size important?</PARA>
<PARA> For company cars it apparently is. </PARA>
<PARA> Well-known motoring consultatnt, Peter Wherrett, put the latest dispute into gear at a dinner function--</PARA>

<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Only 5 per cent of fleet owners took effective cost efficiency action; 65 per cent had no cost control at all; 80 per cent were running inefficient and costly vehicle fleets; . . . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During this debate Senator Carrick, the Minister for National Development and Energy and the Leader of the Government in this place, has been accused by the Opposition of doing an oversell of Rundle. Certain quotes have been given in this chamber of answers or statements by the Minister. It is unfortunate that they have been very selective quotes. To counter the situation I will be selective by quoting some of the Minister's responses to questions asked in this place in regard to the Rundle oil shale project. On 4 March 1980-I repeat the date, 4 March 1980, which is quite some time ago-in answer to a question from Senator McIntosh from the Australian Labor Party the Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the fact of the matter is that shale may well be there in those kinds of quantities but it becomes a viable resource only when it is known that in the capacity of technology and within the cost structure that is viable to us--</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the words 'it is known that in the capacity of technology and within the cost structure that is viable to us'-</PARA>
<PARA> It can be a usable resource. </PARA>
<PARA>Where in that statement is this oversell? The Minister went on:</PARA>
<PARA> At this moment oil shale in Australia has yet to be proved to be a usable resource . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was the Minister's statement on 4 March 1980. Let me move on to May 1980. Again, from the Minister, I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Australia is in a strong position to strengthen its domestic supply by developing the synthetic and crude oil resources. The initial emphasis we believe will be placed on shale oil which is close to being cost competitive at today's price for imported crude at $24.77 per barrel. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a quote from the report of Esso Australia. I emphasise that was the Esso report that the Minister was quoting; those words were not the Minister's. If those honourable senators opposite wish to challenge the Minister for doing an oversell or anybody else I suggest they should go out and challenge Esso. Let me refer to the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on 26 August 1980. He said, in his statement on energy policy and resource development:</PARA>
<PARA> Rundle is only one of several rich oil shale deposits. If it proves to be viable it will almost certainly lead the way in its technology--</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the words 'lead the way in its technology'; in other words, it would open up a new field in Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>in the development of a great new industry for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>We hear only ifs. Having said that, let us look at the statements of the Labor Party that Rundle is a dead issue. The Labor Party has proposed this matter of public importance today in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The failure of the Government's energy strategy, as illustrated by the shelving of the Rundle project. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Oxford Dictionary the definition of 'shelve' is 'To lay aside or defer consideration of'. Where in the statements by the Rundle consortium is it said that this project has been shelved or laid aside? It has not been deferred, nor has it been laid aside. It was stated in this morning's Press that the Rundle twin companies and Esso:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . wish to proceed with further work and plan to discuss a revised joint venture agreement that would permit such work to determine whether or not a project on a commercial scale is technically and economically viable and in what time frame. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Mason picked up the point about the time frame. Nowhere in that statement did it say that the project had been deferred or put aside. The statement spelled out clearly that the consortium is doing a revision of the whole situation. The economics of the whole project will be dependent upon the results of the feasibility study-and the time slot-in other words the price of crude oil throughout the world at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> Why has the consortium come to this situation? Esso has already spent $30m in an inquiry into Rundle and as a result of that inquiry it has recommended a completely new plan of attack which will take in a lot more study of the physical problems encountered in the study. It has also said that in all probability, if feasible, it will by-pass a demonstration plant, which plant could have cost a terrific amount of money. Why has it made these statements? I would have thought that the Opposition would pick up these things in this morning's Press. They were spelled out clearly in this morning's Press. It dealt with the problems and the reasons why the consortium made yesterday's statement. It dealt with the geological problems, stating that a portion of the resource will be very difficult to extract. We have been given certain estimates of tonnages or barrels equivalent of oil, but now the companies have had to reduce that estimate in real terms because, after further inquiry, they now see a problem with regard to the mining of this resource. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the retort pilot tests. The companies have already indicated that the yields will be lower than those estimated in May 1980. They have also noted that they will have to upgrade the quality of the shale oil itself. That in itself means added problems, added costs. They have also said that the estimates for electricity and water costs have increased and that manpower requirements have also increased. Because of all these other cost considerations that have come to light as a result of the $30m feasibility study, it has been estimated that the cost of the total project could be tripled. So the capital costs could be as high as $10 billion. Of course, these costs have to be recouped, so they have to be related back to a price per barrel. I come back to the point made by Senator Mason. He said, not in the image of a Doomsday prophet-unlike members of the Labor Party-that he hopes that Rundle will be a viable proposition one day but that that will depend upon the price of crude oil at the time. We find that the estimates given in this morning's Press vary between $44 and $57 a barrel and no doubt we will see even higher estimates tomorrow. But we know that the estimate is already way above the current crude oil price based on the price of Saudi crude oil, which price applies under our import parity policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to the import parity policy. I wish to quote comments that were made early in the piece with regard to the Rundle project. Mr Schaefer of the Esso company was asked whether the project could have gone ahead without import or world parity oil pricing. When asked whether it was a Government pricing victory for a Government pricing policy, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> It's a victory if you like, but certainly it is true. Without todays and the projected prices for crude oil, the Rundle development would not be viable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just dealt with the projected prices for crude oil. The thing that has amazed me today is that the Opposition has seen fit virtually to slander the Minister, and to accuse the Government of an oversell. Opposition members have carried on with crocodile tears about the Rundle project. But would there ever have been a Rundle project in this country or would any company have been prepared to have spent some $30m in research if the Labor Party policies had been in operation or if we as a Government had listened to the Labor Party? Under Labor there would never have been an import parity pricing policy in this country. One can turn to so many other areas in which, had it not been for import parity pricing today we would not-I repeat 'not'-have had the alternative fuels that have been discussed in this place, be it ethanol, methanol, fuel from coal liquefaction or anything else. None of these things would be economically viable without import parity pricing. This is the crux of the whole situation in Australia today. We on this side are accused of not having an energy policy. Without import parity pricing, no policy that would lead to future development and expansion of resources in this country would be operative. I was interested to hear Senator Button, as I understood him, in answer to an interjection from Senator Carrick, say that it is no good talking about the number of wells drilled in 1975, as it is now 1981. He said that the best thing we could do would be to find another oil field and that that is where an energy policy should be directed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is the basis for encouragement for oil companies to explore for oil at present? There is only one basis-import parity pricing. I was at the Australian Petroleum Export Association conference in Adelaide yesterday. Over 1,000 delegates from Australia and overseas attended. When members of the Opposition talk about multi- national corporations, perhaps I should remind them that over three-quarters of the members of the executive of the APEA group are Australians. That is not a bad track record for an oil industry. Time and time again speakers at yesterday's conference made it perfectly clear that one of the greatest things that has happened this country to revive the enthusiasm that is evident in Australia is this Government's policy with regard to import parity pricing. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that honourable senators will read the verbatim report of a speech given by one of the leading oil men in the United States of America from one of that country's biggest companies. I refer to a man by the name of Mr Grivetti. He was one of the lead speakers at yesterday's conference. Whilst he dealt principally with financing, he dealt with many other aspects also. He dealt with the probabilities and possibilities of finding more oil and gas, throughout the world and in Australia in particular. The one thing that he emphasised was that overseas companies have the expertise, the capacity, to explore. There are many countries to which they will not go today, even though they know that prospects for oil discovery are good. The risks involved are too great. He went on to say that, even though we may not find any more big deposits such as that at Bass Strait, even though we may never find in Australia deposits of oil as large as those in the North Sea, and even though we may not have major finds as large as some of those in Alberta or the Middle East, a lot more oil and gas will be found in this continent of Australia both on-shore and off-shore. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Grivetti also said: 'Many companies will come here to help you find that oil and gas because Australia is a favoured country, because your Government is stable and because your policies are sensible. While governments give incentives to companies to come here and risk their money, companies will be prepared to take that risk, but while governments screw companies down, companies will not come here; they will go elsewhere because they must get a return on their risk and investment capital.' That was a very important statement for him to make. Other delegates at that conference, in particular two delegates from Canada, made it perfectly clear that they will look to Australia rather than to Canada to invest capital because the Canadian Government has become too tight with regard to the oil industry in that country. I think the bringing forward by the Opposition of this matter of public importance today was ill-timed. Not one basic argument has been propounded in this place. I support the Minister and all the statements he made today and the Government's policy. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not oppose the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Bill 1981. If honourable senators are profoundly interested in this subject, I suggest that they read the Hansard of the House of Representatives where the subject was extensively dealt with by a number of speakers. In the course of my brief remarks I will make one or two points about the legislation. I wish, firstly, to say why we welcome it and, secondly, to point to one or two factors which ought to be considered in the future. For some time Australia has made a claim to a very significant portion of the Antarctic. Three-sevenths of the total area of the Antarctic is claimed by Australia. That represents an area equivalent to 6 million square kilometres. For some time Opposition spokesmen and indeed Government members have urged that in order to justify the extent of that claim to the Antarctic Australia should show a little more tangible interest in it than has been the case in the past. We should do a little more about asserting our interests. In that context it is not sufficient, in our view, to spend $55m as is now happening on the upgrading of the Antarctic bases, but it does require a somewhat greater presence and more particularly a greater research and development effort in the Antarctic than has been embarked upon to date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our claim to such a substantial area imposes on us obligations of a foreign policy kind. The resources of the Antarctic are probably potentially enormous in terms of food and a variety of resources which as yet we probably do not know enough about; we ought to know more. We, as a relatively rich and developed country-I emphasise the word 'relatively'-have I think a moral obligation in relation to the Antarctic. If the Law of the Sea Convention is ultimately passed we will have definite moral obligations in respect of other underdeveloped countries in South East Asia and their sharing in the resources of the Antarctic. It is important that from time to time we consider the importance of the Antarctic as a responsibility which we have in part assumed and that we do so in terms somewhat similar to the terms and spirit in which this treaty or convention is embraced in the context of this legislation. I refer the Senate to the principal point which the contracting parties undertook in connection with this Bill. The convention appears as a Schedule to the Bill and its primary aim is the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources. The Schedule refers to the undertakings of the contracting parties. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Recognising the importance of safeguarding the environment and protecting the integrity of the ecosystem of the seas surrounding Antarctica;</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Considering that it is essential to increase knowledge of the Antarctic marine ecosystem and its components so as to be able to base decisions on harvesting on sound scientific information;</PARA>
<PARA>The Schedule then sets out the terms of the convention. In the convention there is a lot of use of the expression 'rational use', an expression which is not defined. Perhaps that does not matter if policies are developed which display rational use of the living resources-that is, fish, birds, seals crustaceans, other animals-and the marine ecosystem. Many of the discussions which have taken place about this legislation have been devoted to the krill resources of the Antarctic area, their potential as a source of food in the future and the need for both research and development in relation to that matter as well as a number of other matters. </PARA>
<PARA> We welcome the Bill because it legislates for Australia to become an official member of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. I think that if we are not first, we are high in the pecking order in our acknowledgment of this convention. It is doubly welcome to Australia in the sense that the Commission's headquarters is to be established at Hobart. The most important point the Opposition would like to make about that is that the establishment of the headquarters at Hobart really imposes on Australia further ongoing obligations in relation to the degree of effort we make as a nation in Antarctica, a degree of effort not only in terms of the specific subject matter of this Bill, namely, marine living resources, but also in terms of research generally in Antarctica and the need to upgrade our research effort. </PARA>
<PARA> For those reasons, we believe that the step taken by this legislation is an important one, and it is welcome. It points us in the right direction, as it were, and more importantly, it points up the need for greater effort in this area if we are to honour both our foreign policy obligations and the moral obligations we take on by making such a large claim to Antarctic territory. Having said that, I wish this Bill a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Bill gives the Senate an opportunity to debate some of Australia's international responsibilities concerning the Antarctic. Debates on Antarctic matters tend to be extremely truncated in this place. The last debate we had on conservation of Antarctic resources occurred just before the Senate rose last May. A very important piece of legislation went through the Senate in a matter of a few minutes and did not give any opportunity for an exploration of the responsibilities Australia has taken on with regard to the Antarctic. In an historical sense, Australia's relationship with the Antarctic has been a particularly long one. The continent was first described by Captain Cook in an account of his voyages between 1772 and 1775, and at a later date Australian explorers were among the first in the Antarctic. It is interesting to note that on one of Sir Douglas Mawson's early expeditions to the Antarctic the first record was made of the fact that there were mineral deposits worth exploiting in the Antarctic, and that is a matter to which I shall return later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1933 this Parliament passed the Australian Antarctic Territory Acceptance Act, which in section 2 states:</PARA>
<PARA> That part of the territory in the Antarctic seas which comprises all the islands and territories, other than Adelie Land, situated south of the 60th degree south latitude and lying between the 160th degree east longitude and the 45th degree east longitude, is hereby declared to be accepted by the Commonwealth as a Territory under the authority of the Commonwealth, by the name of the Australian Antarctic Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>That means that the responsibilities of the Commonwealth Government towards the Antarctic are precisely the same as its responsibilities towards any of its other external territories, or the Australian Capital Territory for that matter. By the passage of the Antarctic Treaty Act in 1960 Australia accepted certain international obligations, and the Schedule to that Act, the Antarctic Treaty, contains a number of very important provisions. For the purposes of this Bill, the most important of those provisions is to be found in Article IX, which indicates the principles and objectives of the treaty, including matters relating to the use of Antarctica for peaceful purposes only, the facilitation of scientific research in Antarctica, the facilitation of international scientific co-operation in Antarctica, the facilitation of the exercise of the rights of inspections provided for in Article VII of the treaty, questions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction in Antarctica, and the preservation and conservation of living resources in Antarctica. It is to sub-paragraph 1 (f) of Article IX, 'preservation and conservation of living resources in Antarctica', that this piece of legislation is directed. We have always asserted our territorial claims over that part of Antarctica described in the original acceptance treaty. During the second reading debate on the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Bill on 23 April 1980 the then Minister for Science and the Environment (Mr Thomson) spoke in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The Antarctic Treaty is a cornerstone of international and Australian policies for Antarctica. Maintenance of Australia's sovereignty over the Australian Antarctic Territory is, of course, the other major consideration in our policy. </PARA>
<PARA>We have continued to reassert our sovereign claims. In an article on Antarctica, appearing in the Australian Foreign Affairs Review January 1981, under the sub-heading 'Sovereignty' it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's claim rests upon discovery and formal taking of possession by the United Kingdom, and then a continuous display of Australian occupation and administration after passage of the Australian Antarctic Acceptance Act of 1933. </PARA>
<PARA>The Harries Committee on Australia's Relations with the Third World, which reported in September 1979, spent some time in its report 'Australia and the Third World' dealing with the question of the Antarctic. In relation to Australia's policy interests, it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Our policy interests are:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to maintain Antarctica as an area free from strategic and/or political confrontation;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to provide adequate protection for the Antarctic environment, having regard both to its unique qualities and its possible effect on our own region;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) to take advantage of the unique opportunities the region offers for scientific research;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) to be informed and consulted about development in a region geographically proximate to Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) to derive, if possible, economic benefit from the living and non-living resources of the Australian Antarctic Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard paragraphs 199 to 210 of the Harries report, which deal with the question of Antarctic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>K: ANTARCTICA</PARA>
<PARA> 199. Australian policy towards Antarctica is based on the premise that the region is an important one in which we have a history of involvement. As a consequence Australia has sought to maintain an adequate level of activity there and, as one of the twelve original signatories of the Antarctic Treaty of 1959, to have its position respected and its voice heard in international forums concerned with Antarctic affairs. Our policy interests are:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to maintain Antarctica as an area free from strategic and/or political confrontation;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to provide adequate protection for the Antarctic environment, having regard both to its unique qualities and its possible effect on our own region;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) to take advantage of the unique opportunities the region offers for scientific research;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) to be informed and consulted about development in a region geographically proximate to Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) to derive, if possible, economic benefit from the living and non-living resources of the Australian Antarctic Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia has sought to protect these interests through policies directed towards:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the maintenance of sovereignty over the Australian Antarctic Territory (AAT);</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the preservation of the Antarctic Treaty and the use of its consultative framework; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the maintenance of an Australian presence and the carrying out of a program of scientific research and exploration activity in the AAT. </PARA>
<PARA>International Interest in Antarctic Resources 200. The Antarctic Treaty contains no provisions specifically governing the exploitation of the resources of Antarctica. A significant recent development has been a growing international perception that the resources of Antarctica may be both accessible and rich, and a corresponding growth of interest in the possibility of their exploitation. Interest in Antarctic resources has been shown by United Nations bodies, particularly the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). </PARA>
<PARA> 201. The concern of some Third World countries that the Antarctic Treaty Parties may act soon to exploit the resources for their own benefit could precipitate proposals to internationalise Antarctica. The recognition of the 'common heritage' concept in relation to the deep sea-bed in the Law of the Sea Conference is likely to stimulate moves for application of a similar concept to Antarctica. There has already been evidence of such moves in both United Nations bodies and in the Non-Aligned Movement. These developments raise the basic questions of the longer term tenability of Australian sovereignty over the AAT; of the extent to which the maintenance of sovereignty over the AAT might jeopardise the continuance of the Antarctic Treaty, including its demilitarisation, peaceful uses and non-nuclearisation provisions; and of what arrangements in the Antarctic would best serve Australia's wider foreign policy interests, including our concern about our relations with the other Treaty Parties and the Third World. </PARA>
<PARA> 202. Third World interest in the living resources of the Southern Ocean has been mentioned at recent meetings of the FAO Committee on Fisheries (COFI). Moves have been made in COFI, supported by Third World countries, to give COFI an active role in the management of the living resources of the Southern Ocean. These have been opposed by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties on the grounds that, while FAO and COFI have an undeniably legitimate interest in the living marine resources of the Southern Ocean, their proper role is one of information-gathering and evaluation. Moreover, the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties have a demonstrable role in the management of Antarctica and are currently engaged in the preparation of a regime for the conservation (and therefore the responsible management) of Antarctica's marine living resources. In response to this, COFI has been prepared to modify its ambitions with regard to management. However, there is continuing pressure among the Third World countries in COFI and any failure or undue delay on the part of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties to conclude a responsible regime for the living resources of the Southern Ocean will undoubtedly result in further moves to have COFI more involved in the management of the living marine resources of the Southern Ocean. To date, the Antarctic Treaty partners have also been successful in heading off other Third World initiatives, including those by Sri Lanka aimed at persuading the United Nations General Assembly to adopt a resolution for the internationalisation of Antarctica and that country's efforts in October 1976 to have included in the Declaration of the Non-Aligned Conference words to the effect that Antarctica was the common heritage of mankind. But it would seem likely that unless the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties can demonstrate a capacity to develop satisfactory resource regimes the dangers of Third World pressure building up will increase. </PARA>
<PARA> 203. Australian policy must take account of the foregoing developments. However, other factors, which are difficult to assess, must also be taken into account. These include the outcome of the Law of the Sea Conference, the attitudes of the other Antarctic Treaty partners, the economic/technological feasibility of exploiting Antarctic resources, and whether international pressures will strengthen among Third World countries in such a way as to require any change in our policy. Nevertheless, three possible policy approaches can be identified. They are:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) Strict Adherence to Sovereignty 204. Australia has so far adopted the position in discussions among Treaty partners that nothing should be done in relation to the resources question which is not basically compatible with our sovereignty. This has been possible in the past because there has been little substantial discussion of resources in the Treaty context; such a position becomes harder to sustain as interest in resources grows. </PARA>
<PARA> 205. The obvious advantage of a policy of strict adherence to sovereignty is that, if it were sustainable in political and enforcement terms, it would allow Australia to determine all aspects of the development of the AAT and its off-shore areas. We would be able to regulate exploitation, in the same way that we now regulate the mining industry in Australia. Such a policy would also meet our environmental interests by enabling us to impose our own standards and controls. However, in view of the very limited international recognition of our claim, there must be doubt as to whether it would be sustainable as it becomes feasible to exploit the resources in the region. At the least we would need to allow access on generous terms. If the sovereignty issue became contentious, we would have to consider whether the price, in terms of our international standing and broader political and economic interests and relations, would make a policy of strict adherence to sovereignty worthwhile. Such a policy would be seen by many developing countries as running counter to their ambitions; it could also run counter to the interests of the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan and other non-claimant Treaty Parties. </PARA>
<PARA>(b) Internationalisation 206. Another approach would be to accept the internationalisation of Antarctica if it is proposed, or, indeed, to promote it. The premises of this approach would be that Australia cannot hope successfully to assert exclusive control of the resources of the AAT and its off-shore area, that increasing Third World pressure is inevitable, that the Treaty itself, based as it is on a privileged position for twelve (now thirteen1) countries, will not provide a long-term solution, and that a new and comprehensive international regime for Antarctica can be established. Australia might therefore anticipate this situation through a bold and generous initiative to propose the internationalisation of Antarctica and the preservation of Antarctic resources for all mankind. Australia's acceptance or sponsorship of internationalisation, and our geographical position, might enable us to retain a measure of political influence and a share of economic benefits (including possible use of Australian bases or entrepot facilities) under any eventual international regime for Antarctic resource exploitation. But this is essentially conjectural and any international 'appreciation' might be shortlived. However, to the extent that internationalisation could prevent Antarctica from becoming a scene of international discord, our defence interests would be served. It might also be conjecture that such a policy would enhance Australia's international standing, particularly among the Third World, with consequent advantates in other areas of foreign interest. </PARA>
<PARA> 207. Such an initiative, if successful, would, however, mean the end of Australian sovereignty over the AAT, and domestic political repercussions could be expected. It would be highly desirable-some might say a prerequisite-for there to be full consultation with out our Antarctic Treaty partners with the object of obtaining their agreement. We should, however, have no illusions that the other Treaty Powers would be likely to support such an approach; and we would incur the displeasure, and indeed the anger, of at least some of them, for advancing it. It would also mean giving up to the international community most of any economic benefits and the exclusive environmental controls which sovereignty, in theory, gives us. Whether the 'spin-off' Australia might derive from participating in an international regime for Antarctica would compensate, and whether international environmental controls would meet our requirements, could not be forecast at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA>(c) To Build on the Antarctic Treaty 208. Another course-and the course in fact followed in current policy-is to seek to work within the Antarctic Treaty framework to develop new regimes to handle resource questions, together with the related questions of conservation and protection of the environment. In pursuing this course our basic objective is to derive as many as possible of the benefits of sovereignty rights over resources, including the living marine resources within Australia's future 200 mile off-shore zone, without sacrificing our other policy objectives. In the context of the Treaty it is necessary to negotiate on the basis of sovereignty; but, in the recognition that the full exercise of sovereignty is unlikely to be sustainable, we have accepted that some flexibility is necessary in order to encourage others to participate with Australia in promoting mutually beneficial regimes for the exploitation of living resources and, at a later date, non-living resources. </PARA>
<PARA> 209. The draft regime for Antarctic marine living resources, which is currently being negotiated by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties, aims at the long-term conservation of these resources, thus ensuring their preservation as a future world food source. The establishment of such a regime by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties can be presented as a responsible action taken in the broader interests of the international community. </PARA>
<PARA> 210. The Committee has felt obliged to address itself to Australia's interest and policies in relation to Antarctica because they clearly have Third World dimensions which could become more important with time. However, it does not feel called upon to make any recommendation in terms of the options canvassed.</PARA>
<PARA> 1 The thirteen Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties are Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, South Africa, the USSR, the United Kingdom and the United States. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The important thing to note is that the report indicated that one of Australia's policy interests should be to derive, if possible, economic benefits from the living and non-living resources of the Australian Antarctic Territory. It is important to understand that the peace and co-operation which so far have existed in Antarctica could well be set at risk if there is to be a major scramble at any future stage for the exploration and exploitation of mineral and especially hydrocarbon resources which may or may not be available in Antarctia, which may or may not be recoverable in Antarctica.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have said something about the assertion of Australia's territorial sovereignty in the Antarctic, but I would not want it to be thought that this has gone without challenge. In an article by D. W. Greig entitled 'Territory Sovereignty and the Status of Antarctica' in Australian Outlook of August 1978, a considerable amount of space is devoted to a discussion of whether our territorial claims are proper and legitimate, and whether, as Senator Button indicated, our occasional seeming lack of presence and activity in Antarctica has pre-judiced those claims and laid them open to challenge by other treaty parties and by non-treaty parties. Greig in his article concludes I think very correctly when he says:</PARA>
<PARA> Extravagant claims to sovereignty are a source of discord. They exacerbate existing jealousies and rivalries. The moderation of claims needs not to be regarded as 'giving way' if it can be explained by the standard of what can rationally be demonstrated as reasonable. Even in the narrow perspective of the Parties to the Antarctic Treaty, the concept of more limited territorial rights within areas claimed could advance the cause of corporate action. Certainly Australia, a country which is scarcely in a position to assert unilaterally its claims to sovereignty, has much to gain from initiating adjustments that could promote stability and avoid confrontation. At the right time and in an appropritate context, recognition of the fact that Australia's (and the other claimants') rights are something less than sovereign could serve both those objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, Mr Alan Renouf, former head of the Department of Foreign Affairs, in his recent book made a considerable plea for Australia to renounce its territorial claims in the Antarctic, something I certainly reject. In August 1979 I put a question to Senator Carrick, representing the Foreign Minister, about the Government's response to Mr Renouf's book. In a reply given to me by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It remains the Government's policy to maintain sovereignty over the Australian Antarctic Territory. Under Australian law, the AAT has the constitutional status of an Australian territory similar to that of any other federal territory. The Government has no intention of undoing what has been accomplished over the years by its legislation on the AAT. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, in the second reading speech to the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Bill 1981, as recorded on page 1008 of the House of Representatives Hansard, the Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Australian sovereignty in the Australian Antarctic territory is in no way prejudiced by the Convention. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Convention essentially entered into at this stage. The Antarctic Treaty, I regret to say, has been plagued by a number of difficulties arising in the international environment. A backgrounder of the Department of Foreign Affairs published only last month indicates some expansion of membership of the consultative parties to the Antarctic Treaty and indicates that at the thirteenth Antarctic Treaty consultative parties meeting held in Buenos Aires in February and March this year the Federal Republic of Germany was added to the list of treaty parties. Poland, of course, had previously been added to the original signatories to the Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate although I have said that international politics has nevertheless intruded, it is of some significance that the Soviet Union particularly has sought to exclude certain parties from participation in Antarctic Treaty matters. The Netherlands, although having acceded to the Treaty, and South Korea, which is actively interested in the question of fishing resources, have been excluded from full participation by the Soviets on the basis that it requires the unanimous consent of all parties to add further parties to the Treaty and to negotiations. It is certainly true that China has now indicated an interest in the Antarctic and the possibility of seeking to join the international regime. Perhaps the most disappointing of all these events was that during the discussions held in May 1980 in Canberra to bring about agreement on the international regime the Soviet Union was very anxious to exclude the European communities from participation in that Treaty. Senator Sibraa who, like myself, was one of the alternative parliamentary delegates who attended part of that meeting, will know the enormous amount of time wasted by the attempts of the European communities and others to play some meaningful role in the development of an international regime and the frustration they were accorded by the activities of some of the existing parties. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make a final two points on that subject. I indicated that the People's Republic of China appears to be gaining some interest in Antarctica. A recent Chinese Government delegation, in fact, visited the Antarctic and was accorded some hospitality in the Australian section of the Antarctic. The most disturbing thing I find, however, as far as the international regime is concerned is the possibility of the area being used for nuclear testing by the French. In a publication put out at the Conference on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources a question was asked as to the attitude of the French government and in particular in reference to statements made by Monsieur Bourge, the French Minister for Defence, who refused to confirm or deny that there are plans to move the French nuclear test site from Muroroa to Kerguelen Island which is one of the islands adjacent to the Antarctic. At the international treaty meeting held in Canberra in May last year specific exclusions were made for Kerguelen Island for some of the other operations of the international regime. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, this treaty has been a long time in coming. It was first started at the eighth meeting of the consultative parties held in Oslo in 1975. It then worked its way through to the ninth treaty meeting in London in 1977 and the tenth treaty meeting in Washington in 1979. It eventually saw the light of day at the meeting held in Canberra. I want to say a couple of things about that. The first is to offer my congratulations to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs for the way in which the international convention meeting was managed and for the chairmanship of Mr Ryan, a Deputy Secretary, I think, of the Department who, as chairman of the international meeting, handled some very difficult situations with great ability. I also mention Mr Brennan, the chief Australian delegate to that meeting, who made an enormous contribution to the deliberations and to the final outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> I was glad to see that the Australian Parliament decided that it should be represented at this meeting. Delegates and alternative delegates from both Houses were appointed. It gave me a great deal of pleasure that when the final treaty was actually drawn up and opened for signature, apart from its being signed by ambassador Brennan and one of the other Foreign Affairs officers present, an invitation was extended to me on behalf of Government delegates, and to Mr Jacobi, on behalf of Opposition delegates, actually to sign that treaty on behalf of the Australian delegation. The other point that I think was important to note about that meeting was that for just about the first time, with the possible exception of the meetings of the International Whaling Commission, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Peacock, made arrangements for non-government organisations to be represented, to have observers present and to be included in the deliberations of the Australian delegation. A Friends of the Earth representative, Michael Kennedy, the individual concerned, wrote to the Minister on 28 April 1980 indicating that Friends of the Earth would like to record its thanks to the Government and to the Parliament for its inclusion in that delegation. </PARA>
<PARA> That convention led fairly promptly to the passage of the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Bill 1980. That has now led to the legislation currently being considered which seeks ratification of the final instrument agreed to at the Canberra meeting. As I said, this Bill implements the Convention's conservation regime. It is important to understand that the regime itself breaks new ground. It is the first occasion on which a convention has been based upon a conservation standard which embodies an ecosystem approach to conservation. It seeks to protect not only harvested species but also the entire ecosystem including species dependent on the harvested species. In this way it differs from traditional fisheries arrangements which seek to protect only the target resource. This is the third international agreement touching on the Antarctic to which Australia has become party. The first was in 1972 with Australian accession to the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic seals. </PARA>
<PARA> I make a plea to the Minister to indicate, in responding to this debate this afternoon, why it is that Australia although having agreed to become a party to that international convention in 1972 has not yet seen fit to give formal ratification to that treaty. The second international agreement, of course, included those 1980 agreed measures which, as I said, found their expression in the previous piece of legislation, the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980. Clause 8 of the legislation currently being considered contains a series of very broad prohibitions. They are prohibitions which provide that a person should not do any harvesting or research in the Antarctic with respect to prohibited marine organisms unless it is done in accordance with a permit granted by the Minister. An elaborate permit system is established under clause 9 and subsequent clauses allow for the suspension, cancellation and variation of the permit. The clauses allow for the appointment of inspectors and for arrest without warrant which, apparently, is necessary since the difficulty of obtaining a warrant in the Antarctic to arrest an offender poses some difficulties, I suppose. They also provide for review of those variations, suspensions and alterations in the permit system to be appealable to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Button said, the headquarters of this new organisation which arises as a result of the Bill is to be located in Hobart. That is to the credit of a large number of people who pressed for its establishment in Hobart. It is to the credit of not only the Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Hodgman, who is the member for the area but also, I think one should say, former Senator Wriedt, who was a very strong advocate of the establishment of the Convention headquarters in Hobart. Steps have now been taken to get the headquarters established and functioning. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the research issues which have to be undertaken if we are to demonstrate that our presence in the Antarctic is viable and not simply a matter of bolstering our purely territorial claims. In November 1979 the Antarctic Research Policy Advisory Committee reported to the Government with a whole series of recommendations about what it thought ought to be done in terms of research in the Antarctic and the priorities which ought to be established. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the summary of recommendations of that Antarctic Research Policy Advisory Committee which were directed to the Government at that stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 1 That Australia have a high quality research program in Antarctica directed towards:</PARA>
<PARA> the living and mineral resources of the Antarctic and the environmental effects of their exploitation;</PARA>
<PARA> the effect of the Antarctic climate, weather and ocean circulations in the Southern Ocean area, particularly as these relate to Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA> taking advantage of the special opportunities afforded by the uniqueness of the Antarctic. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 2That proposals for research consistent with the detailed guidelines prepared by the Committee should be called for and assessed in accordance with the mechanisms described in Chapter 6. All proposals, independent of their origin, should compete for a place in the research program. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 3That universities and other organisations responsible for research under contract develop specific proposals which should compete on an equal basis with all other projects for inclusion in the research program. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 4That medical officers employed for service in the field, in appropriate cases be offered appointments on three-year period contracts associated with a medical research body for the purpose of planning and doing research and, where appropriate, working towards a higher degree. Specific proposals for medical research by workers other than medical officers will be considered on their merits for inclusion in the overall program. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 5That the Chairman of ANCAR be invited to attend meetings of ARPAC as an observer. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 6That individuals of standing in scientific disciplines be appointed to act on ARPAC's behalf to encourage and coordinate responses to ARPAC's invitation to submit proposals for Antarctic research and to initiate the process of assessment of the scientific merit of these responses. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 7That a Planning Committee be established, under the Chairmanship of the Director, Antarctic Division and comprising coordinators in specific disciplines appointed by ARPAC. The Planning Committee will make recommendations to ARPAC annually on the content of an Antarctic research program. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 8That the level of support for Antarctic research be set no later than August each year for the program in Antarctica to begin in October of the following year. Once the total program for that year is formulated, the collaborating organisations must be assured that the required funds will be forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 9That the Antarctic Division continue to provide and co-ordinate the logistic support for the Australian Antarctic program. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 10That the Antarctic Division continue to have a scientific research role and accept responsibility for such interdisciplinary coordination, storage of data and expertise as may be required. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 11That the Antarctic Division be developed with a view to becoming a centre of excellence in Southern Ocean marine biology as the major thrust of its research program and develop a small professional group to:</PARA>
<PARA> undertake oceanographic research in the Southern Ocean; and</PARA>
<PARA> provide a supporting role in the maintenance of equipment and data storage and retrieval in order to foster oceanographic research by other appropriate agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 12That the Antarctic Division continue to conduct research in terrestrial biology at about the present level. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 13That the Antarctic Division develop a repository of knowledge and expertise in engineering and polar technology. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 14That the Government review the staffing structure of the Antarctic Division's research branch as a matter of urgency with a view to introducing the Research Scientist classifications as used in CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 15That staff levels and resources available to the Antarctic Division not be reduced from present levels. Vacancies created by letting contracts for glaciology, upper atmosphere physics and cosmic ray physics should be retained for programs in marine and terrestrial biology, oceanography and supporting studies in engineering and polar technology. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 16That Antarctic research be identified as a national commitment. Coherence in, and continuity of funds for long-term programs should be guaranteed by the ear-marking of funds within the appropriations of the Government organisations involved. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 17That a supplementary fund of $500,000 p.a. be created, to be administered by the Department of Science and the Environment to support high quality research proposals which are likely to contribute significantly to the aims of Antarctic research and which do not qualify for support from other sources. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 18That the replacement of existing station buildings continue and that additional shipping capacity be provided to allow that program to proceed without reducing the logistic support for the scientific program. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government responded to that report in an official statement made by the then Minister for Science and the Environment, Mr David Thomson, in which he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee's main recommendations have been accepted by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Certainly that program of research is now starting to show some evidence of being undertaken in the Antarctic. Clause 9 (1) (b) of the Bill very specifically deals with the carrying out of research. It states that one of the things which a permit system may permit is to:</PARA>
<PARA>carry out research with respect to marine organisms of a specified kind or kinds. </PARA>
<PARA>As honourable senators will know, there has been some acceptance by the Opposition of the thrust of that report, as was illustrated when Senator Button spoke in this place on 25 March 1980 on the tabling of that report. He indicated the Opposition's broad support for the proposals which were being put forward. On 22 August 1979 the then Minister for Science and the Environment, Senator Webster, announced the major rebuilding program at Australian Antarctic stations. I think Senator Melzer, as a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Public Works, may well have seen the proposals which have been put before the Government and the Parliament on that matter. Moves are afoot to obtain a research vessel for use in the Antarctic. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of the three matters of scientific research that perhaps need to be brought to attention concerns the weather. It is of significance to Australia. Australia derives a great deal of its weather impact from events in Antarctica. There appeared in the authoritative journal Nature of 26 January 1978 an article written by Professor Mercer of the Institute of Polar Studies entitled 'West Antarctic ice sheet and CO2 greenhouse effect: a threat of disaster'. In that article Professor Mercer indicated:</PARA>
<PARA> If the global consumption of fossil fuels continues to grow at its present rate, atmospheric CO2 content will double in about 50 years. Climatic models suggest that the resultant greenhouse-warming effect will be greatly magnified in high latitudes. The computed temperature rise at lat 80*S could start rapid deglaciation of West Antarctica, leading to a 5m rise in sea level. </PARA>
<PARA>A five metre rise in sea level would effectively wipe out a large proportion of my constituency and I am sure of the constituencies of most honourable senators. It is quite clear that the behaviour of the Antarctic ice sheets will need to be carefully monitored by Australian meteorological authorities. The second point which appears to be of interest for research in the Antarctic is, in fact, the very matter of the origins of life on which I am sure my friend and colleague, Senator Martyr, will have some opinions. In an article which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald in December 1980 under the heading 'Antarctic ice could be hiding the key to life' one of the researchers as reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Probably the most significant thing that has been proven with the Antarctic meteorites is that amino acids do exist in outer space', says John Annexstad of NASA a member of Cassidy's team and leader of the current expedition. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, there are some grounds for believing the presence of meteorites and the material frozen within the Antarctic continent may have enormous implications for the esoteric studies of things such as the origins of life and of biological molecular formations. The final major scientific area in the Antarctic which will need to be watched, as Senator Button has indicated, is the exploitation of the krill which abound in Antarctic waters. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in a publication produced in August 1979 reported:</PARA>
<PARA> Fisheries biologists generally regard annual catch levels of 50-60 million tonnes--</PARA>
<PARA>Of krill-</PARA>
<PARA>as feasible-about the same order of size as the entire world fish catch at present. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, there exists within the Antarctic the capability of taking, in terms of protein for possible human consumption, about the same amount of value of protein as is currently derived from all the world's fisheries. That will undoubtedly have major implications for feeding people throughout the world and, indeed, will raise the question of who should properly have the right to exploit and profit from such undertakings. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to raise another matter because it seems to me that it is a matter on which no international agreement is likely to be provided. It is the matter of mineral resources in the Antarctic. Jon Tinker, writing in the New Scientist of September 1979, indicated that international peace, good will and harmony would probably melt as quickly-I think his phrase was-as an iceberg in the Red Sea the moment we come to talking about the exploitation of resources which actually have real commercial viability. This tends to be very largely, therefore, a debate about what mineral resources are potentially available in Antarctica. A report in the Washington Post of September 1979 stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Antarctic treaty nations warned yesterday that if a legal and political system to regulate oil drilling is not developed soon, the ecology of the earth's last unspoiled continent could be seriously damaged. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Major oil companies are pressuring the 13 nations to open Antarctica to off-shore exploration. </PARA>
<PARA>The question very much is not only whether there is material in Antarctic worth exploiting but also whether it could be exploited at a reasonable cost. A paper which was prepared by the foreign affairs group of the Legislative Research Service of the Parliamentary Library in May 1980 was headed 'A Background Brief on the Antarctic and Marine Living Resources'. It indicated that by and large the resources likely to be exploitable in the mineral sense are limited. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> However, while mineral occurrences have been detected in many parts of the continent most of them are of a quality and quantity such that they would not warrant further consideration if found elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA>In other articles different points of view have been put forward. Barbara Mitchell who has written extensively on the politics and the environment of Antarctica in an article appearing in the Environment issue of January-February 1980 made it quite clear that in her view there are considerable mineral deposits in Antarctica and that they are capable of being exploited. One of the points she raised which I thought interesting was in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The non-claimant--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, those nations without territorial claims in the Antarctic-</PARA>
<PARA>position is countered most strongly by the Latin claimant states and Australia. One claimant state has even insisted that its sovereignty must be recognised before the Antarctic Treaty can be extended to cover mineral resources. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, before further exploration the Treaty must recognise what it currently does not recognise; that is, the actual legal authority of one of the parties over part of the continent. The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Speaking at a press briefing seminar in Washington in September 1979, Ambassador Keith Brennan of Australia made it clear that oil found off the Australian sector was Australian. </PARA>
<PARA>If that is the case I suggest that that is somewhat of a departure from the international regime that has currently appertained. The Australian Financial Review of June 1980 headed one of its articles 'Antarctic marine life accord clears way for mining talks'. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The convention, signed in Australia last week, clears the way for a more difficult task: finding a way to deal with the mineral resources of the continent. </PARA>
<PARA>That indeed will be of very considerable importance. Informed discussions were held in Washington last December to try to develop a framework for the handling of mineral resources within the Antarctic Treaty and within the regime that currently exists. Many people such as the Friends of the Earth are bitterly opposed to this. Dr K. D. Suter in his publication 'World Law and the Last Wilderness' is very anxious when he indicates that the kind of rocks that have been found both in South Africa and the Transantarctic Mountains include formations which are otherwise rich in deposits of platinum, nickel, copper, chromium, lead, zinc, iron and cobalt. It is to be hoped that the idea that these resources could be exploited simply by one of the Treaty parties to the disadvantage of either the international community or other Treaty parties will be resisted. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that is to be substantially resisted is the fact that there are now a number of Australian defence and foreign policy writers who are producing articles entitled, for example, 'A Limited Antarctic Warfare Capability for Australia'. There is an article in the Pacific Defence Reporter of February 1979 which indicates how Australia should be moving to acquire facilities and to acquire some sort of ability to undertake limited Antarctic warfare. There is an article by Lieutenant Colonel Teague 'Scope for Defence aid in Antarctica' which indicates the sort of resources that Australia's armed forces would need to mount and support some sort of military involvement in Antarctica. These articles need to be carefully examined. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill puts into effect a treaty which has a number of weaknesses such as the failure to adjust to the mineral regime; the failure of the Treaty parties to come to grips with the continuing politics; particularly the Soviet Union's veto of other people's participation; the question of needing unanimous consent under Article 12 of the Treaty; the question which the Department of Foreign Affairs has been unable to answer as to whether Australia's 200-mile economic zone applies in the Antarctic. A question was asked by Mr Jacobi of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Peacock) as to whether Australian authority extends within 200 miles of the Antarctic. The Minister's reply to that question was:</PARA>
<PARA> The questions raised by the honourable member involve complex issues of law that in many respects are unsettled. It would therefore not be appropriate for me to canvass these legal problems at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA>We do not even have the benefit of knowing what the Australian Government's legal view is of its relationship to the Antarctic. There are territorial claims still unsettled. There are the legitimate claims of the Third World to share in the benefits that might possibly be derived in the Antarctic. There is the question of the effect of the law of the sea regime. There is the continuing battle between the conservation nations and nations such as the Soviet Union, Japan and Poland which seek to exploit the resources of Antarctica. There is a lack of biological data about krill, Antarctic fish, seals, and a number of other matters. In this Bill, I regret to say, there is a substantial division of jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> It amazes me that the Minister responsible for this legislation should be the Minister for Science and Technology and not the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, who otherwise has the carriage of matters dealing with the conservation of living natural resources, certainly in all the other territories of Australia. It is ridiculous that one Minister will be responsible for control of whaling legislation in the Antarctic and another Minister will be responsible for the control of the exploitation of krill in the Antarctic. It seems to me very stupid that the Government should have allowed this divided jurisdiction between two of its own Ministers to persist in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The international regime, however, is to be welcomed. It is to be hoped that the matters which have been raised, both at the international meeting which was held in Canberra and at subsequent meetings, can be dealt with effectively by the parties in the future, and that some method will be found of adjusting international disputes over other resources in the Antarctic without the breakdown of the international regime of peace and co-operation which has served the Antarctic well, and which has served the world in general very well. I hope that these other matters can be settled as satisfactorily as this one has, and that in time all of those weaknesses which I have identified can be taken up and effectively dealt with. I commend this Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not speak with the expertise of Senator Puplick. It was with great pleasure that I listened to his speech and to his treatise on the problems and the history of Antarctica. I was fortunate enough to visit the Antarctic earlier this year. While I was there it became very apparent to me that there were two or three problems that I think the Government and the people of Australia should be aware of. I must say that I had always had a deep interest in the Antarctic, but it was not until I found that I was to go there with a committee that I did more extensive reading on the area than I had before. I became aware of the fragile nature of the environment in the Antarctic, and I became conscious of the fact that Australia should play a part in preserving that continent and preventing it from being damaged or destroyed by modern man.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said in this place last week, when we went to McMurdo we found that the Americans had established a nuclear reactor there. At the time they established it, I suspect they thought that it was an easy way to provide energy in the Antarctic. Energy that produces heat is essential to any human being living in the Antarctic. I suspect that the Americans thought at that time that nuclear power was a renewable, easy to manage source of energy in an area where it is not easy to get stores or get great bulks of energy delivered. But after the reactor had been in existence and in action for some few years they found the same problems existed with that reactor as exist with every other reactor. These problems arise everywhere there are nuclear reactors. They at least had enough conscience to decide that they could not endanger the area by keeping the reactor going. They could not endanger the area by awaiting the inevitable accident. They closed down their reactor and took it and the contaminated earth away. But knowing what we know now about nuclear reactors, we cannot be sure that that episode has not affected the Antarctic in some way. </PARA>
<PARA> By going there, and from my reading about the area, I found that 90 per cent of the world's fresh water is locked up in the Antarctic. If that fresh water were contaminated, it must have an effect on life on earth. I also realised, of course, that if that over two-mile thick cap of ice that sits on the rock that makes Antarctica started to melt in any part, life in many parts of the world would be made quite untenable, and that life for many people may become extinct in some parts of the world. It was only by delving a little into the history of the Antarctic that I discovered that that reactor had been there. We cannot but wonder what else might have gone on in the Antarctic which the rest of the world has not been made aware of and which might very well affect our lives in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> When I listened to Senator Puplick talk about the possible French proposal to take its weapons testing program to the Antarctic I could not help being concerned that a nation could show so little concern that it would even tolerate the idea for a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OL7">Senator MELZER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting I was explaining that my interest in the Antarctic had been reawakened by the fact that I had to visit the Antarctic with the Public Works Committee. Some of the experiences I had there awakened my real concern that Australia should show some leadership in relation to the Antarctic. I explained that during my visit to the Antarctic I found out that at one stage there had been a nuclear reactor at McMurdo Sound. I was concerned that countries could be so unaware of the delicacy of the situation in the Antarctic that they would put in the Antarctic region the sort of material that could cause disaster. I said earlier that Senator Puplick had given me the information that the French were considering moving their nuclear arms tests from the Pacific to the Antarctic. I think that is appalling. The French are showing very little consideration for the effect that such action might have on the environment in the Antarctic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While I was visiting the Antarctic I also heard people talking about krill. Before I went to the Antarctic and since I have returned I have heard people talking about the fact that millions of tonnes of krill can be taken from the Antarctic. It is said that krill is an extraordinary source of protein. The more questions I asked and the more I listened, the more I realised that in this area, as in so many other areas of the environment-the flora and fauna with which we are concerned-nobody really knows the answer and nobody has a base upon which to form his opinions. For instance, when we were being briefed in relation to the Antarctic it was put to me that the reason there may well be millions of tonnes of krill available for harvesting at the moment is that certain nations have fished out the whale population and that there are not as many whales in the southern seas as there once were. Whales, of course, eat extraordinary amounts of krill. </PARA>
<PARA> It was put to me that we might at the moment have an extraordinary population of krill in the Antarctic because, to be basic, whales were no longer eating it. It was put to me that once the krill population had caught up with the fact that there were not so many whales in the Antarctic the amount would level out to a point where there might not be millions and millions of tonnes and that in fact by allowing nations to fish for millions of tonnes of krill we might very well be exterminating the krill in much the same way as we have exterminated some varieties of whales. What impressed and frightened me was that when one asked what effect that will have on the fish population of the world and what effect that, in turn, will have on the world, the answer was the answer so often given, that is: 'We do not know'. If Australia is really concerned about the Antarctic and intends to go ahead with its commitment to the Antarctic I would like to see it take a proper view. Australia should make sure that research is carried out immediately so that we know where we stand in relation to that particular resource. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter raised while we were talking to people who were in the Antarctic or who were concerned with it involved the penguin population. For years poultry farmers in Australia have been terrified of Newcastle disease. It has been put to us in various references that if Newcastle disease ever got a hold in Australia it would wipe out the poultry industry and would wipe out a good deal of the bird population. During my visit to the Antarctic it was put to me that Newcastle disease had been introduced to the penguin colonies in the Antarctic. I suppose that the penguin colonies in themselves are not of any commercial viability. I am glad to say that we do not eat, sell or wear penguins but we do not know what part penguins play in the whole chain of life in the Antarctic or in areas closer to Australian shores. It was said to me that Newcastle disease had been introduced into the Antarctic. If anything like the facts that have been given to me in various inquiries are true, Newcastle disease could very well wipe out the penguin colonies of the Antarctic. It does not appear to have caused any government to take any sort of precautions. Indeed, if Newcastle disease is present in the Antarctic, it appears that it is there because it has been introduced by countries that have not taken proper precautions in relation to the disposal of food or waste in the Antarctic. We do not appear to be taking any steps, for instance, to make sure that it does not proceed from the Antarctic into Australia. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OL7">Senator MELZER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What worries me is that I was told that Newcastle disease existed in the penguin colonies in the Antarctic. I cannot see any evidence that we have accepted that Newcastle disease is present in the Antarctic. We are not taking precautions nationally or internationally to combat it, to do away with it or to stop its coming into Australia. None of the members of the party I was with took any precautions to stop the disease being introduced into Australia by us. I repeat that I do not know whether Newcastle disease is present in the Antarctic but I am saying that if Australia is fair dinkum about the Antarctic, if it has some commitment to it, I would hope that it would acknowledge that the disease could exist, or that it would take precautions or act in a responsible manner if such a threat exists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From my own observations in the Antarctic I feel that the improper disposal of waste could affect the whole environment, the balance of nature. It appears that some countries with bases in the Antarctic take home their waste. It appears that some countries take home some of their waste and freeze the rest, hoping that nature will dispose of it in the southern seas. I am not sure what Australia does in this instance but it certainly appears that some countries do not give a damn and feel that the environment one way or another can cope with whatever waste is left there. If Newcastle disease exists in the Antarctic, that may be the reason for its existence. I would like to see countries which have bases in the Antarctic-this applies even to countries which cast envious eyes at the Antarctic and which feel that they too should perhaps have a share of the spoils-at least show a responsibility and take away from the Antarctic the mess made by human beings. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that if we do not accept that responsibility the balance of life in the Antarctic may be upset. If the balance of life in the Antarctic is upset it might very well affect Australia and, being less parochial, I feel that it could affect the world. In taking the step that Australia has in acknowledging in this Bill its responsibility to the environment of the Antarctic, I hope that Australia goes on to show a greater responsibility to the Antarctic than it has shown before. </PARA>
<PARA> As speakers who have gone before me in this debate have said, Australia in the past, although claiming sovereignty over a very large slice of the Antarctic, has not done very much more than just claim that sovereignty. Despite the fact that we have not put our money where our mouths were, Australian scientists, from my experience, have done magnificently with what we have given them. They have carried out magnificent work under poor conditions and with poor equipment. They have achieved world renown in some areas in conditions that seem to me to be remarkable. I would like to see Australia take a responsibility for the Antarctic. I would like Australia to show a very proper concern for what I feel is a magnificent continent. I hope that in this Bill we have a commitment from the Government-it is certainly a commitment from honourable senators on this side of the chamber-that Antarctica will proceed without being endangered in any way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank honourable senators who have taken part in this debate on the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Bill 1981. I thank the Opposition for its support of the Bill and I thank Senator Button, Senator Puplick and Senator Melzer who have spoken in the debate in this place. I would like particularly to thank my colleague Senator Puplick for the very informed comments he made in his contribution this afternoon to the debate. I think it is proper that in responding I address myself particularly to a couple of points which the honourable senator raised. He asked firstly about the delay in ratifying the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Seals. In 1972 the Antarctic Treaty nations developed the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Seals which aims to promote and achieve the protection and the study of Antarctic seals while making provision for their rational use as a resource. It is true that Australia has not yet ratified the seals convention although it does appear as a Schedule to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1974. However, I am advised that presently no commercial sealing is undertaken in Antarctica. Draft regulations to allow for the ratification of the seals convention are presently being examined to ensure their consistency with the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980 and the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Bill which, of course, is the one we are discussing at present. So some activity is going ahead in the area which was a matter of concern to the honourable senator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He also raised the more general question of whether this Bill properly lies within the area of administrative responsibility in which it has been presented. The point does pose a dilemma as to whether we subdivide the overall environmental responsibility or the overall scientific responsibility and how we draw the balance between them as to where we let the matter of administrative responsibility lie. I think all honourable senators would agree that a decision had to be made that one or other Minister would in fact have responsibility. As the present Bill reflects the research interest of the new International Commission and as the Antarctic Division of the Department of Science and Technology also has strong research interests, the administration of the Bill appears to be quite appropriate within the science and technology portfolio. That is in no way to deny the importance of the other parts of the questions which have been raised by my colleague. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I think it remains for me only to observe that the debate in both places on this Bill has been of a particularly high standard which I think has reflected considerable credit upon the capacity of the Parliament to give informed debate to an important matter. I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-On behalf of my colleagues on the Joint Parliamentary Committtee of Public Accounts I have pleasure in presenting the Committee's 185th, 186th and 187th reports. The 185th report is the Department of Finance minute on the Committee's 176th report on the Auditor-General's report for 1977-78. The Committee is satisfied with the explanations provided by the Department of Finance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 186th report concerns our inquiry into the Advance to the Minister for Finance for 1979-80. The Committee obtained explanations from departments and authorities in relation to 128 items of expenditure from the Advance. Public inquiries were held into four departments. I am pleased to be able to inform the Senate that we are satisfied that in most cases the use of the Advance in 1979-80 was justified. </PARA>
<PARA> The 187th report relates to inquiry by the Committee into the criticisms made by the Auditor-General in his reports for 1978-79. It has been a long standing practice for this Committee to select items from these reports and inquire into some of the issues raised. In our 187th report we have made recommendations on some administrative and financial aspects of the Departments of Defence, Primary Industry and Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry into the Department of Defence arose out of comments by the Auditor-General in 1977-78 and again in 1978-79 relating to the practice within the Royal Australian Air Force of removing serviceable components from aircraft to remedy defects in other aircraft. Investigations by the Committee revealed that this practice, although in itself wasteful of limited resources, is a symptom of wider problems of the RAAF maintenance supply system. We discovered that as a result of delays in bringing an up-to-date computerised supply system into operation in the RAAF and the decision in 1973 to abolish 'buffer stocks' or 'supply margins' of aircraft spares, the RAAF supply system has become too finely tuned to provide the necessary logistics support to the RAAF within reasonable time constraints. We therefore made a number of recommendations aimed at the more timely provision of spare parts, including a 'once off' expenditure of around $20m to re-establish the spares supply margin and the development of a more accurate mechanism for assessing future spare parts requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also noted related aspects of the availability of skilled manpower in the RAAF and local industry participation in aircraft maintenance. We discovered that the RAAF is experiencing considerable difficulty in retaining adequate numbers of skilled tradesmen and engineers. Accordingly, we are presenting a number of recommendations aimed at improved efficiencies in this area. These include better margins for skills, increased re-enlistment bonuses and overseas recruitment. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry into the Department of Primary Industry concerned the Auditor-General's criticisms of the procedures relating to the management and disposal of forfeited foreign fishing vessels. During this inquiry the Committee became aware that the realisable value of many of the forfeited vessels and catches was low, whereas the costs of storage and maintenance prior to disposal were high. Additionally, local harbour authorities were concerned that the prolonged storage of apprehended vessels posed considerable inconvenience and danger to harbour operations, and that the often considerable delays between apprehension and disposal led to increased costs. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, we believe that there had been considerable ecological and environmental effects as a result of illegal fishing, particularly with the taking of clams. Confiscated catches of clam meat individually have amounted to several tonnes, with one particular catch being in excess of 11 tonnes which would represent the destruction of over 22,000 clams. The Committee is satisfied that the Department's new manual of procedures will overcome many of the Auditor-General's criticisms and should result in greater decision-making at the local level, considerably reducing the delays and costs associated with the disposal of these vessels. A vessel ordered to be forfeited in January this year is currently being destroyed in accordance with the new procedures. It is estimated that considerable savings have been achieved as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also inquired into the deficiencies mentioned by the Auditor-General in the procedures for payment and review of pensions and benefits overseas. Since May 1973 persons leaving Australia either permanently or temporarily have been entitled to receive their Australian pensions and benefits under substantially the same conditions as if they were residing in Australia. There has been a rapid expansion in recent years in the number and value of these payments and the Committee was concerned that the deficiencies mentioned by the Auditor-General may have led to significant payments in excess of entitlement. Accordingly, the Committee examined the procedures for payment and review of pensions and other benefits, reciprocal payment arrangements with other governments, staffing of overseas offices and the internal audit procedures applying to overseas payment functions. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Committee has noted the actions taken by the Department of Social Security to strengthen its procedures following the Auditor-General's report, it is concerned that this action was not taken earlier, as the growth in overseas payments has markedly increased the scope for improper or excess payments. The saving of $685,000 achieved by a special review conducted by the Geneva office over the 12 months to March 1980 clearly demonstrates the need for regular investigation. The Committee has made a number of recommendations aimed at achieving greater efficiency and economy in this field. We have recommended that most payments to pensioners overseas should be made by the central office of the Department of Social Security. Centralisation of control, we believe, will facilitate eligibility checks. In addition, the Committee believes that in order to minimise the number of overseas payments, pensioners on short term visits should be actively discouraged from using the overseas payment system and instead should have their payments made into bank accounts for transfer overseas using normal banking facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has also recommended that the Department pursue the possibility of extending reciprocal arrangements similar to those with Britain and New Zealand under which administrative functions and controls over pension payments would be exercised by the authorities in the countries where the payments are being made. In some cases consideration should be given to posting appropriate officers to posts, especially in southern Europe, where significant numbers of pensioners reside. I commend the reports to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to elaborate on two points which were not clearly identified in the short statement. The first concerns the apprehension of foreign vessels and associated problems. One problem which the Committee found during its investigation was that there was a lack of co-ordination between the various departments responsible for the apprehension and destruction of catches and of vessels, which in many instances were considered by the local authorities in whose ports those vessels were situated to be not only a great danger to local shipping but also a health hazard. It is interesting to note the multitude of authorities involved with the apprehension of foreign vessels. They are at all levels of government-Federal, State and local. They include the Attorney-General's Department, the Bureau of Customs, the departments of Administrative Services, Foreign Affairs, Health, Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Prime Minister and Cabinet and Transport, Federal and State police forces, State fisheries and local harbour authorities. In the submissions from the various port authorities we were told of the immense delays which they experience because of the various departments having to make decisions about what to do with the vessels or with the crews of the vessels. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point which I would like to emphasise and which was mentioned in the statement is the ecological damage caused by clam fishing vessels. The Committee heard a lot of comment during its investigation about the effect on the Great Barrier Reef of clam fishing vessels and clam fishing. Clam meat is regarded as a great delicacy in quite a large part of South East Asia. The only meat taken from a clam is the muscle and the average clam yields approximately half a kilogram of muscle. If we consider that one catch consisted of 11 tonnes of clam meat, we can see that during the fishing for that meat about 22,000 clams were destroyed. We were told that the clams of the region have an extremely slow growth rate, with some species taking approximately 70 years to reach maximum size. When we consider that it takes up to 70 years for a clam to be fully grown and that in one catch alone 11 tonnes or more than 20,000 clams were destroyed, we can understand the damage done the Great Barrier Reef in that respect alone. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has come to the conclusion that the method used to dispose of apprehended vessels was not at all economical because of the delay involved and because of the way the whole system was treated. The fact is that some of the vessels the Committee inspected are of negligible commercial value and that the costs associated with their maintenance and disposal are generally many times their realisable value. Therefore, the Committee strongly recommends that such vessels be disposed of as quickly as possible after forfeiture, for the following reasons: Maintenance costs are both significant and unpredictable; they occupy valuable port facilities; they incur hidden costs by way of involvement by fisheries officers as well as local authorities; they are a hazard to navigation if they sink or break up at moorings. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad to report that in July 1980 the Department of Primary Industry published a manual of procedures for recording and disposal of fisheries forfeitures. The Committee has examined the manual and is satisfied that it will help to overcome the problems raised with the Committee during the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> The second item which I should like briefly to elaborate on is the payment of pensions and benefits overseas. This matter also was referred to in the statement. It is interesting that the number of pensions paid overseas has incresed considerably in the last six years. There are two main points from which the pensions are paid; one is Geneva and one is in London. From 1974 to 1980 the number of pensions paid from Geneva increased from 2,754 to 9,423 which is a 242 per cent increase. The number of pensions payable from London increased from 2,217 to 3,941, which is a 78 per cent increase. The total number of pensions paid overseas by all posts-not only Geneva and London-increased from 5,560 in 1974 to 15,314 in 1980, an increase of 175 per cent. The major increase occurred in southern Europe. We have been told, for instance from the Geneva office, that of the 9,423 benefits paid from the Geneva office, 3,464 were paid in Greece and 2,492 were paid in Italy. The fact is that our offices in Geneva do not have facilities or staff to be able to control or check the pensions which are paid in that area. Therefore, we recommended that an office be established in the countries which pay the largest number of pensions-for instance, one in Athens and one in Rome-because it would definitely help to police and to check the pensions which are paid at the moment. Mr President, these are two points on which I want to elaborate because I feel that they are not well elaborated on in the statement. </PARA>

The Committee believes that the choice of the word 'cannibalisation' was indeed unfortunate in the sense that it conjures up a notion of permanent destruction of one item in order to obtain parts which are necessary to repair another item. We found that in practice cannibalisation is the removal of parts from one temporarily unserviceable aircraft for use in another to overcome a periodic shortage of spares, and then this decision is taken only at the highest possible level. I contend that this practice is not a reflection on the Royal Australian Air Force but rather on the Parliament, by our placing these people in a position in which such practices are not only time consuming and costly but also are necessary in order to increase the operational availability of a very small air force. We have approximately 20 different aircraft types from seven countries, and with small numbers this presents tremendous problems of supply of spares. It is impossible to get any sort of economies of scale as a result of this practice. Our Committee is most concerned about a number of features.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I continue to be concerned about the inevitable amount of red tape involving communications between a central office at Russell Hill and the various bases. While our Air Force is bringing into service the latest in technical hardware and sophistication the accounting and the logistic supply systems are indeed very deficient and need updating as a matter of extreme urgency. We believe it is time to review a decision which was taken in 1973 to reduce a six months buffer stock. If we can reintroduce a buffer stock which will cost-a once-off, as Senator Lajovic mentioned-about $20m, it should certainly reduce the time interval. One can appreciate that, quite frequently, with high technology items, some of our aircraft are starting to date. Essentially, we keep our aircraft such as the F111 flying for many years, into a period far beyond that at which many countries put their aircraft into mothballs. We have problems because we are dealing with a high technology. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe the people are underpaid. There seems to be a need for a higher margin for skill and to review the time in lieu principle. The inevitable result is that after the initial period of contract service the re-engagement rate is only 50 per cent to 60 per cent. So the skilled people are going outside the forces and are getting better money in private enterprise or by working for Qantas Airways Ltd. In the interests of the defence of our nation we have to encourage these skilled operators to stay in the Air Force, but they must be appropriately remunerated. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Committee recommends that we reduce the reliance on overseas sources of supply. This creates some problems in regard to time delays, and we advocate local participation so far as aircraft maintenance is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter concerns lead times. Introducing buffer stocks, getting a proper logistic supply system, updating a very antiquated accounting system and introducing a mechanism for assessing future spares requirements, we believe, are some of the measures which can make the Air Force operationally far more efficient. I believe the men at bases such as Richmond and Amberley are doing a good job but are labouring under certain problems which I believe Parliament does not really appreciate. I welcomed the opportunity to visit these places and to participate in preparing this report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the reports and the statement relating to the reports. </PARA>
<PARA>I did not hear Senator Lajovic's statement, but I am startled to learn of the large number of inquiries being made by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. I think honourable senators should have an opportunity to look at the reports of this Committee and to debate them. Tonight two Liberal senators have offered some criticism. One criticised the staffing restrictions on the office of the Department of Social Security in Geneva and suggested that there were not enough staff to check all pension payments. This could be costing the Australian Government many millions of dollars through improper payments. This is a question to which Senator Grimes has given a good deal of consideration. Therefore, I think he should have an opportunity to debate the reports of this Committee, including the questions of whether payments have been made improperly, whether there should be payments from a central office and generally the question of payments to pensioners who live overseas. I think these questions need the consideration of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The most enlightened comment this evening came from Senator Watson, who laments the loss of highly skilled technicians from the Defence Force of Australia because they are not paid enough. I do not know how Mr Peacock will take that comment in view of the course he is following on wage restraint at present. Obviously something is lacking in our system when we lose highly skilled technicians to private enterprise. This matter also needs consideration. Not having seen the reports and not having sufficiently studied the statement put down by Senator Lajovic, I am unable to continue with the remarks and I therefore seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a statement on domestic air fares which was originally brought down last week by the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt). I was part way through my remarks on Wednesday night when the Government asked me to defer concluding my remarks so that it could bring in some urgent legislation. If Senator Tony Mulvihill, my friend, were here and we were talking about football he would well know what I meant when I said that when a football team starts to fumble the ball for no explicit reason it seems to have a whole day or a whole season of fumbling the ball. Once the first fumble takes place, it seems for no explicit reason to become contagious. In looking at the Government's performance of late, I think the Government has got the fumbles. In fact, I think it has got the stumbles. It seems to me that the Government is experiencing a self-generating stumble. The reason I say this is that we expect the Government to run the country but it cannot even run this Senate. It cannot even run this Parliament. I have great sympathy for the Government Whips-and one should have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me look at the performance of the Government. This is the eighth week we have sat since the election. We have passed very few, if any, provocative, controversial or difficult pieces of legislation. Sure, we have passed the Human Rights Commission legislation because the Government senators who intended to object to it believed it was useless to do so and were prepared to fight another day on other issues. We have virtually four weeks of the current session left. The Government has let it be known that it wants its controversial legislation passed before it loses control of the Senate on 30 June. Let me look at the imposing list of legislation and the matters that the Government must get through before that date. There are amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act relating to the ownership and control provisions and the matter of supplementary licences for regional television stations; a decision about the new statutory home for the Independent and Multicultural Broadcasting Corporation, whose staff employment contracts terminate on 31 May; the vexed decision on what is to happen to Mr Murdoch's Channel 10; alternations to Telecom's status as a common carrier for all terrestial communications; amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act on tax avoidance; decisions on new levels of assistance to the iron and steel industry; a decision on Medibank; a decision on hospital funding; the question of the airlines agreement; the passage of the airline loan Bill; and the Freedom of Information Bill. Normally it would take a parliament six months to debate properly and pass such a list of legislation but with the exception of two Bills the legislation has not even been introduced into the Parliament. We have been sitting for seven weeks and done almost nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> To sum the matter up, tomorrow the Airlines Equipment (Loan Guarantees) Bill will be introduced into this place. This legislation has to be passed by the Parliament in order to guarantee a loan to Ansett Transport Industries Ltd to buy its new Boeing aircraft. I will quote the reason that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has given as to why these Bills have to be rushed through. I will quote from the National Times. If I do a disservice to the Prime Minister, I ask him to forgive me. The Prime Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA> We have to get this legislation through before Easter because the guarantees are needed for the Ansett group in fulfilling that loan with Exim bank. We are not prepared to run the risk of going over the time scales in relation to that, because that would probably force Ansett into renegotiation with Exim, and that would have all sorts of complications and difficulties which nobody would want. </PARA>
<PARA>What a pathetic, sad reason to hear a Prime Minister giving for wanting this legislation through before Easter. The Government has stumbled again. I will not canvass whether Ansett should be able to get loan money at very cheap interest rates. Good luck to Ansett if it is able to do so honourably because the lower rates will be reflected in lower air fares. </PARA>
<PARA> I have yet to make up my mind, as has my colleague Senator Mason, on the vexed question of how we will vote on this legislation when it is brought into this place tomorrow. I do not know whether the Labor Party has made up its mind. Normally the Labor Party and the Democrats would say: 'Sure, we will pass this Bill because it is backing an Aussie airline to borrow money at good interest rates abroad'. But where does this leave the Parliament? Does this pre-empt the Parliament in a true consideration of the two-airline policy? Once the Parliament has approved the guaranteeing of a loan of millions of dollars to Ansett, are we then left with any room to manoeuvre on whether to accept or reject the two-airline policy? The Democrats have given notice-it amazes me that no members of the Press gallery saw fit to report this; maybe it was a bit late for them-that under no circumstances will they vote to ratify the two-airline agreement unless an inquiry is set up to complete the work of the Holcroft inquiry into domestic air fares and the two-airline policy. I was given authority by Senator John Button to say that the Labor Party totally supported the Democrats in that move. Not one line of the stand taken by the Democrats appeared in a newspaper; not one mention on the radio or on a television program. All we heard over the weekend through the media was this garbage of a report that Mr Hunt will set up an inquiry into the two-airline policy. As I understand it, the inquiry will last for five years. It is unbelievable. To use other adjectives, it is incomprehensible, unbelievable, incredible and mind-boggling the way in which the Government has fumbled this airlines question. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Lewis Carroll would be ashamed to put his name to such a saga of misadventure. It all began with the appointment of the Holcroft inquiry. When the two-airline policy comes into this Parliament for ratification, I will challenge Western Australian senators, Liberal senators and Senator Harradine from Tasmania to stand up on this side of the House and vote against ratification until the truth is known about what the Government's air fare policy is doing to the citizens of Western Australia and Tasmania. The Holcroft committee began when several discontented Western Australian senators went to the Prime Minister before the election to say: 'There is a big move on in Western Australia to lower air fares. There is cross-subsidisation and a fair air fares campaign has been established, which threatens to run a Senate candidate'. The Liberal Party in Western Australia said to those involved in the fair air fares campaign: 'Do not run a Senate candidate. We will get Mr Fraser to appoint an inquiry'. So the Holcroft inquiry was appointed and began an investigation. It began to get very close to the truth about air fares. It had some devastating things to say about Ansett, the Department of Transport and the very concept of a two-airline policy. Then quickly, without warning, its whole work was truncated. Its whole existence was terminated by the Government after it had won the election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Immediately upon terminating the work of that inquiry, the Government brought in this statement on domestic air fares. The Democrats are not happy about the kinds of air fares which were arbitrarily determined by the Government. How does the Government know that it is equitable, for example, to reduce the Melbourne-Perth economy fare from $229.30 to $220.20? That is a massive reduction-a reduction of $9.10-for the people of Western Australia who have been subsidising eastern State travellers to the extent of something like $19m a year. How does the Government know that it is equitable to increase the Melbourne-Hobart fare from $70.50 to $74-an increase of $3.50 which on the formula is supposed to be a 10 per cent reduction? How do we know that? There was no opportunity for the Holcroft inquiry's recommendations or arithmetic to be tested. These are arbitrary figures. If Western Australian or Tasmanian senators vote for the ratification of the two-airline policy, they will be saying yes to an arbitrary decision of one of the most inefficient, unco-operative departments in the Public Service-the Department of Transport. It is a department which held in contempt a Government appointed committee of three distinguished Australians. As I said on 1 April, that was the most appropriate day of the year on which to bring such an absurd statement before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> But, as if that were not bad enough, on 2 April the saga continued with reported comments from the Minister for Transport. Mixed up in this statement on air fares was an announcement that Trans-Australia Airlines was to become a public company. In the Senate we tried to elicit what a public company was. Senator Button asked Senator Messner, the Minister representing the Minister for Transport, to define it. Senator Messner could not tell the Senate what the definition of a public company is. Yet tomorrow we will be asked to give consideration to guaranteeing a loan to Ansett Airlines. On 2 April the Melbourne Age carried the following report on page one:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hunt, who is believed to have strongly opposed the sale of TAA when the matter was canvassed within recent weeks, said that the Government expected to spell out within a month the details under which the airline would become a public company. </PARA>
<PARA>Here we have an incredible situation: The Government has announced that TAA is to become a public company but Mr Hunt, the Minister for Transport, does not know whether private enterprise is to be allowed a share of it, whether 49 per cent is to go to private enterprise, or whether the whole lot is to go to private enterprise. The Minister for Transport himself, the day after April Fools' Day, did not know what was going to happen to TAA. The Age article continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Mr Hunt made it clear that the Government would not let the situation arise where the Ansett group could take over TAA and create a monopoly. </PARA>
<PARA>How in the name of fortune could he stop that if TAA becomes a public company, unless the Government owns 51 per cent or more of the shares? The Minister was careful not to say that. He was given an opportunity on 1 April, 2 April and subsequent days to categorically state: 'The Government will not sell more than 50 per cent of TAA to private enterprise'. But he did not do so. All he says is that by some magical means he will stop some intermediate predator in the community from taking control of TAA, and finally putting it into the hands of Ansett. For my part, I do not believe for one moment that either Sir Peter Abeles or Mr Rupert Murdoch has any intention of purchasing TAA. I do not believe any of this rubbish suggesting that they have ever contemplated buying TAA or Qantas Airways Ltd. But in Australian civil aviation what could be just as bad as a monopoly is a duopoly where there is a cosy arrangement between Ansett and a second party, whoever owns it. But the third statement attributed to Mr Hunt on 2 April is, to use an oft repeated word, reprehensible. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hunt told reporters outside Parliament that while it had not finally been decided, he doubted that the situation would arise where the Government sold a controlling interest to private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA>I find that statement from a responsible Minister mind boggling. I repeat that the article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hunt told reporters outside Parliament that while it had not finally been decided, he doubted that the situation would arise where the Government sold a controlling interest to private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA>But then, unfortunately, the situation got worse. On 3 April the Sydney Morning Herald-it is hardly a rampant, radical, left wing journal of this nation-reported:</PARA>
<PARA> Significantly, while the recent Holcroft report called for a more competitive environment, it did not bother to recommend that TAA be either turned into a public company, or sold off to private interests. </PARA>
<PARA>The Sydney Morning Herald castigated the Government for not being more explicit about how much of TAA is to be sold. But the matter did not finish there. We then came to 6 April and the announcement-I am trying to source this announcement to find out where Mr Hunt made it and what were its explicit terms-that there is to be an inquiry. The Melbourne Age of April 6 stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to understand the thinking behind the Federal Government's latest series of decisions regarding domestic air services. After giving what appears to have been little serious consideration to the Holcroft committee's report . . . the Government last week approved big rises in short haul tariffs and small reductions in long distance fares. The formula certainly falls far short of the Holcroft recommendations. Then, in a statement that, perhaps deliberately, distracted critics from the shortcomings of the new fares formula . . . Mr Hunt announced that the Government was considering selling all or part of TAA to private enterprise. Apart from being a complete about-turn on previously stated policies, the vague announcement seemed aimed only at quietening those increasingly vocal sections of the Government parties which are in favour of less Government involvement in commercial enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA>But then the Age went on to report:</PARA>
<PARA> But the most mystifying announcement last week was that the Government intended establishing a new inquiry into the two-airline policy and the question of deregulating the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The Age then went on to canvass deregulation as it is practised in the United States of America. I do not have a complete view on that matter. As a person who champions free enterprise, I can see virtue in competition. Yet almost every article that I read about deregulation in the United States that it has reached the stage where cost cutting is impinging on safety. Areas in out of the way places such as Queensland and Western Australia-the very areas that deregulation is supposed to help-would be disadvantaged. Under a deregulated system, a completely free enterprise system, they are the first to go. So I have a totally open mind on the subject. The mystifying thing is that apparently this inquiry will run for the next five years. The Age quite properly stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Thus the biggest problem with the proposed inquiry is that it could provide the Government with an excuse for doing nothing about the anachronistic two-airline policy for at least another eight years. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that this is wrong. I will quote from the National Times of last weekend. Marian Wilkinson and Julie Flynn are normally two very accurate and responsible journalists, but they wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> Last Thursday night a group of West Australian backbenchers relented after threatening the Government with crossing the floor on a crucial bill to guarantee Ansett's loan for the $246 million purchase of its 21 new Boeing jets. </PARA>

I have great admiration for Western Australian senators and members but I cannot believe that they were lined up by the Prime Minister or Mr Hunt last Thursday night, who said: 'We gave you the Holcroft inquiry.

Now you have kicked up a fuss about not taking notice of the Holcroft inquiry. We have arbitrarily introduced new air fares. You cannot test whether, because of cross-subsidisation, they are the right amounts and Western Australians and Tasmanians relatively will now pay less than those in the eastern States. You cannot test that, but we will give you an inquiry. That should shut up and satisfy you boys'. The inquiry will take five years and it may take another two or three years after that to act on the recommendations of that inquiry into deregulation. Then we may have courageous Western Australian back bench senators tugging their forelocks and saying: 'Malcolm, that is fair enough for us.

Have we left ourselves any room to manoeuvre on air fares? This statement has been brought down and airlines are already charging these air fares today. Can Senator Thomas, who knows of my regard for him, stand up and say: 'I know that the economy fare from Melbourne to Perth at $220.20 is fair and equitable to Western Australia'? If he can stand up and say 'I have proved to myself mathematically that that fare is fair and equitable' then I will believe him because he is an honest man. But he shakes his head as an honest man would be expected to do. He does not know and he cannot prove it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) on nuclear safeguards agreements with France, Canada and Sweden. I must admit, in the short time that I have had this statement available to me, to being appalled at its contents. There are a number of disturbing features about the agreements. Honourable senators do not have to go past page 1 where the Minister states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are continuing our active role in the Committee on Disarmament, the main international negotiating forum on disarmament questions, and we are maintaining our long-established participation in the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). We are continually working to encourage such studies as those on plutonium storage, spent fuel management and assurance of supply, and to upgrade international safeguards measures, particularly in respect of proliferation-sensitive technologies. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Government says that while we are continuing our active role in the Committee on Disarmament and maintaining our long-established participation in the IAEA, this Government recognises the need to upgrade international safeguards measures particularly in respect of proliferation-sensitive technologies. Yet it would appear to the lay person, as he reads these agreements, that that is exactly what it is doing. The Government is providing the resources for proliferation. I do not see anything in these agreements as sufficient assurance for the people of Australia that there are, at this stage, adequate safeguards measures nor any attempt on the part of this Government to insist on adequate safeguards measures. For instance page 2 of the agreement states:</PARA>
<PARA> They provide for the prohibition of explosive or military use, the application of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, ''fall-back'' safeguards in the event that IAEA safeguards cease to apply,--</PARA>
<PARA>Whatever that is supposed to mean-</PARA>
<PARA>Prior consent rights over reprocessing high enrichment and transfers to third countries, as well as internationally recognised levels of physical protection. </PARA>
<PARA>'Internationally recognised levels of physical protection'. What on earth is that supposed to mean? I notice from the speakers list that not one Government member is to speak in this very important debate. Four members of the Opposition are to speak and not one member of the Government is prepared to debate such an important issue as nuclear safeguards agreements. I would like to ask what these internationally recognised levels of physical protection are. Whom do they apply to? Is this physical protection of the people who will work with Australian uranium? Is it physical protection of the agreements being signed? If it is, how will we monitor it? Exactly what are the internationally recognised levels of physical protection? This phrase can be found on page 2, paragraph 3 of the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The other disturbing point about that paragraph relates to the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. The people of Australia have been told and conditioned, I suppose, to believe the safeguards that apply through the International Atomic Energy Agency are the ultimate; they are as much as we need to ensure that our uranium is going only to be used for peaceful purposes. In this one statement we are told that not only do we have IAEA safeguards but also that we have fallback safeguards. The Minister's statement refers to fallback safeguards in the event that IAEA safeguards cease to apply. There is no mention anywhere in the statement, that I can find, of the circumstances in which IAEA safeguards would not apply so that we would need to go into a fallback situation. The Minister has many answers to give on this matter. As I said, I am disturbed that we do not have speakers in this debate from the Government side. There are many things that the people of Australia need to know. We need to know who accepts the responsibility for the fallback safeguards. It could not possibly be the IAEA because its safeguards have already failed to apply at this point in time. These fallback safeguards would surely come into operation only when the IAEA safeguards cease to apply. It says so in the statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Who is going to enforce the fallback safeguards? As I said, the people of Australia are being duped into believing we already have adequate safeguards. I will quote for instance, from the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) as reported at page 1,701 of Hansard, in the other place on 24 May 1977, when delivering the Government's policy on nuclear safeguards. I do not intend to read the entire speech, so perhaps it might be appropriate before I quote from it to seek leave to have the speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The future course of world nuclear development and the regime of international controls which should apply to such development are currently subjects of great international interest. In the past few weeks, for example, there has been an important statement by President Carter on nuclear energy in which he emphasised the need to restrain the spread of nuclear weapons or explosive capabilities without foregoing the tangible benefits of nuclear power. Again, at their recent Summit meeting, the Heads of Government of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, West Germany, France, Japan and Italy committed themselves to increasing nuclear energy to help meet the world's energy requirements while reducing the risks of nuclear proliferation. They launched an urgent study to determine how best to fulfil these objectives. At the conclusion of the recent Salzburg Conference, the most important international conference held in recent years on all aspects of nuclear power, the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency referred to the agreement of the meeting that nuclear power was a necessary and irreplaceable source of the future energy supply to mankind for both the short and the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that there is widespread international concern to establish a framework of control within which the benefits which many countries see in the peaceful use of nuclear energy can be safely realised. These are issues of major international importance in their own right, but they have an added significance for Australia because of our potential as a supplier of uranium. They are issues on which I have already written to President Carter and Prime Minister Trudeau and on which the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and Australian officials have held detailed consultations with the United States, Canada and other countries. They are issues which have been under the closest and most careful consideration from the moment the Government took office. In the present period of international reappraisal of these issues the Government is determined that Australia should play an active role with other countries in the search for, and achievement of, joint solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> A proliferation of nuclear facilities without adequate protection against diversion of material to nuclear weapons production or nuclear explosives would pose serious threats to international stability and peace, obviously inimical to Australia's interests and to global and regional security. It was for this reason that, in his address to the United Nations General Assembly last September, the Foreign Minister (Mr Peacock) described the strengthening of measures to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons as a central and fundamental area in which Australia looks and hopes for early progress. This will remain the case whether or not Australia is ultimately to become a major exporter of uranium. The safeguards policy which we will follow is, in our view, appropriate for any country to follow whether it be a uranium supplier or consumer. I make clear from the outset that the term 'safeguards' is used here to denote the whole range of measures used to provide assurance that nuclear material supplied for peaceful purposes is not misused for non-peaceful or explosive purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government fully accepts that, if it were in future to permit new uranium export from Australia, this would carry with it added responsibilities. Against the background of these international responsibilities the Government accepts that uranium is a special commodity, the export of which would involve important considerations of a kind not involved in the export of other commodities. This implies a requirement for selectivity in the choice of customer countries and the closest attention to ensuring adequate safeguards should be regarded as something to be balanced against commercial considerations. We view adequate safeguards as a fundamental prerequisite of any uranium export which we would also expect responsible customer countries for Australian uranium readily to accept. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be recalled that, following the release of the First Report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry, the Government announced in the House on 11 November 1976 that it supported the Inquiry's view on the need for the fullest and most effective safeguards on uranium exports. The Government also stated that it was carrying forward more detailed consideration of safeguards in order to develop further a national policy on this subject. The announcement of a policy at this stage, of course, in no way pre-empts a decision on the question whether any such new contracts for the export of uranium will be permitted. As the Government has repeatedly emphasised, this remains a matter for consideration following receipt of the final report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry. However, as the Foreign Minister said in the Government's foreign policy statement in the Parliament on 15 March 1977, the Government would be remiss if it did not address itself to safeguards questions in the meantime. </PARA>
<PARA> That the Government has taken certain decisions on safeguards policy at this stage reflects its determination to make sure that an established framework of policy exists so that any new uranium exports take place under the most carefully considered and responsible conditions possible. The Government wishes to avoid a situation in which decisions may be required on new uranium marketing at some point in the future without the benefit of a clear policy on the ground rules to apply so far as safeguards are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has long recognised the desirability of defining a comprehensive policy on safeguards. It would not be desirable for safeguards requirements to be left to ad hoc decision as this would not afford the strong and clear support for international efforts to strengthen controls against nuclear weapons proliferation to which the Government attaches major importance. Australia is a potentially significant supplier of uranium, but if we are to play the part which this potential gives us the opportunity to play of contributing effectively to international efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regime, it is desirable that uranium importing countries and other nuclear supplier countries alike know where Australia stands on the matter of safeguards. In the narrow sense, safeguards are systems of containment, surveillance, accounting and inspection of nuclear materials and facilities designed to verify that diversion does not take place from peaceful to non-peaceful or explosive purposes. The major systems of international safeguards are administered by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In a broader sense, safeguards for future Australian uranium exports would comprise, as well as the application of international safeguards in this strict sense, the securing from importing countries of adequate assurances regarding the use and control of supplied nuclear material and the conclusion of binding arrangements to give effect to such assurances. In both senses, as mechanisms for verification and as controls and conditions for nuclear exports, safeguards arrangements are an evolving structure, continually being strengthened, refined and improved. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this background, I would like to announce the following specific components of the comprehensive safeguards policy which the Government has adopted. These cover:</PARA>
<PARA> The need to keep policy under review; careful selection of eligible customers for uranium; the application of effective International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards; bilateral agreements with customer countries; fallback safeguards; prior Australian Government consent in relation to re-export, enrichment and reprocessing; physical security; safeguards provisions in contracts; and international and multilateral efforts to strengthen safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA> First, it will be a basic feature of our approach to recognise that the process of strengthening and improving international safeguards arrangements is an ongoing one. Our policy and safeguards arrangements must be kept closely under review to take account of the future evolution of international thinking on safeguards. In this regard the Government is pleased that, as recently announced, Mr Justice Fox has agreed to become an adviser to me on policy matters relating to nuclear non-proliferation and safeguards. Second, should the Government approve further development of the Australian uranium industry it will retain the right to be selective in the countries to whom uranium export will be permitted. The following minimum criteria for eligibility to receive Australian uranium will apply. The Government emphasises that these represent minimum conditions for countries to be eligible to receive Australian uranium. The Government makes clear that wider foreign policy considerations may also be taken into account, and that it reserves the right to refrain from permitting export should this be appropriate in the light of such considerations. It does not, therefore, follow that the Government would necessarily permit export to a country meeting these minimum safeguards criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of non-nuclear weapon states-that is to say, all countries other than the 5 existing nuclear weapons powers recognised by the Non-Proliferation Treaty-sales will be made only to countries which are parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Because of these countries' safeguards obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty this policy will make sure that the entire civil nuclear industry in such customer countries is subject to effective safeguards to verify that nuclear material, whether of Australian or any other origin, is not diverted from peaceful uses. The Government is aware that work has recently been under way within the International Atomic Energy Agency on a new system of equally stringent safeguards to cover the entire nuclear industry in non-nuclear weapon states which are not parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. It will be following progress on this matter and the implications which it may have for our policy. Regarding existing nuclear weapon states, they are not obliged under the Non-Proliferation Treaty to renounce nuclear weapons or accept international safeguards. They retain the right to use nuclear material for weapons as well as for peaceful purposes. Even so, Australia would want to have assurance that nuclear material we may supply for peaceful purposes is not diverted to military or explosive purposes. We will therefore export only to nuclear weapon states which give Australia this assurance and accept that the uranium we supply be covered by International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. In this respect the Government's policy introduces a requirement additional to those recommended by the Ranger uranium environmental inquiry in its first report. </PARA>
<PARA> Third, the Government wishes to ensure that if a decision is taken to permit new uranium export, the uranium will be covered by International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards from the time it leaves Australian ownership. As matters stand, while safeguards applied under the Non-Proliferation Treaty require notification of transfers of yellowcake, the full intensity of such safeguards only commences to apply later in the fuel cycle. Accordingly, it will be the Government's policy that any future sales arrangements for exports of Australian uranium should be such that the uranium will be in a form which attracts full International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards by the time it leaves Australian ownership. Fourth, Australia will require the prior conclusion of bilateral agreements between the Australian Government and countries wishing to import Australian uranium under any future contracts. These bilateral agreements will provide a framework for direct and binding assurances by importing countries to the Australian Government in relation to the use and control of uranium supplied from its use. The fundamental undertakings the Government will wish to obtain from uranium importing countries in such bilateral agreements are that nuclear material supplied by Australia for peaceful purposes or nuclear material derived from its use will not be diverted to military or explosive purposes and that International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards will apply to verify compliance with this undertaking. Australia would seek to arrange with uranium importing countries regular expert-level consultations to satisfy ourselves of the implementation of the provisions of bilateral agreements. In line with the positions taken by the United States and Canada Australia would retain the right to cease supply of uranium to any country which breached safeguards undertakings. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifth, the Government takes the view that nuclear material supplied by Australia or nuclear material derived from its use should remain under safeguards for the full life of the material in question or until it is legitimately removed from safeguards. In line with this basic principle the Government has decided that bilateral agreements with non-nuclear weapon states should make provision for so-called fallback safeguards. I have already made clear that Australia would not be prepared to export uranium to such countries in the absence of International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards applied under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. However, the question arises of ensuring the continued safeguarding of material already present in an importing country should safeguards under the Non-Proliferation Treaty at some stage cease to apply in that country. There should be provision under the bilateral agreements for the contained application of international safeguards in such circumstances. Further, the bilateral agreements should provide for Australia to make alternative arrangements for the safeguarding of nuclear material supplied by us in the event of international safeguards as such ceasing to operate. Moreover, the Government feels it is reasonable to ask importing countries who will already accept International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards of comprehensive scope under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, to accept that, at the first fallback level also, international safeguards should apply to all nuclear material not just that portion supplied by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Sixth, the Government considers that it would be an unsatisfactory situation for uranium supplied by Australia to one country, or nuclear material derived from its use, to be able to be re-exported to a third country without the opportunity for Australia to satisfy itself that adequate controls would apply to the transferred material and that the ultimate destination is acceptable to us. For this reason the Government has decided that bilateral agreements with uranium importing countries should make any transfer of supplied material to a third party contingent on a prior consent of the Australian Government. This provision will give Australia the means of making sure that our safeguards requirements are met despite any onward transfers of the uranium we supply or nuclear material derived from it. </PARA>
<PARA> Seventh, we would require that Australian uranium supplied to other countries for peaceful uses not be enriched beyond 20 per cent uranium-235 without prior Australian consent. This provision is in line with the practice adopted by other nuclear supplier countries. The figure of 20 per cent has been chosen as representing a level of enrichment below the practical requirements for a nuclear explosive, while being above the enrichment level required for most peaceful uses, excepting, for example, some research and radioisotope production reactors, for which approval to enrich to the necessary level would need to be obtained. In respect of this requirement also, the Government's policy extends beyond the recommendations made by the Ranger uranium environmental inquiry in its first report. </PARA>
<PARA> Eighth, the Government is aware of the interest of some countries in the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel to meet their anticipated future fuel requirements, and to facilitate the management of nuclear material following its use in nuclear reactors. At the present time the need for reprocessing and the details of an effective control regime for this area of the nuclear fuel cycle are the subject of close study internationally. This is an area in which there are a number of new ideas and initiatives. The United States has proposed an international nuclear fuel cycle evaluation program to consider various nuclear fuel cycles in terms of their implications for proliferation control. There are also such ideas as various schemes for multinational control of reprocessing facilities and for the management of spent fuel and plutonium. The Government welcomes these studies and consultations and will seek to contribute actively and constructively to relevant aspects of them such as fuel supply assurances and waste management. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's view is that, prior to a clearer outcome emerging from this current international activity, it would be premature for Australia to adopt a unilateral position on the detailed conditions under which we might be prepared to agree to reprocessing, if any, of nuclear material supplied by Australia. In order to reserve effectively Australia's position on this matter for the time being we would wish to make provision in bilateral agreements with countries importing Australian uranium that any reprocessing of nuclear material supplied by Australia may only take place with the prior consent of the Australian Government. This requirement is additional to those recommended by the Ranger uranium environmental inquiry in its first report and reflects similar concerns to those expressed by the inquiry in relation to reprocessing. </PARA>
<PARA> Ninth, the Government would require in future bilateral agreements the assurance from uranium importing countries that adequate physical security will be maintained on their nuclear industries. In addition, we believe the agreements should specify compliance with standards of physical security based, at a minimum, on International Atomic Energy Agency recommendations as presently defined and as updated from time to time. They should also make provision for expert level consultations as necessary on physical security arrangements. These requirements also translate into concrete policy measures concerns expressed by the Ranger uranium environmental inquiry. The incorporation of these provisions in the Government's safeguards policy reflects our concern that total nuclear control should encompass safeguards not just to verify that nuclear material is not illicitly diverted from peaceful uses by national governments or national authorities, but also to protect nuclear material from illegal use by groups or individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> Tenth, the establishment of effective arrangements for safeguards is essentially a matter for governments and for inter-governmental agreements, either bilateral or multilateral. Nevertheless, it is important to make sure that the actual parties to commercial contracts, which may be private organisations, are also aware of the safeguards obligations to which their transaction is subject. For this reason, although the Ranger uranium environmental inquiry in its first report did not make a recommendation on this matter, the Government has decided that it is desirable that, as a standard practice, a clause should be included in any future contracts for the export of uranium from Australia noting that the transaction is subject to safeguards as agreed between the importing country and the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, as an important complement to the measures I have outlined so far, the Government recognises the importance of Australia contributing to constructive multilateral efforts to strengthen safeguards. There is a need for what President Carter has described as systematic and thorough consultations in this area. We too consider that it is highly desirable that there should be the widest possible consensus amongst both nuclear supplier countries and nuclear importing countries on the controls to apply to the world nuclear industry. The wider the consensus, the more effective these controls will be as a barrier to nuclear proliferation. The more uniform the views of the countries concerned, the easier it will be to implement a properly effective regime of controls. It will be an integral part of Australia's approach to safeguards to seek to promote such a consensus. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, we will seek to co-ordinate policy on safeguards with other like-minded countries. As I noted at the outset, I have already initiated an exchange of correspondence with the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Canada expressing this wish, and extremely valuable consultations have already taken place. The policy I am now announcing incorporates the Government's consideration of these consultations and represents a very similar approach to safeguards to that adopted by the United States and Canada. More generally, nuclear supplier countries have a special role and responsibility in the ongoing development of safeguards and Australia will be prepared to participate with them in any constructive efforts to develop a co-ordinated approach. We will also continue to attach major importance to the effective application of safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency. We will investigate whether there are specific areas in which Australia could usefully assist the Agency's capacity to apply increasingly effective safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA> At the present time the Government sees a multilateral approach towards safeguards questions as being especially desirable in one specific area as well as in the international nuclear fuel cycle evaluation program already mentioned; we would wish to lend support to the development of an international convention on the physical protection of nuclear material in international transit. Also, we would wish to explore with other countries a common approach to sanctions in the event of a breach of supply conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> The essential ingredients of the policy I have outlined are careful selection of customer countries, the application of international safeguards to verify that material supplied for peaceful purposes is not misused, the establishment of additional safeguards through bilateral agreements, and an active involvement by Australia in international efforts to upgrade safeguards. The policy is the result of full, careful and detailed consideration of safeguards by the Government. It builds on the preliminary thinking of the Government described in testimony to the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry last year, as well as the recommendations of the First Report of the Inquiry itself. The policy has been the subject of detailed exchanges of views with other countries-both uranium importers and major nuclear exporters-and relevant international organisations including the International Atomic Energy Agency. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result the Government is satisfied that the policy it has decided upon represents a practical, reasonable and effective package of safeguards measures to seek from countries wishing to import uranium from Australia under any future contracts. It is fully in step with current international efforts to strengthen safeguards. The policy goes beyond a mere acceptance by Australia of our international obligations as a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and constitutes a policy as stringent as that adopted to date by any nuclear supplier country. I present the following paper:</PARA>
<PARA> Nuclear Safeguards Policy-Ministerial Statement, 24 May 1977. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5V4">Senator COLEMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speech contains many questions in itself. If refers also to fallback safeguards and speaks of special conditions which will apply when we supply uranium to nuclear weapons states. In reference to existing nuclear weapons states the Prime Minister stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Regarding existing nuclear weapon states, they are not obliged under the Non-Proliferation Treaty to renounce nuclear weapons or accept international safeguards. They retain the right to use nuclear material for weapons as well as for peaceful purposes. Even so, Australia would want to have assurance that nuclear material we may supply for peaceful purposes is not diverted to military or explosive purposes. We will therefore export only to nuclear weapon states which give Australia this assurance and accept that the uranium we supply be covered by International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. In this respect the Government's policy introduces a requirement additional to those recommended by the Ranger uranium environmental inquiry in its first report. </PARA>
<PARA>Later on the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Government considers that it would be an unsatisfactory situation for uranium supplied by Australia to one country, or nuclear material derived from its use, to be able to be re-exported to a third country without the opportunity for Australia to satisfy itself that adequate controls would apply to the transferred material and that the ultimate destination is acceptable to us. For this reason the Government has decided that bilateral agreement with uranium importing countries should make any transfer of supplied material to a third party contingent on a prior consent of the Australian Government. This provision will give Australia the means of making sure that our safeguards requirements are met despite any onward transfers of the uranium we supply or nuclear material derived from it. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement gives us no guarantee at all that material supplied to one country and through it to another country will comply with the safeguard standards we have established in Australia. As I have said, I do not believe the safeguards or standards are adequate; they are not. The ministerial statement gives another little gem. It is not necessary to read far into the statement to start knocking holes in the agreements. On page 2 it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The agreements provide for administrative arrangements to ensure implementation of their provisions and the tracking of Australian supplied material throughout the fuel cycles of customer countries. These detailed procedures enable us to verify that there is no diversion of Australian supplied material to non-peaceful purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like a member on the Government bench to tell me how on earth we are going to do that. Are we saying that in some magical way uranium from Australia will be tagged so that in actual fact we can track it throughout the fuel cycles of customer countries? Are we going to propose that they make the uranium bright purple in colour so that we will recognise it if it comes back to us in the form of a nuclear weapon? It is a ridiculous statement. I am sure honourable senators will agree with that view. It is contained in what is supposed to be a responsible statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Are we going perhaps to station personnel in every country to which we sell our uranium to make sure that ours is not used for any other than peaceful purposes? How are we going to monitor the Australian material or track it, as the statement says, throughout the fuel cycles of customer countries? On page 2 it further states:</PARA>
<PARA> The agreements concluded with France and Sweden include settlements on reprocessing in accordance with the Government's policy of maintaining Australia's prior consent rights over reprocessing of Australian origin nuclear material, while establishing conditions under which this consent may be exercised in our bilateral agreements. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Foreign Affairs announced in Parliament on 27 November 1980 the Government's policy on these conditions:</PARA>
<PARA> The Agreement with Canada keeps open the possibility of agreeing on conditions for reprocessing if the need should arise in the future. Neither Canada nor Australia at present envisages reprocessing nuclear material supplied by the other. </PARA>
<PARA>Now we are getting down to the guts of what the matter is all about. We are now talking about the real issue-reprocessing. We are not really just talking about nuclear agreements for domestic or energy purposes; we are talking about reprocessing. There is only one reason why governments want to reprocess; it is not for peaceful purposes. Again, the bland statement towards the end of that paragraph informs us:</PARA>
<PARA> Neither Canada nor Australia at present envisages reprocessing nuclear material supplied by the other. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not aware that Australia is purchasing nuclear material supplied by Canada. In other words, this is a one sided agreement. It does not apply. There is no point in saying that neither Canada nor Australia at present envisages reprocessing nuclear material supplied by the other because we are not purchasing it from Canada; Canada is purchasing the material from Australia. That is what this agreement is all about. It is one of those agreements people are supposed to read but not question. It talks about processing nuclear material supplied by the other but we are not receiving any from Canada; Canada is receiving our uranium. We have the agreement in front of us. </PARA>
<PARA> When we get into the area of reprocessing we are really talking about nuclear weapons; we are not talking about the use for peaceful purposes of uranium to provide nuclear energy. The statement really does not do a great deal because we do not even get the real truth of the matter until we reach the addendums attached to the agreements. In annexe D of the French Agreement we have one of the most extraordinary provisions I have ever seen in an agreement between Australia and another country. Annex D is headed 'Enrichment to 20 per cent or greater in the isotope U235'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Whereas Article IX.2 of the Agreement provides that NMSA shall only be enriched to 20 per cent or greater in the isotope U235 according to conditions agreed upon in writing the Parties;</PARA>
<PARA> The Parties to the Agreement,</PARA>
<PARA> Declare that they shall not at present--</PARA>
<PARA>I stress the words 'at present'-</PARA>
<PARA>enrich NMSA to 20 per cent or greater in the isotope U235; and</PARA>
<PARA> Agree to consult within 30 days of the receipt of a request from either Party to consider proposals for conditions to be agreed upon in writing according to which NMSA may be enriched to 20 per cent or greater of the isotope U235. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that Annex D states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Declare that they shall not at present enrich NMSA to 20 per cent or greater in the isotope U235; and</PARA>
<PARA> Agree to consult within 30 days of the receipt of a request from either Party to consider proposals . . . </PARA>
<PARA>How could we have an agreement by Australia when, in actual fact, the agreement is between France, Sweden and Canada with Australia? We are not importing uranium from any of those countries so it is one way request for consultation. The request for consultation could come from only those countries. It could not come from us. Why would we be proposing that they enrich their uranium to 20 per cent or greater? That is amazing. Yet, that suggestion is in Annex D as though it is a normal practice and as though this is one of the matters that we should be considering. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us suppose that we have been able to track our Australian uranium all the way through the domestic fuel cycle of a customer country and we receive a request for a consultation on the possibility of enriching uranium to 20 per cent or more. Will we have the opportunity to say no? In an interjection in the other place Mr Street said:</PARA>
<PARA> We have to consent to it. </PARA>
<PARA>But will we be able to say: 'No, you cannot do this'? How will we say no? How on earth will we stop them? We are not dealing with little children. We will not be able to smack them on the hand, call them a naughty boy or a naughty girl and say: 'You must not do that again' or 'You must not do that'. If those countries have the potential already in their countries, regardless of whether it is Australian uranium, they will tell us to get lost and we will not have a single leg to stand on. There is no way that we will be able to identify uranium from Australia being used for enrichment. No one can identify the uranium. Anybody who has been working in the nuclear energy field would confirm that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly is a thimble and pea trick. One would think we were talking about peanuts or peas and thimbles instead of something that could affect the whole world. Talk about apple pie! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Lionel Bowen, raised the matter of Annex D of the French agreement in the other place on 26 March this year in the general debate on the nuclear safeguards agreements. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only real reason that one would talk about enriching uranium to 20 per cent or more would be if one wanted to get towards what is called weapons grade. Why would one want to suggest that? France has been given this peculiar advantage in that she can put forward proposals that the parties enrich uranium above 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>To that, as I said, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Street, interjected:</PARA>
<PARA> But we have to consent to it. </PARA>
<PARA>But he does not say what will happen if we do not give our consent. That is the question that I am asking. I would welcome any member on the Government side telling me what will happen if we say no. What would be the situation if France says to Australia: 'Look here, old fellow, we want to enrich your uranium to 20 per cent or perhaps more, to which we say, 'No, you cannot do it' and France says: 'Tough cheddar; we will go right ahead and do it anyway'? There is no way that we could stop France. There is not one single action we could take because the uranium is already in France and it is already capable of being enriched. </PARA>
<PARA> We continue to make fine speeches particularly about disarmament and enrichment of uranium. The former Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Honourable Andrew Peacock, at the inaugural session of the Committee on Disarmament held in Geneva on 24 January 1979-two years ago- said:</PARA>
<PARA> Arms control disarmament are the gravest problems facing the world today. Solutions are imperative. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet in an agreement Australia is virtually saying that France will be able to enrich to 20 per cent or more because there is no way that we can stop her. We are providing the material for the most horrific weapons that man has yet devised. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has had his piece to say about disarmament too. When he announced that Australia was giving the go ahead on uranium in August 1977 he assured us:</PARA>
<PARA> Our aim is to minimise the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation. </PARA>
<PARA>How does that tie in with the agreement that has been signed on behalf of Australia? Foreign Minister Peacock spelt out the steps Australia believed should be taken to minimise the risk of nuclear weapons at the inaugural meeting of the Committee on disarmament. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia believes that the starting point for further progress in nuclear arms control should be the establishment of an international environment which will remove the motifivation to possess nuclear wapons, deter their acquisition and provide non-nuclear weapons states with security against nuclear attack. </PARA>
<PARA>How on earth could we provide non-nuclear weapon states with security against a nuclear attack if we did not provide them with the where-withal to create their own nuclear weapons? That is what it will take. There is not any way that we can provide security against a nuclear weapon attack without nuclear weapons. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Our efforts need to embrace:</PARA>
<PARA> substantial limitations and subsequent reductions in existing arsenals</PARA>
<PARA> the complete cessation of nuclear weapons testing in all environments. </PARA>
<PARA>Is that not classic? We are debating an agreement between Australia and France, which has already been signed, when we know that France is perhaps the greatest perpetrator of nuclear weapons testing. Already nuclear weapons have been tested by France at Mururoa Atoll in the Pacific. Tonight we heard Senator Puplick inform us that France is seriously considering moving its nuclear weapons testing to the Antarctic. Yet we are signing an agreement that will provide France with the necessary equipment to continue its proliferation of nuclear weapons. France is not even a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. It can do just as it likes, not that the Non-Proliferation Treaty would be any guarantee that France would not do what it likes. In 1968 France said that it was not going to sign the Treaty but it promised to behave in a similar manner to those countries which did sign it. Was that not generous?</PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, we have had the experience of Mururoa Atoll and the nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific. Surely to heaven we have learnt by now that France cannot be trusted and that it is perhaps the most immoral country when it comes to nuclear weapons. How can it say that it will not sign the non-proliferation treaty but will act in a responsible manner as other signatories to the treaty will be expected to act and yet go ahead with the weapons testing it has been conducting at Mururoa? What control have we had over those activities and what control would we have over any other activities if France wanted to enrich our uranium to 20 per cent or more? I have said and I repeat that there is no way that we could enforce an agreement if France decided to dishonour that agreement. We are not talking about gentlemen's agreements and a shake of the hand across the board room table. We are talking about the world. We have to be concerned about the world. Not just Australia and not just France are involved. We are talking about the whole world. Let us look at other most important matters which the Foreign Minister in 1979, Andrew Peacock, saw as being important. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons to countries not yet possessing them. </PARA>
<PARA>How on earth could we prevent that? How on earth could we prevent France, Sweden or Canada from providing countries which do not have nuclear weapons at this time with those weapons? If they wanted to sneak them in the back door, how would we know? If they wanted to use Australian uranium, how would we know? Mr Peacock went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>measures to ensure that the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes does not contribute to the proliferation of nuclear weapons</PARA>
<PARA>the cessation of the production of fissionable material for nuclear weapons purposes</PARA>
<PARA>satisfactory security assurances for non-nuclear weapon states confidence building measures which will limit the danger of nuclear war through miscalculation or the failure of communication. </PARA>
<PARA>The Fraser Government has been very big on talking about its commitment to nuclear arms control and disarmament. Its recent actions merely confirm that its real interest is in quick profits for big companies in an industry which is neither proven to be safe nor able to ensure an answer to the world's long term energy needs and which, by its own admission, provides the means by which more and more countries may produce nuclear weapons and heighten rather than diffuse the prospect of a nuclear holocaust. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard our own Prime Minister say that it is possible that we will have a nuclear war within three years. Any decision by this Government to allow other nations to reprocess spent nuclear fuel derived from Australian supplied uranium will make it possible for customer countries to extract, amongst other things, plutonium, which is a major material used in nuclear weapons. Despite the Government's pathetic protests that it in no way seeks to encourage the production of nuclear weapons, only a fool would be convinced that, with the flimsy qualification that customer countries will be required to 'demonstrate and to comply with Australian safeguards on storage and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons', there is any real safeguard. What do we do, for instance, if one of our customer countries informs us that some of our uranium is missing? That has happened before, and it has happened in Australia. I will refer to that matter in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me remind the Senate of a few other instances of shipments of uranium going missing and turning up in unexpected places. On 10 April 1969 a 8,500 lb shipment of enriched uranium from Goodyear Atomic Corporation to New York turned up in Cleveland, Ohio. There was no reason for its being there; it just went in the wrong direction. In India, in May 1974, police arrested five members of the personnel of a uranium enrichment plant and discovered that they had 3.6 kilograms of uranium. Inquiries revealed that a gang which stole uranium transported it through Nepal eventually to end up in Hong Kong. Where did it go after it had been through Hong Kong?</PARA>
<PARA> In the United States, on 2 February 1979, the Federal Bureau of Investigation recovered 68 kilograms of uranium stolen by an employee at the General Electric plant at Wilmington in North Carolina. On 11 May 1979, in France-Senator Primmer will probably recall this incident-a man tried to kill his employer with radioactive discs which he had placed under the seat of his car. Where did he get the discs from?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Charming! In Australia, on 31 October 1979, in a report in the West Australian-I have pointed out in this place many times that the West Australian is possibly the most conservative of all newspapers in the conservative Press in this country-the following report appeared:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Bushwalkers and children have access to a chemical dump at Australind where low level radioactive waste is stored. </PARA>
<PARA> The waste is radium 228, with a half-life of six years, and radium 226, with a half-life of 1,600 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The dump is on private land about 200 metres from the Collie River where bushwalkers often go. </PARA>
<PARA>That is charming! I want to refer to uranium and to those types of products which have gone missing in Australia. Honourable senators will recall that on 8 August last year it was found that quite a deal of uranium had been going missing from the Mary Kathleen mine, presumably over a lengthy period. People do not just cart out 2,200 kilograms of uranium overnight. It has to come from somewhere, and it is generally taken in little bits so that people do not realise that it is missing. On 16 August another man was charged with the theft of a further 220 kilograms of uranium oxide from the Mary Kathleeen uranium mine. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we do if we are told by some of our customer countries-these people with whom we are signing agreements and to whom we are selling our uranium-that some of our shipment is missing? I do not know. </PARA>
<PARA> I was hoping that some of the Government members would be able to tell me a little more clearly just what it is that these nuclear safeguard agreements are supposed to mean. At the moment they do not mean very much at all to me. As I have already pointed out, the agreements are with France, Canada and Sweden. I have no reason to trust France and I am sure that many people in Australia feel very strongly about the Australian Government entering into any sort of nuclear safeguard agreement with France after the attitudes it has portrayed in the Pacific in regard to its nuclear testing. I believe Australia does have a part to play, even if it is only secondary to and perhaps even dependent upon the actions of the super-powers. </PARA>
<PARA> I am disturbed that as long ago as 1978 we were told that Australia was already spending $7m a day on arms. I think there are much more useful and peaceful ways in which $7m a day could be expended in this country. As I have already said, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Peacock, on 24 January 1979 said that arms control and disarmament are the gravest problems facing the world today and that solutions are imperative. Solutions are imperative. They come closer to reality now, not necessarily because of the fact that we have these agreements, but because these agreements mean so little. It is an incredible situation to find oneself in-recognising that we have a need to assist those countries which do not have energy supplies and realising the small amounts by comparison which are going into the discovery and continuation of other worthwhile fuel energy cycles. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to hear Dr Mark Diesendorf from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation speaking on a talkback radio program in Western Australia yesterday, prior to my leaving for Canberra. Some of the things that he had to say were extremely interesting, including the fact that we cannot have just one nuclear energy station. If we are to operate on nuclear energy all the time, there must be two stations, which doubles the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking tonight on the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) on nuclear safeguard agreements with Canada, France and Sweden. I wonder how much governments, and the Australian Government in particular, understand about the enrichment process. I question whether in actual fact they are aware that plutonium metal will be created whether the reactor is in fact intended to make bombs or whether it is intended to have much larger quantities come from reprocessing plants built purposely to reprocess that substance. The Australian Government has stated that reprocessing cannot be undertaken without prior consent from Australia. As I have said, this is not an easy provision to enforce. In fact, short of massive interference in the internal affairs of the recipient countries, Australia could not possibly enforce that provision. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that Australians are being fooled by a government which is attempting to conceal its utter contempt and disregard for the principles of non-proliferation behind this non-existent safeguard, because it is a non-existent safeguard. There is no way in which we can guarantee to anybody in Australia that our uranium will not be used in the proliferation of nuclear weapons. I think the Government has failed to take into consideration the catastrophic consequences that could follow from the passing of plutonium into the wrong hands. I believe it is a matter of the gravest national importance yet no concern was expressed either in the statement presented to the Parliament or in the agreements. I hope that we are not too cynical and too totally irresponsible to forget John Donne's famous and appropriate line:</PARA>
<PARA> No man is an Island, entire of itself;</PARA>
<PARA>We are not an island, we may be an island continent. But we have to be concerned for the safety and the security of the whole world. Senator Mason in a previous speech pointed to the pitifully inadequate safeguards announced by the Government. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> How can we be assured that governments keep their agreements. What would happen in the event of a coup d'etat such as that recently in South Korea in which a new military regime could renounce previous agreements? In this case plutonium held in storage could then be diverted readily and quickly to the production of small high fall-out type A bombs-fission weapons capable of global nuclear pollution-and could even be used to attack Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's policy may place Australians at greater risk of a nuclear attack. Nations such as France and Japan, which it seems are the only two nations so far which will be allowed to reprocess uranium, cannot give guarantees that every government from now to eternity will abide by the rules of the uranium game according to Malcolm Fraser. According to Malcolm Fraser, it is a game. We are playing with people's lives. We are playing with the future of children on this earth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly will be from now to eternity. It seems clear to me that Mr Fraser has forgotten or perhaps never meant his words of 1979 which I quoted earlier. He said that the Government's aim was to minimise the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation. Yet none of these agreements does just that. If anything, they maximise the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation. I, for one, am not prepared to accept as a fact of life, as Mr Anthony has put it, the export and reprocessing of Australian uranium and the obvious implications of greater access and stockpiling of nuclear weapons by formerly non-nuclear weapons possessing countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this world only a handful of people will benefit either directly or indirectly from the development of nuclear power and specifically nuclear weapons. Yet that fact of life is forcibly being imposed on us. Who is going to benefit? Not many Australians will benefit. Who, I wonder, will protect them when nuclear war becomes a reality? If people want to know how ill-prepared Australia is for that eventuality they should contact their special emergency services to get hold of a document which shows what to do in case of a nuclear attack. It is a gem. It is something that every Australian should read. Some of the documents go back to 1968. They have not been updated. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia Dr Geoff Williams has just been given a grant of $100,000 by the Western Australian Government to study something like 127 buildings in the Perth city area which are considered to have nuclear safe areas. It is incredible that $100,000 is to be spent on a survey of about 127 buildings that are considered to be safe in the event of a nuclear attack on Perth. I suppose that is all right if one happens to be in or near one of those buildings and enough warning is given to enable one to get into the basements of those buildings where one apparently will be safe. </PARA>
<PARA> We live in strange times. It is strange to me because it is clear that the overwhelming majority of people throughout the world want peace. The declaration of the international conference for zones of peace in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans as long ago as 1978 expressed concern that we could in actual fact assist mankind better by creating a zone of peace, by declaring the whole nation a zone of peace. What a wonderful thought that is. We know that we do not have a government committed so deeply to peace or to peaceful purposes that it will do anything about it. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5V4">Senator COLEMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is indeed. At this time, whether we like it or not, we are a zone of war. Australia is prepared to sell the potential for nuclear weapons to almost anybody, as I have said. France is the most immoral country that one could imagine so far as nuclear weapons testing is concerned, yet we are selling her our uranium. A special clause is contained in the agreement which says that in all probability Australia will give consent to enriching uranium to 20 per cent. I want to conclude my remarks by referring to two important quotations. Paragraph 47 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations held on 30 June 1978 stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nuclear weapons pose the greatest danger to mankind and to the survival of civilisation. It is essential to halt and reverse the nuclear arms race in all its aspects in order to avert the danger of war involving nuclear weapons. The ultimate goal in this context is the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet here tonight we are discussing the wherewithal to manufacture those nuclear weapons. The final quotation to which I wish to refer comes from President Franklin D. Roosevelt, in his address to Congress on 6 January 1941. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The fourth--</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to a principle or ideal-</PARA>
<PARA>is freedom from fear-which, translated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbour-anywhere in the world. </PARA>
<PARA>I totally reject these agreements. Unfortunately, they have already been signed. I am not a lone voice on this side of the chamber but there is no voice from honourable senators opposite. Not one honourable senator opposite is prepared to debate these very important agreements tonight. They are supposed to be safeguards agreements with France, Canada and Sweden on the provision of our uranium and the nuclear safeguards that will apply. It seems a great shame to me that we will not have the opportunity to hear words of wisdom from the Government benches. I think it is about time the Government recognised its priorities. Obviously, nuclear safeguards agreements is not one of them. </PARA>

I just said to another colleague: 'I feel I am singing an old song to a tired audience'. At times one wonders whether in this place it is worth rising to comment on these matters. It is not worthless making these comments outside because more and more Australian people understand what honourable senators on this side of the chamber are saying when they are talking about the whole nuclear industry and its proliferation into armament. It would appear that honourable senators opposite no longer want to comment. I do not believe that honourable senators opposite do not understand the very real problems that are attached to the nuclear industry and to our assistance in the proliferation of nuclear arms by mining uranium. I think they understand very well the problems. The Government has been painted into a corner by the uranium miners and the nuclear industry. It appears that there is no longer anybody on the other side of the chamber with sufficient courage or the stomach to face up to the arguments that need to be put in this particular instance.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators opposite know that nuclear war is threatened. They know that there are no safeguards so far as nuclear war is concerned and they know that Australia is providing the material from which those nuclear weapons will be made. Much is made in the statement attached to the agreements about the fact that the Government believes in and is working actively to enhance the international non-proliferation regime through action in multilateral bodies, but at the same time as it is saying that it is allowing American B52 bombers to use bases in Australia. The Government tells us that we should not be concerned because the Americans will use them only to train their pilots in navigation. It tells us that the B52s are unarmed. Of course it omits to tell us that, in military parlance, saying a bomber is unarmed does not mean that it is not carrying bombs; it just means that those bombs are not primed at that particular time. The Government hides behind such words. It knows very well that we are threatened with nuclear war and it admits that there is no safeguard. I have proof of that in a letter from the Minister for Defence, Mr Killen, in which he said in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A complete protection against the effects of the explosion of nuclear weapons is not a practicable civil defence objective for any country. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . successive Australian Governments have taken the view that our primary concern should be to support the effectiveness of the US deterrent to war itself. </PARA>
<PARA>We know what the United States deterrent is. It includes such things as B52 bombers carrying nuclear weapons that will land on our shores and paint us into whatever deterrent action the United States of America is going to take. That is the sort of proposition we have from the Government, and no Government member has enough guts to stand up here and put up an argument for it. The statement talks about our active role in the Committee on Disarmament. What is our active role in that Committee? It is providing the wherewithal for nuclear weapons. Certainly I have not seen any statement from this Government which says: 'We believe in peace. We will fight for peace. We will be for peace in any circumstances.' Instead, we have a Government which, from the sorts of statements it has made, is hell bent on provoking anything but peace in places such as Afghanistan, El Salvador and Poland. Where is there one statement from one Government Minister which says: 'We believe in all circumstances in peace, and we will fight for peace'? There are plenty of statements about deterrents.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OL7">Senator MELZER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Plenty of statements about war. Our active role in the Committee on Disarmament is referred to, while we provide the very material from which nuclear weapons are made. The statement talks about our continuing work to encourage such studies as those on plutonium storage, spent fuel management and assurance of supply, all of which are geared to a continuation of the supply of the material from which nuclear weapons are made, and the upgrading of international safeguards measures, particularly in respect of proliferation-sensitive technologies. What are we doing in that respect? Nothing-no research, no statements, and no active turning of our backs on nuclear war. We are told in the statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of the Agreements is to ensure that when Australia supplies uranium for peaceful purposes it will not be diverted to non-peaceful or explosive uses. </PARA>
<PARA>It does not say whether these agreements apply to the source materials, such as yellowcake, or whether they apply only after enrichment. If they apply only to the source materials such as yellowcake, that is just so many words on paper. There is no way in which we can stop yellowcake once it has been enriched from being diverted to non-peaceful or explosive uses. The statement goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> These safeguards and controls remain in place over all Australian origin nuclear material so long as the material remains relevant from the point of view of safeguards as determined by the IAEA;</PARA>
<PARA>For what sort of period are we covering this material? For how long does that sort of mealy-mouthed statement apply? We will keep the safeguards covering the material so long as it remains relevant from the point of view of safeguards as determined by the International Atomic Energy Agency. There are no safeguards determined by the IAEA at this moment, so what safeguards are we talking about? What safeguards are we putting on this material? If we are talking about the life of the material, that is, the time over which that material can be used, we are talking about a period of over 1,000 years. Are we seriously proposing that these agreements can be kept in force and will safeguard this material for that length of time? As the Opposition has said before, no era has lasted, no regime has remained in control, for anything like that period. What reason do we have to believe that any civilisation of which we are a part will be able to control material for anything like that period?</PARA>
<PARA> Nowhere does this document tell us how countries can retreat from this arrangement. We know that under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons countries are required to give only 90 days notice and they can then say: 'That's it. We are out of it.' Does that apply to these agreements too? If it does not apply, and if these agreements are to stay in force for 1,000 years, what will we do if a country says: 'Sorry, it does not suit us any more'? Nothing. We have supplied the material with which civilisation can be obliterated and we have absolutely no way of enforcing these mealy-mouthed safeguards. Part of the proposal talks about fallback safeguards. They can provide for the prohibition of explosive or military use, the application of the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards-fallback safeguards, in the event that IAEA safeguards cease to apply. Those IAEA safeguards do not apply now, so will somebody please tell us what the fallback safeguards are? What fallback position can we possibly have when dealing with this sort of material? This renowned document refers to:</PARA>
<PARA>prior consent rights over reprocessing, high enrichment and transfers to third countries, as well as internationally recognised levels of physical protection. </PARA>
<PARA>Will somebody please tell me what are the internationally recognised levels of physical protection? There is none, as we all know. We all know that it is impossible to impose them, so what is the point of drawing them up? It is just so much hot air. Further, the statement talks about our exporting of uranium under stringent safeguards. I should like to know what sort of stringent safeguards apply when at this very moment drums of yellowcake are being sneaked out of Darwin under all sorts of cloak and dagger conditions. They are being flown into Darwin from the mine site, sneaked on to planes and flown out to Singapore, to go where? We are told that their final destination may be Japan but they will have to be enriched before they get there. We have no way of knowing where those drums of yellowcake have gone. After a drum of yellowcake is taken into a country, to expect the people of Australia or the people of the world to believe that the exact material comes out of that country again is just hypocritical nonsense. There is no way in the world whereby, once a drum of yellowcake has been tipped into an enrichment plant, we can ever know where our yellowcake has gone, what bomb it finishes up in, which country it annihilates, how many people it kills in a thousand years time. The Minister for Foreign Affairs told us further in the statement:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government has developed an approach to reprocessing which fully satisfies the Government's non-proliferation concerns. </PARA>
<PARA>If I can say so cynically, I agree that it probably has, because the Government has not got any non-proliferation concerns. So the very fact that it has developed such an approach to reprocessing is probably the truest statement in the whole document. If we accepted that an Australian government did have a concern about non-proliferation, how on earth could we believe in this nuclear world where there are no accounting processes, no monitoring procedures and no reliable procedures or processes to prevent a small but significant amount of plutonium being diverted, it could write into a document a phrase to the effect that the reprocessing procedures that have been set out fully satisfy its non-proliferation concern?</PARA>
<PARA> It is common knowledge that all over the world plutonium has been lost, stolen, diverted or whatever term we like to use. It has gone from being officially used for nuclear power to countries or to people who want to produce nuclear weapons. That has been proved over and over again. Small amounts perhaps are involved, but large amounts are not needed to make nuclear weapons. The situation has even reached the point, as my colleague Senator Coleman pointed out, that ordinary people are using this sort of material for their own ends to wreak revenge. In a case which came before the French courts only last month the French Government charged a man who had planted radioactive substances in a car belonging to his boss. A newspaper report of the case stated, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> It . . . revealed weaknesses in security at the Leastone nuclear decontamination centre. </PARA>
<PARA>The report stated that the man in question said that he found three tubes containing radioactive substances under the driving seat of his car, and it continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The tubes were thrown back into a pool at the company's headquarters. </PARA>
<PARA> In the pool, nuclear wastes in tubes from all over Europe are dropped for decontamination . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Expert witnesses said it was easy for Lecomte to fish some of the tubes out of the pool, stuff them into plastic containers to protect himself from radiation and put them under Busin's car . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The newspaper Le Figaro said: 'Engineers at the decontamination company admit that no adequate equipment has been invented to prevent the theft of radioactive material. </PARA>
<PARA>'A thief has only to know the area to avoid setting off the alarm sirens. It is all rather frightening.'</PARA>
<PARA>It is all rather frightening right across the spectrum because we cannot guard even small portions of material that have been discarded from the nuclear industry and are being kept for some sort of disposal. The material to which I have just referred was being kept for decontamination. It could not be guarded. We cannot guard the material that sails the high seas in ships. We cannot guard the material that is carried by road in trucks. We cannot guard the material that is carried by railroads. We cannot guard the material that is put in waste dumps. We cannot guard the material that is sent into factories to make high-grade nuclear weapons. Nobody in the world has found a way in which to guard that material and Australia is the country that supplies the raw material in those sorts of instances. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the agreements under discussion is with Sweden. In the statement accompanying the presentation to the Senate of the Agreement it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Sweden . . . has a firm commitment to nuclear power confirmed in a referendum last year . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is a little less than the truth. Sweden has a commitment to nuclear power to the year 2000, if it cannot produce the power from any other source in that time, and a commitment to be free of nuclear power after the year 2000. This week the news came that Sweden is opening its own mine, against some strong opposition from the Swedes themselves who see the opening of a mine as a way to destroy their water supply and an area where their deer graze. Once Sweden has opened its mine, if it does, and once material is produced from that mine, how will we differentiate between Swedish uranium and Australian uranium? There is no way in which we will be able to do so. So we will be seen by the Swedish people as being a party to the destruction of their country as uranium destroys their water supply and their pastures. The Government could at least be honest about Sweden. It could honestly say what the position is. It could honestly say that a great number of Swedes are against the Swedish nuclear program and are working very hard to see to it that Sweden does not go nuclear or goes nuclear to the least possible extent. Instead the Government suggested in its statement that all Swedes are going all the way with nuclear power and will continue being all the way with nuclear power into the future. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleagues have already questioned the role that France plays in nuclear proliferation. France is an unabashed nuclear weapons country which has not signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It is a country to which we have gone cap in hand begging it to buy our uranium to the point where in 1979 permission was given to the uranium miners to conclude conditional contracts with the French before any safeguards such as these were drawn up or had actually been signed-so hungry are the uranium miners for some return and so stupid does Australia appear to be. The statement talks about the IAEA and its verification activities in France. That will not be of any comfort to us because for one thing the IAEA has admitted that it has not got anything like the number of inspectors it would need to keep a close watch on activities in France and we know very well in any case that France is of no mind to let inspectors in to inspect its facilities. The statement says:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . no Australian supplied uranium can be transferred to any third country which Australia itself would not be prepared to supply directly. </PARA>
<PARA>How will we ever know? Because they say they will not do so or have not done so? What will we do once it has been transferred to a country such as Pakistan or to one of the African countries? What will we do when such a country says: 'We have supplied them with some plutonium which might very well have been produced from your uranium. What are you going to do about it'? We could do nothing about it. Will we stop supplying such a country with more uranium, or will we stop selling our wool or our wheat? Will we disallow one of the mineral contracts which we might have signed with it by then? There is no way in the world we would do that. The Government's statement is just so much rhtoric and so much hot air. Nobody can guarantee that a country which produces nuclear weapons, as France does, will not use Australian uranium to produce the material for those nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> Already we are caught between France and Japan. Japan sends its waste to France to be reprocessed. We are jammed in there and we would have absolutely no way of knowing what material had gone where and when it had gone there. We would have no way at all. France is tied in with Euratom, the European Atomic Energy Community. We know very well that Euratom is tied with a scheme which allows the free flow of material between European countries. How do we cope with this? I suggest, for instance, that France would treat us with derision, would ignore whatever piece of paper it had signed and would go its own way. Already, of course, we cannot guarantee that our uranium would not be used in the tests in the Pacific. Horrifically, we have no way of knowing whether our uranium would be used in tests in the Antarctic if the French go ahead with the project, and we have no reason to believe that the French will not push ahead with it. This document further states:</PARA>
<PARA> The conclusion of the Agreement is proof that the two Governments--</PARA>
<PARA>The governments of Canada and of Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>are willing to accept themselves the stringent controls they require of others. </PARA>
<PARA>That sounds to me to be a bit like that old joke about the lady who went to the dentist and the tag line is: 'But we will not hurt each other, will we?' I think that that is much the same as the feeling between Canada and Australia. How can we accept that of Canada? I remind honourable senators that it was Canada who supplied the reactor to India. India was to use it only for experimentation but India was naughty and used that reactor to produce a nuclear weapon and blew a great big hole in the ground. What could anybody do? Everybody tut-tutted. Canada said that she would not supply any more uranium. That policy lasted a short time and recently both Canada and America have decided that India has shown her regrets and has paid the price and they will again supply uranium to her. </PARA>

<PARA>. . . while applying stringent non-proliferation safeguards to our uranium exports we are prepared to make Australian uranium available to customer countries for legitimate peaceful energy purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out to the Senate that the whole nuclear energy program came into being because the military juntas around the world wanted to produce nuclear weapons. In producing the material for nuclear weapons, energy was produced. So the so-called peaceful nuclear energy program was a great cover to provide nuclear weapons for the world. Uranium miners are so desperate for a return on the capital which they have invested that they will push governments to anything. Already we have the international spreading of nuclear weapons. Small countries all over the world are desperate to show that they too are as good as the country next door, or are desperate to pressure the country next door, by seeking nuclear weapons. If President Reagan is successful in lifting the safeguards agreements and allowing nuclear weapons, plutonium and uranium to be exported to Pakistan, we can be held just as responsible. If our uranium is exported to America we have absolutely no way of knowing that our uranium was not part of the bomb which might very well start the next war, which will be a nuclear war. </PARA>
<PARA> The uranium miners, as I said, are desperate for some sort of return. They have invested $420m in a processing plant. At the moment the price for uranium is hitting $20 per lb. This means that if one wants some sort of return on the money one put in, one is desperate to sell it anywhere and at any time. That, very obviously, is the stand which the uranium miners of the world and the uranium miners represented in Australia are taking, and this Government is going along with them. Never mind about all the high-flown phrases in this statement. Never mind about the so-called safeguards. There is no safeguard once this material is used. The Government is not prepared to look at safeguards in any fashion because, as it knows, and as we know, the only real safeguard is to keep the wretched material in the ground. If the Government really cared about peace, about non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, about keeping this world free from nuclear war, it would disregard the greedy uranium miners and it would listen to the majority of the people of France, Canada and Sweden who say, as we do: 'Leave it in the ground'. </PARA>

I am the fourth speaker tonight from my side of the chamber. Not one Government member has participated except by way of a couple of childish interjections. It is a matter which should be handled by the Minister in charge of the Department of National Energy and Development, Senator Carrick, regardless of whether the Department of Foreign Affairs or other departments are involved. He is the man who is supposed to be responsible for the production of nuclear material and, in company with other Ministers, of course, to see that safeguards are observed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is surprising that the most junior Minister, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) is in charge of the House during such an important debate-a junior Minister who, incidentally, is having great difficulty handling his own portfolio, who has rubbished the people suffering from the effects of agent orange and who has said that a lot of the things they have been suffering from are psychological, or, alternatively, that they have been taking drugs or that they have venereal disease. This week or in the week after the Easter recess I will provide the Minister with some photographic proof of what is happening. It will show that even he has not a grip on the problems in his Department. I understand that Senator Carrick was otherwise engaged tonight on Nation- wide, where he behaved like a crashing bore and was an abject failure in trying to explain the scandal which has now become apparent over the last day or so involving the Rundle shale oil deposits. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement between Australia and France-I think this is a prime example-is one of the most tragic things which has ever been entered into by a dictatorial country. That is what France is. France has never signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In years to come there will still be deaths from the atomic tests carried out in the Pacific. We do not know yet the long term results of the damage which has been done to the marine environment by France's underground testing. We do not know precisely what happened in the nuclear accident there some little time ago because France has been terribly silent about it, but that accident caused injury and death. I suppose one could align France's secrecy in its atomic testing with that of Russia and China. The Non-Proliferation Treaty has not been signed by China. There has been secrecy surrounding the experimentation in regard to the testing of atomic weapons. One can apply this on a broad basis to America. I shall quote a letter dated 30 October from the Australian Embassy in Paris to the French Secretary-General who entered into the negotiations with Australia. I propose to incorporate a copy of the letter of agreement at the end of my speech. The letter was sent to M. Bruno de Leusse de Syon, Secretaire-General, Ministere des Affaires Etrangeres. The address and postcode are also shown. Let me quote a couple of paragraphs from the letter. If this is not a bootlicking episode as far as the Australian Government is concerned then I would like to know what is. In the first paragraph Mr Rowland states:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr dear Secretary-General,</PARA>
<PARA> I have the honour to refer to discussions between Australian and French officials which took place in Canberra in August 1980 which covered, inter alia, an agreement for a transitional arrangement to enable conversion and/or enrichment in France of Australian origin nuclear material supplied to Japan under a sales contract concluded prior to 2 December 1972. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Doug Scott led a team to France to conduct some negotiations associated with these agreements. One of the first indications we had that something was going to go wrong was a statement made by Senator Scott. From memory it was made from Paris. We were told nothing about these secret agreements that were going on. If time permits I propose tonight to read from another document which I compiled, otherwise I will do so when I continue my speech on another day. One of the great problems has been the secrecy surrouding the negotiations for the selling of uranium whether it is in the enriched form or in ore form. Incidentally, recently a statement was made by, I think, that great leader of democracy the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, who said that the Australian Government was still planning to go ahead with an enrichment plant in this country. I will not ask the responsible Minister in this place to carry the load of responsibility by requesting him to explain all about it because I am sure he has never heard of it, and obviously he would never have read the paper anyway. I refer to page 2 of Mr Rowland's letter. This ought to go into the record. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) This letter applies only to 478 short tons of uranium concentrate (yellowcake) which is proposed to be shipped from Australia under the contract between Shikoku Electric Power Company and Queensland Mines Ltd concluded on 9 October 1972 as to 300 short tons in January 1981 and as to 178 short tons in April 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>Prior to the holding of the 1972 election, when the Labor Party was succesful in winning government, none of this information was released. It was a state secret. It was probably a classified document. But now that the agreements have been made all these little things are seeping out. This shows there has been long term planning. It further shows, as the Minister for National Development and Energy indicated in this place today over the Rundle scandal, that he is not in control of the energy policy of this country and he does not know what is going on. As one of my colleagues on this side of the House said during the debate on the matter of public importance, a whole host of small shareholders have lost something like $57m. I would say-I make this accusation in all sincerity-that before this happened the Government or the people responsible in Government had warned the big shareholders what was going to happen to Rundle. In other words, it was a fake show so that some people could rip off the cream, just as in the so-called takeover of Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort Ltd. Some $16m was ripped off Australian taxpayers by avoidance of tax to fatten the pockets of somebody who already was wealthy. Paragraph 2 of the letter from Mr Rowland states:</PARA>
<PARA> For the purposes of this Letter the following definitions apply:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) ''Australian origin nuclear material'' means uranium concentrate (natural uranium ore concentrate of the approximate chemical formulation U308) and all natural, enriched and depleted uranium products, including compounds, derived therefrom, or equivalent quantities;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) ''conversion'' means transformation by chemical processes of uranium concentrate to uranium hexafluoride;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) ''enrichment'' means increasing the ratio of the isotope uranium 235 to the total uranium isotopes above the ratio found in nature;</PARA>
<PARA>If I may interpolate, this shows a progression well on the way towards plutonium. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> (d) ''appropriate governmental authority'' means, in the case of France, the Secretaire-General du Comite Interministeriel de la Securite Nucleaire--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the interministerial section responsible for security nuclear weapons-</PARA>
<PARA> or such other authority as the French Government may designate from time to time and, in the case of Australia, the Australian Safeguards Office or such other authority as the Australian Government may designate from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Australian origin nuclear material, when in France, shall not be used for any other purpose than the conversion and/or enrichment below 20 per cent in the isotope U235 contracted for and the associated storage. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to deal with a couple of other so-called safeguards. That document is not worth the paper that it is written on. I do not know what is wrong with this Government but it is totally oblivious to the general feeling of people in Australia in relation to the mining of uranium. I have here the results of a poll, which I propose to read, together with the questions that were asked in this survey which was taken in the Townsville region some 12 or 18 months ago when the Premier of Queensland was most anxious to see that a uranium enrichment plant was established in that area without any regard to safeguards. There was a telephone poll and a street survey. I will give the results for both. The first question was:</PARA>
<PARA> Are you in favour of a uranium enrichment plant being built in the Townsville area?</PARA>
<PARA>The results of the telephone survey, which covered 100 people, were: Twenty-six in favour; 68 opposed; six people did not understand the question, did not want to be involved or did not care. The results of the street survey of 409 people in relation to the first question were: One hundred and eleven in favour; 276 opposed, and 22 came into the other category I mentioned. The second question was:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) If 'Yes' to Q1 say 'Could you please give me your reasons why?'</PARA>
<PARA> (b) If 'No' or any other reason given in Q1 ask 'Do you support the building of uranium enrichment plants elsewhere in Australia?'</PARA>
<PARA>The people surveyed were slightly less emphatic in their responses to this question. The results of the telephone survey in relation to the second question were: Twenty-two said 'yes'; 44 said 'no'. In other words, there was a 100 per cent difference. Some people did not answer this question at all and two people had other replies. The results of the street survey of 409 people in relation to the second question were: Sixty-two said 'yes'; 208 said 'no' and six were undecided. The third question was a very important one. The others were important but this was the most important. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Do you feel there is enough information on the safety, and waste disposal problems affecting the nuclear industry?</PARA>
<PARA>In the telephone poll 12 said 'yes'; 76 said 'no' and 12 were undecided. In the street survey, 23 said 'yes'-that is, 23 people out of 409 were convinced that nuclear safeguards were sufficient-380 gave an emphatic 'no' vote and only six were undecided. Those are the sorts of figures that ought to be generally known. They have been published but not widely. There have been no gallup polls for several years in Australia to find out what the Australian population really thinks about the mining of uranium. </PARA>
<PARA> I know the Government Whip was very emphatic that we ought to go ahead-I know that Senator Kilgariff will admit this-with the mining of uranium in the Northern Territory. But when Japan said it would send the nuclear waste back for burying in his country from which he wanted uranium to go he said: 'No, not under any circumstances will you bury it in the central Australian desert'. The Premier of Queensland, who is known as the great upholder of democracy in this country, got very keen on the Burdekin dam project because a lot of water was needed to establish an enrichment plant in the region. But when he found out that the National Party undertook a similar poll to that which I have referred to and came up with almost identical answers he got cold feet and said: 'We will put it in a remote area'. But he did not say that it would be built in Kingaroy. Now the proposal has gone into limbo and money for the Burdekin dam has disappeared, obviously as a result of collusion between this Government and the Queensland Government in relation to the mining of uranium. </PARA>
<PARA> I have the results of a local authority poll for a referendum which was taken in the Thuringowa Shire. The Minatome mine is located just inside the Dalrymple Shire. The Chairman of the Thuringowa Shire, Danny Gleeson, a political chameleon, who had been in the Labor Party-in fact he has been in everything except the bath-said he would be one of the those who would take part in a civil rights campaign. I am delighted to see Senator Carrick has entered the chamber after the massive show which he has just put on for Nationwide. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to pursue the quest that, in conjunction with Senator Button, I started last week to probe to the full extent whether the Australian Institute of Sport is fully achieving the objectives for which it was set up. Senator Button and I have not been altogether happy with the responses we have been getting. When Senator Button initially raised the subject last Tuesday night he received a response from Senator Peter Baume who in a guarded fashion said that there was some sort of demarcation dispute between the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson), who is normally the Minister who deals with sporting issues, and the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman). On the next day I pursued the matter a little further. I asked whether-this was the main thrust of my campaign-in line with the objects that were supposed to be embodied in the Australian Institute of Sport, we were going to provide special facilities for field games exponents. I had in mind particularly discus throwers and people who put the shot. On Wednesday, in a further question to Senator Peter Baume, I pointed out that it is accepted that there are many claims on the usage of the Bruce Stadium and that it appeared that there was some reluctance to let the field games people use it because of damage to the turf.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst we can argue about sports priorities, the real issue is embodied in Senator Baume's statement that the Bruce Stadium is a sort of half-way house and the Canberra College of Advanced Education is prepared to have its oval used on an interim basis. Australia is probably unfortunate in that we do not have the total state commitment that applies in eastern European and most western European countries. We do not have the numerous millionaires that the United States has. In all those countries athletics are pretty well funded and facilities are usually first class. I wish to hammer home the point that some athletes are treated as second class competitors as far as facilities are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Before reporting my remarks on Thursday morning the Canberra Times had asked the respective Ministers for a comment. In the criticism that I voice, I want it to be clearly known that nobody is questioning the dedication of the director of the Australian Institute of Sport, Don Talbot. He made his mark in the swimming world. I do not question his appointment to this top position but I believe that he is in a squeeze play between the two departments. Senator Baume expounded the idea that we have an alternative place for the field games exponents. I say that that is not good enough. Obviously, the College of Advanced Education would be responsible to some degree to a Minister other than the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment. I come back to my attitude in this area. I think I have had more experience than most in eastern European travel. I know that if a certain area is the responsibility of only one Minister all departmental bickering is removed. I pointed out to Senator Baume that some of Australia's top field games girls such as Gael Mulhall and Bev Francis, who I suppose epitomise the zestfulness of Australian womanhood, who train so assiduously and of whom we expect the maximum number of succeses overseas, are given second class facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> What burns me up is that, although Senator Button started this probe last Tuesday and I continued it on Wednesday, we have had no comment from the Minister, Ian Wilson, the Lochinvar from Adelaide-not a word. We have heard nothing from his Department and nothing from the Minister for the Capital Territory. I have checked the Canberra Times up to this morning. No comments have been reported from the Ministers. I know what is behind it. This is the month of April. I say to those people who compete in field games-I have had discussions with officials of the Victorian Women's Amateur Athletic Association-that all that I have said about the playing down of field games has been borne out by the wall of silence. I say again that it is the month of April. The Budget will be presented in August. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) spoke on record about this Institute and what it would do. We were going to recapture former glories in some sports. Frankly, it has become a victim of the gang of four. I give notice now to my colleagues in the Estimates committees which deal with the estimates for the Department of Home Affairs and Environment and the Department of the Capital Territory that we will certainly push this matter. But I am a political realist. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume, who represents the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment in this chamber, is absent from the Senate. I took the trouble to ring his office at 10 a.m. to advise him that I would raise this matter. Senator Messner, representing the Minister for the Capital Territory, may be the one to give me good tidings; I do not know. I can assure him that as far as many people outside this chamber and I are concerned, if the Institute is to meet its full ramifications, every one and every sport must be equal as far as its operations are concerned. I say again and again that it is not a matter of having interim facilities. There is ample land in Canberra for such facilities. There is no question that a short discussion between the Minister for the Capital Territory, Michael Hodgman, and the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, Ian Wilson, should clear up the matter in an hour. As a matter of fact, anybody who read last Thursday's Canberra Times would have got the impression that we were on the threshold of a breakthrough. </PARA>
<PARA> Like most senators, I have a copy of the Australian Olympic Federation report on the 1980 Olympic Games. In the women's field games, the first place in the discus throwing competition went to East Germany, the second to Bulgaria and the third to the Soviet Union. In the shot put competition East Germany was first, the Soviet Union was second and East Germany was third. I am not a jingoistic person and I do not think any of our athletes are either, but this is the age of specialisation. The money involved would be peanuts. When some of these early Press releases came out I almost asked whether some Press officers prostituted their profession. Frankly, the style now is for a Minister to announce a new era, a vision splendid, and when six months later as a political infantryman one tries to find out what has happened there are always a lot of gaps in the story. There is no doubt that if Senator Button and I had not commenced this probe last week these girls who compete in discus and shot put events, would have been living in a dream world believing that everything was right. Well, everything is not right. I believe that we pay a pretty poor compliment to these people. We expect them to compete overseas in the future. I have before me a letter from the Australian Olympic Federation, signed by the Honourary Secretary-General. He deals with forward planning. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> Preparation for . . . the Summer Games . . . in Los Angeles, July 28th-August 12th-and the Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to mention future targets. Here we are arguing about the piddling amount of money needed to provide land for this Institute. As we have seen happen so often in many sports, if one is only a tenant and not the landlord, by the whim of somebody else one can be pitched out. I think we all appreciate that the rhythm of training should be maintained and that if it is suddenly broken we cannot expect success. </PARA>
<PARA> I wind up on this point: Those people in the field games have been excellent ambassadors for Australia in any country in which they have been competing. Even though in this particular area we certainly were not quite up to the standard of the East European countries that I mentioned there is no doubt that we were in the Pacific Games. Gael Mulhall, for example, dominated those proceedings as she did in the subsequent games held in the capital city of the State of South Australia which the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Messner, represents. I note that the Minister acquiesces with that assertion. The fact is, as I said last week, that actions speak louder than words and I would expect the two Ministers to go public and give us the real story. What is much more important is that at the end of a season these girls are still training hard. The Melbourne Age of Monday carried a report about one of our illustrious coaches who had been unwell but who had come back to coaching under extreme difficulties. Most of our top athletes flocked to him to discuss technical problems with him. If that dedication by our athletes is to be maintained, let us give a bit of lead. Let the two Ministers concerned make a public utterance. I repeat, in this age of budgets for departments amounting to many millions, not much money is here involved. I leave the matter at that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I intend to correct misleading information given to this chamber last week by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Peter Baume. Last week, Senator Walters asked a Dorothy Dix question of the Minister in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar). Senator Walters's question related to Federal Government funding for local government. She asked whether the Minister could 'inform the chamber of the amount by which the Federal Government funding to local government has increased since the Fraser Governent took office'. If the Minister had not been given advance warning of this question, he would not have had the necessary figures at hand. Last Wednesday, however, he provided to the honourable senator for Tasmania figures which purported to show how much more the Fraser Government had given to local authorities than the previous Labor Government. This exchange occurred on 1 April so perhaps the Minister was only trying to enter into the spirit of the day when he answered Senator Walters's question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Briefly, the Minister informed Senator Walters that in the last Whitlam Budget-1975-76-the sum of $80m was provided to local government; that in the first Fraser Budget-1976-77-it jumped to $140m; and that in last year's Budget, the allocation made by the allegedly generous Fraser Government to local authorities was $221m. These figures are certainly impressive. I am sure that many people who heard the question and answer on the rebroadcast of proceedings that evening would think that the Fraser Government had been extremely generous to local authorities. The only problem is that Senator Baume's assertions are not correct. The Minister has conveniently looked at only one aspect of the Federal Government's financial assistance to local authorities, namely, general purpose assistance for local government. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer the Minister to 1980-81 Budget Paper No. 7, a copy of which I am sure he has in his office. He will see that on page 108 there is a long list of other direct and indirect payments that are Federal Government grants to local authorities. At the base of page 108 the total amounts provided to local government by the Commonwealth Government are shown for four financial years. These amounts are: 1976-77, $192.160m; 1977-78, $201.668m; 1978-79, $212.094m; and 1979-80, $255.313m. If the Minister would consult a previous Budget Paper, he would see that the total amount, not in just one area that happened to suit the Minister's argument, provided to local government in the last Whitlam Budget in 1975-76 was $274.255m. So, not in any year since the Fraser Government took office has the total amount allocated to local government reached the level of funding provided in the last Whitlam Budget. These figures which I have quoted do not represent the level of funding in real terms. Expressed in 1975-76 dollar values, the figures would read as follows: 1976-77, $174.058m; 1977-78, $168.478m; 1978-79, $167.003m and 1979-80, $184.608m. Again, these figures do not compare at all favourably with the Whitlam Government's allocation of $274.255m in 1975-76. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether the Minister thinks that by simply forgetting to mention all the extra payments to local government in addition to the general purpose assistance, or the tax sharing entitlement as it is now called, he will fool either the Senate or local authorities that they are better off under the Fraser Government. I suggest to the Minister that the next time he supplies an answer to a Dorothy Dixer from an honourable senator on his side of the chamber he make sure that he has a factual answer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With reference to Senator Mulvihill's remarks in connection with the Australian Institute of Sport, as he has pointed out, this matter has received some attention in the media and, in particular, in the local newspapers.

I will bring the matter to his attention and ask him to bring down a reply to Senator Mulvihill as soon as possible.

<PARA> Senator Colston sought to set the record straight, as he termed it, in regard to Senator Baume's answer to Senator Walters's question last week. I am not in any way debating the questions and the points that Senator Colston raised but I wonder whether-and I will check this by reference to the records which he quoted-the 1975 figure for grants to local government which he mentioned in fact included the Regional Employment Development Scheme grants which were, of course, of a fairly short duration, were cancelled by the former Whitlam Government, would not have applied in subsequent years and certainly were not taken up by the Fraser Government when it came to power at the end of 1975. I do not debate the matter. I just put that forward as maybe one of the answers to the comparisons which Senator Colston was making. I will indeed seek to inform myself as to that and ask Senator Baume to bring down a reply to Senator Colston as well. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. Prior to negotiations with the Taiwanese and their Australian representative in September last year, extensive discussions were held with Australian Fishing Industry Council representatives on the terms and conditions of access for Taiwanese vessels including proposed measures to control fishing operations by the Taiwanese in north and north west waters. During the negotiations with the Taiwanese, which were attended by observers representing the Australian Fishing Industry Council, and the Western Australian and Northern Territory Governments, the Taiwanese were informed of the intended introduction of legislation to prohibit the use of cod end liners and to set a minimum mesh size of 50 mm during the period of the current agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. A Fisheries Notice restricting the use by pair trawlers of a net with mesh which is less than 50 mm came into operation on 1 April 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In the past, yes. However the use of any material or device which blocks or obstructs the mesh of the cod-end was prohibited from 1 January 1981 by Fisheries Notice No. 95.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Australian Fishing Industry Council has been fully consulted on the conditions of access for Taiwanese vessels to waters of the North West Shelf. Competition from Taiwanese would affect the success of Australian operations in the area but other factors such as operating expenses and availability of suitable markets would also be major determinants of economic success. In order to assist in the assessment of the commercial viability of Australian fishing operations on the North West Shelf the Government approved several feasibility fishing ventures by Australian fishing interests involving the use of Japanese and Korean stern trawlers. These projects operated in areas fished by the Taiwanese and through the use of different mesh sizes valuable information on catch rates, species mix and size composition of fish was obtained. Information obtained from these operations is available to the Australian fishing industry.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Taiwanese have operated in waters of the North West Shelf for many years. In accordance with our responsibility to allow foreigners access to stocks not fished, or only lightly fished by Australians, within the 200 mile Australian fishing zone (AFZ), the Taiwanese have continued to fish in the area since the AFZ commenced on 1 November 1979. Under agreements negotiated with Taiwanese commercial interests their fishing effort has been considerably reduced, primarily by limitation on the allowable catch, and certain fisheries and areas of interest to Australians are now closed to the Taiwanese. The closed areas were extended following consultations with industry during the last round of negotiations for access by Taiwanese vessels. Taiwanese fishing operations have been closely monitored and controlled since the extension of Australia's fisheries jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) No Australians operated in the north west trawl fishery before the Taiwanese fishery was established in 1973. Since 1974, catch rates have been stable. As I have mentioned, areas have been closed to Taiwanese fishing in order to allow for an expansion in Australian fishing operations. Moreover, the allowable catch is well below the Taiwanese catch prior to the introduction of the 200 mile Australian fishing zone and gear restrictions have been introduced.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Operations by foreign fishing vessels are kept under constant review by Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory Governments in order to determine appropriate management measures to apply and restrictions if any to be introduced to protect the interests of the Australian fishing industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The pension and benefit increases in November 1979 were based on the movement in the consumer price index between June 1978 and June 1979, and the May 1980 increases on the movement in the consumer price index between June 1979 and December 1979.</PARA>
<PARA> If the pension increases in November 1979 had been based on the movement in the consumer price index between June 1978 and September 1979, and the May 1980 increases on the movement in the consumer price index between September 1979 and March 1980, the additional cost in respect of social security pensions and sickness benefits would have been some $70m in 1979-80.</PARA>
<PARA> If the estimated cost of similar increases for unemployment and special benefit recipients were included, the additional cost in 1979-80 would have been $75m.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) Australia joined the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples when it was established in 1961 and has been a member ever since, except for the period from January 1969 to January 1973.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Working Group of the Special Committee is an informal group which the Chairman of the Committee can convene at his discretion to assist him in planning the work program of the Committee. Its membership has come to consist of the office bearers of the Committee and several others invited by the Chairman. Australia was invited at the beginning of 1980 to participate in the Group.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) The Anglo-French Condominium of the New Hebrides was considered from 1961, when the Special Committee was established, until 31 July 1980 when it attained independence as the Republic of Vanuatu. No other French territory in the Pacific has been considered by the Special Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Working Group did not consider the New Hebrides. The New Caledonia Independentist Front made representations in 1980 to the Chairman of the Special Committee to have New Caledonia reinstated on the United Nations list of non-self-governing territories. Such a decision can be taken only by the General Assembly of the United Nations. The Special Committee, however, is the appropriate body to make a recommendation to the General Assembly on the issue. The Chairman of the Special Committee decided, as an initial step, to convene a meeting of the Working Group in August 1980 to consider the representation. The Working Group agreed that the documentation provided by the Independentist Front should be put to study. No date has yet been set by the Chairman for reconvening the Working Group.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes, in General Assembly Resolution 35/118.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) (a) and (b) The Special Committee met on 21 January 1981. No timetable of future meetings has yet been decided. The Working Group has not met since 12 August 1980. As noted under 1 (b) above, the Chairman of the Special Committee has the discretion to call meetings of the Working Group.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) (a) In the Special Committee Australia supported the program of self-determination for the New Hebrides and was a member of the United Nations Mission which visited the territory and observed the elections in November 1979. At meetings of the Special Committee in August 1980, Australia took a leading role in the adoption of an appropriate resolution welcoming the accession to independence of the new state of Vanuatu and at the same time expressing regret that continuing incidents on the island of Espiritu Santo, supported by foreign nationals, were not brought to an end before independence.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Australia agreed with the decision of the Working Group noted in answer 2 (b) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) (a) and (b) The attitude to be taken by Australia at any meetings this year of the Special Committee and the Working Group which discuss French territories in the Pacific will be decided having regard to the matters arising at the meetings, to considerations relevant at the time of such meetings, and to the resolution adopted by the South Pacific Forum at Honiara in 1979, which read in part as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Noting the desire of Pacific Island peoples, including those in French territories, to determine their own future, the Forum re-affirmed its belief in the principle of self-determination and independence applying to all Pacific Island peoples in accordance with their freely expressed wishes. Accordingly the Forum called on the metropolitan powers concerned to work with the peoples of their Pacific Territories to this end.'</PARA>
<PARA> (7) (a) The Special Committee is composed of the following 25 countries:</PARA>
<PARA> Afghanistan, Australia, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Congo, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Ethiopia, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Mali, Sierra Leone, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, USSR, Tanzania, Venezuela, Yugoslavia.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Working Group is composed of the following ten countries:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia, Congo, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Iran, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) No consultations on French Territories in the Pacific have been held within the framework of the Special Committee since adoption of General Assembly Resolution 35/118 on 11 December 1980. Naturally, Australia will be consulting at the appropriate time with members of the Special Committee and with other countries concerned.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Defence has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The JTTRE conducts hot-wet and hot-dry exposure trials of defence material and materials for the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence and the Australian Department of Defence.</PARA>
<PARA> The Establishment was formed in 1977 by the amalgamation of the Joint Tropical Research Unit and the Tropical Trials Establishment. The latter was formerly an Army unit and twelve of its Army personnel in administrative-clerical positions were retained. These servicemen were employed at Pin Gin Hill and Cowley Beach.</PARA>
<PARA> Experience has shown that a new Establishment requires a review after a settling-down period, and an Establishment Review was conducted at JTTRE in September 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> The Review recommended that all Service positions be dis-established for the following reasons:</PARA>
<PARA> The level of activity involving Service personnel at JTTRE no longer justifies the retention of servicemen, particularly when higher priority requirements for them exist elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA> The Review concluded that the duties undertaken by the military personnel can now be undertaken by civilian staff within current staff ceilings.</PARA>
<PARA> The servicemen were not fully employed and not performing worthwhile and satisfying duties.</PARA>
<PARA> The servicemen were performing duties that did not require service training or experience.</PARA>
<PARA>The last serviceman (a driver) is expected to be withdrawn from JTTRE about the end of April this year.

<PARA> The Minister for Defence has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The definition of 'de facto spouse' in Determination No. 26 of 1980 was included in that Determination to cover payment of Post Allowance to members in de facto relationships who otherwise qualify for the Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA> The definition used was one which applied to de facto relationships in the Defence Force at that time. It has since been amended after a thorough examination by the Department and the three Services. The definition in use since 13 January 1981 requires that there should be a period of twelve months cohabitation before a de facto relationship may be recognised and that there should be either a child dependent on the de facto couple, or a legal impediment to their marriage.</PARA>
<PARA> In a case where legal impediment to marriage is claimed, a maximum period of eighteen months is to be generally applied to Service recognition of the relationship.</PARA>
