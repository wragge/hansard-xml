<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> Many Australians depend almost exclusively upon Trans Australia Airlines for the provision of essential air services.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Liberal Party policy objective of selling Trans Australia Airlines within 4 years is contrary to the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA> Sale of Trans Australia Airlines would inevitably result in:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the creation of a private monopoly of major airline services in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) higher domestic air fares.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senate will reject outright any proposal to sell Trans Australia Airlines.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth, do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Note that legislation establishing plant breeders' rights in other countries has had serious adverse effects, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Virtual monopoly control of seed production has passed into the hands of a few large international corporations seeking to profit from the exclusive rights over plant genetic materials created by such legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The varieties of seeds available have been restricted mainly to hybrids which will not reproduce truly and will not grow without the aid of artificial fertilizers and pesticides, thus maximising corporate profits without regard for the interests of growers and consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The genetic diversity of crops has been eroded, rendering them vulnerable to disease and other environmental threats.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Recognize that maintenance of the genetic diversity of plant varieties is crucial to the continued well-being of the Australian Nation, and take all necessary steps to preserve and promote such genetic diversity as a public resource and to prevent exclusive control over plant genetic materials from falling into private hands.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Defend the vital interests of Australian farmers and gardeners, independent Australian seed companies and their employees, and consumers of Australian farm and garden produce, by rejecting any proposal to legislate for the establishment of plant breeders' rights in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA> That the proposed new standard for regulation of Vitamin and Mineral Supplements will:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) curb our individual freedom to care for our health according to need, environment, and climate.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) will significantly increase the cost burden of subsidised N.H.S. health care to the tax payer.</PARA>

<PARA> That the projected repeal by the Queensland State Government of the Aborigines Act 1971-1979 and the Torres Strait Islander Act 1971-1979 will almost certainly lead to the degazettal of all Aboriginal reserves in Queensland, as happened with Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>
<PARA> That, if the Aboriginal communities from these reserves are placed under similar shire council legislation on fifty year leases, they will be exposed to serious encroachment on their land by mining and tourist interests.</PARA>
<PARA> That, on past evidence, these interests will clearly have the full backing of the Queensland Government and the rights of Aboriginal people to land rights and self-management will not be granted by that Government.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Commonwealth Government has the constitutional power to legislate and acquire land for Aboriginal people since the amendments to the Constitution in 1967, but it is your Petitioners' sincere belief that it has already failed in its duty before the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Aboriginal people of Queensland have stated that they want land rights and self-management.</PARA>
<PARA> Your Petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should make use of its constitutional and legislative powers to grant full land rights and self-management to the Aboriginal people of Queensland.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to ask a question of the Minister representing the Treasurer. I preface my question by saying that no doubt the Minister is aware that present interest rates are excluding many persons from a range of loans that would enable them to borrow sufficiently to buy a house at present day prices. Is it true that a person does not have to be an Australian resident to own Australian property? Is the Minister aware of the effect that outside money, if I may call it that, has had on forcing up the price of houses in some areas of Australia and that this money also competes for funds available for borrowing? Is the Minister able to give the Senate some idea of how many houses are owned by persons who do not reside in Australia? Will the Minister ask the Government to make it illegal immediately for non-residents to buy up Australian homes? Finally, is this perhaps yet another reason that Australian residents should have some system of social security numbers by which they could be identified at other times, but particularly when they are wanting to buy a house in this country?</PARA></TALK.START>

I note the other part of the honourable senator's question which related to some sort of social security number to identify Australian citizens at the time they purchase houses or property.

However, I will see whether some inquiry could be made with regard to that suggestion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Social Security. Is it a fact that as a result of the Budget pensioners and beneficiaries who rent public housing from housing commissions, et cetera, will not be eligible in future for the supplementary rent allowance? If that is so, does the Minister expect the State housing authorities to make up this deficit in pensioners' incomes? If that is so, how can the authorities do so in view of the fact that once again this year the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement contains an 18 per cent reduction in real terms in the funds for States in this area?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="48" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter to which the honourable senator drew attention at the beginning of his question is correct and I think that is explicit in the material which was put before the Parliament in the Budget. The changes being made to the supplementary allowance have the express objective of directing the financial assistance to those pensioners who require it most, that is, those pensioners who are paying high non-subsidised rentals. Pensioners and beneficiaries who rent public housing are already in receipt of a considerable public subsidy which is partly at the cost of the Commonwealth because of the Commonwealth's involvement with respect to welfare housing and the payments it makes to the States in that area. It has been a problem for some pensioners and beneficiaries who are not able to get the benefits of that subsidised accommodation that they have been forced to rent at high rates. That has been a particular problem in Sydney. It varies from town to town and city to city.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation is that the increases in benefit will be available to those pensioners who require it most, that is, those who have least private income and who are paying high private rents. I would not expect the State housing commissions to make up the deficit in any sense. Rather I would expect the State housing commissions to continue to set their concessional rentals at levels which take into account the actual income limits or the incomes available to the pensioners and beneficiaries that they are serving. To avoid any misunderstanding I should also point out that with respect to those pensioners and beneficiaries who are currently receiving supplementary assistance and who are occupying the sort of accommodation referred to by the honourable senator in his question, namely, public housing, there is a saving provision which will ensure that they continue to receive the supplement that they receive at present.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I wish to ask a supplementary question. In view of the final remarks of the Minister I ask whether this means that in future we will have in public housing accommodation two groups of pensioners-one group whose occupancy of those houses preceded the Budget and, therefore, who will continue to receive the supplementary rent allowance and another group who will be worse off but perhaps in the same situation and who, because they occupied their houses after the Budget, will receive no such allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that new tenants in that accommodation will not receive the supplement and those who were in that accommodation prior to the Budget will receive the supplement. The alternative available to the Government was to cease to pay the supplement to those pensioners and beneficiaries which would have resulted at least temporarily in a reduction in their income until the indexation provisions overtook it. The Government thought that that was not the most desirable way to deal with the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a question of the Minister for National Development and Energy, although the Minister for Finance may feel it is more appropriate for her to answer the question, which concerns the Foreign Investment Review Board. Is the Minister aware that Sir Bede Callaghan, Chairman of the Foreign Investment Review Board, recently proudly stated that 'very few' foreign investment proposals are ever rejected by the Board? Further, is the Minister aware of Sir Bede's incredible explanation that this situation is 'partly due to the Board's role in helping foreign investors frame their proposals to match the Government's requirements'? That quotation is taken from the Bulletin of 18 August. Is this merely another way of saying that the FIRB is happy to advise, presumably free of charge, large foreign investors on how to bend the rules to breaking point and hence ensure that further hundreds of thousands of hectares of Australian urban and rural land are sold off to overseas interests? In the light of Sir Bede's frank and alarming admission and in view of the fact that during the last four years no less than 14 million hectares of land, valued at $192m, were purchased by foreigners, when will the Government establish a full inquiry into the extent of foreign ownership of Australian land?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of the remarks made by Sir Bede Callaghan. It would be necessary for me to look at the whole context of those remarks before I could adjudicate on them. As to the second question, the answer is no. As to the third question, the first thing I should say is that ownership of and title to land in Australia are primarily State matters. An assertion as to who shall own land and who shall not, of necessity has to be a matter for the States. That is not in any way to resile from the Commonwealth's responsibility in terms of capital inflow; I want to say that.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is exactly the point I am making. I want to define the difference in the two matters. Of course the Commonwealth has a capacity and a responsibility in regard to not only the quantitative but also the qualitative nature of the inflow of capital. It is looking at that very strenuously. For example, an analysis of the $6,000m of last year's capital inflow showed a very small detectable real estate quality to it. That is not to say that in the first instance the money could not come in under another umbrella and be used for real estate down the way. So the Government is looking very hard at the matter. We are very keen to diagnose the true nature of the inflow of capital. Of the $6 billion that came in last year, more than half immediately turned around and went out to purchase imports for capital ventures, for setting up industries. It is not easy to diagnose what funds are used for the purchase of real estate but we are looking hard at that at this moment. My comment on the States is clearly to indicate that the States have sovereignty in terms of the final ownership of land. It is possible for the States also to act. The Commonwealth can act at the point of inflow of capital; the States of course can act in terms of titles. We have the matter continuously under survey.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has received a report from Sir Clarrie Harders in accordance with the terms of reference detailed by the then Minister for Administrative Services in his second reading speech to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill on 15 May 1980. As the honourable senator reminds us in his question, the Minister at that time referred to the Government's wish to have available the advice of an independent inquiry prior to making any decision. The position, therefore, is that the Government has received the report, is still considering it and has not, so far, made a decision. Whether the report to the Government will be tabled in the Parliament is a matter which is also being considered. Without committing the Government one way or the other and without saying the report will not be tabled-I am not saying that at all-all I can say is that, at the time the Harders inquiry was established, no commitment was given that the report to the Government-that is to say the report to the Government for its advice and not to the Parliament-would be tabled or otherwise made public.

Is the Minister aware that some long term mail contractors in New South Wales country areas are being forced out of business because new applicants are submitting absurdly low tenders, which Australia Post accepts? Further, is the Minister aware that these new mail contractors are then deliberately operating their businesses at a loss so that they can write this loss off on their income tax returns? Will the Minister ensure that future mail contracting jobs are awarded to sincere men and women instead of to people who are manipulating the contracts in order to out-smart the Taxation Office and who, in most cases, are providing inferior services to those provided by the original long term contractors?</PARA></TALK.START>

In three weeks the delegation did not do a bad job of getting a feel for what is going on in this country. I certainly stand by the comments that I made on the Nationwide program that, in general terms, I endorse the assessment that there is a serious problem in this regard in Australia. Of course, as I said on that program, that is why we have a Department of Aboriginal Affairs. It is why this Government is committed to Aboriginal advancement and why it has done and is doing so much in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have been able to provide large amounts of housing stock over the last decade and will be able to continue to supply significant amounts throughout Australia. The honourable senator would know that the provision for housing this year will be split between the Aboriginal Development Commission, which will use some of the housing funding for grants-in-aid, and my colleague the Minister for Housing and Construction, who will distribute some of it through the States for public and welfare housing, for Aboriginals specifically. The allocation will be sufficient to build a large number of houses. I am advised by some of my officers, for example those in the eastern and other regions, that they believe the housing backlog for Aboriginals can be overcome, if not in the next few years, perhaps within the next 10 years. The allocation of funds as between the different functions of my Department has been examined as a matter of priority. I have wanted to devote more money to Aboriginal health, particularly by way of grants-in-aid. I draw to the attention of the Senate that this year we will be able to increase by more than 20 per cent grants-in-aid for both Aboriginal health and Aboriginal legal services.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have only recently become aware of the availability of the sorts of devices mentioned by the honourable senator. In fact, a couple of weeks ago in Perth I saw one of these units demonstrated. I understand there are a number of competitive units available on the market now. I gather that the general approach adopted by people who make and sell these units is to provide some form of connection between the person who perhaps is concerned about his or her health and some centralised point which will enable that person to raise an alarm if he or she suffers a collapse or has some difficulty in communication. Obviously, this sort of service could be very relevant to people who are frail and who perhaps are living alone at home and who might be nervous about continuing to do that because of the risk of some physical injury or illness or something of that sort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It appears to me that this is a development which could be very useful to many people in the community. Accordingly, I have drawn to the attention of my Department the availability of these devices. I have requested my Department to pass on that advice to the Australian Council on the Ageing which, in conjunction with the Commonwealth Government and at the expense of the Commonwealth, is currently doing a survey into the needs of the aged at home. It is aimed very much at determining what is required by the aged to enable them to maintain independent living. I cannot say that consideration has been given at this stage to whether there ought to be some government intervention in what is at the moment an initiative of private business people or a number of different private businesses. But I believe such devices could have some useful application which might indeed be of interest to the Government and to the Department in the longer term. I inform the honourable senator that the point she has raised is in the initial stages of examination and will be examined further.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Large numbers of Poles are presently entering western Europe, particularly Austria and West Germany. However, it is not clear how many of these people are seeking to remain abroad. The movement of Poles into central and western European countries is normal at this time of the year but this has been facilitated in recent months of course by the more liberal approach to the issue of passports by Polish authorities, as well as by other events. Although the number of those who have sought refugee status is relatively small, the number of Poles seeking refugee status in countries such as Austria has increased significantly. Those seeking to enter Australia as independent migrants or for family reunion are able to apply at migration offices in various European capitals. Such applications are given sympathetic consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those who seek to be included in Australia's refugee program must first satisfy the requirements of the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that they have adequate claims for refugee status before they can be considered for inclusion in our program.

Although no final decision has yet been taken by the Government on the size of the 1981-82 program, it is expected to be of a similar order. Of course, as the events in Poland unfold, the situation will be kept under continuing review.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only statement by a parliamentary member opposing home ownership came from a gentleman who I think said he did not want people to become little capitalists. He was not a member of the Government parties. The answer to the honourable senator's question is no. In the year that has just passed I think the number of homes increased by something like 11 per cent-I do not want to be held to that precise figure, but I can get it-and applications in the June quarter were high at something like 5 1/2 per cent. So the trends are still good. Having said that, I do not want to be complacent. The fact of the matter is that over the 1960s this Government raised Australia's home ownership to the highest in the world-something in the order of 75 per cent. It is true that high interest rates and the pressure of resources development will make things hard, both for those who have homes already and for those who do not have homes, because we must consider the availability of money as well as the interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>

Housing activity rose strongly by 11 per cent in 1980-81 and remains buoyant. Dwelling approvals in the June quarter 1981 were 5.9 per cent above the June quarter 1980. In terms of costs generally, the fact is that inflation in Australia in the last financial year fell by 2 per cent to 8.8 per cent. That was the envy of the free world. The real measure, in looking at costs to people, is to understand that at a time when the inflation rate was 8.8 per cent the average rise in wages was in excess of 13 per cent. Therefore there was a gain to the average Australian in real purchasing power last year in excess of 4 per cent. Those figures will be found in the Budget and they are a clear indication.

The question raises the issue of whether the Government should attempt to gain union and employer agreement to a set of procedures designed to minimise industrial disruption during the processing of wage claims. There is some precedent for the sort of approach which Senator Archer has suggested to the Senate today. A number of Federal awards contain dispute procedures or grievance procedures which seek to avoid disputation over claims and to direct parties along certain paths of negotiation, with the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission playing a role in that process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A good example of a recently agreed grievance procedure is that contained in the composite agreement for reduced working hours between the State Electricity Commission of Victoria and the Victorian Trades Hall Council.

There are other examples around Australia-for example, the Altona chemical complex. I mention that to the Senate because it indicates that the broad approach which the honourable senator has suggested is an approach which, in a more limited sense, is already in application in the industrial area.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since late last year when the Premier of Queensland announced an intention to repeal the Queensland Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders Acts the Government has been watching the situation closely and has maintained very close contact with colleagues in Queensland. We have made sure that the Commonwealth's concerns are known and I intend to continue in that way. The picture is not yet clear, and the Queensland Government has not yet made clear what it intends to do. On 23 July I issued a statement to the Press setting out a Governments position.

<PARA>MINISTER FOR ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS</PARA>
<PARA>Queensland Reserves</PARA>
<PARA>Statement by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator the Hon. Peter Baume</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government believes that four principles must be upheld in the resolution of the future of the Queensland State Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Reserves. These are:</PARA>
<PARA> The integrity of the present reserve boundaries be maintained;</PARA>
<PARA> Secure tenure for occupants and preservation of their rights to use the land;</PARA>
<PARA> Local communities to play a significant role in the management of the Reserves;</PARA>
<PARA> Full consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people before any decisions are made.</PARA>
<PARA>There may be several ways to satisfy these goals. I do not intend to endorse or to criticise any proposal until it has been outlined in full for public discussion.</PARA>
<PARA> Although it is not yet clear what the Queensland Government will finally propose, the Queensland Premier's tentative thinking about 50-year leases is better than the present situation where reserve status can be abolished overnight. Of course, perpetual leasehold or freehold would be even better.</PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the promise of the Premier to consult widely with Reserve communities and look forward to learning the results of these consultations. They will be particularly important in identifying appropriate systems for the management of the lands and communities.</PARA>
<PARA> I have consulted and will continue to consult with Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders and with Queensland Ministers as appropriate.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is very kind of the honourable senator. In that statement I said that the Commonwealth believed in four principles. I think those four principles might be emphasised again. They are, first, that the integrity of the present reserve boundaries should be maintained; secondly, that there should be secure tenure for the occupants, with preservation of their rights to use the land; thirdly, that the local communities in Queensland should play a significant role in the management of their reserves; and fourthly, that there should be full consultation with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities before any decisions are made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps I can take the last point first. I would like to make sure that all Aboriginal and Islander people can have their say in a matter which so vitally affects their future. Consultation with the people and attention to their express wishes is thus the first necessity in reaching decisions about the future of the reserves. I note that the Queensland authorities have paid some attention to this and that the Premier himself has been at some pains to say that he is consulting the Aboriginal and Islander councils. But it would seem from information available that wide consultation has not as yet been concluded.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the other three points relate to what might happen on the reserves. Obviously integrity of the reserve boundaries means just that-that none of them must be carved off for tourist resorts or anything like that. That is something that was raised in the Press. The second principle concerns secure tenure and the third principle is that local communities should play a significant role in management. I hope that those points become clear as the weeks go by. I say to Senator Bonner that the four points which have been enunciated put down a clear Government position and a clear set of Commonwealth Government requirements in the matter which he raised.</PARA>

However, to clarify matters, let me make it clear that the broad significant matters concerning nuclear non-proliferation, of course, are and will remain a Commonwealth matter. The Australian Safeguards Office is under my supervision and portfolio. It will so remain. The movement and monitoring of radioactive materials from Australia to elsewhere in the world will always be a Commonwealth matter. There will be discussions with the States and the Territory on many matters that are now handled by the States. For example, medical and industrial radioactive materials are now handled by the States. Those that have been normally treated as coming under health regulations no doubt will continue to be so treated. But overall, there is a need in a federation to devise rules under which we should work. When they are complete they will ensure that for all kinds of fissile materials and radioactive materials generally throughout Australia at both Federal and State levels there will be the highest possible standards of control and supervision that can be devised.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator misunderstands the situation. As to the whole movement of uranium from Australia overseas, firstly, no sales will be permitted and no movement negotiated until it is quite clear that the purchaser of the uranium is a member of the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and will undertake to effect all the safeguards. That is quite clear and that is a Commonwealth responsibility. Secondly, I repeat that it will remain a Commonwealth responsibility to maintain and to progress an Australian Safeguards Office under my own departmental supervision. The role of that Safeguards Office will be that of a very thorough auditor, that is, to monitor the nature, quality and changes in fissile material originating from Australia, wherever it may be on the world scene. That will remain a Commonwealth matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matters that largely affect the States are health matters. For instance, a common health code has been sought and, I think, substantially obtained with the States in the code of mining as it concerns the mining and milling of uranium. Of course the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry report has indicated that, properly supervised, that is a matter that well can be carried out. I stress that, apart from that, the materials the States would be concerned with are those medical and industrial materials which are used day by day in either medicine or industry and which have, in fact, very short radioactive lives, as do most such materials. Therefore, they present a relatively ready and easy way of maintaining health regulations and safeguards.</PARA>

Will the Minister give an assurance that if such an agreement is reached it will not operate for those months when daylight saving is in operation in other States in Australia, given that when other States advance their clocks by one hour it is necessary for people seeking interstate connections for flights originating at Brisbane to leave at 6 a.m.?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like Senator Teague and the rest of the people of South Australia, I welcome several features of the Budget as announced last night, including the statements concerning wine tax and the Adelaide Airport. It is intended that planning for interim improvements to the existing taxiways, aprons and the terminal building to permit the introduction of regular domestic wide-bodied jet services in June 1982 will be completed by that date. The honourable senator will notice that at this stage I refer to wide-bodied jet services, as distinct from international airline services. It is intended that the airport will be upgraded with those programs and a start will be made on containerised baggage handling facilities, further apron works, further taxiway upgrading and changes to the access road and car park.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Studies have shown that it is not feasible to upgrade the existing terminal building to accommodate domestic wide-bodied jets in the longer run. Therefore, international services could not be accommodated in the existing domestic terminal because of the differing requirements of domestic and international passengers. However, the Government has approved the construction of interim facilities such as those I have mentioned, at a cost of $3m, to enable international air services to commence. However, this will require passengers to be processed through Customs and quarantine facilities at a gateway port. The amount of $0.8m has been set aside in 1981-82 to get this work under way.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition raises this matter of the absence of a coherent industrial relations policy of the Government at this stage because it is highly relevant to recent events in Australia and, indeed, is highly relevant to the Budget brought down last night and to the strategy revealed in the Budget. In recent weeks Australia has been plagued by industrial disputes-on the waterfront, within Telecom Australia, in the transport industry, in the airlines industry and within the Australian Broadcasting Commission, to name but a few-which have caused inconvenience to the Australian public and disharmony in industry and which have not been resolved or assisted by the initiatives of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The system of wage indexation has collapsed in recent weeks. The centralised system of wage fixation which we have enjoyed in this country for many years is under threat. The Government, which is supposed to provide leadership in these issues, has nowhere to go. This is not merely an allegation made lightly by an Opposition senator. The honourable member for Boothby, Mr Steele Hall, in an address to the Young Liberals in Melbourne on 29 July, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is impotent and unsuccessful in industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Max Burr, the honourable member for Wilmot, commenting on Mr Steele Hall's remarks, said he was quite right in his criticism because it was unreasonable to expect wage restraint from unions under some policies being pursued by the present Government. Mr Andrew Peacock, the honourable member for Kooyong, about the same time issued a six page industrial relations statement in which he said, amongst other things, that 'the Government had pursued a rigid and unrealistic industrial relations line'. Those three distinguished members of the House of Representatives are, of course, not alone in their criticisms of the present Government's industrial relations policy. I quote from an editorial in the Australian Financial Review of 3 August-I use this because it seems to sum up the situation very effectively-which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The nearer the end of indexation came the more total the lack of direction of the Government in the vital Industrial Relations and wages areas became apparent. Rather it has weakly back-pedalled on its former tough approach in the Arbitration Commission and hoped to the very last moment that indexation, partial, flexible or otherwise, would survive in some form . . . The Arbitration Commission certainly tried hard enough to keep indexation going . . . but the Government never gave it sufficient support to make the effort any longer worthwhile. </PARA>
<PARA>In a comment in a leading article in the Melbourne Age of 13 August this year this was stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the impotence of the Government, which was dramatised by Mr Fraser's eagerness to reach an accommodation with the A.C.T.U. over the transport unions strike so he could catch a plane to get to the royal wedding. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know, Senator. That is something the honourable senator's party will have to sort out, not me. All I am saying is that those sources I referred to were consistent about one thing; they agreed with the view, a unanimous view which is widespread and shared by both unions and employer representatives-if Senator Teague wants some quotations from some of them I will give them to him later-that the Government's industrial relations policy is chaotic and a mess. They also agreed that this question of industrial relations lies at the heart of the progress and future development of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the reasons for that is, of course, that there is total confusion between wages policy and industrial relations policy in the mind of the present Government. There is total confusion between the two issues. That confusion is reflected in the Government's attitude, for example, to the amalgamations of trade unions, and its refusal to proceed with the enunciated policy of Mr Tony Street-towards amalgamations of industry-based unions. It is illustrated by writing sections into the Conciliation and Arbitration Act requiring the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to have regard to overall economic considerations in reaching its decision. That represents a confusion between the industrial relations function of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and the question of a wages policy. It is also evident by the Government's very bad record in its failure to consult with peak union organisations on industrial relations situations. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make one comment flowing from last night's Budget. It is simply this: The strategy contained in last night's Budget was necessary because this Government has no incomes and wages policy. The strategy embraces the tight monetary policy and it embraces tariff review and a revalued dollar in due course. The strategy embraces those sorts of things. It embraces essentially the notion that industrial relations in Australia from now on, because of the absence of a Government industrial relations or wages policy, are to be left to market forces. I think some of the supporters of this Government in industry should start asking themselves: What does it cost a business in Australia to test the power or resolution of a trade union in the market? What does it cost a business in terms of, probably, millions of dollars? I think that is an important question which honourable senators in the Government parties have to deliberate on. </PARA>
<PARA> It has long been recognised in this country that the use of market forces in industrial relations areas is not acceptable, as in other areas. This abdication of leadership on industrial relations and wages issues is just another example of this country becoming a social laboratory for stupid ideological experiments. That is what it is becoming in relation to some of the ideology inherent in the razor gang and the ideology inherent in the lack of any policy in relation to wages and prices, for example. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that the wages policy of this Government is now in the market. There are a number of ways in which the market can dampen the growth of wage increase expectations. Firstly, it can reduce profits, thus lowering the overall prosperity in the economy and making it harder for businesses to agree to wage rises. Secondly, it can create unemployment, which worsens the bargaining position of employees. Last night's Budget was intended, I allege, to do both. </PARA>
<PARA> For the benefit of Government senators I propose to refer to the degree to which industrial disputes occur internationally, in terms of days lost per thousand employees annually in several countries. Let us consider that situation in order to test the market forces argument. Last year in Australia 656 days per thousand employees were lost. The unemployment level was 6 per cent. In Canada 756 days were lost. The unemployment level was 5 per cent. In the United States 396 days were lost. The unemployment level was 6 per cent. I invite honourable senators to consider those figures and then compare them with the figures for some other countries. </PARA>

If the honourable senator can accommodate three or four sets of figures in his mind at the same time I will be surprised and gratified. I was referring to the very high level of industrial disputation in those three countries, which have high unemployment levels and no prices and incomes policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us consider now the position in three other countries. In Austria 0.3 days were lost per thousand employees. There was no unemployment. In Norway 34 days were lost. There was no unemployment. In Sweden seven days were lost. There was no unemployment. In Denmark 69 days were lost. There was some unemployment but not much. In Germany 19 days were lost. There was very little unemployment. These figures should be taken into account by the geniuses of the Liberal Party, such as Senator Lewis, who presumably adopt a market forces approach in relation to wage fixation. It will be noted that three of the countries mentioned-namely, Norway, Sweden and Austria-have a very low level of industrial disturbance and no unemployment. Incidentally, they have prices and incomes policies, an approach which the Fraser Government completely lacks and indeed disclaims. One must consider such figures in considering how best to get out of the current mess. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am trying to debate a serious subject, one that I know Government senators do not take seriously. That is one of the problems that they face as a government. My argument, which I must make in the brief time that is available to me, is simply that, firstly, in Australia the Fraser Government has adopted social and economic policies which have destroyed the possibility of achieving a social consensus for the maintenance of the wage indexation system. Secondly, during its six years in office, the Government has promoted divisive, rhetorical and ineffectual approaches to industrial relations legislation. Thirdly, the Government has mismanaged industrial disputes to a degree which has contributed to the unstable industrial relations climate which precipitated the abandonment of wage indexation by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Fourthly, it has totally failed to provide constructive policies to fill the dangerous vacuum that has resulted from the breakdown in the wage indexation system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to deal first with the breakdown of a social consensus in this country as to the social and economic policies necessary for the maintenance of a centralised and orderly wage system. The Fraser Government, before it came into office, made a promise about full wage indexation. It subsequently abandoned that promise. Secondly, it made promises about tax indexation. It has since abandoned those also. Thirdly, it made promises about the place of the Prices Justification Tribunal as a segment of the consensus which at the time it thought was necessary to an orderly wage fixation process. It has broken that promise also. Fourthly, by the increasingly retrogressive tax burdens that it has imposed on the poorer section of the community it has contributed further to the shattering of that consensus. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last night, the Government in the Budget signalled a number of actions which represent a further breaking down of the consensus which is necessary in order to maintain a system of wage indexation and centralised wage fixation which in the past it has itself argued was necessary. There has been a significant increase in sales tax. Recent increases in interest rates have meant massive increases in mortgage repayments. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), in expounding one of those ideas that come off the top of his head, was saying a fortnight ago: 'We might do a deal on interest rates if we can get some wages peace'. What an absurd proposition to put to the people of Australia! What sort of bargain is that?</PARA>
<PARA> Also from the Budget emerged the fact that the PAYE tax take, which was up by 22 per cent last year, represented the largest increase ever under the present government. That tax is paid by wage and salary earners. All in all, when one considers average weekly earnings, tax, loan repayments and so forth, a taxpayer with a dependent spouse and two children is now $17 a week worse off, in real terms, than he was in 1975-76. Again, last night further reference was made to the tax avoidance industry. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these matters are relevant to the achieving of a social consensus about industrial relations policies. The Prime Minister knows that himself. On 16 August of this year, in his electorate talk, he recognised that fact in saying that wages and industrial claims must be considered in the light of the interests of the community as a whole and take into account the state of the economy, especially inflation and employment. He knows that as well as does anybody else who stops to think about it but the Government has failed totally to create an environment in which there can be a consensus about wage fixation in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last six years this Government has quite deliberately gone about promoting policies which display divisive rhetoric and make ineffectual noises about industrial relations issues for quite cynical purposes. A great deal of that is inconsequential and bluster, as we experienced it in regard to the Telecom dispute. As I heard someone say on another occasion, the Minister for Communications, Mr Ian Sinclair, when discussing the attitude of the Government to the Telecom dispute, adopted more positions than one could find in the Kama Sutra. At first he said: 'They won't get a cent out of us.' Then he said that he was going to close Telecom down. Two or three days later he said that he was not going to close Telecom; that there was some justice in the employees' claims. Finally, the Government settled the dispute. What sort of bluster is that? What are the wage earners of Australia to expect from this Government in terms of understanding and trust if such attitudes are displayed by professional loud mouths in the Ministry in the House of Representatives. What sort of standards are those to adopt in approaching industrial relations issues. The ineffectuality of all of this was displayed in figures of the Australian Bureau of Statistics which were reported a few days ago in the Australian Financial Review. The conclusion reached by the survey was:</PARA>
<PARA> Intervention by Federal Government officials did not lead to the settlement of one industrial dispute during 1980</PARA>
<PARA>The ABS goes on to show how various disputes were settled by negotiation and by reference to the Arbitration Commission. But not one was settled by the bluster of Ministers of this Government. This was again evidenced in relation to the Australian Broadcasting Commission only a few days ago. Of course, there have also been examples of gross mismanagement. If we look at the Telecom Australia and Transport Workers Union disputes, both of which were specifically mentioned by Sir John Moore as a contributing factor to the breakdown of wage indexation, in each case the Government initially opposed the union claims. It invoked the Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Act against the Telecom employees. It attempted to deregister the TWU. </PARA>
<PARA> In connection with the second matter the Prime Minister, in a 43rd floor suite in the Wentworth Hotel in Melbourne, summoned the Labor Premiers of Tasmania and New South Wales to his assistance. The first advice he was given by Mr Wran, the Premier of New South Wales, was this: 'If you want to settle the transport workers' dispute and go to the royal wedding then call off your deregistration application'. That happened. That advice was given to the Prime Minister and he took it. That was after all the bluster in the world about how the Government would get tough with the Transport Workers Union. This sort of action has led to comments by the business community in that the Director of the Employers Federation of New South Wales, Mr Jones, has accused the Government of a sellout in relation to the Transport Workers Union strike. </PARA>
<PARA> All those matters are indicative of chronic confusion and mismanagement at a time when this country allegedly faces the prospect of considerable economic growth with no wages policy and no coherent policy on industrial relations. There are no constructive policies coming from this Government on any of those issues. I commend to Government spokesmen on these matters that there are some nettles they have to grasp in relation to these issues. They have to grasp the issues of a prices-incomes policy in this country, the issue of integrity in dealings with employees throughout the community, and the issue of the importance of a centralised wage fixing system. Finally, Government spokesmen have to grasp the nettle of the need for this country to have one uniform system of industrial relations and one uniform system of arbitration rather than the seven systems we now have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speech made by the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button) on the matter of public importance which he put before us concluded really with a plea that we should adopt all the programs and policies of the Australian Labor Party and that that would ensure that the Government had a coherent industrial relations policy. Except in one respect his closing words were in fact a plea for us to adopt not the policies of this Government on which we have gone to so many elections but the policy of the Opposition. There was one point with respect to which the Government is in agreement with him. That is in respect of the importance of a centralised system of wage fixing. The Government's efforts to maintain and sustain a centralised system right up to the present day are, I think, obvious to any impartial observer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The case brought by the Opposition seems to be based mainly on the flurry of activity and concern which accompanied the withdrawal of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission from the system of indexation which with some changes has applied since about 1975. Of course, a great deal of concern was expressed by very many sections of the community about what would happen to wages in the light of that withdrawal by the Commission from that system. That was one element of the points put forward by the Leader of the Opposition to support his claim. The other element was to cite records of industrial disputes in a number of countries with which we might most commonly compare ourselves. For example, Canada and the United States are countries which in many respects are like our own. The Leader of the Opposition contrasted those countries with countries such as Austria, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Germany. He suggested that we need to adopt their policies to achieve the very low levels of industrial strife which he cited in his speech. He also cited for us the low levels of unemployment in those countries, ignoring of course a number of factors, not the least being the quite different social traditions existing in those countries compared with those in the first three he named. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, in many of these countries for many years there has been a reliance on migrant workers, a reliance which ceased as their labour was no longer required. Of course, many of those workers have gone back to their places of origin. In fact, there is a whole series of differences between the countries which the honourable senator chose to list. </PARA>
<PARA> He very carefully avoided talking about the history of industrial relations in this country and particularly the history of industrial relations during the mid-1970s when we had a government of which he was a supporter. It remains a fact that the highest level of industrial disputation during the decade of the 1970s occurred in 1974, in the middle year of the Whitlam Government. That was a year in which industrial disputation was accompanied by very high increases in wages, both nominal and real. A feature of that year was government leaping into the provision of a series of programs which, according to the speech we heard today, ought to have built a social consensus. Honourable senators will recall the programs put forward in 1974. Virtually everything a man, woman or child could ask for was being promised. The programs were designed and to some extent put into effect. That was in a year when one would have thought there would be maximum social consensus, when real wages were rising rapidly-although inflation was rising it certainly was not rising anywhere near the rate at which wages rose-and when there was government activity of a social type which ought to have been building a great consensus. What did we get? We had the highest level of industrial disputation of the 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we are entitled to be a little chary of the examples put forward by the Leader of the Opposition. I think we are also entitled to be a little chary of his suggestion that the problem of industrial relations in this country is solely a matter of building a consensus on the sorts of policy areas he mentioned in his speech. In fact, the Government is concerned, and has always been concerned since it has been in power, to maintain a coherent industrial relations policy and to reduce the level of industrial disputes. We have never succeeded to the extent that we would have wished. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me cite the number of working days lost through industrial disputes for the period 1973-1980 to show that the efforts of this Government have been marked by some successes which might have been envied by the previous Government. In 1973, 2.6 million working days were lost; in 1974, 6.3 million working days were lost; in 1975, 3.5 million working days were lost. In the first year of the Fraser Government the number of working days lost increased on the previous year's figures to a total of 3.8 million. In the following year we lost only 1.7 million working days and in the succeeding year 2.1 million working days. For the next year 4 million working days were lost but the figure dropped back last year to 3.3 million working days. </PARA>
<PARA> I cite those figures not to express satisfaction with them. I do not believe any member of the community, let alone any member of the Government, would be satisfied with the level of industrial disputation. I simply cite them to try to put into context the sorts of suggestions made by the Leader of the Opposition and the promises which he held up and which seem so remote from the reality of the performance when these grand social designs were being put forward in 1973-75 to the apparent gross dissatisfaction not merely ultimately of the electorate but indeed of the trade union movement that one would have thought would have been most enamoured of what was being done. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government spelt out its objectives in this field when it came to government. We said that we would work to improve the industrial relations climate and to protect the rights of individuals and of the public. How often do we hear the Opposition talking about the rights of individuals and the public in this country to be protected against industrial activity which is to their detriment? Indeed, every time we have sought to legislate to protect individuals against being leaned on by trade union power that legislation has been opposed in this place; it has been seen as inimical to the interests of the trade union movement. I notice that the British trade unions are now challenging the findings of the human rights court in Europe because they too seem to oppose the idea that individuals as well as trade unions should have rights in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> We said that we would emphasise the responsibilities of all parties to meet their obligations and that we would improve conciliation and arbitration procedures. I think in all these debates it is important to remember that we as a government do not have directing primary power. Under the Constitution we have a primary obligation to provide a legislative framework for the resolution of industrial disputes. Sometimes it is a matter of frustration in the community, as it is in government, that one cannot simply, by waving a legislative wand or taking some executive act, solve an industrial dispute. In fact, we are primarily responsible for providing a framework within which disputes, when they occur, can be settled. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a key part of the Opposition's case today, and an expressed part of the matter of public importance under discussion, that the Fraser Government has moved to exacerbate industrial disputes. A key part of what was said by Senator Button was that we are faced with the problem of the collapse of wage indexation and are now placed in a situation in which we have no industrial relations policy. Yet over the last fortnight the Government has met with the trade union movement, employers and State governments. With each of those bodies it has discussed the necessity of supporting a centralised wage fixing system. It seems that the Government has achieved agreement with all of those bodies that that ought be done. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the Government's intention is to establish a framework which not merely goes to the settling of disputes but which also has some of the other objectives which I have mentioned-in particular, the protection of the rights of individuals within the system. We have, as a government, moved in several ways since we took office to protect individuals and the public interest. I wish to mention some of the changes we have made to the industrial relations system to try to achieve our objectives. We established the National Labour Consultative Council to ensure regular consultation at the national level. We legislated to provide secret postal ballots for elections in federal employer and employee organisations. We legislated to require industrial organisations to produce audited annual financial accounts to members. We legislated also to protect genuine conscientious objectors to union membership. </PARA>
<PARA> As I list these matters, I am reminded of the number of occasions on which members of the Opposition opposed these pieces of legislation, notwithstanding their apparent importance in protecting the situation of individual unionists and individual Australians. We made various changes to the legislation to improve the procedures of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. We extended the grounds for deregistration of organisations acting in a way which would damage the interests of the community. We strengthened the Commission's powers to deal with demarcation disputes. We established the Industrial Relations Bureau to secure observance of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and regulations and awards. Most recently, and very importantly, we extended the secret ballot provisions to enable individual employees to apply for a secret ballot to express their views on strike action. I think that is the most recent debate which has taken place in this chamber on the subject which is before us this afternoon. Again, I recall that the concept of a group of employees concerned about a strike situation being entitled to apply and to have their views tested in a secret ballot was strenuously opposed in this place by Opposition senators. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government legislated also to protect the individual's right to continue to work rather than participate in industrial action. I think that a speaker from the Government side may wish to make some comments later on the value which has been found in that legislation in permitting people to avoid the tyranny of unions and to work in a situation where they wish to provide services for the public. I would have thought that after the last fortnight this was the worst possible time to bring this matter before the Senate. In fact, in the last fortnight the Government has shown a strong commitment to ensuring that there is an orderly process of wage fixation following the cessation of the indexation system. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already referred to the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and other senior Ministers, including the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner), have sat down with the trade unions, employers and the State governments. They have sought to ensure that the processes will remain orderly and on foot. I believe the public announcements by the Government over the last couple of weeks, in concert with the State Premiers, and the announcements made by employers clearly indicate an overwhelming adherence to the principles of a central wage fixing system and an adherence to the fact that through the national wage cases the great bulk of wage and salary earners in this country will continue to receive wage justice through the system of conciliation and arbitration established under Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other elements in the arrangements which have been made over recent months indicate the Government's commitment to having an industrial system which does meet the needs of the community and which can be seen to be fair and to serve all sections of the community. Agreement in principle has been reached with the State Premiers-I stress that this includes Premiers from Labor States-on the establishment of a wide-ranging national inquiry into wage determination and industrial relations. I suppose the very fact that the Premiers and the Federal Government see a need for that sort of inquiry does indicate a sense of dissatisfaction at all levels of government. The important thing is that there is an agreement in principle that that dissatisfaction should be worked through by some common approach which might lead to achieving better solutions in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic purpose of the proposed inquiry is to achieve a better understanding and a more harmonious climate of industrial relations and to enable the development of a system of wage determination and industrial relations which meets the future needs of the Australian community. Although that decision in principle was made some months ago, the Commonwealth and State Ministers for Labour will be meeting next month to consider the draft terms of reference for the national inquiry into wage determination and industrial relations. That inquiry will not take place in a vacuum. It is an inquiry which the statements of the last few weeks indicate will take place in the context of regular major cases coming before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission with the prospect of a major national wage case taking place either later this year or early in the new year. There is a unified approach to this matter. If there are defects in the system those defects can be tackled on a basis which involves all of the key parties to the matter. The Government holds the view that although wage indexation has come to an end-it has come to an end notwithstanding the Government's attempts to buttress that system-there will be no lapse into a situation of no rules or no law but rather a use of the existing mechanisms which will ensure that an orderly system does continue. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that in the minds of members of the public the attitude towards the Federal Government with respect to industrial relations is in a large part influenced not merely by the sort of role of government which was referred to by Senator Button in speaking on the matter of public importance, but also by a quite separate aspect; that is, the role of the Commonwealth not as a government but principally as an employer. I believe public concern about industrial disputation focuses most closely and most harshly on the areas where government itself is supposed to provide services. The widespread concern which is felt in the community when there is a disruption of what is seen as an essential public service is a concern which is shared by government. In that regard the Government brings to its attitude to its own employees the general approach that it expects other parties to bring to industrial relations; that is, it expects the parties to rely on a process of negotiation. Where negotiation fails, after a dispute has been submitted to the processes of arbitration which are available, and if public employees are not prepared to follow those processes of negotiation, it can become necessary for government to take more direct action to protect the public interest. This is a difficult area for government but I believe there is a strong expectation in the community that we will not allow the community to be massively disadvantaged by people who are in public employment and who are, therefore, in a position to hold the community to ransom. In the very difficult area of the Commonwealth dealing with its own employees, the Government takes the view that it must require both itself and its employees, in the main, to rely on the processes of negotiation and arbitration, but the Government must in the end maintain ultimate responsibility, hence the additional powers which it maintains in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is totally wrong to suggest that there is no coherent Government industrial relations policy. It is certainly wrong to suggest that we have moved in a way which exacerbates industrial disputes. Rather, I think there has been at times a sense in the community that we have done too little, that we have not been firm enough in dealing with industrial disputes which occur. I think that the line which needs to be trodden is a fine one. I believe the Government has conscientiously tried to tread it and in a large part has succeeded in its attempts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to supplement the timely remarks of my leader, Senator Button, about the shambles that exist today in the industrial relations field. I could do no better than to start with a quotation from Mr Justice Kirby at a recent industrial relations seminar, in which he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In our search for improved industrial relations, we have concentrated on the trees to the neglect of the forest. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpret that as the failure of governments to capture the hearts and minds of the rank and file trade unionists. When I look around this chamber I see my new colleague from South Australia, Senator Foreman, who is a former official of the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation of Australia. I think he would agree with me that if members of the vehicle industry were asked how they see their future, they would shake their heads. They wonder from week to week about job security, and that situation has come about because the Government speaks with a forked tongue in relation to its tariff policy. In the clothing and textile industries and in the rubber industry people are wondering what their future is, and consequently they are motivated to maintain wage relativities as far as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me take the matter a little further. I take umbrage at the comments of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) about the industrial relations policy of the Australian Labor Party. The plain fact is that all of the Labor Party's proposed legislative innovations in the field of industrial relations, along with those in other spheres, were emasculated by the Senate. Notwithstanding that, it is to the credit of Clyde Cameron that many innovations have been undertaken. It is significant that, in regard to the role of the shop delegate or the shop steward, the creation of the Clyde Cameron College added considerably to the industrial know-how of future trade unionists, not merely stewards but paid officials. When we come to specifics, the average rank and file trade union member today has grave doubts about the technological age in which we live. It would be very hard to prophesy what will happen in five years, much less 10 years, in many industries. No matter what sort of high level deal might be made at the Lodge in Canberra or with a State Premier, the rank and file trade union member is in a situation where he must wonder about his future. </PARA>
<PARA> The rank and file unionists today, particularly those under the age of 35, are not overawed by somebody who is supposed to be a legend in the trade union movement. At their meetings now the dialogue goes along different lines. Proposals are put and they discuss a clause and ask what it means. Good negotiators though these representatives may be, they could be somewhat uncertain. Someone will say: 'You had better get that clarified. We will meet again in three days' time.' The person who moves that sort of motion is not indulging in treason. He believes that Jack is as good as his master. In many ways, over the last 15 years, the Press and the Government have developed trade union bosses. Anyone who knows his trade unionism today is well aware that, by and large, the momentum comes from the bottom, and probably it is a good thing that package deals are not accepted automatically. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go on a little further and consider how we operate in these situations. Reference was made by Senator Button in his lucid style to the Scandinavian situation. I know for a fact that about two years ago the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), when he met with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, considered the idea of an in-built stabilising health scheme. It is true that no health scheme is free in the real sense, but in Scandinavia, West Germany, France, and a host of other countries there are not the fluctuations in medical and health coverage that we have with the luxury of a multiplicity of funds. I speak as a member of Medibank Private, but even there I believe it is wrong that a production manager pays the same fees as a process worker. That is one facet of the basic wage compilation. In Europe one can bargain with the state and there is a more uniform health coverage. Nobody will deny that the moment these funds increase their fees again the impact will be felt by the middle and lower income trade union members. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the composition of wages, it is well known that Bob Hawke, the Labor Party's spokesman on industrial relations, has referred to a two-tier system. I think it will be accepted, and I know my colleague from the west, Senator Gordon McIntosh, a prominent member of the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union, would agree, that once upon a time the fitter was the key figure in the metal trades award. That was the bench-mark, and there were then other developments. Dealing with relativities, and I am referring now to the non-craft union grades, who have a certain parity with the fitter under the metal trades award, the tyre builder in the Federated Rubber and Allied Workers Union of Australia and the car and wagon fitter in the railways are not tradesmen in the sense of having served a five-year apprenticeship. However, due to certain other duties, they have some parity with a tradesman. Once we got away from using the metal trades award as the pacesetter, we had all the confusion that exists today. No trade union official, even if he were an industrial Einstein, could get a perfect settlement, and there is an obligation on the Government to accept this two-tier system. For instance, taking the example of miners working at the coal face and AMWSU member doing maintenance, the danger side of mining has to be guaged. This is too broad a subject to go into in its entirety but, if we operated under the two-tier system, every quarter or every six months cognisance would be taken of fluctuations in food prices and so on, and we could arrive at a base rate. In an industry where new techniques are being introduced which involve some danger, the second tier would apply. To me these things are quite simple, and they are able to be elucidated to the rank and file, but they are non-existent. When Senator Chaney asks what can governments do, I think that is the first nettle the Government should grasp. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the complexities of this matter, I must be very careful here because I do not want to offend many colleagues of mine in the trade unions who face a very difficult situation. In the containerisation industry, there is declining membership in the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia. The Transport Workers Union of Australia, the Federated Storemen and Packers Union of Australia and the Federated Clerks Union of Australia are also involved. Let me deal with the latter union, and I will be deliberately careful about how I put it. The tally clerks are a component of the Federated Clerks Union, and their conditions are completely different from those of clerks in an air-conditioned office. Probably they have some similarity to clerks in the other two unions I mentioned, but I am not going to take sides. The plain fact is that there is an honest difference of opinion in the port of Sydney between rank and file tally clerks and the Federated Clerks Union management committee about the right to elect vigilance officers, or organisers. For better or worse, they took this matter before a judge, there was a lengthy hearing, and ultimately the judge decided that the matter was not within his jurisdiction. One side would say that the rule is tyrannical, the other side would say that it is the right of the management committee. I am simply saying that it is an indictment of our industrial relations system that nobody is able to solve the problem. That dispute will go on and on. I suppose the feeling of the rank and file is that they are levying themselves to pay for the two vigilance officers to speak for them, and the management committee is very hostile to the idea. The problem has not been solved. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an argument between the Australian Workers Union and the WWF over coverage in the wheat industry in Western Australia. So many of these matters are drifting on, and I refer particularly to the Australian Building Construction Employees and Builders Labourers Federation and the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia. It seems to me that our industrial system could work much more effectively. I do not mean that we have to go after Norm Gallagher with a big stick; far from it. I know that my colleague Mr McBean, of the Trades and Labour Council in Sydney, the AWU and the FIA have had long talks with the BLF, and I know that other building trade unions have differences with that union. Nevertheless, to say that there is no role for the Government in this area is an attitude of cowardly neglect. There is a role for the Government, and I am putting the matter through the eyes of the rank and file trade unionists. </PARA>
<PARA> One group of senior Government Ministers have said that tariffs are coming down. Another group have said that they will remain as they are. Senator Chaney referred to the guestworker component in the Western European workforce. What he omitted to say, and this is a problem the Government will have to face this year, is that we are accepting our humanitarian obligations in regard to political refugees. By and large, the physique of these refugees is not on a par with that of the normal migrant, who might go to Mount Isa or somewhere like that. The refugees will go in as process workers to Standard Telephones and Cables Pty Ltd, they will go into light industries such as textiles and clothing, and some sections of the rubber industry. If the Government maintains its high tariffs, as it should, it will accept its component of political refugees. But if it does not maintain those tariffs-some members of the Government believe in lowering tariffs-will it have the courage to protect the existing work force with its high migrant content, or will it say: 'We will phase out the industry?' Those migrants do not have a trade so what will happen to them?</PARA>

In the question I referred to the Sydney metropolitan railway system and to allegations concerning women carriage cleaners. I received an answer from the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Chaney) stating that Mr Commissioner Walker was expected to have the findings of an industrial board on 16 July. In fairness, I understand that the Commissioner suffered a bout of illness but the Commission is not moving quickly enough.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I go a bit further and refer to a letter dated 16 June 1981 from the then Acting Minister for Industrial Relations, the Honourable W. Fife. I had put a series of questions, one of which related to the exploitation of migrant women in the Wollongong area. Mr Fife said in his letter to me that the matter had been drawn to the attention of the Director of the Industrial Relations Bureau for investigation. That letter was dated 16 June and we are now in the middle of August. It was not such a difficult thing to answer. Why do we not receive answers? If asked whether we are working well enough, I say that we are not. These problems that I mention are not new problems. At the end of the Chifley era about 16 conciliation commissioners were appointed in one bite and they did a very good job. But that conciliation system is not the perfect system any more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the relatively short time at my disposal I advocate a two-tier wage system, permitting greater latitude at the second tier relating to disability allowances and skill, without upsetting wage relativities. We have massive fluctuations in health charges. If we had the European inbuilt system of health charges, it might mean that we pay a bit more income tax in a year but our budgets throughout the year would remain the same. If an employee had a year when he earned extra overtime he would pay a bit more. Under the present system a process worker pays the same as a production manager. This is a source of discontent. It is manifested more among people in the lower grade professions than in the higher grade professions. </PARA>
<PARA> I started my speech with the definition of rank and file militancy. I think Senator Lewis made reference to the air traffic controllers in the United States of America. According to Time and Newsweek, most of those air traffic controllers are Republican voters; they are not blue collar Democrat supporters. The same applies in Sydney. Some of the people who have been engaged in disputes, who have tried to protect wage relativities, live in electorates such as the Bradfield electorate; they do not come from militant electorates such as Blaxland and Reid. In supporting the views of Senator Button, I have endeavoured to indicate areas in which the Government could bring in innovations and get the confidence of the rank and file trade unionists. So far it does not have that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating as a matter of public importance the Government's industrial relations policy. Firstly, the principal objectives of the Government's industrial relations policy have been constant since they were expounded in 1975 and they have been repeated frequently. In summary, they are to work to improve the industrial relations climate, to protect the rights of individuals and the public interest, to emphasise the responsibility of all parties to meet their obligations, and to improve conciliation and arbitration procedures. In discussing this subject today, the Opposition speakers seemed to overlook totally the constitutional limitations imposed on the Federal Government. That is a great pity because it must always be remembered, when discussing what the Federal Government can do in relation to its industrial relations policy, that the only power which it has is to legislate in respect of conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limit of any one State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I repeat that the Government has power to bring in legislation dealing only with conciliation and arbitration. This Government has no power to bring in a wages and prices policy as put forward by Senator Button who opened this debate for the Opposition. All the Government can do is to pass legislation relating to conciliation and arbitration which is specifically for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes. There has to be an industrial dispute before the Government can apply its legislation. Such a dispute must extend beyond the limit of any one State. That is a very severe limitation on our economic power. Strangely enough, although that is not recognised by Opposition speakers in this place, it is recognised by the shadow Minister for Industrial Relations-I understand his name is Mr Hawke-who as recently as 12 August of this year said in a speech to the Industrial Relations Society:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government has less comprehensive and relevant powers of economic management than virtually any other national government in the world.</PARA>
<PARA>That must never be forgotten. From time to time there have been attempts to give the Commonwealth Government a power in these matters but on each occasion the people of Australia have rejected those propositions. Our power to take action in this field is severely limited. Having said that, I mention the two areas to which I suggest we should give consideration on this subject. The first area relates to the Government's position as an employer. Notwithstanding the constitutional limitation, the Government has power to pass legislation to control its own employees. I refer not only to direct employees of the Government but also to employees of statutory authorities of the Commonwealth Government. The fundamental principle of the Government's legislation, one that I have already mentioned and one that the Government constantly tries to implement, is to encourage the use of the framework established for the orderly settlement of disputes. That has been the purpose of the Government's legislation all the time. The Government has set out a framework for the orderly settlement of disputes involving its employees and the Government insists that its employees negotiate within that framework. </PARA>
<PARA> What in fact happens is that guerilla tactics are adopted from time to time by Government employees. What has this Government done to try to stop those guerilla tactics and to encourage the employees to work within the framework which it established? Firstly, we passed the Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Act. Having passed this Act, we did not proclaim it at that stage, hoping that the employees would realise that their guerilla tactics would not be tolerated by this Government. But after a certain time, of course, it became obvious that they were not acting within the framework and so, in order to encourage once again the proper settlement of disputes, the Government adopted the common law principle of no work as directed-no pay. That operated for a short time until 1979, when there was a court decision which said that the Government could not apply that common law principle for certain technical reasons which I will not bother to go into. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government immediately legislated to cover that situation in order to ensure that it could in fact adopt the principle of no work as directed-no pay. Subsequently, certain Commonwealth employees proceeded to adopt the guerrilla tactic of having one person not work one day, then another person in the department not work the next day and another person in the department not work the following day. As a consequence the Government was unable to persuade its employees in certain areas to go back into the framework for the proper and orderly settlement of their disputes under the existing provisions. So again the Government had to take stronger action to enforce the use of this proper settlement. It proclaimed the CE (EP) Act. That Act was used only once in the years 1979 and 1980. Of course, during the last 12 months Commonwealth employees have more frequently adopted guerrilla tactics and so it has become necessary during 1981 to use the provisions of the CE (EP) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> What am I talking about in relation to the CE (EP) Act? The CE (EP) Act enables the Commonwealth Government to suspend people who are taking industrial action and to stand down fellow employees who are unable to work as a result of the industrial action being taken by their colleagues. During 1981 the Government has used this procedure on four occasions. Earlier this year the Australian Telecommunications Commission stood down 1,045 keyboard and clerical staff who were engaged in a dispute over comparative wages. Also, 1,182 striking Commonwealth employees were stood down in relation to a transport workers dispute. In addition, 460 licensed aircraft maintenance engineers were stood down, although some may have been suspended, as recently as earlier this month. Last weekend the Australian Broadcasting Commission suspended some 90 striking broadcast engineering officers. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose one could say that the proof of the pudding is in the eating in relation to the use of this Act by the Government. In fact-I am unable to say precisely whether this has been due to the use of this Act or to other factors-people have gone back to work very shortly after the Government has implemented the provisions of this Act. I do not know whether that is direct cause and effect. In any event there seems to have been a proper result. But what I do say to the Senate is that these measures have not been used to exacerbate the disputes but have been used to discourage guerrilla tactics and to encourage employees to use the due processes of the legislation for the resolution of their disputes. The fundamental principle of the Government is to persuade its employees to use the framework which it has established for the orderly settlement of disputes and not to step outside that framework with guerrilla tactics of strikes and disruption of essential services to the nation in which most employees of the Commonwealth Government are employed. That is the way the Government treats its employees. It is trying to persuade them to use the framework which it has established to settle their disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the situation in relation to the nation as a whole-in other words, as a government-and remembering the constitutional limitations which I have mentioned and the objectives of the Governent, let us have a look at what this Government has legislated to do. It has legislated to establish the National Labour Consultative Council, to provide secret postal ballots, to require industrial organisations to produce audited annual financial accounts to members, to protect genuine conscientious objectors to union membership, to improve the procedures of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, to extend the grounds for deregistration of organisations acting to damage the interests of the community, to strengthen the Commission's powers to deal with demarcation disputes, to establish the Industrial Relations Bureau, to seek observance of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, regulations and awards, to extend the secret ballot provisions to enable individual employees to apply for a secret ballot to express their view on strike action and, finally, to protect individuals who wish to work when strike action is taken by their colleagues. All this legislation has been passed by this Government in following the fundamental objectives which it laid down as far back as 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened? In recent weeks, of course, indexation has gone. Some people seem to think that the whole situation has fallen into a vacuum because indexation has gone. That is all nonsense. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act runs into some 188 pages. Of course, that Act remains. That Act protects the rights of individuals that I mentioned a few moments ago. It controls unfair industrial practices. It controls union officials and their accounts. The deregistration provisions are all set out there. The legislation exists to provide a framework for the proper negotiation and settlement of disputes without the need for guerrilla action by unionists and, I might say, by some employers. I do not deny the strength of some employers in these matters. But a whole procedure has been established to provide for the proper negotiation and settlement of disputes, and that continues notwithstanding the abandonment of indexation. Certainly the Government's industrial relations policy still exists. This policy not only exists but will also be enforced. Certain pieces of legislation which the Government has introduced, and which I have mentioned, are designed to ensure that the people of Australia endeavour to settle their industrial disputes properly. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few minutes remaining to me I would like to point out that the protection has been established. We trust that the parties will be encouraged to use the Commission and that within that framework industrial disputes can be settled. Certainly the Government should intervene in industrial disputes where the public interest requires it. The national wage case is a perfect example. But, with all due respect, I do not see any reason for the Government to get its cotton-picking fingers into every industrial disputation in this country, notwithstanding the media constantly running to the Government and saying 'What are you going to do?' when someone is going out on some small strike about something or other. The legislation is there to enable the parties to settle their dispute. It is there to enable the unionists to enforce their rights; it is there to enable employers to enforce their rights. I do not see that the Government should be interfering or intervening in every dispute between employers and employees. As a matter of fact, I think that the less frequently the Government intervenes in these matters the more there will be rapid settlement of disputes. So I say to the Senate that the Government's industrial relations policy is an excellent policy, it is well enforced by the legislation within the constitutional limitations and it is a matter for praise by the public of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I first wish to refer to the honour conferred on me by the people of the State of Victoria and the appreciation I have of the function of the Senate as a States assembly and a House of review. I hope that the Senate has gained greater flexibility to act as a true House of review in the future. In industry we have a saying when a young executive is subjected to a lot of pressure. We say that he has had a baptism of fire. I cannot escape the feeling that this has happened to me over the last two days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Moving from confrontation to co-operation in industrial relations is vital if this country is to solve the very real problems that lie ahead. There are many problems with Australia's industrial relations legislation. We have overlapping Federal and State awards. We have too many unions and employer organisations. We have demarcation disputes, leapfrogging. We have direct negotiations by unions on logs of claims which lead to temporary solutions but do not result in any written contract for a period of industrial peace between unions and management. Australia's industrial relations legislation is in rapid need of overhaul. </PARA>
<PARA> The most fundamental problem facing Australia's industrial relations today, however, is not the legislation but the humanisation of the work place. Unless we can find an organisation structure that allows people to use their human qualities of imagination, initiative, technical expertise and sociability continued strife is inevitable. Nothing can compensate people for eight hours frustrating, monotonous, mind-killing work. If we are to be honest with our children we have to offer them something better than saying that if they work hard they will be able to work their way up a rigid hierarchy. It was Anthony Jay in his magnificent book Management and Machiavelli who outlined the family tree that most people have firmly in their minds. It went something like this: There is a head of a company and he has three people reporting to him. Those three people in turn have three people reporting to them and it goes on down to the seventh line by which time there are 278 junior managers and an urgent need for a large triangular piece of paper. We have to offer our children something better than that. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no simple solution to how we can achieve the humanisation of the work place but there are five basic principles that, if adopted, could lead to a work environment that allows people to use their abilities to a much greater degree than most industries are able to allow today. The first of these five principles is a cellular organisational structure. This involves dividing the organisational structure into small autonomous groups of about 40 people and allowing each group to have the ability to manage its work, to hire and fire people, to plan for the future, to work its own overtime and to be self-managing and self-directing. To do this there has to be a profit system which shows the members of that group how they are performing each month against the budget and allow them scope to affect their own improvements to what they are doing. </PARA>
<PARA> The second basic principle is profit-sharing. If people are to work in small autonomous groups and if those people know what profits are being generated, it is only right that they should have a means of sharing in the profits. Profit-sharing should be based on profits before tax in relation to the assets employed in the organisation. The third principle is an open organisational structure in which there are no secrets about profits and sales. This can be achieved through a consultative council made up of workers and management represenatives, with the worker representatives appointed by a secret ballot. Apart from getting information on how the company is performing this consultative council should also have power to pass resolutions directly on working conditions relating to safety and so forth. Such a consultative council should not have power over wages and award rates which is the rightful province of the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth principle is flexible working hours. I believe the time has long past when we should be directing our attention to an eight-hour working day. We have to have a much more flexible approach to working hours. For a start, an eight-hour day does not suit most women in the work force. They are confronted with a decision to work and neglect their families or not to work at all. Many young people would prefer to work more than eight hours. So we believe a more flexible arrangement is vital. My fifth and final point relates to the sharing of ownership by employees. The interests of capital and labour are very much easier to reconcile if, to some degree, the employee has a vested interest in the company in which he works. The sharing of ownership by employees breaks down the separation between the interests of labour and capital. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to move towards these five principles if we are to seek co-operation in industry. Their application has to be worked out for each specific company.</PARA>
<PARA> What is the wage fixing policy of the Australian Democrats? We believe the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission ought to continue to fix minimum wages and conditions and minimum awards for skill and resolve demarcation disputes. However, in future over-award payments and improvements in conditions ought to be negotiated directly by shop stewards and factory management on a factory by factory basis. The people who know most about the dispute should be the ones to be involved in the direct negotiations. Shop stewards could call in their unions on a consultative basis in the same way as management uses industrial relations consultants. The actual negotiating would best be done by managers and representatives directly. Such agreements, once arrived at, would have much greater likelihood of being honoured because the parties would have been negotiating directly rather than negotiating through a third party. The agreements ought to be put in writing and should be binding for a period of 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Such an agreement would free employers from the worry of having constant disputes, yet they could grant better pay and conditions to employees on the basis of market forces and local conditions. Such contracts could be enforced by the Australian Industrial Court and could provide for fines if parties broke the agreement, as is the case in the United States of America and in most European countries. The contract could include a clause providing that no internal claims or work stoppages for wages and conditions would be made during the lifetime of the agreement. Any domestic situation that developed which might lead to a conflict or have the potential of leading to a conflict could be resolved by a request by either party for a meeting to take place within 24 hours, and during that 24 hours work should continue. </PARA>
<PARA> The present situation is intolerable for both unions and employers. Unions can present several logs of claims a year. Employers must have a period of industrial peace but equally unions have every reason to try to preserve the standard of living of their members. No system, no matter how enlightened, can maximise human potential unless it humanises the work place. I intend to present to this Parliament a Bill to provide incentives for employers to introduce industrial democracy. Such a Bill will not pass this Parliament without the support of both parties and I appeal to all honourable senators and members to pass such a Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I would like first to congratulate you on your election to the highest office in this Parliament. I am sure that you will enjoy your term as President and I look forward to working under you. I would also like to congratulate Senator Siddons on his maiden speech. It was very thought provoking. The matter of public importance before the Senate refers to 'the exacerbation of industrial disputes by the Fraser Government'. That has a very familiar ring. Every one of us has heard that sort of thing a thousand times. Every time the Government takes any stand at all we hear from the Opposition benches and from the militant trade union section the same old thing-'Government confrontation'. We never hear of union confrontation; it is always Government confrontation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer now to Australia's present position. In July-last month-we were presented with an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development forecast and leading articles in the newspapers made reference to this. The Australian Financial Review ran an article which was headed 'It's good news week for Fraser. Australia leads Western growth stakes'. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia stands to enjoy the highest economic growth rate among developed Western nations over the next 18 months, according to the OECD's latest world economic outlook. </PARA>
<PARA>We find that unemployment is expected to go down from 6 per cent in 1980 to 4.5 per cent in 1982. The OECD claims that the growth rate in Australia will go from 2.8 per cent in 1980 to 5.75 per cent in 1981 and 5.25 per cent in 1982 while the average of the OECD countries is forecast to be a rise of one per cent for 1981 and 2 per cent for 1982. We will have a rise of 5.75 per cent and the OECD average is expected to rise by one per cent. Private investment in Australia has gone from 4.3 per cent in 1980 to 9 per cent in 1981. Whilst we have a trade deficit this year, in 1982 we expect exports to exceed imports. </PARA>
<PARA> The only cloud on the horizon concerns the consumer price index. Bearing in mind that if none of our policies is to be altered, the forecast is that Australia's CPI will go from 10.2 per cent in 1980 down to 9.5 per cent in 1981 but then will rise to 11.25 per cent, so the OECD claims, in 1982. The average for other OECD countries is going down. It went from 11.3 per cent in 1980, which was well over our figure, to 10 per cent in 1981. Again that is over our figure, but that average is going down whereas our figure is going up. According to the OECD forecast, the average for other countries in 1982 will be 9 per cent.With that forecast one would think that all Australians, from all walks of life, would work to demolish that one cloud, the increase in the CPI. One would think that all Australians would work towards lowering the consumer price index and then, having done that, would work towards reducing the unemployment figure-the 1982 forecast for which is 4 1/2 per cent-even further. In that way we could reach the prosperity in this country that we had under the Menzies Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of that, what do we have? As soon as the good news was forecast we had two of the worst strikes one could imagine. Perhaps the two unions involved-the Waterside Workers Federation and the Transport Workers Union-thought that was the best way to destroy that good news. They certainly worked towards the gathering of that one dark cloud on our horizon. Mr Martin Cooper, the secretary of the TWU in Tasmania, came out with an extraordinary statement. The article in which his statement was reported reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . another transport strike would be more severe on Tasmania than the two-week stoppage last month. </PARA>
<PARA>Imagine any Tasmanian at all saying: 'Don't worry, we can do more damage to Tasmania than we did last month. Try us and we will do ever so much more'. Tasmania lost $12m, on a conservative estimate, through that strike. We have been assured by the State secretary of the Transport Workers Union that that is chicken feed and that the transport workers can do much more damage to the State. Newspapers in Australia such as the Age have seen the need to put out a strike casualty rate column each day saying that, for example, we cannot get milk in most shops today; the wharves are all closed and we have $80m worth of cargo still tied up; government services are disrupted; mail is almost stopped; fuel supplies and plane services are threatened; telephone disruptions are occurring; there is trouble with bread supplies; there has been panic buying of groceries; meat supplies are still lasting but they are not likely to be available on Monday-but beer is all right, we still have beer. It has been reported that thousands are taking leave to avoid standowns. It is an absolutely incredible position. Yet we have the State secretary of the Transport Workers Union saying that the unionists can do more than that; that that is just chicken feed. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already mentioned the cost in dollars to Tasmania; I now refer to the rest of the country. According to one estimate in the Australian, at one stage goods worth nearly $200m were tied up at the wharves. It has been called the worst dispute on the wharves and has involved the worst industrial relations on any wharves in the world. We have the cost to the country of a worsening reputation. A mission from Japan came to look at the industrial relations situation because the Japanese could not imagine that it was as bad as they had heard. The export of live sheep is now threatened. There were meant to be record live sheep exports this year of 5.5 million sheep. As soon as that figure was understood to be a record, we had Mr Jack O'Toole saying: 'We'll fix that'. It is an incredible situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to the Government's responsibility in this area. We believe we have worked to improve industrial relations. We established the National Labour Consultative Council which comprise of union, employer and government representatives. It is consulted before any industrial legislation is brought into this Parliament. It should work and, indeed, on many occasions it has. We have also established the Industrial Relations Bureau to carry out the decisions of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. We have protected the rights of individuals and provided secret ballots for election to the federal bodies. We have required industrial organisations to produce audited annual financial accounts. We have protected the genuine conscientious objector if he has not wanted to join a union. We have protected the rights of anyone who has not wanted to go on strike. Indeed, we have passed legislation prohibiting unions taking any intimidatory action against people who say: 'I want to work'. Australians have said that men have a right to go on strike, but they have also got in their legislation the right to work. If a man wants to work and does not want to go on strike, we have legislation to protect him. Not only can the unions not intimidate him but also they cannot intimidate his boss and say to the boss: 'You have to get your men out'. </PARA>
<PARA> During the last Transport Workers Union strike in Tasmania all the men employed by the private bus owners wanted to work. Every one of those private bus owners had their men working and the buses were not stopped. This enabled tourists to keep travelling around Tasmania. It also enabled all the school children in outlying areas to be taken to school each day. The unions think that is a terrible crime. I can assure honourable senators that that is what they think because one of the other union members said: 'We have learnt a lot. We know how to deal with those people the next time and we will not have strike breakers'. The unions say that it is a disgrace that the bus proprietors and their employees who wanted to work were permitted to take the school children to their schools and to take tourists around our State. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also worked to emphasise the responsibility of all parties to meet their obligations. That has been done by extending the grounds for deregistration of organisations which act to damage the interests of the community as a whole and also where unions put the health and safety of the community at risk. We have also worked to improve the conciliation and arbitration procedures by broadening the area of concern of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Premiers, the Australian Council of Trade Union leaders, the employers, the employer representatives and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) have all got together to see whether they can do something about industrial relations. Statements have come from these groups. They are all very concerned and they all say that they agree we already have a wages policy and a wages system that ought to be abided by. </PARA>
<PARA> The only people who at this moment seem not keen to work together or to co-operate are the members of the Opposition. They have underlined this by bringing this matter of public importance on today. I believe that the Opposition ought to take notice of its erstwhile senator, Senator Wheeldon, who was quoted in the Canberra Times of 17 August as having said:</PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental organisational problem of the ALP is the continuation of affiliation of trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA> The control which unions have over the party made it very difficult to develop policies for the good of the nation and community as a whole, . . . they were sometimes contrary to policies which favoured trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> By having unions, but not other interest groups, as affiliates, the party was clearly identified as representing only one section of the community. </PARA>
<PARA>It is time that we Australians all learnt to pull together. We have a wonderful country; we have so much. Not one of us is independent. Every one of us relies heavily on the other. In my profession as a nurse prior to my coming here, where would I or the patients have been without the cleaners, without the doctors or without the technicians? It is time Australians learnt to pull together. We need each other. Every man needs his neighbour to be responsible. I move:</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In doing so I wish to make some fairly brief remarks. I understand that this is the first report of the Film Censorship Board to be tabled. That fact is to be very much welcomed. The Film Censorship Board, which has existed in its present form since 1973, operates under a quite extraordinary miscellany of Federal and State legislative and regulatory provisions. By and large nowadays it does have a completely uniform mode of operation over all the States and over both films shown in cinemas and films shown on television. The exception in this respect is the State of Queensland, which here, as in so many other contexts, insists upon doing its own thing. It has so insisted since 1974. That is not a phenomenon entirely to be regretted, I might add, particularly in the context of film censorship, because it ensures that a rather higher level of civilisation prevails elsewhere in the country as a result of Queensland opting out of the system of uniform censorship that has thus evolved. The other area of exception from the jurisdiction-if I might describe it as such-of the Board, insofar as television films are concerned, appears to be the Special Broadcasting Service, Channel 0/28. The unwillingness of that authority to submit to the jurisdiction of the Film Censorship Board is, I notice, the subject of some adverse criticism in the terms of this report. Maybe that is a matter which requires closer examination as to the desirability or otherwise of Channel 0/28 remaining outside the system. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic task of the Film Censorship Board is either to accept or to reject films as being available for screening in cinemas or as viewing on television channels and to classify those films which survive the basic threshold hurdle into one or other of four categories. Those are: G for general exhibition category; the NRC category, not recommended for children under 12 years; the M category for mature audiences; and the R or restricted category whereby persons between the ages of two and 18 are not to be admitted to the cinema. In addition, the Board from time to time allows special conditions to apply to films. This has particularly occurred in the past in relation to films imported for film festivals or for special screenings, for example, at the National Film Theatre of Australia. The exercise of the Film Censorship Board's functions over the years, and in particular over the last year or so, is the subject of some quite fascinating statistical tables in this report. Some very interesting trends have shown up over the years, notably a significant decline in the period since at least 1976-which is the subject of specific statistics-in the number or proportion of films that are actually rejected outright, which has fallen from 5.4 per cent in 1976 to 2.3 per cent in 1980. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The explanations are interesting in themselves. What might be at stake here is not only an increasing liberalism in the attitude of the Board, or on the part of the community, which the Board is endeavouring to reflect, but also the consideration, which is noted in the report, that there has been a somewhat decreasing patronage of theatres which show R rated erotic material in those States where there is easy access to hard core pornographic films and tapes in adult theatres and sex shops, the adult theatres in question tending to operate, whether within the law or not, rather outside of the censorship system. There is also an increasing availability, for better or worse, of pornography in the form of video cassettes. So, to a considerable extent, the men with gaberdine overcoats need not don them any more but can enjoy the material in question in the privacy of their lounge rooms. Whether that presents a satisfactory alternative to the joy that is otherwise derived from descending those scruffy stairs into dank basements in our various cities remains to be determined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to those films that are rejected, the trends over the years are interesting to note. Whereas rejection on the ground of sex-one might say straight sex-demonstrates a considerably downward trend, rejection for reasons of violence, or more particularly, combinations of sex and violence, represents a significant upward trend. A number of other things-I do not propose to describe them in detail-might be said about the trends which have emerged with respect to films with G, NRC and M classifications and the kinds of cuts that have been requested regularly by the Censorship Board. One factor in regard to cuts or eliminations that I do pause to note briefly is mentioned at page 13 of the report. Whereas in previous years sex accounted for the majority of eliminations, in 1980 violence and animal cruelty also figured prominently. It must be said that the performance of the Censorship Board has been, at least until quite recently, apparently the subject of universal acceptance, if not actual positive acclaim. Indeed, this much emerges from the report at page 20, where we find described the number of complaints which the Board has received from the community at large. It is there noted that in calendar year 1980 the Board received 67 letters and several telephone complaints, so described, criticising its treatment of theatrical films. The Board notes:</PARA>
<PARA> Considering that the complaints were confined to six or seven titles out of a total of 1,050 features registered by the Board in 1980, it would seem that its decisions have met with general acceptance in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, I endorse that self-description by the Board of what it has been about, and of the way in which, by and large, its performance in recent years seems to have been very much in accord with the increasingly liberal standards in these matters that have become accepted by the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is one slightly jarring note that I think it proper to intrude. It is perhaps the major reason why I rose to speak on this report. It seems that the Board is starting to take a somewhat harder line towards the category of foreign films that are imported for special purposes, either film festivals or screenings by organisations such as the National Film Theatre. A particular feature of the Board's functions and performance in this respect which has received some recent notoriety is its rejection of a film by the very famous and brilliant Japanese director, Nagisa Oshima, entitled In the Realm of the Senses, which was, in fact, screened quite uncut at the Melbourne Film Festival in 1977 before, I gather, a very large audience-not including myself so I cannot speak with any confidence as to its precise details. It was not allowed by the Board to be imported or screened, without substantial cuts, as part of a retrospective screening of some 14 films by Oshima organised recently by the Australian Film Institute. The Institute, in presenting its retrospective program of Oshima films at the National Film Theatre, quite properly refused to have anything to do with the screening, in the presence of Oshima, of a distorted or mutilated version of the film in question. </PARA>
<PARA> This might be regarded as being something of an isolated instance, except that one cannot help noting that Mrs Janet Strickland, the Chairman of the Board, who seems to have been getting a good deal of publicity lately because of her views about the Board and its role in the community-most extensively in the Age of 18 August-acknowledges a change in attitude, if you like a hardening of attitude, by the Board in respect of festival films or films that hitherto have been regarded as being in a special category. She is quoted in the article in the Age as making that point quite vigorously in these words:</PARA>
<PARA> I don't personally believe that film festivals should be able to show films that other sectors of the adult population can't see. You can't have one class of adults being exempt from the law. It is elitist to say otherwise. It has no substance in law and no substance in my philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA>Although that is certainly a debatable point of view, and as a good socialist I become very sensitive whenever allegations of elitism are thrown about in respect of anyone who argues for a greater degree of liberality, perhaps, in the censorship of certain classes of films in certain contexts, a sensible argument can be made for framing substantially more liberally the censorship standards that are to apply to films of unquestionably high artistic merit and reputation that are imported, or sought to be screened, for purposes such as film festivals and retrospective showings under the auspices of such bodies as the Australian Film Institute. Mrs Strickland seems to have taken a very hard line position, and one that I doubt on the whole would be accepted by most people in the community. I am not even sure-this is the last point that I wish to make-that it is in accordance with the actual philosophy of the Censorship Board, as articulated on pages 3 and 4 of its report. The Board, speaking of its role, states:</PARA>
<PARA> Within the limits of the legislation, the Board tries to implement a censorship policy based on the philosophy (shared by the major political parties) that adults have the right to make their own decisions regarding the material they read, hear or see; but that people generally should be protected from exposure to material that may be offensive-or, in the case of children, harmful to them. </PARA>
<PARA>If the philosophy is that adult persons should have the right to make their own decisions about what they see, that the only essential restriction to be imposed is that persons generally should be protected from exposure to material that may be offensive-a philosophy that appears to be accepted by the major political parties-something must surely be said for allowing persons who voluntarily make the effort to attend special screenings of films, knowing precisely what kind of film they are about to see, and who are generally literate so far as film culture is concerned, so to do. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be no question under those circumstances of a person wandering unaware into a cinema, misled by the kind of advertising that might be outside and being, as a result, offended by extremely graphic scenes with which they might then be confronted. It is very difficult to argue that in those circumstances anyone would be other than a voluntarily, actively consenting, willing participant in the cultural feast or famine, as the case may be, that the film in question actually represents. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe, and it is not an unimportant point, that we have mercifully survived for the last 15 or 20 years now without rending discussions or debates in the community about censorship issues. It is a wholly civilised turn of events for Australia that over the last 15 years this has been so. I would regret any suggestion that, as part of the emerging moral conservatism that seems evident in some other familiar cultures, if not yet entirely in our own, there should be a swing back of this particular pendulum. I am not sure, from what is in this report, that the Censorship Board is in fact foreshadowing any major across-the-board swing back of the pendulum towards a more restrictive approach, or view of the world. But in the matter of especially sensitive films, in the special context of film festivals and so on, there does seem to be evidence between the lines of this report, and more specifically in various recent pronouncements by Board members, of an emerging, quite significant, change of heart. If that were I would find it most regrettable, and I would hope that other honourable senators would find it equally so. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to comment briefly on the somewhat lurid report of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, though I refer to the colour of the report more than the contents. I do so because the report does not correctly describe how the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet intrudes on every other department of the Commonwealth Public Service. Rather than my saying it, I will refer briefly to the words of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) who explained it all with great clarity and on the basis of lengthy experience on 28 April this year. When talking about the relationship between the Fraser Cabinet and the Parliament he said that our present system has deteriorated because that relationship has foundered. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It has foundered because the Prime Minister increasingly centralised power around himself. Any erosion of the Cabinet system goes to the heart of the parliamentary process. By reposing too much power in the Prime Minister, the system of collective responsibility within Cabinet is destroyed: The responsibility of Cabinet to Parliament is abandoned; and the very democratic process is placed in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Kooyong went on to talk about the handling of the Cabinet by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), which I will not go into here. I am sure there are honourable senators in this place who have a more vivid recollection of that process and a better knowledge of it than I, although they are not in the chamber at the moment. Mr Peacock in his speech of 28 April dealt with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the subject of this report, in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> Outside Cabinet there is another development, that of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Apart from the complex system surrounding Cabinet, the House should note that each Commonwealth department is now duplicated in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. This causes waste but, far worse than that, it brings interference with, indeed supervision of, decisions made by Ministers and their departments. The role now given to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet challenges the authority given Ministers under section 64 of the Constitution. There is another equally undesirable effect. It places deep strains on the Public Service because it sets public servant against public servant. It is a major power structure for the Prime Minister. As a consequence, it is at odds not merely with the Constitution but with efficient management of the country. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a point that I intend to illustrate in a minute. Mr Peacock continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, to me, as a Liberal, it strikes at the root of liberalism itself. Liberalism distrusts concentration of power. It has always been associated with checks and balances and the division of powers. Liberals believe that in a healthy society power and decision-making are widely dispersed throughout the community. They are not to be monopolised. Therefore, the ever increasing centralisation of power is striking at the heart and core of liberalism. </PARA>
<PARA>I see Senator Messner blanch at that thought. Mr Peacock went on:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, Liberals believe in consensus, and consensus does not mean abject compromise. Strength does not mean bullying. I believe the growth of centralised power within our Government today is restricting effective formulation of policies required by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The complaint of the honourable member for Kooyong against this Government was that the Prime Minister had a dangerous determination to centralise power. He gave us evidence of this from his personal recollections. We can also see evidence of this from the Government's actions. While all sorts of government programs were cut in the Review of Commonwealth Functions none of the Prime Minister's pet schemes were cut as a result of the so-called razor gang review. For example, 30 colleges of advanced education are to be rationalised; the college in Mr Fraser's electorate remains unscathed. General cuts are to be made in defence expenditure, especially defence matters related to research and development. But the Casey University, the Prime Minister's pet idea since 1970, is to remain untouched, at a cost of a minimum of $80m. </PARA>
<PARA> The promised grand prix race track for Canberra is to go ahead not because this Government is at all shy about breaking election promises; the construction of the race track is to go ahead because it is the pet project of the Prime Minister of this country. The Prime Minister likes racing cars. In addition to those examples is Mr Peacock's apologia. These are evidence of what is going on inside the Cabinet in terms of decisions of government which in the words of the honourable member for Kooyong are overborne by the structure of government and the centralisation of power in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and in the hands of the Prime Minister. The report of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet gives further evidence of the hypocrisy of this Government and the hypocrisy of the Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Baume wants me to say that the Prime Minister says one thing and does another I can document that over about an hour. But I am referring to the hypocrisy of the Government and the hypocrisy of the Prime Minister in relation to the matters already adverted to. I will refer to some other matters. While the Prime Minister has been constantly calling for a reduction in the size of government departments and for general restraint the central organs of Mr Fraser's Government have grown significantly-none more than Mr Fraser's own Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the staff of which has grown by over 17 per cent during his tenure. In spite of the urgings for a reduction in the size of the Commonwealth Public Service and for a reduction in the size of other government departments the staff of the Treasury has grown by 10 per cent, and the staff of the Public Service Board has grown by 5 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Expenditure on the Australian Federal Police Force and security related matters has increased under the Fraser Government by 40 per cent. This is in spite of calls for reductions in Commonwealth expenditure and Commonwealth functions. The report of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet further underlines this trend. In an atmosphere of financial stringency the report discloses that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet spent 15 per cent more in money terms than in 1979-80. That is a growth in real expenditure of about 5 per cent over just one year in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It represents an acceleration of an already established trend. A look at the Budget forecast indicates that that trend will accelerate further. Money growth in expenditure in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet for 1981-82 is expected to be 23 per cent. What other area has been budgeted for an increase in expenditure of the order of 23 per cent by the Fraser Government at a time when the Prime Minister persistently maintains that the size of the Public Service must be reduced, that the functions of national government must be reduced and that the costs of national government must be reduced? These double standards amount to classic examples and illustrations of the proper use of the word 'hypocrisy' to which I referred to a moment ago. There is real growth of well over 10 per cent in the expenditure of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very nice to have an annual report tabled here with photographs of former Prime Ministers of Australia on the front and back. It is very nice to be assured that members of that Department continue to do the good job which I am sure they do. It is not what is in reports that is important; it is what is left out of them that should be considered from time to time by this Parliament. It is those matters which on 28 April this year the honourable member for Kooyong was constrained to draw to the attention of parliamentarians on both sides, the growth and centralisation of power in the Prime Minister's Department and the adverse effects it was having on the process of democratic parliamentary government in this country. I commend a reading of the report to honourable senators but I commend to their consideration some other matters which are not included in the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The report of the Royal Military College at Duntroon is a report of an institution which is now drawing to a close. It marks the end of a period or chapter of proud history for that institution. At the whim of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) it has become a place where army cadets in future will get shortened periods of military training. It is to be replaced-I said something like this a few minutes ago-by the Prime Minister's pet project, the Australian Defence Force Academy. At a time when the Australian community is told to exercise restraint, when the ordinary Australian is being slugged with higher taxes-now even a tax on information in terms of books, magazines and newspapers-this utterly wasteful project is to go ahead. This is a story of the Prime Minister's pigheadedness and of what the honourable member for Kooyong, Mr Peacock, has described as the Prime Minister's manic determination to get his own way-Mr Peacock's words, not mine. Mr Fraser, as Minister for Defence, in 1970 first floated this project. It was rejected by the Gorton Government. The following year he participated to some extent in bringing down Mr Gorton as Prime Minister of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, which is a joint party committee, examined the proposal in some detail, as it was incumbent on that Committee to do, the subject matter having been referred to it. The report of that Committee effectively said that the Committee could see no merit in the proposal educationally, in defence terms or in any other way which would justify the level of expenditure proposed. The level of expenditure proposed is significant. It was announced in December 1979 as being $65m. Four months later the cost of the Casey military university had gone up to $80m. It is now probably closer to $100m. It could be well above that figure by the time it is finished. Quite apart from the reports of the parliamentary Committee and the opposition of that Committee to it, there are other reasons why it is a senseless project. I refer to views held by Australian educational bodies such as the Australian University Vice-Chancellors Committee, the Federation of College Academics and so on. Each organisation has said that the project is wrong in terms of educational priorities to segregate military cadets in an exclusively military environment for university training. Last year the Western Australian Minister for Education, Mr Jones, described it as 'one of the more incredible decisions of the Federal Government'. He was making that criticism on the grounds of educational priority, amongst others. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal to proceed with this so-called university is wrong in terms of defence priorities. Despite the increase vote for defence in last night's Budget, the Government is still hundreds of millions of dollars behind the target figure for defence expenditure set in its own defence White Paper in 1976. The money which is to be spent on this institution could have been better spent in terms of current needs of the Australian military forces on ammunition, such as bullets for the Army, increasing the strength of the Royal Australian Air Force, or allowing pilots to get more flying hours. Any of those things could have been done but they have not been done. By any standards the services are in a pretty shocking state. They are in an abysmal state considering the proposals set out in the Government's own White Paper in 1976 for defence expenditure. The fact is that our defence forces would be incapable of sustaining a defensive effort of any worthwhile size or length of time. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1978 the Australian Naval Institute described the academy-this successor to the Royal Military College of Australia, which is the subject of this report-as a 'recipe for disaster'. Officer after officer gave evidence to the Public Works Committee saying that the proposal was undesirable in military terms. The officers included Major-General Vincent, Brigadier Greville, Brigadier Taylor, Air Vice-Marshal Candy and Air Vice-Marshal McNamara. The defence forces of countries such as the United States of America and Britain have never looked at a proposal for a joint academy of this kind. A careful investigation by the Public Works Committee of the Parliament resoundingly opposed the proposal. The decision was unanimous. The Chairman of the Committee, Mr Mel Bungey, a Liberal member, said on the Australian Broadcasting Commission program AM:</PARA>
<PARA> We believe the concept is wrong and I certainly won't be supporting anything which I think is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA>The Royal Military College at Duntroon, the subject of this report, has served this country well, as has the Royal Australian Naval College and the Royal Australian Air Force college. These institutions are virtually to disappear for no productive purpose. They are to disappear simply to pander to the wishes of the Prime Minister and to ride roughshod over the commonsense view of defence and educational experts and a unanimous decision of the Committee of the Parliament. This is wasted expenditure in the light of consistent calls for constraint in Government expenditure. It is expenditure which is accorded in the light of the priorities to which I have referred in dealing with the report of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. I draw these matters to the attention of the Senate because again they concern a question of political priorities with which this chamber has to deal and which we cannot fail to confront in relation to all matters which come before us. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to provide a voluntary contribution scheme as an alternative to private health insurance so that contributions to that scheme are proportionate to the gross income of contributors and so that the beneficiaries are persons whose income is such that they will pay less under the scheme than they would pay for private insurance. Basically, it is a Bill to end an anomaly and an injustice which originated when the present Government last amended existing health insurance schemes. The anomaly I am referring to is the one involving the absolute cut-off line between those people defined by the Government as disadvantaged, and therefore qualifying for free health care, and those who are not so defined. As my colleague, Senator Mason, pointed out during the passage of the enabling legislation last May, this produced the absurd and, in some cases, tragic situation in which, for example, a family with two children whose income was $199 a week was actually better off than that same family would be if its income rose to $205 a week, even allowing for the tax concession available on the health insurance paid in the latter case. This could put millions of Australian children at risk since some parents would be forced not to take health insurance, simply because they could not afford to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the intention of the Australian Democrats to correct this anomaly by introducing provisions for the operation of a sliding scale scheme. The purpose of this Bill is to achieve that end in the simplest, least arithmetically or administratively complex way-through the option of a voluntary contribution scheme which is conducted through a levy on gross income until the level of the contribution reaches the level of the cost of basic private health insurance minus the tax concession. It would ensure that a voluntary contributor had the same rights as a disadvantaged person has under the present Act, but would make no provision for hospital only insurance. It is not, of course, restricted to those people whose incomes lie between the present cut-off point and the top end of the sliding scale, as the secondary purpose of this Bill is to provide some element of choice to Australian health insurees. At the moment, they are faced with a very limited one: Not to insure at all and suffer the consequences, or to insure privately with one of a series of companies offering essentially the same product. </PARA>
<PARA> Before going on to give details of the way in which the system will work, I would like to comment on the drafting of this and other Bills being introduced by Australian Democrat senators. In the very early stages of our existence as senators, we approached the Parliamentary Counsel for assistance in preparing what were, we knew, some interestingly complex private senators' Bills; complex, that is, for lay people conversant with neither lawyers' English nor drafting procedures. Unfortunately, none was forthcoming. While the Counsel was prepared to spend some considerable time delineating the reasons why he could not help, he was not able to spend any time at all apparently in sorting out any of the problems for which he envisaged we were heading. Indeed, I found his letter to me rather more patronising than was warranted, although this may have been merely an expression of the attitude most lawyers seem to have of lay people rather than any expression of condescension he, as a public servant, had for me, as a mere member of parliament. We turned, therefore, to the Senate staff for help and these Bills are the result. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of what we hoped to do must be done by regulation, partly because the figures, incomes and rates concerned are likely to be affected by inflation and are therefore best left out of the actual legislation, and partly because incorporation of them would have made the drafting process and the resultant Bills so much more complex. I mention this point not because I believe that the Parliamentary Counsel was being deliberately obstructionist, but to provide you, Mr President, and honourable senators with the reason for the fact that much of the 'meat' of the Bill is to be enshrined in regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> I must also point out that in the event of this Bill passing both Houses-a highly unlikely event at the best of times-amendments would have to be made to the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981. I reiterate at this point that the intention of this Bill is to remove the anomaly inherent in the present 'disadvantaged persons' definition by providing a sliding scale of voluntary contributions through a levy on gross income. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme would work in this way: The present cost of insuring a family with a private health insurance fund is $572 per annum, on which a tax deduction of 32 cents in the dollar applies. I recognise the fact that private health insurance companies are at present engaged in the game of increasing those costs but for the sake of simplicity I will have to stick to the ones operating at present. Thus, at the moment, actual family rates for health insurance amount to $389 per annum. The single rate of insurance is presently $286 per annum, less the 32 cents in the dollar tax concession, producing an actual cost of $194 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> I say at this point that the introduction of tax deductibility for health insurance fund contributions is long overdue and something for which the present Government is to be congratulated. The present disadvantaged cut-off points are $96 a week for a single person-that is, approximately $5,000 a year-and $160 a week for a married couple, with an additional $20 a week allowed for each child. The relevant annual figure for a married couple with no children is therefore $8,320 a year. An additional $1,040 a year is allowed for each child. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the system we are recommending-that is, that a levy of six cents in the dollar be charged for family insurance-a married couple with no children would begin paying this levy at the present Government cut-off point for disadvantaged persons; that is, at $8,320. At this rate of six cents in the dollar, a couple with no children would have to earn $14,803 a year gross before they were contributing the now basic rate of $389. At this point, no further levy would be charged. Similar figures for a married couple with one child would be: Start of levy, $9,340; and the end of the sliding scale, $15,823. For a married couple with two children the starting point is $10,400 and the cut-off point $16,883. I think the rate for families on lower incomes is significantly different from the one which now applies. </PARA>
<PARA> Single people would pay a levy of 3c per dollar operating from $5,000 to a cut-off point of $11,403. For single parent families, similar rates of levy to those operating for married couples would apply; that is, a sole parent with one child would pay the same rate as a married couple with no children while a sole parent with two or more children would pay the same rate as that applying to a married couple in the same situation. In other words, instead of there being the absolute cut-off rate between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged persons as now applies under the Act thus causing extraordinary hardship to hundreds of thousands of Australians, a sliding scale of contributions would apply. No health insurance costs would be incurred for married couples between $8,320 and $10,400, depending on the number of children and no health insurance costs would be incurred for single people or sole parents earning between $5,000 and $10,400, again depending on the number of children involved. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the mechanics of operation are concerned, I would envisage that, since this Bill is not intended to operate before 1 July 1982, after that date individuals or families who wish to avail themselves of the scheme would do so by filling out a form available from the offices of the Commissioner of Taxation. In addition, a simple change to the taxation form to provide a section in which indication can be given of the health insurance scheme used by the individual concerned would then allow the Treasurer to deduct the required amount of payment due from those opting to pay for their health care cover through the income levy. Payment by the Government to doctors directly or to private health insurance companies for those individuals opting for the levy system would operate in the same way as applies at present to disadvantaged persons and pensioners. We feel that this scheme reduces the burden which is placed on people marginally above the level of income which at present is regarded as making them disadvantaged, without in any way grossly overburdening government revenue. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>First, Mr President, may I add my congratulations to those of other senators on your election to the position of President of this chamber. Secondly, I would like to make it known that I accept fully the responsibility given to me by the electors of Queensland to represent them in this the States' House of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment which I am proposing in the Customs Amendment Bill (No. 2), if carried, will ensure that this Parliament has the opportunity to protect natural areas of outstanding scientific, conservation and recreational value from destruction by sand mining. It does not seek to prohibit all sand mining. Indeed, this Parliament will, with this amendment, be able actively to encourage the export of minerals extracted from sand from those areas which are of economic value only. There are large deposits of mineral sands in Australia which are not located in environmentally sensitive areas such as Moreton and Fraser Islands. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, this amendment will give this Parliament the opportunity to prohibit the export of such minerals when they are likely to be used by nations hostile to Australia, particularly those nations which may wish to seek to use them for military purposes. For example, in the 11 months ended May 1981 we exported to the Soviet Union 5,018 tonnes of rutile valued at $1,671,000. In the free world at least over 90 per cent of rutile is used for the production of paint pigment. However, in the Soviet Union the rutile usage is mainly for missile production. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been necessary to bring this Bill before the Senate at this time because the Queensland Government, in not accepting its responsibilities in the areas of conservation and defence, has proceeded with granting sand mining leases for areas of Moreton Island. To point out that Moreton Island is a prime example of a remaining unspoiled coastal area on the doorstep of Australia's third major city is not to take an anti-mining stand. It is merely to state a fact. The Minister responsible for the granting of export licences has not, to date, indicated his intentions to prohibit the export of minerals to be mined from Moreton Island. It is encouraging that the Government senators, in recognising the importance of preventing the sand mining of this island, have elected to bring the second reading of this amendment Bill before the Senate today. I look forward to their further support when they vote for this Bill at the appropriate time. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreton Island is of major scientific importance not only environmentally but also archaeologically and biologically. The environmental and aesthetic values of Moreton Island are equal to those of Fraser Island. The particulars regarding the lakes, swamps, vegetation and geography of those sand islands do not require reiteration. This parliament knows of their value. However, Moreton Island has particular importance which is worth mentioning. It is a natural area of outstanding recreational value and a most important scientific and conservation area with considerable landscape value which would warrant consideration in a world heritage list. Of the large sand islands in that region Moreton Island is the least disturbed by man's activities. It is unique in that it is the last major sand island in close proximity to Queensland's capital which could still be regarded as a natural wilderness area. I believe on that basis alone Moreton Island should be preserved intact. Mining 6 per cent of Moreton Island will not leave many of its unique and varied attractions intact. The big and small sandhills, nearly all of Ocean Beach, the rolling heathlands surrounding Blue Lagoon, the west coast and the spectacular high dunes north of Mount Tempest will all be degraded. Thousands of years of Aboriginal history will be gone forever. The best mining technology can not restore such features. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not the only one who believes this. One of the heartening aspects of the Moreton Island conservation campaign has been the tremendous public response it has had, particularly in Brisbane. The Institute of Applied Social Research at Griffith University conducted a public opinion poll which showed that 68.1 per cent of the population within the Moreton region were not in favour of sand mining of Moreton Island. It is the opinion of anthropologists in the University of Queensland that this island offers the last remaining site within which the life patterns of the aboriginal inhabitants of Moreton can be pieced together. At least 30 distinguished Australians have attested to this. In an open letter to the Australian people they said:</PARA>
<PARA> We consider Moreton Island to be an invaluable resource for flora and fauna conservation, social values including recreation, archaeological and scientific values. Moreton Island is an invaluable natural resource for Queensland and the world. It should be kept for all generations to appreciate. All of Moreton Island should be conserved and managed as a national park. </PARA>
<PARA>It has been stated that the minerals to be mined from Moreton Island are of such value to Australia that we must forgo the conservation of Moreton Island to reap their benefits. This is simply not true. The sand mining industry is a capital intensive one with a high degree of foreign ownership and with a majority of its products being exported. At the most only 200 jobs will be created and many of these will be filled by existing employees of the companies involved. It has been estimated that the total revenue to the State Government from royalties, payroll tax and lease rentals would be a mere $4m. Furthermore, a major market for these exports will be the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the rutile will be used in the aircraft and space industries of that country including those for military use. None of the three minerals to be mined from Moreton Island will have a significant impact on the total mined throughout Australia. Rutile, even after excluding existing environmentally protected areas, will only be 4.25 per cent of Australia's total production and both zircon and ilmenite will be less than 2 per cent of Australia's production. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent oversupply of world markets has resulted in the cutting back of production for the mineral sands industries of Australia. In the light of this do we need to mine Moreton Island for the benefit of the USSR and to the detriment of Australia's environment? Irrespective of what has been said elsewhere, sand mining is incompatible with conserving Moreton Island and it would endanger its ecological integrity and destroy the natural recreational values that presently attract so many people to that island. Restoration of vegetation cover in mined areas of Moreton Island would require the use of fertilisers. Some native plants are sensitive to phosphate fertilisers and their application may prevent the re-establishment of some types of native plant communities. Should mining proceed on Moreton Island it and the associated infrastructure would jeopardise Moreton Island's status as part of the National Estate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my belief that Moreton Island is an impor- tant part of Australia's natural heritage and for this and the many other reasons that could be stated it should be kept in perpetuity for the people of Queensland and Australia. I believe this Parliament should, as a matter of continuing public debate, bring up from time to time in the consideration of such leases the ongoing debate between conservation and development within this country. I believe it is a debate worthy of this chamber. It is a debate in which we must all take part. I look forward to the support of honourable senators and I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to ensure, firstly, that regulations are made under the principal Act for the control of increases in interest rates; secondly, that those regulations grant relief from increases in interest rates to families borrowing funds for the purchase of their first home; and thirdly, that Parliament has control of increases in interest rates of more than 0.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, as you are no doubt aware, one of the traditional dreams of Australians is to own their own home. Indeed, Australia has one of the highest rates of home ownership in the world. It hardly needs stating, therefore, that rises in interest rates generally, and home loan interest rates in particular, have a devastating effect on individuals and families either already in possession of a mortgage or planning on applying for a loan to buy or build a house. </PARA>
<PARA> Constantly increasing interest rates have a staggering effect on these people. They make future budgetary planning almost impossible and I remind honourable senators that, unlike governments, householders in Australia are not encouraged to run at massive annual deficits. Those most affected, of course, are the poor, although middle income earners are also hard hit. Newly married couples have no chance of planning for the future under a system of constantly rising interest rates. They are forced out of the home market and into the rental or welfare housing market. Statistics on the value of total home loans show that there has been no real increase in these loans since the 1976-77 financial year, despite the fact that there has been a very real need for more loans. If the present Government's blinkered attitude to interest rate increases continues, I predict that these young couples and any family they can afford to have will be forced into the tent owning market. I say this advisedly and not frivolously. </PARA>
<PARA> When home loan interest rates rise, rentals inevitably follow either because the landlord has a mortgage as well or because he senses a high demand in a dwindling supply situation. A growing number of individuals and families can afford neither a home loan nor high weekly rental. In South Australia, a recent study by the South Australian Housing Trust reveals that between July 1980 and June 1981, the average rental price of houses rose from $56 per week to $65 per week, while those for flats and units rose from $38 to $44 per week. As South Australian house prices are generally lower than those in the eastern States, I imagine that the situation is even worse in Victoria, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. That there is a limited supply of rental accommodation and that what there is is outside the price range of those people who are finding it impossible to qualify for or keep up repayments on mortgages, is reflected in the ever increasing demand for housing trust or housing commission homes. Australia wide, there has been a record number of applications for the provision of welfare housing in the last 12 months. In South Australia, the jump has been of the order of 12 per cent in 1980-81, and this follows an increase of 9 per cent in 1979-80. </PARA>
<PARA> After last night's Budget it is clear that we can expect this trend to continue. The fact that Federal Government funding to the States for housing has dropped from $280m in 1978-79 to $108m in 1981-82 will serve only to exacerbate the problem. Public rental stocks are already at a record low. The wait for home loans is increasing and the cost of even an average home mortage repayment is prohibitive. The pressure of demand on welfare housing is rising dramatically. I repeat my prediction that if this trend continues, and it appears inevitable that it will, we will be faced with a generation of tent dwellers-a fact which will probably prompt the Government only to increase sales tax on tents! An even more troubling result of the fact that families are finding it difficult if not impossible to afford a roof over their heads, is the domino effect this has, not only on the building industry but also on other sections of business and commerce. Families will be forced to cut back expenditure on other items in order to meet repayments on existing mortgages or in order to afford to rent a roof. The first restraints will be applied to appliances, white goods, and cars. As a final resort, purchases of clothing and then food will be hit. After last night's budgetary announcements it appears that all that most people will be able to afford is to drive to their local bottle shop!</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill intends to stop the rot that is eating into the way of life of the majority of ordinary Australians by providing some relief for them of the excessive burden of interest rates facing them at present. It will do this in two main ways. Firstly, it provides for regulations to be made under section 50 of the Banking Act so that a five-year moratorium occurs on interest rate increases for individuals or families taking out a first house loan. Under this system, these people would know that for the first five years of their loan, their interest rate will not increase and, further, that any increase in the rate of interest required to bring the rate of interest to prevailing market levels will be made in stages over the second five years of the loan. This will shift the major burden of repayments from the low income earning years to a period in the lives of most people when they are better able to afford them. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it is apparent to many people that the sooner interest rate variations become a matter for the Parliament to decide before the event instead of acquiescing after it, the better. To that end, this Bill provides that the Treasurer shall not grant permission for an increase of more than one half of one per cent per six months in interest rate -unless a statement setting out particulars has been laid before each House of the Parliament and each House of the Parliament has by resolution declared that the Treasurer may grant the required permission. There are those who would say that these days Parliament is merely a rubber stamp of the Executive, and that may well be so. On the other hand, if interest rates have to be approved by Parliament as a whole, then the general public will at least have some opportunity to lobby their local members-a not inconsiderable improvement on the present situation.</PARA>
<PARA> I cannot emphasise too strongly that ever-increasing interest rates hit at the very heart of family life in this country. They will not go down by the Government expressing pious hopes that they will. Something has to be done to ease the burden on ordinary Australians and this Bill is one way of doing that. I would hasten to add, however, that the day the Government has the compassion to introduce tax concessions for home loan interest rates with a fair and just means test applying, I will support it wholeheartedly. It is beyond the competence of any senator, however, to introduce such a Bill and this one is the next best thing. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the banking industry starts beating its collective breast, I would like to refer at this point to another Bill in my name which seeks to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The purpose of this second Bill is to encourage savings in finance organisations which lend money for housing, by granting exemption from income tax for the first $1,000 of income from interest paid on savings accounts bearing interest at a rate of 10 per cent or less per annum. The result of this would be to provide a pool of money in relatively low interest bearing accounts in banks and building societies for those organisations to lend out at the low or pegged rates of interest for home loans I mentioned earlier. The result for the investor is simple. If he or she invests, say, $10,000 in an account paying 10 per cent per annum and does not have to pay tax on that, the money has been invested effectively at 14.7 per cent, a rate reasonably compatible with prevailing rates. I hasten to point out that, where an individual earns more than $1,000 interest in such accounts, only the first $1,000 would be exempt from taxation, and where the interest derives from investments in accounts paying more than 10 per cent, no exemption would apply. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my belief that, despite their bleatings to the contrary, banking institutions in Australia are not about to go to the wall and must be encouraged to face their responsibilities to Australians other than major investors. I cannot implore the present Government strongly enough to stop playing academic fiscal exercises with the lives and hopes of millions of Australians and, please, to show some real compassion for the ordinary man in the street and the women and children who will soon be sharing that street, quite literally, with him. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The object of this Bill is a simple one; it is to restore the 100 per cent disability pension to all ex-servicemen and women suffering from tuberculosis and who had contracted it prior to 2 November 1978. In the Federal Budget of 1978, the Government took away several longstanding benefits from those many Australian war veterans who already have and will in future suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis. Their dependents were also stripped of benefits. Among the benefits withdrawn by the Government were: Automatic 100 per cent disability pension for life-first granted in 1922; automatic acceptance and pension for those who served in a theatre of war-first granted in 1943; service pension for TB ex-servicemen and women who served their country but did not have overseas service-first granted in 1936; educational benefits for children of TB ex-servicemen; and recognition of the tubercular condition as if it had resulted from an occurrence which took place during the servicemen's war service. </PARA>
<PARA> As people in this Senate chamber will no doubt remember, when our servicemen and women returned in 1945 they were welcomed with ticker-tape, adulation and thanks on the part of the people of this country. In fact, we are able to debate matters today because of the actions of servicemen. Unfortunately we seem to have now forgotten the things done in 1945, and to thank our ex-servicemen and women. That debt remains whether it be 30 years ago or not. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the Government's action in cutting those benefits in 1978 was a very misguided one. I quote the rationale provided by the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Honourable Evan Adermann:</PARA>
<PARA>'. . The Government (has) decided that the special provisions which related to pulmonary tuberculosis were no longer appropriate because they were introduced when T.B. was a serious health problem with limited prospects of effective control. The introduction of effective treatment methods, based on new drugs, has changed this situation. The Government considered that, as most pensioners have long since ceased to suffer any extensive actual incapacity from TB, they should, in future, be paid on the same basis as veterans who suffer from other incapacities, that is, on the basis of the actual degree of incapacity suffered'. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate that it was not until the early 1970s that the standard of treatment of pulmonary TB was such as to bring about the situation which the Minister indicated was the reason for the Government's action. He and his departmental advisors conveniently forgot all those veteans whose TB had, for periods of up to 40 years, already gravely affected their lifestyles, and those people were at an age where a reduction in their pension was an economic disaster. Indeed, I have met a number of people who were reduced from 100 per cent disability to 5 per cent and who, for the first time since World War II, had to front up at a social security office and apply for the unemployment benefit. Those people were in their sixties. The Government has repeatedly promised-during the past 60 years-that under no circumstances would this particular pension rate be reduced below 100 per cent of the ordinary rate. I quote a letter dated 14 November, 1947, of which I am sure the Minister of Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) would have hundreds:</PARA>
<PARA>' . . . In connection with your war pension . . . You are informed that pension will continue subject to further review, but will not under any circumstances-</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat 'under any circumstances'-</PARA>
<PARA>be reduced below the ordinary total rate, prescribed by the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Messner, the present Minister, has stated that although TB veterans received letters containing the above undertaking, it meant only that the rate of 100 per cent applicable at that time would be paid-for example, inflation was not to be taken into account! He compounded this nonsense by announcing that there was no Government commitment to continue the 100 per cent rate to TB ex-servicemen and women. The Fraser Government was the first government to break this solemn promise to veterans in 56 years. According to Senator Messner's argument, there was no 'legal requirement' for every Government from 1922 to 1978 to continue the pension at the 100 per cent rate, but they did so nevertheless. </PARA>
<PARA> It is insufficient for the Government to claim that now there is a 'cure' for tuberculosis it can ignore the long term effects of the disease. Major economic, social and lifestyle changes were wrought on tuberculosis veterans prior to the discovery of the 'cure' and these must continue to be taken into account, even in 1981. One unique characteristic of tuberculosis victims is the stigma of the tuberculosis label, which brought may practical and social problems to affected veterans, and had serious consequences for their employment prospects, their social relationships, their chances of securing superannuation, and also of life insurance. Those veterans still alive continue to suffer from those disabilities that they had in 1945-social and economic disabilities that they suffered at the prime of their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> Treatment methods for tuberculosis generally after the First World War were crude and prolonged, and these methods continued until the Second World War when the most common method of treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis was pheumothorax, requiring the injection of air into the chest cavity. These injections of air to keep the lung collapsed were carried out on a weekly or fortnightly basis for periods of five years or more. If that is not a reason why this country should not at least respect those veterans, then I do not know what is. In approximately 1947, chest surgery was introduced. This process involved the risk of loss of life, permanent disfiguration and very painful post operative effects. Can we now say: 'Let us forget about the suffering of those pensioners at that time because there is a cure now'? What has a cure now got to do with it?</PARA>
<PARA> In the employment area the tuberculosis veterans were particularly disadvantaged, especially where medical examination was a necessary prerequisite. Some fields-for example, the food industry-were closed completely to such veterans. Many promising careers were cut short and the Minister knows this well. Promotion opportunities were missed and jobs lost because medical officers told veterans not to push themselves, to take things easy and take time off. They had those painful surgeries for up to five years or longer at a time when most people were establishing their economic livelihood and their families. Does that not continue to 1981? It is understandable, therefore, that, with their life opportunities greatly reduced, the 100 per cent rate disability pension-designed specifically for those veterans -should continue. How can the Minister for Veterans' Affairs then say what he said in correspondence? He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate the Government's belief that its current policy in respect of these veterans is a generous one, is reasonable and equitable, and places these veterans on the same basis as other veterans who receive a disability pension. </PARA>
<PARA>It does nothing of the sort. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, may I draw particular attention to clause 19 of my Bill, which has the effect of ensuring that any increased expenditure by the Commonwealth which results from the amendments in the Bill is not made out of the standing appropriations of the Consolidated Revenue Fund as provided for in the Repatriation Act and in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act and may only be provided out of an appropriation made by the Parliament for the purpose in the future. The inclusion of clause 19 is intended to prevent the Bill from being treated as a proposed law for the appropriation of revenue or moneys. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(8.56)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not oppose the Crimes (Currency) Bill, the purpose of which is to update, consolidate and revise all existing Australian law, State and Federal, which relates to the counterfeiting of currency, both notes and coin, domestic and foreign and also the counterfeiting of bonds and securities which are issued by the Commonwealth and foreign governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another object of the Bill is to enable Australia to accede to the International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency, a treaty which was in fact first entered into under the auspices of the League of Nations in Geneva back in April 1929. So it cannot be said that Australia has in any way rushed headlong into this particular legislative exercise. It has taken us some 52 years, in this instance, to get our legislative act together. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is a legitimate one because it is based on a quite inadequate existing law so far as counterfeiting is concerned. There is a spectacular lack of uniformity-despite the clear constitutional power which has existed in the Commonwealth since the turn of the century to override it-between the Commonwealth and the various States in this regard. The State legislation is variable in its coverage and is scattered through a variety of different Acts; for example, the New South Wales Crimes Act 1900, Part V; the Victorian Crimes Act 1958, Division 4; and the South Australian Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935, Part VI, all of which deal with forgery. The State legislation in question does not uniformly protect foreign currency and in some cases provides quite different penalties for offences in respect of domestic currency on the one hand and foreign currency on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we have a package of Commonwealth legislation which again wobbles about as between a variety of Acts-the Reserve Bank Act 1959, sections 46 to 55; the Crimes Act 1914, Part IV of which deals with coinage and Part V with forgery; the Treasury Bills Act 1914, sections 13 and 13A; the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911, sections 48 to 51; and the Currency Act 1965, section 22. </PARA>
<PARA> The mere recitation of that diversity of legislative bases for the present law makes clear the necessity for some rationalising piece of legislation such as this. The existing Commonwealth legislation does not protect adequately foreign currency. For example, the Crimes Act relates only to current coin, so described, that is, coins minted in any part of the Queen's Dominions. Similarly, the Reserve Bank Act deals only with paper money offences relating to Australian notes. One may compare this with the obligations which arise under the 1929 Convention, as supplemented in practice by a resolution of the fifth conference of the International Criminal Police Organisation in 1969, which recommended to participating states that provisions in their domestic law with respect to the counterfeiting of currency be supplemented by provisions which dealt with foreign and domestic government bonds and other securities of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA> That international law-and in particular the Convention itself-requires that the punishment for, or prevention of, counterfeiting offences apply wherever the offences have been committed on the soil of the nation in question, or the soil of any other country. The convention also requires that each country provide appropriate protection against the counterfeiting of foreign as well as domestic currency in Australia or by Australians. It also provides that there by no differentiation between the scales of punishment in respect of the domestic currency in question on the one hand and foreign currency on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> The object of the legislation is to resolve, consolidate and codify the extraordinarily diverse muddle of domestic laws, both Commonwealth and State, which apply in this area and to bring our Australian law to a condition which satisfies international law and enables Australians to accede to the convention in question. Accordingly the reforms that are effected by this Bill are as follows: The legislation now applies to the counterfeiting of Australian and foreign coin, paper money and also government securities and stock of both Australian and foreign countries; it provides for penalties to be the same whether Australian or foreign currency or bonds are involved; it repeals the existing Commonwealth legislation which bears upon this; and it imposes heavy penalties for all classes of offences relating to counterfeiting, which penalties are consistent, by and large, with existing offences and with the seriousness of the offences in question. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill creates a couple of new offences: Clause 18 relates to the possession of disfigured or defaced Australian currency and clause 19 relates to the designing, making, printing and so on of facsimiles of Australian paper money and securities which might be mistaken for the real thing. The Bill also provides for jurisdiction in these matters to be exercised by the relevant State courts. </PARA>
<PARA> There are perhaps only three or four specific issues which require explicit mention. One of them perhaps concerns the extra-territorial operation of this Bill. Clause 5 on the face of it is pretty far reaching to the extent that it applies the operation of this legislation rather unusually: Not only does it make provision in relation to people operating within Australia but also it gives the Bill a completely extra-territorial operation; it does not limit it territorially in any way. However, that is qualified by clause 23 which makes it clear that persons are liable to be charged for offences under this legislation only if the offence in question is committed by a person within Australia or on an Australian ship or aircraft, or, if it happens to be committed overseas, if it is committed in relation to Australian money. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the object of that is to protect the Australian currency in situations, which are regrettably increasingly applying today, of international risk to a nation's currency. Such is the ease of communication both physically and otherwise these days there is a genuine risk to the Australian economy of Australian currency being forged or counterfeited outside the country and brought within it. This aspect of the law in question enables the reach of Australian jurisdiction to extend to that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect of the Bill requires some comment. It will indeed be the subject of a Committee stage amendment by the Opposition, which amendment I hope will be supported by a majority of honourable senators in this place. In this particular respect it will perhaps be an interesting test of good faith. The second matter I draw attention to is one of some concern. It relates to the power to seize forfeited articles under this legislation. At the moment the way the Bill is drawn the power to seize is conferred absolutely and it is not required that the constable or Customs officers in question have a warrant in order to accomplish the seizure of the forfeited article in question. </PARA>
<PARA> The relevant clause is clause 29. Perhaps we will refer again to this clause in a little more detail in the Committee stage of the debate. The relevant articles include not only those in the form of counterfeit money itself but also materials which may be used in the production of counterfeit money. The clause simply provides that any article which is forfeited by virtue of being an article of this type or being reasonably believed to be an article of this type can simply be seized without warrant. In fact, this means that if an officer happens to believe that a printing press may have been employed for suspect purposes in this respect that printing press, however valuable it might be, can in fact simply be seized without warrant. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition regards it as obvious that seizure without warrant of counterfeit currency in particular and other moveable articles that might be involved in the production of it might in circumstances of urgency need to be accomplished without warrant. On the other hand, we take the view that it is most unfortunate for legislation like this, or indeed Commonwealth legislation generally, to be scattered with these sorts of provisions which make no allowance for requirement of a warrant in circumstances where there is no urgency involved because of any concern about the loss or destruction of the article in question. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Committee stage we will in fact be moving an amendment to delete the requirement that all such seizures can in fact be accomplished without warrant. We will substitute a provision stating that normally a warrant should be required except in circumstances of urgency where the article might reasonably be regarded as likely to be lost or destroyed if a warrant is sought before the seizure takes place. Certainly that is consistent with the kind of attitude that the Labor Party can be expected to take consistently in this chamber, as indeed it has taken in the past. That is, while supporting the general thrust of legislation we will be very alert to particular clauses within a Bill which we might otherwise support and which in fact can be regarded as overbroad or infringing legitimate claims of civil liberty. We will move that amendment. I think that will constitute an interesting test case of the good faith of this chamber in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of other matters perhaps need brief mention. The main offences provided for in the Bill in clauses 6 to 13 carry, for the most part, custodial penalties only with no alternative provision for a fine being made. There seems to be no particularly clear or obvious reason why the alternative of a financial penalty should not have been specifically made available to the court in respect of these offences in appropriate cases. One might have thought that on the scale of parallel penalties adopted elsewhere in this Bill-for example, in the new uniform national companies Act-the alternative to 10 years imprisonment should be a fine of around $20,000, the alternative to 12 years imprisonment a fine of $24,000 and the alternative to 14 years, another penalty which recurs in this Bill, a fine of $28,000. I will be interested to hear from the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) in his reply why this pattern of alternatives has not been applied systematically throughout this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a point I think worth making-we will not push it to the stage of division in the Committee stage-but again the Opposition would be interested to hear from the Attorney why the language of the Bill is as it is. Clause 19 makes it an offence to design, make, print or distribute certain materials. The test set out in that clause is that the offending material 'so resembles current paper money . . . as to be capable of misleading a person into believing that it is that current paper money'. That is a rather broad test. The language is very broad and seems to be broader than the test of 'likely to mislead or deceive' which appears, for example, in section 52 of the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that under this legislation all that has to be shown is that the material be capable of misleading a single person in the community, however gullible that person might be. Again, I think there is something to be said for the Attorney taking note of this point and indicating whether he is in fact satisfied that the expression 'capable of misleading a person' is in fact a satisfactorily narrow and precise definition of what is required if this section is not to have overbroad, overkill kind of operation. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the matters that the Opposition desires to raise with respect to this Bill. As I said, it is a somewhat overdue legislative initiative since it has taken something like 52 years to reach the statute book since the Convention was first opened for signature in Geneva back in 1929. The Opposition makes the point in these circumstances, as indeed we tolerantly do in many others, that it is better late than never. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support the Crimes (Currency) Bill 1981. We will be supporting the second reading of the Bill, as I presume the Australian Labor Party will do. The Bill covers the counterfeiting of currency, both domestic and foreign. This Bill is reciprocal legislation which enables Australia to join the United Nations International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency. As Senator Evans indicated, the reason we have not been able to join the Convention in the past is that we have not had the domestic legislation to enable us to do so. This Bill provides that domestic legislation which will allow us to join the Convention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two matters in the Bill that are not required by the Convention but which, notwithstanding, are included in this legislation. The Australian Democrats concur with both of those matters. The first matter relates to the counterfeiting of both foreign and domestic government bonds and securities and the second relates to the reproduction of coins of numismatic interest. I wonder why we use the word 'numismatic' when 'of interest to coin collectors' would be much simpler and would convey the point more accurately and more clearly. </PARA>
<PARA> I have heard the amendments which are proposed. Senator Evans was courteous enough to give us good notice of the suggested amendments which he proposes to move on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. They are amendments with which the Australian Democrats concur. We believe the amendments cover the case where immediate action is 'necessary'. We further note that they are in line with the Australian Law Reform Commission's recommendations. We are pleased to support the Bill. We commend the Government for bringing it in. At the Committe stage of the Bill we will be supporting the Labor Party's amendments. We would commend that the Government give due consideration to them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am trying to put into perspective the honourable senator's concern. The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) is perhaps 50 years further on than the International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency to which Australia is now acceding. What I am saying here is that in the overall international historical perspective, Senator Durack has really acted most expeditiously. Coins came into existence many thousands of years B.C. They were usually stamped in the shape of animals and therefore, doubled as decoration and so on. In times closer to our great turning point from B.C. they were actually made into wedge shapes which gave us the Latin word for coin. It has always been a concern of those in political authority to ensure that the coins and currencies of the realms not be counterfeited or forged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Evans expressed some concern that the offences provided for under this legislation in respect of natural persons permitted penalties to be imposed only in the nature of imprisonment, for up to 12 years in some cases or a maximum of 14 years in others. The history of laws dealing with counterfeiting show that these are very mild penalties indeed. In common law and in the legislation of the United Kingdom, counterfeiting was always regarded as high treason. In the very early statute of treason of 1352, when the King was required to state under pressure from the Commons those seven cases which would be high treason-because lands in that case were forfeited to him rather than the immediate lord of the person concerned-two of those seven heads of treason were to do with counterfeiting. The penalties in that case were extreme and severe. As Senator Evans would be pleased to know, this legislation is well in accord with, and indeed milder than, that which has been a part of our history. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very interesting that Senator Mulvihill should raise that question because I think I know the answer. Whilst some of the convicts brought out to Australia may well have been guilty of such a crime, the fact is that the First Fleet arrived here with no money. At the time of King George III, I think, England was in such a state of political and economic turmoil that there was hardly enough coin for the realm within the shores of the United Kingdom, let alone for the newly established convict settlements in the great southern waters. So when the First Fleet arrived in Australia there was a provision of the necessities of life from the commissariat of the colony. There was even no barter or exchange; everything was provided. When the early governors required greater supplies or sums of money they used to send to the Cape for such supplies. Of course, this led to the early circulation of rum as a desirable medium of exchange. This was used and abused by those officers who had access to it and those members of the armed forces who received rum as part of their ration and pay.</PARA></TALK.START>

Under this legislation Australia does accept responsibility for not only preventing the counterfeiting of its own money within Australia but also the counterfeiting of the money or coin of those other nations which accede to the covenant. In that respect this legislation does fulfil our international obligations under the Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency. It is interesting to note that that too is totally in harmony with the traditions of our common law and legislative heritage from the United Kingdom. In the first year of Mary's reign in 1553 an Act was passed concerning the counterfeiting of strange coins being current within the realm. The preamble may be of interest to the honourable senator. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>

In that respect the Opposition entirely supports the Crimes (Currency) Bill. We do have a misgiving which has been well expressed by Senator Evans insofar as a police constable can seize, without warrant, counterfeit currency, coins or, more particularly, machinery which he reasonably suspects to have been involved in the production of such counterfeit currency or coins. We simply say that unless there is a case of urgency a warrant ought to be argued for before a judge or magistrate before the seizure of such property takes place. In that minor but important respect I support the amendment which will be moved by Senator Evans.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As mentioned by Senator Evans in his second reading speech, the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Bill is based on the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission. Indeed, the Commission's report No. 16, tabled in Parliament on 16 September 1980, contained draft legislation which is almost identical with the provisions in the private member's Bill before the Senate. The Government has completed a careful examination of the recommendations put forward by the Commission. On 10 June 1981 the Treasurer (Mr Howard) outlined the reasons why the Government had decided not to introduce legislation to regulate the activities of insurance brokers. The private member's Bill does not introduce any new approaches to the issues surrounding the question of broker regulation beyond those cavassed by the Law Reform Commission. Accordingly, the Government is not in favour of this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the first place, the Government's general view on intervention in commercial relationships is that a clear need must be demonstrated before Commonwealth regulatory legislation is considered. The Government's view in this case is that such a need has not been established. It is also recognised that the States traditionally are the regulators of intermediaries such as solicitors and estate agents, and in areas of general consumer protection. Those on other side of the Senate may wish to centralise all power at the Federal level, but that is not the objective of this Government. We are fortified in our approach to this matter by the fact that the vast majority of broker transactions have been conducted in a satisfactory manner. The figures of losses from broker insolvencies played upon by Senator Evans ought to be seen in a proper context. The fact is that losses from broker insolvencies as cited by the Law Reform Commission, that is, known insolvencies, in the 10 years preceding the Commission's report, represent less than 0.1 per cent of premiums handled by brokers. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; It is a small amount. Furthermore, based on the Law Reform Commission's analysis, 92 per cent of the known losses arising from broker insolvencies represented amounts due to insurers. In addition, businesses, which could properly be expected to look after their own commercial interests, make up the largest proportion of brokers' clientele. All this suggests that only a very small proportion of the losses would have fallen on the individual consumer. Accordingly, the Government's view remains that the most effective approach to the basic issues relating to insurance brokers is the development of sound self-regulatory practices. With self-regulation, consumers are given the freedom to choose to deal with intermediaries subject to such arrangements or, if they prefer, to seek services elsewhere in the market. There is no shortage of readily identifiable insurance brokers subject to self-regulatory arrangements at this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the Government has taken note of the traditional practice in the general insurance industry whereby brokers in effect obtain extended credit, which in turn enables them either to extend credit to clients or to hold premium moneys for periods exceeding normal business practice before the moneys are transmitted to insurers. While it is evident that the great majority of brokers handle these moneys in a responsible manner, some circumscribing of dependence on extended credit may be appropriate. The Treasurer has said in regard to this particular aspect that consideration will be given, in consultation with the insurance industry, to amending the Insurance Act 1973 to give effect to this objective, provided that it can be done without undue regulation or administrative cost. I am advised that the initial industry reaction to the idea has been positive. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of the commercially interested parties in this matter, I must correct Senator Evans's assertion in his second reading speech, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there has been a striking unanimity in the calls for compulsory regulation of brokers, for professional indemnity insurance and for implementation of the Law Reform Commission's other recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, we are advised by the major insurance industry bodies, representing both insurance brokers and underwriters, that they are most concerned about a number of provisions of the kind contained in the Bill, for example, the provisions in clause 11 under which insurance intermediaries would be deemed to be the agents of the insurer and not of the insured, and the provisions in clause 25 which require a broker to give the insured details of the remuneration received by him from the insurer in respect of the insured's contract. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator made a number of references to the various processes that have gone on in the past to explore the possibility of regulation in this area. It is true that the Government has looked at this difficult area on more than one occasion and had examined a variety of proposals put forward by the industry prior to the commencement of work in this area by the Law Reform Commission. The various studies undertaken in this area, both prior and subsequent to the Commission's report, have shown that significant costs would be involved in establishing a comprehensive regulatory scheme in this area and that many of the problems involved, including the possibility of broker failure, would remain. It is well recognised that a number of States either have legislated or are foreshadowing legislation in this area. To the extent that the interested parties feel that it is important to achieve consistency between State legislation, I point out that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has informed the States that the Government stands ready to assist in that process. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, as the Treasurer has said, the Government is conscious that there will be some in the community who will be disappointed that the Government has not embarked upon the course of full scale regulatory legislation. However, governments have to justify the costs of regulatory intervention by establishing a clear public interest in so intervening. It is often claimed that the only answer to default and dishonesty is to pass more legislation. On the contrary, whilst legislation can go some way towards reducing bad and inefficient practices, no amount of legislation can provide a guarantee against fraud and business failures. At the same time, the attempt to provide such a guarantee in this case would inevitably bring with it an unacceptable level of intervention in the affairs of businesses and individuals. Accordingly, the Government opposes the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the debate be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to speak briefly to that motion. I commend the motivation of Senator Missen in moving the adjournment of this debate. The Australian Democrats are very much for the thrust of the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Bill 1981 but, in one or two minutes, I must say that I believe it has been a very poor show today in the Senate. We have now run out of business. Had it not been for the Australian Democrats-I do not take particular credit for this-with our six private member Bills we would have finished even earlier. I was amazed this morning when we received the message from the Government that we could proceed today with the second reading speeches on those Bills. At first we thought it was a ploy to try to 'catch us with our pants down', but I misjudged the Government. It was not such a ploy. It was simply that the Government had no business. </PARA>
<PARA> The proceedings of the Senate are being broadcast today. The Government has had since June to prepare its business and I believe this early adjournment is an absolute disgrace. Tomorrow there is an item on the Notice Paper-the proposed amendment to Standing Orders-that will probably take several hours. It will eat into valuable debating time. Why is that item not being debated tonight?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is treating the Parliament as though it is an absolute farce. To some extent I can sympathise with Ministers because I know that the Public Service is notorious for not giving in its nasty contentious legislation at the beginning of a parliamentary session. The devious minds of the public servants, the senior departmental heads, think: 'Let us leave that to the end of the session and then rush it through in the last week or so'. They have been able to do that in the past but I warn those devious public servants that they will not be able to do it with this Parliament. I plead with the Government: It has had since June to prepare enough legislation for presentation this first week of sitting to keep the Senate sitting until at least the normal hour of its adjournment. It appears now that we are to rise at something like 9.30 p.m. I do not disagree with that-I am sure all of us welcome a chance to have an early night and go back to our offices to catch up with some of our work-but I believe that the point on the undesirability of this situation is well worth making.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Dear Senator:</PARA>
<PARA>Higher Education Funding Cuts</PARA>
<PARA> The undersigned members of this University write to seek your aid in retrieving higher education from the crisis into which it has been thrown. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee for the Review of Commonwealth Functions has, among other measures relating to education, proposed:</PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of tuition fees for people intending to enrol in second and higher qualifications in 1982</PARA>
<PARA> A tightening of access to the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and the introduction of a loans scheme in prospective partial replacement of the TEAS</PARA>
<PARA> The removal of Commonwealth funds for educational research</PARA>
<PARA> The enforced, rapid, and hence dislocatory amalgamation of 30 Colleges of Advanced Education, either with each other, or with neighbouring Universities.</PARA>
<PARA>None of these proposals has emerged out of consultation with or advice from any of the affected parties, with or from any State Authorities, or from any published advice by the Tertiary Education Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the proposals, if enacted, will be to deny access to higher education to a further and significant proportion of intending participants, and to do further damage to the already weakened state of independent research and scholarship in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time when the nation is undergoing major changes in its economic, technological, and social structure, the need is quite clear that the very best education and retraining should be available for all who can benefit from it. Australians have a right to equal educational opportunity. We ask you to defend that right by opposing the Lynch Committee proposals and supporting the improvement of access to higher education, and improvement in the funding of independent research training activities. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Section 53 of the Commonwealth Banks Act, relating to unclaimed deposits with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, provides that where there has not, for a period of not less than seven years, been any operation on the account by deposit or withdrawal and the pass book has not been presented to the Savings Bank (for example, for crediting of interest), all moneys standing to the credit of the account may be credited to the Depositors' Unclaimed Fund, and shall thereupon cease to bear interest. The Savings Bank, if satisfied that a person is entitled to money which has been credited to the Depositor's Unclaimed Fund, may make payment of the money to him. A list of accounts with balances of $20 or more credited to the Depositors' Unclaimed Fund is required to be published annually in the Australian Government Gazette. The Act provides that all moneys in respect of which a claim is not established within ten years after being credited to the Depositors' Unclaimed Fund cease to be claimable and become the absolute property of the Savings Bank; however the Savings Bank may allow any claim after the expiration of that period if it is satisfied that special reasons exist for the payment of the claim.</PARA>
<PARA> For trading banks subject to the Banking Act, including the Commonwealth Trading Bank, the provisions concerning the treatment of unclaimed moneys are set out in section 69 of that Act. In summary, moneys held in an account which has not been operated on for seven years are paid to the Commonwealth Government and held in a Trust Fund. A list of accounts with balances of $20 or more is required to be published annually in the Australian Government Gazette. After six years in the Trust Fund, moneys remaining unclaimed are paid to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. At any time it is possible for a person to provide evidence establishing a claim over the moneys in which case the moneys are refunded through the bank concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The private trading banks are subject to section 69 of the Banking Act (see (1)) in their treatment of unclaimed deposits. There is no corresponding legislative provision covering unclaimed moneys held by the private savings banks.</PARA>
<PARA> Section 106 of the Life Insurance Act 1945 governs the treatment of unclaimed moneys held by life insurance companies. Under those provisions life insurance companies are required to pay unclaimed moneys to the Treasurer; however, the provisions allow for subsequent payments to be made from those moneys in satisfaction of valid claims.</PARA>
<PARA> The treatment of unclaimed moneys by businesses registered in the Australian Capital Territory (apart from banks, but including such financial institutions as building societies and credit unions) is subject to the Unclaimed Moneys Ordinance 1950. Pursuant to that Ordinance, the details of moneys payable but not claimed within six years are entered into a company register and, in due course, forwarded to the Treasurer. These details are subsequently published in the Gazette and at the elapse of 13 months from Gazettal the moneys are payable by the business to the Commonwealth of Australia. The payments of the moneys to the Commonwealth relieve the business of any further liability relating to the moneys. Any subsequent claim must be settled through the Supreme Court.</PARA>
<PARA> Beyond the above arrangements, I understand there would be State legislation governing aspects of the treatment of unclaimed moneys in respect of various financial institutions. The precise arrangements are, of course, matters for the States concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Managing Director of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation has advised that it is not the practice of the Commonwealth Banks to specially advise customers, on the opening of either trading or savings accounts, of the respective effects of Section 69 of the Banking Act 1959 or Section 53 of the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959 on these accounts. The Commonwealth Banks are not obliged to inform depositors before the provisions of these Acts are enforced. However, the Managing Director advises that the amount of money unclaimed in respect of the Commonwealth Trading Bank is quite small and almost invariably the accounts affected are those of customers for whom correspondence, statements, etc have been returned unclaimed for an extended period. With regard to the Savings Bank, under present procedures the bank writes to all affected depositors with a balance of $1 or more. Where the balance is $20 or more a second advice is sent. For larger balances the bank makes considerable effort to trace account holders before transfer of the relevant balances in terms of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA> The Managing Director has added that the Commonwealth Banks will, subject to identification, pay all claims received for balances dealt with in terms of the Acts. In appropriate cases, an ex-gratia payment is made equivalent to Commonwealth Savings Bank deposit interest forgone.</PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of the above information it would appear that the efforts made by the banks to trace owners of unclaimed moneys are reasonable and appropriate.</PARA>

At the time the book was published, however, there would have been internal departmental reports on tax avoidance activities and reports to Government such as the tax minimisation and tax haven report referred to by the then Treasurer, in his answer to a question from Mr Whitlam (Hansard, 9 December 1971, page 4387). It is not envisaged that such reports would now be published or otherwise made available; internal reports of the Taxation Office contain information covered by the secrecy provisions in the taxation laws.</PARA>
<PARA> Some information of the kind referred to in Item Nos 46, 74 and 75, but relating to income years subsequent to the publication of Mr Spigelman's book, has been released. Statistics as to the application of section 136 (or comparable articles in double tax agreements) during the year ended 30 June 1980 were given by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, representing me in the Senate, in reply to a question from Senator Watson (Hansard, 11 March 1981, page 488). General statements on tax avoidance and legislative measures against specific schemes have been published in the Annual Reports of the Commissioner of Taxation for the years 1978-79 and 1979-80. Estimates of revenue shortfalls due to tax avoidance for the years ended 30 June 1979 and 1980 have been published in the Budget papers. Further information on this matter was given in my replies to Question Nos 915 and 916 (Hansard, 26 May 1981, pages 2587-2588). Figures on the various kinds of tax avoidance arrangements implemented in the years 1975-76, 1976-77 and 1977-78 were provided to the House of Representatives Estimates Committee B in 1979 and appear in the Supplementary Information appended to the Hansard, Report for the Committees A and B (pages 558-559).</PARA>
<PARA> No. 47; This item was the subject of a question upon notice to the Treasurer in 1975 (Hansard, 3 September 1975, page 1002). The then Treasurer noted that Indexed Item 47 in Mr Spigelman's book referred to an article in the Bulletin of 8 March 1969. That article stated that the Treasury had prepared two 'economic papers' (on foreign takeovers), one of which was said to be a study of 100 foreign takeovers and their significance. No such paper (nor any similar paper) was prepared by the Treasury prior to 8 March 1969. As the other 'economic paper' was not specifically identified, no comment could be made on it.</PARA>
<PARA> No. 69; I am unaware of any document with this (or any like) title purporting to be a comprehensive account of the practice of discretionary powers of the Life Insurance Commissioner. In view of the secrecy provisions of section 57 of the Act, and the need to preserve confidentiality so as to ensure there is no restriction in the flow of information to the Commissioner, it is not the practice to publish full details relating to most of the discretionary powers exercised under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to Item No. 69, however, the Life Insurance Commissioner publishes the names of companies which have been granted registration under the Life Insurance Act 1945 in his Annual Reports to Parliament. It might also be noted that the more significant decisions under the Act are subject to appeals provisions. Under these provisions, the person affected by the decision who has requested the Commissioner to reconsider the matter is entitled to be informed by the Commissioner of the reasons for his decision.</PARA>
<PARA> No. 84; The Australian Industry Development Corporation has advised that there does not exist, nor has there ever existed, a document entitled 'Independent Consultant's Report on the Australian Industry Development Corporation' nor any document which could properly be so described.</PARA>
<PARA> It seems probable that Item No. 84 listed in Mr Spigelman's book refers to the response to certain inquiries which were made some years before the Australian Industry Development Corporation was formed, to assist in identifying potential sources of funds for the Corporation as then proposed. If so, the document in question is a record of private and confidential conversations held with members of the Australian financial community, including representatives of overseas banks, to obtain their views and advice. This document has not been published as to do so would involve the disclosure of commercially significant information provided to the Government in confidence.</PARA>

<PARA> Notes:-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) NAAS payments, unlike CRAFT rebates were subject to taxation in the hands of the recipient employer company. For this reason the net cost to the government of NAAS is considerably less than the expenditure shown in the table above.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The calculation of real values depends on the many price deflators used. Different deflators may be preferred but all should be used with caution. The deflator chosen in this case was based on average award wages published in Australian Bureau of Statistics Catalogue 6312.0 'Wage Rates December 1980' for 1980-81, and in the Reserve Bank Statistical Bulletin before 1980-81. This deflation was chosen due to the fact that both NAAS and CRAFT payments to employers were or are subject to annual adjustment to compensate for wage movements. The indexes calculated were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Year</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Under both CRAFT and NAAS an employer may be eligible for one or more rebates or subsidies for an apprentice. Information on the number of rebates or subsidies per apprentice paid to an employer is not available. Thus, it is not possible to calculate for either scheme the total aggregate subsidy per apprentice during the lifetime of the apprenticeship.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised by the Special Broadcasting Service, as the authority responsible for ethnic radio stations 2EA and 3EA that its guidelines for broadcasters and co-ordinators, which have been operative for the past two and one half years, are quite specific in relation to both community announcements and commercial messages, namely-</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Advertising</PARA>
<PARA> 4.1 Radio 2EA/3EA is a station operated by SBS and funded by government. It is precluded from broadcasting commercial messages. All acknowledgements must be approved by station management before going to air.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Anouncements</PARA>
<PARA> 5.1 Announcements of forthcoming functions to be held by community organisations (non-profit bodies) may be mentioned once only in each program and in no more than three programs. The announcements should be concise giving basic details-for example 'The German Welfare League will be holding a dance at the Parramatta Town Hall on Friday, 25 April. The dance begins at 8 pm and tickets are for sale at the door at $4.50 each.'</PARA>
<PARA> In conveying useful information to ethnic communities, the SBS does not wish to place itself in a competitive situation with private enterprise, including the foreign language press, that may draw legitimate sources of advertising revenue from some community organisations operating as trading entities. For example: registered clubs limited by guarantee, movie houses, etc.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the SBS believes that ethnic radio language programs should carry all information that is of genuine community interest and which is a service to communities. The SBS considers ethnic radio should reinforce public awareness of all community functions and entertainments of general interest.</PARA>
<PARA> The SBS will undertake not to accept for broadcast, announcements about functions, concerts, registered club activities or movie theatre programs if adequate proof is submitted to the SBS by media outlets that announcements on SBS stations are resulting in a regular loss of revenue to the companies concerned. In this respect the onus will be on the publishing organisations concerned to advise the SBS of any changes in their trading arrangements with specific clients that may appear to be taking advantage of free promotion on ethnic radio.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) There were special circumstances which prevented the annual reports of Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett being presented earlier to Parliament. In the first place, Parliament rose early in September to prepare for the elections. Secondly, other urgent Government business took precedence over the tabling of these reports in the two-week Parliamentary session in December. As a result, both reports were held over until the Autumn sitting of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The financial information presented to Parliament relating to the operation of air services by Ansett Transport Industries Limited complies with Section 11 of the Airlines Agreement Act 1972.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes. Section 40 of the Australian National Airlines Act 1945-1973 requires TAA to furnish additional information pertaining to their financial status, other than the normal financial statements.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No. Ansett Airlines, as part of Ansett Transport Industries Limited, operates as a private company and as such, conforms with the requirements of the appropriate companies act. There is no guarantee provided in any Commonwealth legislation ensuring Ansett's profits.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) and (7) As indicated in the Minister's second reading speech when presenting the Airlines Agreement Bill 1981 substantially increased reporting obligations have been placed on the airlines by this agreement. Clauses 7, 13 and 23 particularly refer. Annual reports must be made on the use of the consultation arrangements, each airline's trunk route and total airline's financial performance and on the operation of the agreement.

<PARA> (1) and (2) The terms of purchase of the Fawnmac group of pharmaceutical manufacturing companies were established in July 1974 under an option arrangement negotiated by the Australian Industry Development Corporation. The option to purchase the Fawnmac group was exercised by the Government in July 1975 for an amount of $8,735,595. The purchase price was determined having regard to the earning capacity of the Fawnmac Group rather than on the value of its tangible assets and was influenced by an improvement in profitability of the group during the 1974-75 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The present Government sold the Fawnmac group of companies as it did not believe it should be in the field of private enterprise.

<PARA> Because quota issued in most categories under the current arrangements is for a six month period but has a validity of 12 months it is not possible to meaningfully relate the quantity transferred to a particular period ceiling. Another complicating factor is that some of the goods listed in the answer to the first part of the question have been subject to control for less than 12 months. For these reasons no meaningful proportion figure can be provided.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) and (2) The Parliament recently passed legislation to repeal the Australian National Airlines Act and transfer TAA's operations to a public company. Provisions included the transfer of all staff on the same terms and conditions on which they were employed by the Commission. All the shares in the new company will initially be held by the Government. The Government has also decided to commission private consultants to examine the practicality of selling some or all of the shares in TAA, including how this might be done in light of the Government's domestic aviation policies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Commission's Victorian regional office has received submissions from two consumers on the operations of arbitration clauses in the home building field. The Commission also received an application from the Master Builders Association of Victoria seeking authorisation, in relation to the restrictive trade practices provisions of the Trade Practices Act, for standard form documents (Housing Contracts) which included an arbitration clause. Authorisation was granted to the Association on 10 January 1979 to prepare and publish a number of standard forms.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Whether the arbitration clauses in question negate sections 68 to 74 of the Trade Practices Act is a complex question of law. The resolution of that question in particular cases is a matter on which private legal advice would need to be taken by those affected. However, I am not aware of any case in which a court has held that the operation of sections 68 to 74 is affected by contractual arbitration clauses, and the Trade Practices Commission is taking no action in relation to the arbitration clause in question. I understand that the Victorian Housing Builder's Liability Act is administered by the Victorian Department of Local Government and that consumer complaints are handled by the Victorian Ministry of Consumer Affairs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) My predecessor's letter of 23 July 1980 referred to by the honourable senator advised that installation of the Coen and Laura television stations was expected to be completed by the end of June 1981, with regular transmissions commencing several weeks later. However, since that advice was provided completion has been delayed by difficulties with the provision of program bearers to both stations. The Laura station has also had additional difficulties with the acquisition of a suitable site and provision of the power supply. It is now anticipated that the Coen station will officially open in October and Laura in November of this year.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Although the Government is committed to the provision of adequate national broadcasting and television services throughout Australia as soon as possible, the limited availability of resources requires progressive attainment of this objective.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The main points made to the deputation by the general Manager of the Australian Broadcasting Commission were that: (a) he had not spoken to Mr David Barnett at any time during the election campaign; (b) the Commission did not consider that confirmation of the presentation of a balance of views during an election campaign was solely dependent upon a mathematical calculation of time, or on the number of lines of copy in News bulletins. Such a calculation was a useful guide, but no more than that; (c) it was not the Commission's policy to expect complete balance in the amount of time on air given to the Government and the Opposition in any one program series: all programs or News bulletins had to be considered. As an example of the problems created by regarding time on air in any one program series, as the only measurement of balance, it was mentioned that although the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition had each been offered 80 minutes of time on a special phone-in program, the Prime Minister has chosen to take his full 80 minutes while the Leader of the Opposition has used only 53 minutes, although 80 minutes was also available to him; (d) Mr Howard's appearance on Nationwide, on 15 October, had been discusssed by the General Manager with the Chairman and only other Commissioner available and it was considered that the last program of Nationwide, before the election black-out, should include an interview with a representative of the Government as well as the Opposition, in other States New South Wales, and Australian Capital Territory and Western Australia-where the previous night's Nationwide had carried an interview with Mr Hawke following the interview with the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>

<PARA> In order to benefit from the disadvantaged persons provisions of the revised health insurance arrangements to come into effect on 1 September 1981, a person must be accepted as a disadvantaged person in his or her own right, or be a dependent of a disadvantaged person. As members of religious orders would not ordinarily meet the definition of dependant in the Health Insurance Act they need to qualify as individuals. Acceptance as a disadvantaged person is dependent on a person passing an income test. It is my understanding that members of religious orders do not usually have significant personal incomes; in fact, they commonly take a vow of poverty. therefore they will normally qualify as disadvantaged persons, provided they are Australian residents.</PARA>

The Australian Electoral Office has emphasised that electoral work should always take precedence over any census work.

<PARA> The Minister for Industry and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> My attention has been drawn to an article entitled 'Nomad Stalled on US Markets' which appeared in the Financial Australian on 8 January 1981, and which would seem to be the reference used by the honourable senator. The article referred to the success of Nomad aircraft sales in the United States of America, and then went on to suggest that Nomad faced production irregularities because of what it called 'Australian government delays in authorising further production'. The article then asserted that the wait for authorisation had 'put a stop to forward ordering of materials and components'.</PARA>
<PARA> It is my understanding that the honourable senator's question refers to the period of 18 months (also referred to in the article) between approval for purchase of long lead time materials and components and the authorisation in December last, of production of the latest batch of aircraft to a total of 200.</PARA>
<PARA> The period of 18 months has no significance in relation to future production schedules. The current schedule is expected to occupy resources of the Government Aircraft Factories (GAF) until 1984. Concurrently customer demand is being monitored, and the future requirement assessed. If it should appear after consideration of all the factors involved, including the market position, that a further batch of aircraft should be manufactured, I would expect a proposal to be developed by GAF for advance purchase of the necessary long lead time items. The interval between that proposal and consideration of further production would be a matter for judgment based on all the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator can be assured that the Government will give prompt attention to any proposals put to it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 March 1981, (Hansard, page 782) Senator Lajovic asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications. Has the Minister noted an item in today's Sydney Morning Herald reporting that a Soviet satellite in orbit over Australia is being blamed for radio interference on radar screens at Sydney airport for the past few weeks? According to the report the signals block out part of the radar screens. Whilst they are not a danger to air traffic movements they are annoying to air traffic controllers who are subjected to intense pressure during peak hours. Will the Minister institute an inquiry into the possible effects of such interference if it becomes intensified and in particular into the fact that the satellite radio system, according to Transport Australia technicians, is being switched off and on, most likely from the ground?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Interference at Sydney Airport radar which was identified as originating from an orbiting satellite was first reported early in June 1980. The interference which was annoying to air traffic operators weakened during the following month and ceased on about 5 July 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> Recently, attempts were made by the Department of Transport and the Department of Communications to identify further interference. The interference is not continuous, occurring when a polar orbiting satellite passes over Eastern Australia. The period of one complete earth orbit is about 100 minutes. Interference from the satellite may occur several times during one 24 hour period.</PARA>
<PARA> The recent interference may not be from the satellite which caused the interference during June 1980. The frequency band involved 1275 MHz is allocated primarily for radar systems of the type employed at airports. Up until 1 January 1982, the International Radio Regulations of the International Telecommunications Union makes no provision for satellite operations in this band.</PARA>
<PARA> A satellite having the same period of rotation as that observed in association with the interference was launched by the USSR on 20 May 1980 as a navigation satellite. The interference is consistent with the characteristics of a telemetry signal that would be expected to be used with a satellite of that type.</PARA>
<PARA> From 1 January 1982, the Radio Regulations provide for the operation of a radio navigation satellite in the frequency band immediately below the band in which the interference is being experienced. The service would have to operate on a non-interference basis to radar services.</PARA>
<PARA> The interference has not been identified beyond doubt as Russian. If it continues and if it is positively identified, Australia will discuss this with Russia.</PARA>

<PARA> I direct a question to either the Minister representing the Minister for Communications or the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I refer to the action of the Special Broadcasting Service in consigning Mr Bosi, the Italian co-ordinator, to the sin bin for a week. I wonder whether it would be possible to have the whole of the transcript tabled in the Senate so that we could evaluate this apparent demarcation dispute between co-ordinators and the Australian Journalists' Association.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Special Broadcasting Service has advised that it terminated Mr Bosi's services on 5 May following a series of long-standing differences with him on policy and operational issues. The sequence of recent events which led to Mr Bosi's suspension and subsequently to his dismissal is, briefly, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bosi, in his role as Co-ordinator of the Italian language program, suppressed a news item which had been prominently featured in other news media.</PARA>
<PARA> The SBS considered that Mr Bosi's action was a breach of SBS policy and program guidelines and he was suspended after an investigation by a Management Committee of Inquiry which found that there were no grounds for further appeal.</PARA>
<PARA> The SBS Board subsequently resolved to censure Mr Bosi but lift the suspension if he provided a written undertaking to comply with SBS policy. Mr Bosi did so.</PARA>
<PARA> The SBS considered the matter closed, but Mr Bosi then published letters in Italian language newspapers-Il Globo, La Fiamma, Tutto Press Sport, Settegiorni-making serious and unfounded charges against the SBS Board, management and personnel.</PARA>
<PARA> The SBS denied these charges and called upon him in a letter from their solicitors to apologise and retract within seven days.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bosi did not comply and the SBS agreed to terminate his services, informing him of their decision by letter on 5 May.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 28 April 1981 (Hansard, page 1382) Senator Watson asked me a question, without notice, concerning the possible use of the two Royal Australian Air Force VIP B707 aircraft and whether consideration was being given to allowing the international carriers of our near neighbours such as Air Niugini and Air Nauru to service the domestic routes to alleviate the plight of stranded passengers, particularly those in Tasmania, during the flight attendants' dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The use of the B707 aircraft of the VIP fleet was not considered a feasible option in assisting with the movement of stranded passengers during the dispute. The Government's decision to allow Qantas Airways Ltd and other international carriers to uplift domestic passengers on their normal scheduled domestic sectors facilitated the carriage of passengers experiencing hardship between those ports that the B707 aircraft could service. You would be aware, of course, that an aircraft the size of a B707 is restricted to airports of appropriate standard. These airports are, in the main, those serviced by international operators.</PARA>
<PARA> In order to relieve the plight of passengers in outlying regions of Australia the Government gave approval, in principle, for the RAAF to provide services to assist people who were in urgent need to travel for medical, compassionate or other special circumstances, or stranded as a result of the continuation of the strike.</PARA>
<PARA> To facilitate this, appropriate arrangements were made with the Queensland and Northern Territory governments. It was also decided to extend RAAF operations to Tasmania and Western Australia if the need arose. However, the provision of daily return services to Tasmania by both Trans- Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia and the timely settlement of the dispute avoided the necessity to adopt these measures.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided me with the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Approval, in principle, for the RAAF to provide services to people living in outlying regions of Australia was given by the Government during the recent dispute by flight attendants. The RAAF services would have been used to assist people in outlying areas who were in urgent need to travel for medical, compassionate or other special circumstances. RAAF services would also be available to people who had been stranded in outlying areas as a result of the continuation of the strike.</PARA>
<PARA> To facilitate this, appropriate arrangements were made with the Queensland and Northern Territory governments. It was also decided to extend RAAF operations to Tasmania and Western Australia if the need arose. The provision of daily return services to Tasmania by both Trans Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia and the timely settlement of the dispute avoided the necessity to adopt these measures.</PARA>
<PARA> The use of the RAAF in future disputes will be a matter for consideration by the Government in regard to the circumstances existing at the time.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government also requested international airlines serving Australia to consider carrying domestic passengers during the dispute. This request was made when it was found that the effects of the dispute were widespread and was considered necessary in the national interest to relieve the hardship of the many stranded passengers around Australia. International carriers, including Qantas Airways Ltd, were asked to give potential passengers the following priorities:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the carriage of domestic passengers for compassionate reasons, the carriage of Federal Members of Parliament and other VIP's;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the facilitation of international travel by carrying international passengers on domestic journeys to or from connecting international flights;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) domestic passengers enduring hardship such as those stranded away from home and having other compelling reasons to travel;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the carriage of other domestic passengers.</PARA>
<PARA> Such carriage only applied to those routes served by international carriers in normal scheduled services. International carriers could only carry domestic passengers holding tickets issued by TAA or Ansett and could not issue tickets direct to domestic passengers.</PARA>

<PARA> I am advised by Telecom Australia that it is aware that there are a number of people who resent this particular form of selling. At the same time, it cannot ignore the fact that the continued operation of these organisations is indicative of another section of the community accepting it as being a legitimate form of selling. Telecom has had discussions with the Australian Direct Marketing Association on the matter and, to date, has received no evidence of unethical sales practices being followed by telephone selling organisations. I appreciate Telecom's view that it is not appropriate for it to be involved in trying to prevent this form of selling bearing in mind that a sizeable section of the community could resent a public authority regulating the manner in which telephone services may be used.</PARA>

<PARA> As already announced, the Government has decided that, with effect from 1 July 1981, Commonwealth funding in respect of services previously funded under the Community Health Program (including women's refuges) will be provided by way of an increase in each State's general revenue grant instead of by way of specific purpose grants as at present.

<PARA> It will be a matter for each State to determine how the increased general revenue funds are used. The Commonwealth will not be issuing guidelines on this matter.

<PARA> I refer to an interview reported in the West Australian of Wednesday, 6 May, by Allan Veal with Sir Philip Baxter, one of the founders of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission set up by the Menzies Government in 1953. In that interview Sir Philip is reported to have said:</PARA>
<PARA> 'We need to develop our armed forces and our systems of defence using the most scientific methods that are available-nuclear weapons, chemical and bacteriological warfare.'</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction, ratified by Australia on 5 October 1977, will the Minister clarify the Government's position on this important matter? As Sir Philip Baxter is a person of some note in our community and is even held in high regard by some, will the Minister consider making a public response to his statements to assuage the fears of a large section of the Australian community that we may indeed be committing this country to the future use of such abominations?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Australian policy towards the use of chemical and bacteriological weapons is indicated by its adherence to the 1925 Geneva Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare and by its adherence to the convention to which you referred in your question. Australia ratified the latter convention on 5 October 1977 and Parliament passed the Crimes (Biological Weapons) Act in the same year.</PARA>
<PARA> No research into the production of chemical and bacteriological weapons is being undertaken, nor is any contemplated.</PARA>
