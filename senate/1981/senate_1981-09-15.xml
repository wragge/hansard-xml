<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 14 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. That the Budget imposition of additional sales tax to both existing sales taxed items and to previously exempt goods</PARA>
<PARA> (a) will add to the regressivity of the tax structure by imposing a similar burden on all sections of the community-regardless of the capacity to pay tax;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) will be highly inflationary and a disincentive to economic performance in key sectors of manufacturing industry, e.g. car manufacturing; textiles and footwear; boat-building;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) is yet another breach of Government promise, given the Treasurer's undertaking in the Parliament on March 12 of this year that there would be no increases in indirect taxation (without at the same time giving personal tax relief).</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senate will request the Government to repeal the budget amendments to sales tax legislation and to withdraw its sales tax amendment bills which add sales tax to presently exempt goods as from January 1, 1982.</PARA>

<PARA> We of the staff of the CSIRO Divisions of Oceanography and Fisheries Research do protest at the huge salary increases that Federal parliamentarians have awarded themselves. By way of contrast CSIRO scientists have recently been awarded a 5.6 per cent work value increase above the normal wage indexation increases whereas back bench Federal parliamentarians received a massive 12 per cent work value increase on top of the indexation award.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry to discussions last week about the proposed terms of reference for the royal commission into export meat substitution.

Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the comments of the Victorian Minister of Agriculture who has said that the Government's terms of reference are unacceptably narrow because they cover only handlers of meat for export and do not give proper access to relevant documents and other material?</PARA></TALK.START>

Firstly, is it correct that the Australian Capital Territory ordinance relating to the registration of births and deaths does not concern itself with the birth or death of children of less than 20 weeks gestation or weighing less than 400 grams? Secondly, is it correct that children of less than 20 weeks gestation are capable of being born alive? If delivered alive, is there any legal obligation placed on medical staff in the Australian Capital Territory to attempt to maintain and save the lives of such children? Thirdly, does the Australian Capital Territory have any ordinance similar in purpose and effect to the Infant Life Preservation Act of the United Kingdom? Finally, does the Australian Capital Territory Transplantation and Anatomy Ordinance 1978 exclude from its control human ova, human embryos, human foetuses and tissue or organs obtained from them? Is there any Australian Capital Territory ordinance or law which exercises control over such material?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs to articles in today's Australian and Sydney Daily Telegraph in which Mr Howard is reported as having agreed to submit to Cabinet proposals which will effectively revive the Community Youth Support Scheme. Is the Minister aware that this is in direct contrast to a statement by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, Mr Brown, as reported in the Adelaide Advertiser of 11 September, that the Federal Government will not change its decision to terminate CYSS from 31 October? Can the Minister explain this apparent dissension within Cabinet? Can she tell the Senate whether CYSS will be retained in some form after 31 October?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="721" SPEAKER="Guilfoyle Sen The Hon Dame M.G.C." NAMEID="6D7" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; A number of reports have been in circulation in the media with regard to CYSS. I have not read in detail the two reports mentioned, but I am aware of them. The fact is that the decision to terminate the CYSS program is a Budget decision. As has been said by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, it will not be reversed. It is also a fact that the Minister has made it very plain that, although there were some CYSS projects which served a useful purpose, it is in the best interests of all young unemployed people to be encouraged to use the skills, training and work experience programs which the Government has established and which have been greatly expanded in this year's Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister has also said that departmental officers are visiting CYSS projects to explain to project officers and participants the details of the Commonwealth's training and work experience programs for the young. I recall mentioning those matters in answers to questions last week. These visits are well advanced and it is the Minister's intention, when he receives a full report on those visits, to report back to Cabinet. That is expected to occur in the next week or two. If it does emerge from these reports that some young people are unable to use the Government's skills, training and work experience programs, whether because of geographic location and the fact that they have no access to a suitable program or because of personal unsuitability to the present programs, the Government will be looking very closely at the need for any different or new forms of assistance or a special program action that might emerge from that report. We are certainly not going to turn our backs on those young unemployed people who cannot take part in the programs which were outlined and expanded in the Budget. The Government has always had a great deal of care and concern for the young unemployed. For that reason, it will be looking very closely indeed at any new programs of assistance that are required to assist young unemployed people.</PARA>
<PARA> After the Government considers the Minister's report in the next week or two, an announcement will be made if there is any new or further action that the Government feels is necessary. I understand that the Treasurer met with people from his electorate and discussed with them the termination of the CYSS program. I understand that he undertook to look carefully at any submissions that his constituents wished to make and to have them considered. There is no conflict between what the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs has said about considering the magnitude of the problem of those who are not able to find access to suitable programs and the statement by the Treasurer that he would give consideration to matters that were put before him by those who were either conducting CYSS projects in his electorate or interested in them. As I have said, within the next week or two the Government will be aware of what gaps still exist and whether some modification of other programs may be necessary to accommodate those who do not find access to suitable programs.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Attorney-General to an Age report of 14 September 1981 which claims that a branch head in the Department of Science and Technology is believed to have ordered the shredding of departmental papers in an attempt to sabotage the effectiveness of the forthcoming freedom of information legislation. Given the publicly stated policy of the Government that Ministers and officials should make as much information as possible available to the public, I ask: Firstly, is it correct that such an officer has ordered the destruction of documents known as branch whites so as to make it possible to avoid requests for information under the proposed legislation? Secondly, if so, who is the officer referred to in the article? Thirdly, what action will be taken by the Government to ensure that its commitment to make as much information as possible available to the public under the freedom of information legislation is adhered to by all Ministers and government officials?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the only part of the question I can properly answer is the third part. The other parts of the question really should be directed to the responsible Minister. I undertake to refer those parts of the question to him. As to the last part of the question, of course the Government has been at pains to make a number of statements about access to information generally, apart altogether from the freedom of information legislation. Officers of my Department have been engaged for a long time now in what I suppose are training exercises with officers in other departments in respect of their responsibilities under the Freedom of Information Act. My Department will have the responsibility of carrying on that program. Indeed, in many ways my Department will have to provide continual information and advice as to whether documents should be made available and so on. Therefore, in view of the interest and widespread concern that I know exist in the Senate about making the Freedom of Information Act work effectively, I will obtain a more detailed account of what has in fact been done. I will table that information in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my question to the Minister for Finance by saying that in the recent sales tax increases the Kit Kat biscuit produced by Rowntree Hoadley Ltd was redefined as confectionery. This product has previously been exempt as a wafer biscuit but is now subject to a 17 1/2 per cent sales tax. Is the Minister aware of the burden imposed on Rowntree Hoadley by broadening the sales tax? Is the Government concerned at the probable sacking of 50 to 75 employees by that firm? Can the Minister guarantee that there will be a re-examination of the interpretation of the Kit Kat as this product is defined as a biscuit in every other country in which it is produced? Finally, as the Australian Customs Tariff defines Kit Kat as a biscuit, does the Government intend to deal with this anomaly?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I saw the note from the Rowntree company which I assume is the basis of the question that has come forward on this matter of sales tax. The list was changed to remove anomalies between those things that are classed as confectionery and those that might be classed as food. I did see the statement as to the possible sacking of numbers of people in the Rowntree company. I certainly hope that the company will be able to find alternative products on which the skills of the people concerned will be able to be used. I will ask the Treasurer to have a look at the matter of tariff that has been mentioned in the question. I will see that the appropriate Minister makes some comment. The change was made in the present Budget in order to remove another anomaly that existed. No proposal is under consideration that would change what now exists in the present sales tax proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw to the attention of the Minister for National Development and Energy an article which appeared on the front page of yesterday's Australian Financial Review and which quoted from a report produced by the Tokyo headquarters of the Bank of America which suggested that Australia had a pressing need to adopt a national energy plan. The report stated, among other things, that Australia's energy pricing was inconsistent and that our adoption of import parity pricing for oil would lead only to a misallocation of resources unless corrected.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would have been wise to have read them and to have realised their accuracy. Anyone who had read speeches given by members of the Australian Labor Party, particularly before the last elections, would today realise just what a total failure their predictions had been. The fact is that the Bank of America has said that Australia has a very strong future in the energy field. The Government agrees with that. The world is hungry for what we have. I saw in the Australian Financial Review a comment regarding import parity pricing which was quite incapable of interpretation in the context in which it was made there. Import parity pricing is acknowledged by the International Energy Agency, of which 21 nations of the free world are members, as being absolutely fundamental to any efficient energy policy in any country. Indeed, the IEA in its reports has commended Australia upon its import parity pricing policy. As the report is somewhat impossible to interpret from the Press accounts, I will study the full document and, as soon as I can within the next day or so, I will add further comment to this answer.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Health whether he is aware of certain anomalies in the present health insurance scheme whereby some individuals are in the position of qualifying for neither free health care under the disadvantaged persons scheme, because their incomes are slightly above the limit, nor the 32c in the dollar tax rebate because their incomes are not defined as taxable. Is the Minister aware that this situation is applicable to many female pensioners who are in receipt of small amounts of maintenance, to blind pensioners who have a small amount of extra income, and to those whose tax rebates are less than the full amount refundable for health insurance purposes? Does the Minister not consider it inequitable that some individuals who are forced to take out private health insurance cannot claim a full rebate, or in some cases any rebate at all, while those on higher incomes and paying the same amount in health insurance costs are able to claim the full rebate for basic health insurance payments? If the Minister does agree that the anomalies exist and that the situation is inequitable, will he take any steps, such as introducing a sliding scale scheme, to correct the situation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Watson has asked me to comment on policy decisions. Of course, I cannot forecast or comment on policy decisions until they are made and are free for announcement. One would need to look at the whole speech of the Deputy Prime Minister. It is true that there was a domination of the balance of payments by investment inflow in the past 12 months. Of course, one of the reasons for this was that the drought had affected seriously the export of primary products. There needs to be an analysis of the whole basis of what we are doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator should keep in mind that the capital investment inflow itself will be used for export producing industries. Fundamentally, most of this inflow is for capital equipment and development of energy resource industries which, upon their attaining production, will be earning very much more money for Australia. So one must examine the total trends to see where we are going. By and large, Australia in recent years has held a very healthy situation. Of course, this continent is always prone to being affected by climatic change-we experienced drought in the last year-nevertheless we have managed to reach a more sound position now. I will draw the suggestions made by Senator Watson to the attention of the relevant Ministers, including the Treasurer and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</PARA>

I did see a report of a statement by the Honourable Neil Brown which picked up the fact that the CYSS projects have not merely dealt with the question of moving into employment but also apparently picked up some social welfare activity in the course of their development. Certainly, in one report I saw, Mr Brown made reference to the fact that there was a social welfare aspect. I have in fact had a number of discussions with the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs about CYSS projects. The general position is as outlined by the Minister for Finance in answer to a question earlier in Question Time and those conversations I referred to are, of course, compatible with that position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, we have discussed the question of the welfare aspects of some CYSS projects.

My Department principally is a department which provides income maintenance to a very large section of the Australian population. It does have some subsidy programs which provide assistance to the aged, the disabled, the handicapped and so on. But the general provision of welfare services to meet social problems is within the conduct of State welfare departments. There are no programs in my Department that I would understand as being available to carry out that sort of direct welfare activity. It may be thought that the Youth Services Scheme, which is a project funded by my Department jointly with State governments, might be relevant; but that scheme is specifically directed to the provision of accommodation for youth rather than the provision of general welfare services of the sort that I think was raised by the honourable senator in his question.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that when the Daily Telegraph claims that national superannuation proposals deserve serious study most people find it difficult to disagree with that broad proposition. Interest in the community with respect to income maintenance is very high because, of course, the bulk of Australians of pensionable age look to the Government for income support; so it is not surprising that there would be broad agreement with the idea that national superannuation schemes should be seriously considered. In fact, the Government has looked very carefully at the recommendations put forward by the Hancock National Superannuation Committee of Inquiry. The Treasurer announced on 12 July 1979 that the Government had decided not to proceed with the scheme recommended by that Committee. Its reasons were indicated at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In common with any scheme involving increased payment to retired people, the scheme would involve the payment of a contribution-in the case of the Hancock scheme it would involve a compulsory contribution-which in terms of those people working in the community would be exactly the same as an additional income tax. The contribution required would be quite a heavy burden. Indeed, under the proposal the minimum wage earner would have had to pay an increase of about 20 per cent in tax. The Government decided that, in light of the additional impost that would be required, it would not proceed with the proposals put forward in that report.</PARA>
<PARA> At that time, however, the Treasurer indicated also that a task force would be established to examine occupational superannuation arrangements. Work has been proceeding on that. The work of the task force has revealed significant weaknesses in the occupational superannuation arrangements which apply in Australia. By that I am referring to the private superannuation arrangements which apply. The Government is continuing its examination of this area. I think it is important that we have schemes which encourage private provision for retirement, which is what the superannuation schemes do. At the same time we have a situation in which the taxpayer supports those schemes quite heavily and then, in many cases, is called upon to provide additional income support through the pension system. I think this is an area which warrants close and careful examination by the Government to ensure that we have the best possible scheme for Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The generalised complaints made by the honourable senator in his question are not easy to answer because they lack specificity and cannot really be checked. On the job training is provided for counter officers. It is acknowledged that the role of the counter officer is extremely important and a good deal of work has gone into devising appropriate training schemes for officers employed in those positions. I should mention also that a great deal of effort has gone into trying to devise office designs and layouts which will ensure a good opportunity for clients of my Department to have the right sort of environment for communication with my officers. The Frankston model which has been developed is gradually being extended around Australia. I think the provision of an appropriate working environment is very helpful to counter officers and also provides them with adequate training. When we consider the fact that something like 12,000 officers are employed in the Department of Social Security and that there are 163 regional offices which deal with in excess of a couple of million Australian families in relation to income maintenance, it is not surprising that on occasions there are complaints about particular items of service not being satisfactory.</PARA></TALK.START>

Recently there has been a series of reviews which have ensured that a much larger number of officers is available to service the public. The fact is that additional staff was provided to service the additional jobs which were undertaken by the Department following the institution of the new health service and the additional functions which we have taken on with respect to unemployment beneficiaries.

As I have said, the funding for the CYSS program will cease on 31 October as has been announced in the Budget. What has been suggested by me and by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs in earlier responses to questions is that, when the Minister receives the final report from officers of his Department on the review of CYSS throughout Australia, he will then determine what gap there is in programs that have been outlined in the Budget-the training programs and things of that kind-and also the Department of Education programs that operate in conjunction with State education systems and technical and further education. He will also look at the magnitude of the problem to see how many young people there are who are not catered for by existing programs in the Department of Education or the training programs through the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final question, I think, with regard to the use of voluntary assistance in the CYSS program is one that is perhaps a feature of this particular program and its development. Possibly that feature was not recognised when the Government introduced this program some years ago. I think the voluntary work that has been done by the groups with many of the CYSS programs has been invaluable. I hope, as I have heard, that in some communities they intend to continue with something similar to the CYSS program. As we have said earlier, the assets and other equipment that may have been developed through the CYSS program will be available for appropriate community groups to use. I think in some instances some community groups will continue, perhaps through their social workers attached to local government or in other ways. That would be determined by the communities concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as the Government is concerned, the funding for CYSS will cease on 31 October. The Minister will look at the reports that he receives to see what else may need to be done. Perhaps some of the Department of Education programs may need to be adapted further to be able to accommodate the needs of some of the young people who do not find the other training programs appropriate in their present form. That is something that I hope will be determined in the very near future.

It is my clear view that such an inquiry would not solve anything in terms of finding answers to the problems of Vietnam veterans. It is clear to me that, if a judicial inquiry were conducted in the fashion which has been outlined in the letter, the issue would come down to one having to be determined on the basis of scientific evidence.

We do not need a judicial review to tell us that certain chemicals are dangerous, or that some are poisonous. That really is not at issue here at all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Attorney-General. The Attorney will be aware of the finding by a Melbourne Coroner's Court in 1980 that Douglas and Isobel Wilson were murdered on the instructions of Terry Clark, head of the Mr Asia drug syndicate, after he had received illegally copies of tapes on the organisation given by the Wilsons to the Queensland Police. The Minister will also be aware that the Government disbanded the Federal Narcotics Bureau after a royal commission had reported adversely on its handling of the Wilson tapes. Is the Minister aware now of grave claims in the book Greed by Richard Hall published this week that Terry Clark received much more leaked information from the Federal Narcotics Bureau which led him to kill or have killed another three or even four people and to threaten the execution of at least two more? Will the Minister have these claims fully investigated by the police team assisting the current Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking and establish that none of the former Federal Narcotics Bureau people now employed by the Australian Federal Police can be linked with Clark's organisation? In particular, will the Minister ensure that directions are given to counsel assisting the Stewart Royal Commission to ensure that these allegations and others of corruption are investigated in open hearings and are not hushed up in secret sessions?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The implication in Senator Ryan's question is that these matters have not been of grave concern to the Government and officials of government for a long time. I am particularly familiar with a great deal of the information in relation to these allegations which have been made. Proceedings have taken place in a number of courts; not only in the Coroner's Court in Victoria but also in committal proceedings in a magistrate's court in New South Wales. It was as a result of a good deal of these events and, of course, particularly the trial in the United Kingdom that the Government in conjunction with the governments of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland decided to set up the Royal Commission now known as the Stewart Royal Commission, which has just commenced operations. That Commission is particularly interesting in many ways because it has been set up to assist in particular the police task force which was already in existence and which was investigating a lot of these allegations and matters raised in Senator Ryan's question. That police task force is very closely associated with the Commission and will continue to be so. I am quite satisfied that all the matters will be fully and properly investigated by this Commission and all the people who are associated with it in this very considerable investigation. As to the book to which Senator Ryan referred, I have seen a reference to it in some journal. If the author of that book has any information, I expect that the proper course for him to take would be to provide that information to the Commission or to those assisting the Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not be at all surprised if what the honourable senator has said is true. It was only this morning that I said to myself that some animals will beef about anything. I am very glad to have been asked this question because it reminds me of something quite irrelevant but something I have been wanting to talk about for ages. There is a place called Hamelin Pool which is just near Shark Bay. It is a smallish place. There is a loop of semi-enclosed water of high salinity and temperature. It is becoming an area of considerable interest to scientists. This is a sort of James Webster memorial answer. There has been a flow of visitors from the Honourable William Charles Wentworth through to distinguished American academics and various interested geologists to study a quite extraordinary form of growth which occurs at Hamelin Pool. It is a form of fungi that does not require oxygen to grow. This is of very great significance because it suggests life forms which could have been present on the planet before there was oxygen. It also suggests life forms which might exist in areas of the planetary system where there is no oxygen. This form of algae, rather than fungi, grows without oxygen and eventually turns into a spongy, rock-like substance. I think this matter is far more significant than most of those which have been raised in Question Time this afternoon, because it may tell us something about the origins of life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thank the honourable senator for reminding me of the importance of Hamelin Pool in terms of the scientific research which is going on. It is something which, as I said, has greatly excited the attention of a former member of the other place, the Honourable William Charles Wentworth. I believe we will be hearing a lot more about Hamelin Pool, if not about beef in pet food.</PARA>

Is it true that this is the second rise in general cargo rates in the past 12 months, when coastal rates rose 10 per cent, making a total increase of 26 1/2 per cent for the year?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister has provided me with some information on this matter. Firstly, a 15 per cent increase in rates is now to apply to ANL. I understand it is customary for ANL to adjust that rate once a year, and to do that in the last quarter of the year. Accordingly, although ANL is a little early in adjusting its rates this year, it would be misleading to say that it has had a total increase of 26 1/2 per cent for the year. The position is that it did increase the rate by 10 per cent last year and by 15 per cent this year. Current calculations of the schedule to which Senator Archer referred are being made to illustrate the differences, in effect, between the two concepts being discussed in relation to the calculations. The Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme schedule is revised periodically, rather than adjustments being made whenever any individual shipping or mainland interstate cargo rates vary. The increase in the shipping rate should be taken into account, as will the increases in mainland surface rates, from about May of next year. I would need to refer the question of the effects on Tasmania and on the schedule to the Minister for further clarification. I will bring down an early reply for Senator Archer.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the beginning of Question Time the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Button, asked me whether I had seen a report of comments made by Mr Austin, the State Minister of Agriculture in Victoria. Since the honourable senator asked that question somebody has sent me an extract from a newspaper which contains what are supposedly comments from Mr Austin seeking the widening of the powers of the royal commission on the meat industry. The extract from the paper says that Mr Austin wants the terms of the inquiry to include domestic as well as export meat suppliers so as to get better access to documents. In that context I draw the Senate's attention to the statement which I put down in the Senate on behalf of the Government last week which included the following words:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A Federal royal commission necessarily has powers limited to the area of Commonwealth responsibility-the export of meat. The Government therefore has invited all States to issue the royal commission with concurrent powers which would enable it to examine the meat industry in relation to human consumption and other uses domestically. The Victorian Government has already indicated its intention to take this action, so the royal commission will cover at least the handling of meat for domestic purposes in that State.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not wish to refer in further detail to the newspaper article because I have no information as to whether it is accurate or not. But I can advise the Senate that the indication which I gave last week about the Victorian Government joining the royal commission is being pursued at the moment and the sort of restrictions which might have been a matter of concern to the Leader of the Opposition ought not therefore arise in that State.</PARA>

I would like to read the attachment to the bottle. I am sorry that apparently one of my colleagues did not see fit to read it and has thus missed out on some very valuable information. The heading on the attached document is 'Mobilong Rotary Club', it gives a post box address at Murray Bridge and states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>SAMPLE OF PURITY?</PARA>
<PARA> No this is a sample of the water taken from the River Murray at Murray Bridge in July, 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> It is about 900 EC Units not 1100 EC Units-but-earlier this year reached this figure and further down stream, in the Lakes, exceeded 2000 Units. The World Health Quote 830 EC as suitable for domestic use. </PARA>
<PARA> The members of the Mobilong Rotary Club are residents of Murray Bridge, dependent on the river for domestic water and for some, their livelihood. </PARA>
<PARA> They are concerned at the sometimes poor quality of the water which is supplied to Adelaide via Reservoirs and many country areas from the Murray. </PARA>
<PARA> This water sample is a reminder that the river Murray System does have problems-many organizations know this and are working to improve the water quality. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we feel that some people require reminding that the water quality in the Lower Reaches of the Murray should be better and ask that the Sample be displayed in some suitable place for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The river is the lifeline of our State. We are concerned as should be every citizen of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Please contact your M.P. to express your concern. </PARA>
<PARA> Further Samples are avialable from the Mobilong Rotary Club for 50 cents per Sample (plus delivery). </PARA>
<PARA>That is very cheap. The document is signed by the President, H. Stephen. As the club pointed out the River Murray is the life line of our State. Its first use after entering the State is to irrigate South Australia's Riverland which produces a multitude of fresh fruits which in turn are distributed to every corner of Australia. I have seen Riverland oranges in some of the most far flung places of Australia-for example, in the Northern Territory. It is very nice to see them, particularly on many far flung settlements. Much Riverland fruit is also processed into some of the finest wines in Australia and without a doubt a great quantity of excellent quality brandy. </PARA>
<PARA> The next outlet is through the Morgan pipeline to many distribution points in the northern part of the State, in particular, the major towns of Port Pirie, Port Augusta and Whyalla in the iron triangle. The next outlet is the Mannum pipeline to supplement the water supply in the Adelaide metropolitan area. Further downstream the water is used for irrigation purposes in the Mypolonga orchard and dairy enterprises. It is again pumped from the River Murray at Murray Bridge as a further supplement to Adelaide's needs as well as supplying Murray Bridge and district with domestic and stock needs. South of Murray Bridge it is again used to irrigate the very fertile flats which produce Adelaide's metropolitan milk supply. Other towns and districts further south which depend on the Murray for their existence are Tailem Bend, Meningie, Milang and Goolwa as do many of the agricultural districts which are serviced by the Keith pipeline which originates at Tailem Bend. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the water sample which has been distributed to all honourable senators and members is not fit for drinking in its unfiltered state, after being filtered through fruit trees, dairy cows and the limited number of filtration plants in Adelaide it does provide a delightful product for all to consume. Whilst South Australia has only on one occasion not received its entitlement under the River Murray Waters Agreement, it is the water quality we are all concerned about. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Mobilong Rotary Club and in particular the Club's President, Mr Harry Stephen, on the initiative of drawing to the attention of Federal members of parliament the desperate need to upgrade the quality of our water supply in South Australia. In conclusion, I recommend to Senator Georges, my colleague, that if he would like that bottle back-he did not take kindly to my giving it to him-I will be happy to let him have it to take back to Queensland to let Queenslanders see what we in South Australia have put up with, particularly as some of that bad water originates in Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA> (2) 101 invalid pensions were cancelled on medical grounds, plus a further 4 cancellations due to non-attendance for examinations by the recipient, i.e. a total of 105 cancellations. Of those who appealed against the cancellation of pension (90), the Medical Review Team examined 64 appellants in Athens and, as a result of this examination, 3 appeals were upheld in Athens and pension restored. In a further case one of the appellants suffered a heart attack in Greece and the appeal was upheld on the basis of the new condition. This person was advised that pension would be restored on return to Australia. This person returned in September 1979 and is now deceased. The remainder of the appellants (26) returned to Australia prior to the Review Team visit to Athens in January 1979, and a number of the unsuccessful appellants also returned to Australia after January 1979. In addition some non-appellants returned to Australia and re-applied for pension.</PARA>
<PARA> There is a total of 18 persons in these latter categories whose pensions have been restored in Australia (7 of these have now returned to Greece and receive pensions in Greece), making an overall total including both Greece and Australia of 22 (but 2 of whom are since deceased).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) Under 3 months-0; (b) Between 3 and 6 months-2; (c) Between 6 months and a year-8; (d) Over the year-12.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The determination of eligibility for invalid pension under the Social Services Act is the responsibility of the Director-General of Social Services. While Commonwealth Medical Officers and Medical Practitioners in the Department of Health report facts and opinions of a medical nature to assist in the determination of eligibility they do not formally exercise powers under the Act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) For the purpose of calculating the Australian pensions of people who also receive British national insurance pensions a notional exchange rate is used by the Department of Social Security to determine the dollar value of the pound sterling. Since the beginning of 1981, the notional exchange rate has been fixed having regard to the Commonwealth Trading Bank on-demand air mail buying rate (the CTB rate), which is available to individuals seeking to cash sterling drafts. The CTB rate is monitored daily and the general aim has been to adjust Australian pensions when the CTB rate varied by 5 cents or more per one pound sterling from the notional rate and appeared stabilized. Primarily because of the continuous and substantial decline in the value of sterling and the necessary lead-time to effect changes, it has not been possible at all times to keep the notional exchange rate in line with the CTB rate.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It would be inappropriate at this stage to anticipate a value which the Government would wish to place on the Belconnen Mall complex. Whilst estimates have been made, I would wish to seek further advice on this matter as part of the sale process.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) Time of completion of the sale will be assessed in the light of market conditions.</PARA>

<PARA> The Government acknowledges that, at the present time, there are no qualified Aboriginal medical practitioners and insufficient numbers of Aboriginal people qualified for other professional and para-professional roles.

<PARA> I have already talked to some State Ministers and will be talking to others about expanded Aboriginal involvement at all levels of health care delivery.

Continued Commonwealth support will depend on the attainment of specific goals.</PARA>
<PARA> Special attention is being given to the training of Aboriginals in tertitary level courses. I have commenced discussions with professional medical associations and tertiary institutions to explore ways of facilitating Aboriginal entry into relevant courses.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No white managers of stores in Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory have been charged by the Police over misappropriation of funds within the last three years.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Responsibility for debts accumulated by stores rests with whichever incorporated group has responsibility for the operation of the store. This may be the community as an incorporated group or another Aboriginal organisation specifically set up for trading purposes. Short term credit difficulties have occurred, but with the assistance of the Aboriginal Development Commission and the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account, most stores have been able to overcome their difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The appointment of store managers is the responsibility of the particular incorporations managing the stores. When the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account or the Aboriginal Development Commission has provided assistance, those bodies may be involved in the selection and my Department has, on occasions, been called upon to provide advice on the selection of managers.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Aboriginal Development Commission and the Arnhem Land Progress Association are both examining ways to ensure competent management of stores. The measures include training schemes, advisory services, and help in selection of staff, as well as directly managing the stores under contract to the community. In addition, following representations by Senator Kilgariff expressing concern about the operation of stores in the Katherine area, my Department and the Aboriginal Development Commission have co-jointly funded the establishment of an Aboriginal Retail Advisory Service.</PARA>
<PARA> The Service provides expert guidance to communities in the selection of store managers; it provides a means whereby additional training can be provided for Aboriginals, and it allows the effective monitoring of the financial performance of participating stores. It it also able to provide competent managerial relief in emergencies.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Because stores are community enterprises and have not been supported by grants from my Department, the role of Departmental officers is only advisory and generally it is now Aboriginal Development Commission officers rather than Departmental officers who will provide advice about the appointment of store managers.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The primary difference between the pensioner health benefits card and that issued to an eligible sickness beneficiary is the period of validity of the card. The pensioner health benefits card is valid from the date of effect which is printed on the card to the end of the calendar year unless there is a change of circumstances which may affect entitlement to the card. Such circumstances include cancellation of pension, death of pensioner and marriage or re-marriage. The health benefits card issued to eligible sickness beneficiaries fortnightly is valid for the period covered by the two dates printed on the card.</PARA>
<PARA> Another difference between the two types of card is that the pensioner health benefits card has provision for recording optometrical consultations whereas the sickness benefit card does not. However, like pensioners, sickness beneficiaries are entitled to eyesight examinations free of charge from participating optometrists.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Sickness benefits, unlike pensions, are usually shorter-term payments; it is for this reason that health benefit cards are issued to eligible beneficiaries each fortnight. While some sickness benefits may, in the event, be long-term payments this may not always be apparent at the time of grant of benefit and, in the interest of uniform administration, all sickness beneficiaries are treated in a like manner. This arrangement does not disadvantage any beneficiaries and, where eligible, they have health cover for the entire period of their entitlement to sickness benefit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. The Commonwealth's intention is to provide a sealed road link to connect Newman with the North-West Coastal Highway near Port Hedland. This road link will form part of the Perth-Darwin National Highway.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) A final decision on the route for the National Highway is dependent on the results of further investigations which are currently being undertaken in conjunction with Western Australia and which are due to be completed before the end of March 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> The alternative National Highway routes which have been agreed by the Commonwealth and Western Australia for these further investigations include routes which would, together with other road links, facilitate access to existing and potential iron-ore developments to the west of Newman and possible new towns which may be established as a result of these developments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Housing and Construction has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not practicable to provide on an electorate basis details of Home Savings Grant applications received and approved.</PARA>
<PARA> These applications are being received at an average rate of some 1100 per week. Information about electoral divisions is not sought from applicants. Extraction of this detail using the address given and electoral maps would be beyond the limited staff resources available for administration of the homes savings grant scheme and would delay unnecessarily the processing of applications.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 2 April 1981 (Hansard, page 1044) Senator Watson asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Health, a question without notice concerning difficulties encountered by epileptics in taking out life assurance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> The matter is not one that comes within my portfolio but I have had some enquiries made and understand that it is largely a matter for individual life insurance companies to decide the terms on which they are prepared to offer life insurance cover. While the terms and conditions of cover can vary widely as between companies, and there are over 40 companies operating in the market, it is usual for these matters to be determined following an assessment of various risk factors involved including the state of health of the particular life being insured. However, it does appear clear that people with a serious illness or disability, including the more serious forms of epilepsy, are likely to encounter more difficulty in obtaining cover than those whose health is good. Similarly, it is understood that while cover is frequently provided to persons suffering from illness or disability (perhaps with a loading on premium), cases can occur where an insurer is not prepared to insure a person suffering from a serious epileptic condition. However, non-acceptance of a risk by one company does not necessarily mean that other companies would take the same attitude, particularly given the strong competition existing within the industry. Other points made in response to enquiries were that-</PARA>
<PARA> cover is usually available if the epileptic condition has stabilised and is readily controllable;</PARA>
<PARA> most epileptics who are well controlled and who have not had an attack within the past five years can be accepted at standard rates;</PARA>
<PARA> epileptics have better access to insurance cover than many of those suffering from other kinds of medical impairment.</PARA>
<PARA>If a person is encountering difficulty in obtaining cover from a company it could prove fruitful to seek cover from a range of other companies, for example, those with differing marketing attitudes. It might also be noted that if a person suffering from epilepsy is unable to work by reason of his condition, he could, subject to an income test, qualify for a sickness benefit or an invalid pension from the Department of Social Security. Similarily, the person could become eligible for an age pension.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 29 May 1981, (Hansard, page 2345) Senator Harradine asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Communications, a question without notice concerning broadcasting and television standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The maintenance of proper standards of decency on radio and television is an important and continuing function of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in its oversight of the operations of commercial stations.</PARA>
<PARA> The amount of program monitoring needed to maintain a check on compliance by stations with the Tribunal's program standards is a matter for judgment by the Tribunal and it has decided to concentrate its resources on selective observations for specific purposes rather than routine monitoring. It should be borne in mind that the Tribunal has recourse under section 99 (4) of the Broadcasting and Television Act to tapes and other station records whenever the need arises to examine material about which complaints have been laid or other doubts exist in terms of compliance with standards. When considered necessary, the Tribunal gives directions to stations pursuant to section 99 (2) of the Act to vary their programs so as to conform with the standards.</PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal's program of research includes the assessment of what the community expects from radio and television and its research staff is fully occupied on a variety of projects. The cut in research funding referred to by the Honourable Senator was simply the normal process whereby the Tribunal made a selection of projects of highest priority from an exhaustive list of prospective work submitted by its staff. It would not have been possible within the Tribunal's financial and staff resources to have attempted more.</PARA>
<PARA> I should add that the Tribunal is engaged in a comprehensive review of its program standards with the aim of providing a set of clear and unambiguous statements on the important program issues which will be binding on stations as a condition of licence. Guidelines for operators are also being devised. These will not have the legal force of standards but rather provide helpful information on good broadcasting practice.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator also referred to the Broadcasting Information Office. Consideration is being given to the incorporation of some of the proposed functions of the Broadcasting Information Office within the research component of the Tribunal, where appropriate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 September 1981 (Hansard, page 562) Senator Walsh asked me a question without notice concerning the existing commitments to expenditure under the Ord River Irrigation Act and, in particular, whether they include the balance of $20m still available to the State under the Western Australia Agreement (Ord River Irrigation) Act 1968.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The following information is provided in answer to Senator Walsh's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The only existing commitment on the part of the Commonwealth is to provide loan funds under the Western Australia Agreement (Ord River Irrigation) Act 1968 for the constructoin of grain handling facilities at Kununurra for which the State has requested $100,000 this financial year. These loan funds will be drawn against the balance of about $23.5m still unspent from the $48.18m appropriated under the 1968 Agreement Act. At the time of the recommendation of the Committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions, there were no other outstanding commitments relating to the balance still unspent under the Act.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Carrick</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 27 August 1981 (Hansard, page 420), Senator Walsh asked the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources questions concerning clause 7 of the Export Grants Acts Amendment Bill 1981 during the second reading debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Trade and Resources has supplied the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh asked why the provisions of Section 29 (9) of the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974 were amended to include 'that there is a defect or irregularity in or in connection with his appointment'. This particular amendment was made following advice from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel that it would bring the legislation into conformity with the provisions for acting appointments being adopted in connection with other legislation. The form of the amendment follows a 'pro-forma' approach by the Parliamentary Counsel to obviate a defect in the original provisions which may have allowed successful challenges to the legislation on technicalities. A situation could arise, for example, where because of illness the Executive member failed to return to work at the end of a period of leave during which his duties had been undertaken by an acting Executive member. Should the latter officer continue to carry out Executive member duties beyond the formal period of his acting appointment, his signing of a document could, but for the provision, be challenged on the grounds that the document was not signed by an authorised person.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, Senator Walsh asked if the provision would apply retrospectively to the appointments of an existing or previous part time member. Because of the nature of the circumstances for which the amendment provides it was considered that there was no point in making it apply retrospectively. Accordingly the provision will not affect previous or existing acting appointments to the Board.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh's final question was with regard to the application of the amended provisions of sub-section 29 (9) of the Principal Act to the '. . . regular members of the Board as distinct from acting members . . .' The provisions of sub-section 29 (9) do not apply to the 'regular' members of the Board as these members are appointed by the Governor-General by instrument of appointment on the advice of Executive Council. The time available to prepare such documentation precludes in practical terms the likelihood of an irregularity such as that described above from occurring. Acting members, on the other hand, are appointed by the Prime Minister and although care is of course taken in the preparation of documentation it is possible that unforeseen circumstances, such as those outlined above, may cause complications. It is because of the possibility of unforeseen events occurring that Parliamentary Counsel advised the inclusion of provisions such as those contained in sub-section 29 (9) of the Principal Act where acting members may be appointed to the Board of a statutory authority.</PARA>
