<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to Senator Messner in his capacity, I think, as Minister representing the Attorney-General, or is it Senator Chaney? There seems to be some misunderstanding on the front bench about who will take this catch. The other day I raised a question about whether the Federal law authorities would confer with the States, particularly New South Wales, in regard to the activities of the purveyors of racial hatred, that is, the National Front and particularly 'the Skull' and his friends in Sydney. I just wonder whether anything has happened since I raised this question in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not the Acting Attorney-General in the absence of the Attorney-General but rather I am representing the Acting Attorney-General, the Honourable Neil Brown, in the Senate. So, whilst I am sure that the Honourable Neil Brown would have an immediate and precise answer to that question, I am afraid I do not. I do recall the matter which was raised with very great enthusiasm by the honourable senator, who expressed very deep concern about some of the activities which have been occurring in Australia. He took a view which, I think, perhaps went rather beyond the traditional view of what is the role of government and the law enforcement authorities with respect to the treatment of various opinions in the community, some of which of course are repugnant to the great mass of the Australian community. So I must say that my view on the matters which were raised by the honourable senator is that, whilst I share his repugnance about them, some of the measures which he had in mind may go beyond what we would want to do in a democratic society. In any event, the matter the honourable senator has raised is very serious. I will ask the Acting Attorney-General whether he can advise me on any action that has been taken since the question was asked. But I think all honourable senators would be aware that where action with the States is required it is not possible to have an instantaneous reaction. I would also just draw the Senate's attention to the fact that the Human Rights Commission may well be a body which might have some interest in the area raised by the honourable senator.</PARA></TALK.START>

Having recently visited the Burdekin Dam site in north Queensland and being aware of the concern about, and in some instances criticism of, the lack of co-operation from the Commonwealth for the project.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say, with all the emphasis I can command, that there is absolutely no ground for any criticism at all of the Commonwealth's role in this matter. The Commonwealth reached agreement with the Queensland Government in August of last year on the building of the Burdekin Dam and its associated works. The Commonwealth has agreed to provide all the funds for the construction of the dam. The cost is estimated at approximately $85m in 1980 terms. The Queensland Government is to provide the infrastructure and preliminary work necessary for the construction of the dam; for example, the access roads. That is estimated to cost around $15m in mid-1980 terms. Construction of the dam will commence when preliminary works which are being carried out by the Queensland Government have reached the necessary stage. I understand this will be some time in 1982-83. The situation is quite clear. The Commonwealth has reached an agreement. It is emphatically sticking to that agreement. The job at the moment is for the Queensland Government to get the preliminary works into position, and the Commonwealth Government will then take the next step in 1982-83, with the construction of the dam.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think a couple of months ago I had a question from Senator Keeffe in connection with the letter that I had received from the Vietnam Veterans in Congress group. I have since tabled my reply to that letter which I think the honourable senator will find in Hansard if he cares to look it up. In very short terms, let me say that I did not see that particular group in any special consultation. Its representatives, along with those of other veterans organisations, were invited to an evening function which was sponsored by the Embassy in Washington. I would have had the opportunity of meeting them there. However, the representatives of that organisation did not attend that function. I guess we could spend the rest of Question Time talking about the broader question of whom I consulted, but it might suit the purposes of Senator Elstob if I were to provide him with a copy of my itinerary.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8H7">Senator KILGARIFF</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Considering the wide-ranging problems being experienced by mining companies and the mining industry in the Northern Territory, can the Minister advise the effect that reductions in mining and non-delivery of uranium shipments are likely to have on royalty payments to Aboriginal organisations? Can the Minister also advise whether it is correct that members of the Northern Land Council have said that because of the confrontation on Darwin wharf there is now no urgency or necessity to continue with the Jabiluka and Koongarra negotiations because it is futile to endeavour to dispose of the uranium?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1804" SPEAKER="Baume Sen The Hon P.E." NAMEID="ME4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator asks two questions. Any diminution in activity at Gove will result in diminished royalties from that operation. To that extent, there will be diminished income coming into the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account and to Aboriginal communities. If the reduction in activity at Gove is as has been suggested in the Press, the extent of the diminished royalties could be quite significant. As other uranium mining projects come on stream-for example, Ranger and the others-there will be extra royalties. The net effect of this upon Aboriginal communities is hard to judge at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second part of the honourable senator's question relates to some assertions as to what the Northern Land Council may have said about the question of negotiations. There has been no indication to me from the Northern Land Council which in any way confirms the story referred to by Senator Kilgariff in his question. I have had no indications that the Northern Land Council is not continuing with the negotiating process. As far as I know, the negotiating team from the Northern Land Council and the team from Pancontinental Mining Ltd continue to work on an agreement and continue to negotiate. I would be very surprised if they were prepared to stop negotiations on the basis of some extraneous factors which may or may not be in operation at the time when their agreement eventually is concluded.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Did the Government take into account the repressive nature of the military dictatorship in Pakistan before approval was given for a Pakistani cricket team to tour Australia this summer? Does the presence of the Pakistani cricket team in Australia indicate that the Commonwealth Government condones the Pakistani dictatorship's complete removal of civil liberties, the contrived execution of a former Prime Minister and the continued persecution of the Bhutto family?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this question would more appropriately have been directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Of course, the Government does not condone any of the matters, alleged and proven, to which Senator Colston has referred. In many cases the Government finds itself in situations, such as that of the Russian Olympic Games, where for example our sportsmen act alongside people of that country and many other countries in which there is very great tyranny and oppression. Sadly enough, we cannot overcome such conditions throughout the entire world. I will bring the question to the Foreign Minister's attention and, if there is anything to be added, he can comment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's statement relating to the decision of the Australian Government on a conditional commitment of Australians to the international peace monitoring force in the Sinai. In particular I ask about the maximum period for Australian involvement. There has been speculation that this maximum period would be one year or, at most, two years. I ask: When will this matter be decided? Secondly, I ask about both Canada and the United Kingdom committing themselves to involvement being a prior condition for Australia's involvement. When is it expected that these countries may resolve the question of their involvement?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1804" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take the second part of the question first. Throughout the Australian community, there appears to be a general acceptance of the desirability of having a peace force in the Sinai. There are those-including this Government-who hold the view that it would be, of course, infinitely preferable if that force could be a United Nations peace force. But, in the knowledge of the Russian veto, that cannot be; and, therefore, the great bulk of people who have accepted the view that there ought to be a peace force believe that, in the absence of a United Nations peace force, there should be the most widely balanced peace force possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's view was that that should be the goal to be achieved. Specifically, the Government was keen that there should be a major European commitment and that that commitment preferably should be based around the United Kingdom and supported, in the wider sense, by Canada. The interesting situation, although not fully confirmed, is that it looks as though there is a likelihood of a peace force on an even broader base than had previously been thought. It looks very likely that France, under its new socialist President, will commit itself. I believe there is evidence that Italy will. I believe there is evidence that the Netherlands will. There is a strong likelihood of the United Kingdom committing itself. I cannot speak about Canada, but the participation of Canada in itself, whilst desirable, would not be imperative if the base were as broad as now seems to be emerging. Indeed, one would have noted a significant comment from, I think, a Syrian diplomat, namely, that there would be merit in such a peace force. So there is a strengthening view in many facets of the world that this peace force should take shape and take part.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I do not think-I would need to refresh my recollection-that any fixed time limit has been set in the matter. If I recollect correctly, there was some thought that the withdrawal by the Israelis might be by something like April of next year, but I take it that the peace force would be there for such length of time as was necessary and no longer. If there is anything further to add to the answer I will ascertain it for Senator Teague.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen any recent statement by Sir Geoffrey Badger but I am aware of the quite major contributions that he makes to public comment in Australia about science policy generally and the very important role that he plays through ASTEC and other bodies. It is quite incorrect to assert that this Government does not support university research. Unlike most other countries, in Australia the Government is the major supporter of research. More than 70 per cent of all research carried out in Australia is supported directly by government, either through the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the Australian Research Grants Committee and the National Health and Medical Research Council or through a variety of other bodies. The record of this Government is one of continuing and substantial support for research and I reject completely the quite unwarranted assertions in the honourable senator's question.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen the report in the Age, although I was advised that there was a report on that subject on the front page of that newspaper this morning. I have some information with respect to the matter which I received from the office of the Minister for Industrial Relations. I was advised yesterday that, in the dispute which has been going on for some little time over a claim for an increase of $40.20 a week-that claim was put forward on 30 September 1981-the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and the employers have broken off negotiations and there is a likelihood of industrial action. At a meeting yesterday the employers advised the Waterside Workers Federation of their reaction to the $40.20 a week wage claim. They indicated that that part of the claim based on undistributed increases in national productivity should be processed through the Australian Council of Trade Unions with national employers and before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. They put the view that that was the appropriate avenue through which the claim should be progressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was also a claim for $25.30 aimed at bringing classifications into line with rates in industry generally. The employers agreed to have further discussions and to join in proceedings before the Commission on that, but they were not prepared to make any offer. The Federation has pressed for an offer to be made and for a negotiated settlement to be secured before any approach is made to the Commission. That was rejected by the employers. As I understand it, a report is to be presented to stop work meetings of the Federation. The first of those meetings is to be held in Sydney today. It is quite likely that there could be industrial action following those meetings. Obviously, the Government will do what it can to assist in the resolution of that dispute. Again, this is a situation in which, if the trade union movement is not prepared to use the processes which are available to it in order to test claims of the sort presently being put forward, but insists on taking strike action, there is a limit to what the Government can do to bring about a settlement of the dispute.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A few years ago optometrists' services were included in the payment of rebates. That was a major breakthrough in the provision of benefits for medical services as it was the first time that the availability of benefits had been extended beyond the medical and dental professions. As the honourable senator will be aware, rebates are available for medical services, for some dental services and for optometrical services. The extension of rebates to the other valuable therapies-occupational therapy, physiotherapy, social work services or clinical psychology-would represent a major policy decision and would have great budgetary implications. These decisions would have to be taken by government within that kind of context, having regard to all the benefits that people might gain and all the costs that would be incurred. It is the kind of matter which government takes under view from time to time. At present it has not been possible to extend the benefits to clinical psychologists, physiotherapists or the other therapies which might be involved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that there has been no detailed consideration of the use of this Parliament House building after 1988.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; It is a fact that there is a provision in the sales tax law that exempts goods for use and not for sale by a university or school not conducted for the profit of an individual. However, that exemption does not extend to goods produced for sale by a school and there is no other relevant exemption in the law. The Commissioner of Taxation does not have a discretion in these matters. To do what has been suggested by Senator Button would require a change in the income tax law so that the record concerned could be exempt from tax. The record will be sold in the market-place and it will be in competition with other records. It could be felt that there would be some inequity in giving an exemption to this particular record.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is he aware that Dr Dettrick's test showed that only 39 per cent of primary students tested lay in the same ability band as 69 per cent of their teachers, which roughly means that four out of 10 pupils have the same mastery of mathematics as seven out of 10 of their teachers? Did the Minister see Dr Dettrick's conclusions that a substantial proportion of teachers urgently require the support of in-service education in primary mathematics; that the pupil group most disadvantaged by lack of teacher competence is the above average group; that teachers are often using inappropriate cognitive strategies, which in my terms means that they do not know how to teach mathematics; that women teachers particularly require support and encouragement to continue mathematics; and that there are no significant differences in mathematical competency between one, two and three-year trained primary teachers? Does the Minister agree with Dr Dettrick that teacher performances are largely the product of past community actions and beliefs about what is good, necessary, sufficient and affordable in mathematics education? Is it therefore not more important to give greater gravity to assessing the present situation and to plan strategies for improving the quality, particularly of mathematics, in education?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Contrary to the interjections of members of the Australian Labor Party, the question of the standards reached by students, particularly the help given to above average students, and the training given to teachers is of great importance, so I direct myself to it. I am aware of Dr Bremer's article in, I think, the Australian newspaper, which I understand was related to the interim report on a mathematics in-service guidelines study prepared by Dr Dettrick. The essential recommendation arising out of the report is that there is an urgent need for widespread and systematic support for teachers in the area of primary mathematics and, as an adjunct to that recommendation, that there is reason to believe that subject-based in-service education could be of considerable value to some teachers. That is very important. Whilst I have not examined the report in detail, it is clear that the thrust of its recommendations is compatible with the findings of several recent Commonwealth inquiries in the area of education. The report of the national inquiry into teacher education made the point that 74 per cent of primary school teachers in Victoria had a background in the humanities rather than in sciences. It suggested that at the pre-service level teacher education institutions have the responsibility of ensuring that their graduates are properly equipped to carry out effectively their professional duties and that the responsibility for continuing professional development rests ultimately with the teachers themselves. The States, which are primarily responsible for the provision and administration of educational services, should ensure that adequate opportunity exists for teachers to make a choice. The Commonwealth is maintaining its support of in-service teacher education and will provide some $17.5m to the States for this purpose in 1982. I commend Senator Archer for drawing the question to the attention of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of the impact of decisions made by Cabinets and governments, both on Cabinet Ministers and on the community at large, was dealt with at length by the Bowen Committee of Inquiry Concerning Public Duty and Private Interest. For example, it pointed out that decisions would be made from time to time in which groups of members of parliament would benefit, as would the whole community. Where a piece of legislation is of general benefit, quite clearly an individual member of parliament, as a member of the community, would be capable of benefit. I think I construe the Bowen Committee report in that way. For example, a farmer-there are some amongst us, even on the other side- gets the benefit of superphosphate and nitrogen subsidies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> People can hold Commonwealth bonds. Indeed, the day to day decisions of the Cabinet on interest rates affect the interest rates on Commonwealth bonds. In that sense it is not any different to IEDs. Basically, it is necessary to see whether what Senator Walsh asks in the substance of his question infringes the principles of the Bowen Committee report. I will invite a study of that matter and then I will draw the report, in general terms, to the attention of the Prime Minister. Cabinet has accepted the Bowen Committee standards regarding pecuniary interests. General disclosures are made to the Prime Minister. The interests of individual Ministers, as to their professions or investments, are known and the decisions are so made. In due course the provisions will be extended to this chamber so that all honourable senators, including those opposite me, can disclose whether they might be getting beneficial help from IEDs and the particular interest rates.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not certain that the assertions in the newspaper article which gave rise to Senator MacGibbon's concern are in fact correct. If the assertions are not factual, then the consequential worry may not be necessary. My understanding is that the design of the satellite had made provision for some domestic communication services for Papua New Guinea. That has been the idea from the beginning. The Papua New Guinea Government has still to decide whether it wishes to exercise that option. I understand that the option did include provision for switching one of the 30 watt transponders into the Papua New Guinea beam if that Government wanted to introduce domestic broadcasting services by satellite some time in the future. As that has been one of the design options from the beginning, it is appropriate that that offer should be made to Papua New Guinea. The reason for the higher powered transponder is similar to the reason which led to the inclusion of several of those high powered transponders. If I remember correctly a question asked by Senator Button, there were three others in the original satellite design. I will check with the Minister for Communications whom I represent as to whether there are any other features which would lend any credence to a particular vulnerability for the people of the outback.

Of course, the question of the letting of contracts for the Cooper Basin-Whyalla pipeline strictly is a matter for the South Australian Government. I would imagine that, like all governments, that Government would have very effective tendering arrangements and conditions, tested over the years, so that its ethical standards would be absolutely high and unquestionable. Over the years the governments have developed, through their public works, a formula for tendering.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know the nature of the tendering system in South Australia. I would be happy, if the honourable senator wished it, to ascertain the details. I do not know whether Red Ru was the lowest tenderer. That would be a significant, but not necessarily overwhelming condition in the determination of a successful tender. I am not sure that, following inquiry, a government would reveal to the public the reason why a committee or board arranging tenders had made a certain decision, but I would be perfectly assured in my own mind that the body making the decision was a highly ethical one. Perhaps the first approach I should make is to inquire of the South Australian Government the nature of its tendering arrangements and, if it desires to comment further, as to the substance of the telex.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If, indeed, Senator Walsh thinks that it is clever to downgrade the fact that Australia-not myself-was paid a particular courtesy, let him do so because he only downgrades himself when he does such things. I believe that Senator Tate would acknowledge that. I imagine that the chairmanship is arranged for each meeting. There is a president and an executive director and I imagine that at the moment I am simply the Australian representative at the IEA. I have to say that the IEA has the very strong view that oil prices should be at world scarcity prices. To that extent, market forces would be valuable within the United States in raising the price of oil, both indigenous and imported, to the world scarcity price. Indeed, Senator Tate will know that in the past America lagged somewhat in that regard. To that extent, I would have thought that the movement of oil prices to market and world prices would be unobjectionable. I think that the criticism may be directed to what might be considered to be the decontrolling. Under the Carter Administration there was considerable government involvement in the energy office in America, involving very heavy-of the order of $40 billion-government expenditure. As I understand it, what has happened under Mr Edwards, the new Secretary, is that he seeks to do that through private industry. What would be necessary before Australia made its value judgment would be to determine the whole of the substance of the matter and to look at it. I will get a copy of Dr Lantzke's comments and I will put them under study.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two days ago Senator Reid asked me a question concerning the National Library of Australia and some problems relating to it. I am advised by my colleague, the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, that he has noted the main points of criticism which have been made in respect of the resources provided by the Government to the National Library. The Library receives a considerable amount of public funds to permit it to carry out its statutory functions. In this financial year more than $17m will be provided for that purpose. This amount represents a significant increase over last financial year, bearing in mind that the responsibility for the Canberra Public Library Service has been transferred from the National Library to the Department of the Capital Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ordering of priorities within the Library is a matter for the Council of the Library to determine, having regard to the total resources, both financial and staffing, which the Government is able to provide.

The honourable senator's question is recorded in Hansard and relates to estimates of the cost to taxpayers et cetera of maintaining a dual State-Commonwealth meat inspection system, in which varying figures have been given. The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question: The best estimate of the direct additional cost to the meat industry of the present dual State-Commonwealth meat inspection system is $1.25m. This estimate was provided by the High Level Working Group on Meat Inspection in its report to the Standing Committee on Agriculture at the Darwin meeting on 29 July 1981. It represents the calculated savings that adoption of either of the two proposed options under discussion at that time may have produced had they been agreed to. Upper estimates of costs to the Australian community have been put at $5m but would include all the components of meat inspection, charges and related animal health administration in Commonwealth and State governments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday, 27 October Senator Button asked me a question concerning the alleged use of delaying tactics by the Commonwealth in its handling of appeals before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal under the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act. Although that question was addressed to me as Minister representing the Acting Attorney-General, in fact the matters raised probably related to appeals brought by my department, the Department of Social Security. I have sought advice from my Department in relation to this matter. In the light of that advice I am satisfied that there has been no use of delaying tactics as such by the Commonwealth in such appeals. At the same time I acknowledge that complaints have been made on occasions about delays in the finalisation of certain compensation appeals. These delays may be attributed to a variety of causes, many of which are beyond the control of officers of my Department and some of which have been largely overcome by the transfer of appeals jurisdiction under the Act to the administrative Appeals Tribunals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators may be assured that officers of my Department are fully aware of the need to obviate any unnecessary delay in the processing of such appeals. To this end, senior officers of my Department have met with the President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to discuss ways in which the hearing of compensation appeals might be expedited before the Tribunal. Following those discussions, a number of steps have been taken by both the Tribunal and my Department and I understand that these have had a desirable effect. I am informed by my department that it also hopes to be able to expedite matters further as time progresses.</PARA>
<PARA> In raising this matter with me in the Senate, Senator Button made reference to a case decided by the tribunal in August this year. I take that to have been a reference to the appeal of Mr John Bruce Wells. I received detailed advice in relation to that case which was given some mention in the Press at the time. It is unfortunate that those aspects of the appeal which were drawn to attention at the time represented only a portion of the true story and that certain of the asserted facts were incorrect. Whilst I deeply regret that Mr Wells had to pursue so long a course to effect a settlement of his workers compensation claim, I am satisfied that officers of my Department acted with propriety in their handling of his claim. If Senator Button would like any more detailed advice I would certainly be prepared to give that to him. If he would like to discuss the matter with a senior officer of my Department that also could be arranged.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to quote a few passages from the report of the Australian Wine Board. On page 6, under the heading of brandy, I notice that we still have a great problem in Australia because of the savage increase in excise placed upon the brandy industry by this Government in a Budget several years ago. It increased the brandy excise to some 83 per cent. The Government reduced the excise by some 3 1/2 per cent to 4 per cent shortly afterwards and claimed, I suppose rightly, that this Government had reduced the brandy excise. Although when one looks at that claim on the surface it sounds very good, the fact is that the excise has had serious repercussions on the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the heading 'Brandy', the Wine Board reports:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1980/81 brandy still operated well below capacity, a situation which has in recent years unfortunately become normal for brandy producers in Australia. Nevertheless, brandy production recovered from 1.65 million litres of alcohol (lals) in 1979/80 to 2.3 million lals in 1980/81. Grape intake for 1981 brandy production is estimated at 25,000 tonnes, or approximately half the intake that was common in the early seventies. </PARA>
<PARA>For those who live particularly in the Riverland area of South Australia, the State which produces the greatest proportion of grapes for the production of brandy and also the greatest amount of brandy, this has had a very serious financial effect. Many of the people there who depend on the production of grapes for the purpose of making brandy are in very severe financial straits. I think the Government made a very grave mistake when it introduced this savage increase in brandy excise. Whilst I do not want to rehash the whole problem, I recall that members of the Government said when the Senate discussed this legislation that they were very concerned at what effect the brandy excise would have on the industry. One member of the Government from South Australia, Senator Teague, said that he would not be a credible Liberal if he stood by and allowed that increase to take place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All right, the honourable senator says it is not true. The fact is that the brandy excise imposed by this Government has had a very detrimental effect financially on the people of the Riverland. Those people are still suffering from this imposition and they will continue to suffer for many years to come. Those remarks are borne out by what is said in the Wine Board report which we are now discussing. The report points out that the grape intake for the 1981 brandy production is estimated to be 25,000 tonnes or approximately half the intake that was common in the early 1970s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other disturbing aspect of the report concerns imports. This Government is allowing massive increases in imports of brandy at a time when our producers are facing very severe financial problems. I venture to say that the Australian produced brandy is equal to, if not better than, most of the imported brandy. Yet we find that this Government has allowed a great increase in the imports of brandy, which is having a detrimental effect on our own industry. According to page 9 of the report, France has been able to export to Australia 116,666 litres of brandy in bottles or 432,888 litres of brandy in bulk. France is the biggest exporter of brandy to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia brandy has to be kept on wood for at least three years, I think, before it is allowed to be retailed. This Government does not require any proof of the length of time imported brandy is subject to this process. I criticised the Labor Government a few years ago when Senator Murphy was the Minister for Customs and Excise because we were unable to establish whether the brandy we were importing was in fact matured on wood for three years. The grapes for imported brandy could be picked today, processed next week and then marketed in this country. People buying this brandy could be fooled into believing that it had been matured on wood for a certain period. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think it tastes as good as our own brandy. But the Government should be taking some action to protect our own industry by preventing this brandy from coming into this country. I am a great advocate of upgrading tariffs so as to keep this brandy out. Of course, people on the other side of the chamber are always saying that tariffs should be lowered, particularly in respect of the motor industry. But that is another question. Some farmers are claiming all the time that we ought to lower tariffs on farm machinery so that they can benefit. Just recently I asked representatives of a farmers' organisation whether they would agree to lower tariffs on dairy produce from New Zealand. They said: 'Oh, no', and threw their hands up in horror. They do not want the consumers of this country to benefit from lower tariffs, only themselves. Yet some of their own members in the Riverland of South Australia are suffering because we have no restrictions on the imports of brandy, which is being imported in increasing quantities every year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another thing that disturbs me is the massive increase in the volume of wine imported from Germany. Earlier this year I had a discussion with a man from Western Australia who sells imported German wine. I was horrified when he told me that the greatest buyers per head of population of wine imported by his company are South Australians. Some people in the Barossa Valley are the biggest buyers of wine imported by this company. They are not using our own wine. This will be to their detriment in the long run. </PARA>

But we then find that clearances of imported whisky increased by 8.5 per cent and of imported brandy by 47.7 per cent.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In doing so I welcome the tabling of the report as being yet another informative report demonstrating another quite productive year from what is a highly expert and capable body which has been achieving a great deal despite the part time status of its members and despite the very small and overworked nature of its full time staff. This is the kind of report which raises questions about the whole status of the much vaunted new system of administrative law which has been introduced by this Government and its predecessor over the last few years. It also raises questions about the extent to which the new administrative law reality matches the rhetoric which we have been hearing from the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and others in recent times. Because of the constraints of time I do not seek to traverse the kind of ground which I have in previous speeches on this subject, but simply to make three or four points which seem to me to emerge very clearly from this report. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point is that it is clear that the Administrative Review Council is just not getting the kind of co-operation it needs from this Government if it is to be able to perform effectively the functions which have been vested in it. Whether that lack of co-operation is a product of this Government's narrow conservative ideology, whether it is a product of the Government's and the Minister's notorious lethargy in reform matters or whether, as perhaps is most likely of all in this context, it is the product of a systematic bureaucratic snow job designed to ensure that not too much changes in the way the administrative system works and its susceptibility to review-for whatever the reason-it is apparent that the Administrative Review Council is labouring under conditions of much less support than might be expected for a body of its stature and importance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council in its report at paragraph 15 draws attention to the very depressing situation which exists in relation to its staffing. It is limping along at the moment with five full time staff and one part time position which in fact represents not an increase but a reduction in the effective staff ceiling over the last 12 months notwithstanding heartfelt pleas from the Council to enable more full time staff to be made available. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect which is an even more alarming demonstration of the absence of serious co-operation from the Government in the work of the Council is the matter referred to in paragraph 86. That follows where the Council in discussing the implementation of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, one of the key linchpins of the new administrative law system, refers to its recommendation last year to the Attorney-General that it would be desirable in monitoring the operation of that Act for all departments to be required to maintain records as to the operation of the Act in their respective domains and in particular to keep records of cases of refusals to grant statements of reasons and notices as required under that Act in order to enable people to exercise their administrative rights. The Council draws attention to the fact that this obviously very reasonable recommendation to the Attorney-General which is an essential pre-condition for any effective monitoring of the effectiveness of this piece of legislation was in fact rejected by the Attorney-General and in fact no such instruction was issued to the departments involved in the actual or potential administration of this legislation. As a result, the Council's capacity to monitor this legislation will in fact be rendered quite nugatory. That is a clear cut demonstration of the kind of absence of co-operation that has been forthcoming from this Government for whatever of the reasons that I mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point that I wanted to make is that it is clear on a number of quite specific matters, not just procedural issues, that the advice of the Administrative Review Council has not been taken as seriously by the Government as the stature of the Council and the quality of its output would suggest that it should. Many examples of that are evident in recent reports from the Council. I drew attention to a number of them in the context of the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the jurisdiction of the courts under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act in rather lengthy speeches which I made on this subject, and which I will not repeat now, on 20 August last year and 20 November 1979. But I do draw the Senate's attention to the rather eloquent, albeit politely eloquent, statement of the fate of a number of recommendations of the Council which appears on pages 20 to 22 of the report where the Council made it perfectly clear that despite lengthy and carefully reasoned arguments having been put to the Attorney and to the Government as to the nature of the jurisdiction which ought to be vested in the courts in this area, that advice has in fact been systematically ignored. I think that is a matter for considerable regret. </PARA>
<PARA> The final matter I want to mention briefly is the present status of the Freedom of Information Bill which is the subject of numerous references, as one might expect, throughout this report. The Bill had always been intended to be the capstone, as it were, of the legislative system of new administrative law that was to be established respectively by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act and the Ombudsman Act. The Freedom of Information Act, governing the way in which the dynamics of the administrative system would operate, was the Act which when implemented would give additional shape and content to the structure for review of Government decisions which had been thus created. But of course we do now confront a situation with the early rising of the House of Representatives in which it is evident that this Government no longer has any obvious commitment at all to the actual enactment of the Freedom of Information Bill. Despite all the hurry that was evident when the Government rammed the Bill through the Senate with indecent haste in the dying days of the last session in order to avoid being confronted with the kind of majority it has now against it on these questions the Freedom of Information Bill has languished unnoticed and untended on the House of Representatives Notice Paper ever since. </PARA>
<PARA> A small attempt at pretending there was a second reading debate on the Bill was held early in the Budget session but since then nothing whatsoever has happened and all the evidence is that this Bill like so many other grand promises of this Government, legislative and otherwise, has been consigned to the limbo of lost causes. It is a wholly insupportable state of affairs that that should be so. This is an extremely important piece of legislation. It is disgraceful that the House of Representatives is getting up as early as it is, running for cover as obviously it is without debating the Bill. I fear that the failure to debate the Bill and the failure to enact it this session does indicate all to clearly what the fate of freedom of information will be under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Might I make it clear by contrast that the Labor Party is firmly committed now, as it always has been, not only to effective administrative review machinery in all the other ways that are the subject of the Administrative Review Council Report-I refer in particular to the effective operation of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the effective operation of an Ombudsman with wide-ranging jurisdiction and the effective vesting of review jurisdiction in the courts-but also it is committed firmly, explicitly and unequivocally to effective freedom of information legislation of the kind that was recommended by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. It is a matter, as I have said, for profound regret that the Administrative Review Council was not able in this report to report to the nation that a proper, decent, effective system of administrative law in all those respects is now in operation in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I have in my hands a copy of the 1981 annual report of the Canberra Theatre Trust. I am attracted to a couple of comments which the report makes in the paragraph headed 'Hirings and Operational Subsidy' and which should be of some concern to the people of Canberra. It states that although there was a surplus in the accounts on the operational subsidy provided by the Department of the Capital Territory there seems to be a need for an increase in that subsidy because nationwide there has been a fall-off in the number of private promoters and as a result fewer forms of entertainment are coming to Canberra. Apparently the increased cost of touring and the restricted seating capacity of the Canberra Theatre make profitability doubtful in the view of these people. The problem is understated in this report. Most annual reports understate the problems for some reason or other. No organisation which is faced with restrictions on funding is inclined to be highly critical of government because it may find there will be further restrictions in the funds which are made available. From this understatement there emerges a problem that Canberra is facing as the national centre. Not only is it the national centre of government but also it is the national centre, and we have accepted it as such for many years, of education and research. To a certain extent we believed that a cultural level would be developed in Canberra which would attract similar efforts elsewhere. It seems now that there will be not only a restriction in the growth of Canberra economically and structurally but also a chance of a lack of growth culturally. I believe that note ought to be taken of the comments made in this report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Trust believes it should take the initiative in seeking out more attractions to bring to Canberra. To do so will, however, require greater resources than it has at present. Given a further injection of funds, the Trust believes that in the longer term more of the subsidy could be recovered by a greater usage of the facilities by hirers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is doubtful if the situation can ever be reached where no subsidy will be required as has been found not only in Australia but throughout the world in publicly owned performing arts centres. To reach this situation would require an increase in ticket prices of considerable proportion, which would in turn be counter productive in discouraging the public from attending the theatre. </PARA>
<PARA>I go back to the fact that the facilities in Canberra at present are limited. The attractions that are available now are limited by the cost of bringing performing arts companies here. Therefore there is in effect a downturn which should concern not only citizens of Canberra but also this Parliament which is responsible for the development of Canberra as a national capital. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be said that the problem is Australia-wide, but it goes back to the policy attitudes of the Government in reducing funding for the performing arts. If this trend is allowed to continue, it could reach a stage where to reverse it would need considerable funds and effort. The stage could be reached where the trend could be irreversible; the traditions, the expectations which are developed within Canberra, could be so diminished that when funds become available there may not be the initiative nor the enthusiasm to lift the national capital back to the cultural level that we have been led to expect. This report ought to be carefully considered; the implications which are spelt out in mild terms should be realised fully and taken up by those who are concerned about the cultural advancement of Canberra. </PARA>

For that reason the report ought to be brought under careful scrutiny, especially since it indicates just what is to be abandoned.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The report of the Department of Administrative Services deals with multi-varied aspects of Government administration. Therefore, in 10 minutes it is rather difficult to give adequate attention to all of the various sections and statutory authorities that come within the purview of the Department of Administrative Services. Nevertheless, I shall do what I can with the report and the variety of issues it deals with in the brief time that is available. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, of course, it deals with a vexed question that has been worrying the citizens of New South Wales for a considerable number of years. The machinery of government grinds very slowly particularly as it relates to the attempts that have been made by the community of Sydney to get its hands on Commonwealth properties that would otherwise be regarded as part of a military requirement. Of course, I refer specifically to the attempts made by many organisations and by the State Government to establish the Sydney Harbour foreshore or national park. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also deals with the infamous decision made by this Government, as a result of the razor gang decision, to sell the Glebe Estate. That is a very important land acquisition. This was a property and accommodation decision made by the Whitlam Government to acquire from the Church of England in Sydney the very large area, containing some 700 dwellings and 60 commercial properties, commonly known as the Glebe Estate. Of course, so far as the Commonwealth was concerned, that was a very good buy. Of course, the Government now having got ownership of it and looking from the point of view of revenue is endeavouring to sell the Estate. Under force of public opinion that the Government should at least have regard to the fact that the Estate should remain in public ownership and not be sold off as a piece of real estate, negotiations are still proceeding between the Commonwealth and the State Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We hope the State government will be adamant in its attemps to get ownership of this important piece of real estate, being as it is close to the city proper and one which affords an opportunity for a public authority to provide cheap and effective accommodation within the city proper. Therefore, given the Commonwealth Government's desire to have transferred to it other areas of land within New South Wales, one would hope that there will be an amicable settlement of that project. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw to the attention of the Senate another one of the policies being adopted by this Government which shows that it does not have regard to building up its assets. My remarks apply to overseas residences and public offices. Page 12 of the report shows in relation to rental outlays and outlays on capital works and purchases the difference between the last Labor government Budget for 1975-76 and the current Budget of the Government. It is worth referring to the policy considerations that this conservative Government has pursued in this area in the brief period it has been back in office. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1975-76, the Australian Labor Government was prepared to put $15.9m into the areas of capital works on and purchases of overseas properties, but it paid only $11.3m out in rent. It is interesting to compare those figures with the drastic change that has occurred in this area since the Fraser Government came to office. In the current year, we are spending only $3.6m, less than a quarter of the amount I previously mentioned from the Labor 1975-76 Budget, on capital works and purchases. Of course, expenditure on rent has almost doubled from $11.3m in 1975-76 to $21.3m in the current Budget. This Government claims to be concerned with good business principles. We are now paying out more than twice the amount of money in rent that we did in 1975-76, but are doing so in a period when property values overseas are increasing tremendously. As far as the Government's foreign affairs and trade responsibilities are concerned, it has not taken advantage of acquiring property and therefore of having assets in foreign countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Very briefly, I refer also to the matter dealing with the Government's information services and their sales and distribution of publications. We see here quite a remarkable increase in public interest in our sales and distribution of publications. Sales increased in 1980-81 by 32 per cent over those for the previous year. Of course, as we all know this is an enterprise profitable for the Commonwealth. What is the Commonwealth seeking to do? It seeks to lease or sell the Australian Government Publishing Service, an area in which there has been a tremendous increase in profitability. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn in a fairly hurried way to advertising expenditure. This is a matter coming under the Department of Administrative Services, to which I think the Senate's attention ought to be drawn. In 1975-76, total Commonwealth Government outlay was $9m. It has now risen to $23.2m. This is an increase of about 270 per cent. It is worthwhile looking at how the Government is now spending that increased budget. For example, in 1975-76, the last Budget of the Whitlam Government, we spent $68m in display and classified advertisements in metropolitan newspapers. That figure is now down to $42m which is rather a dramatic drop at a time when we ought to be publicising and communicating the decisions of Parliament and other activities of the national Government. It is similarly shown that in the provincial Press there has been a dramatic drop in advertising expenditure from $7m to $3m. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this must have some effect upon the Government's attempts to communicate and to advertise activities in respect of the printed media. One must say that, having regard to the influence that the television moguls have upon this Government, we see a corresponding increase over the previous six Budgets, in the amount of money spent on television advertising, from $11m to $40m. Maybe it can be argued that this is the most effective way of presenting a point of view. The Opposition has seriously criticised the Government's wastage of expenditure on so many advertising campaigns, for example, in relation to the 35-hour week and other matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The reference dealing with public order and police affairs is contained on one and one-third pages. The Department of Administrative Services deals with public order and police affairs so this is a most inadequate report on that aspect. It does not mention the tremendous drop in morale that has taken place as a result of the merger of the Australian Capital Territory Police with the former Commonwealth Police Force, to form the Australian Federal Police organisation. It does not mention the great dissatisfaction that is evident in the Australian Federal Police journals. It does not mention the dissatisfaction which exists in Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia because the Government's assurances in respect of the merger have not been carried into effect. Nor is any mention made of the fact that the projected retirement of Sir Colin Woods, the head of the Australian Federal Police, probably results from his failure effectively to bring about the merger in such a way as to protect the economic interests and efficiency of our new national organisation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the motion that the Senate take note of the report of the Department of Administrative Services, by referring again to a couple of matters that concern me about the policy of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) in relation to that Department. Last Thursday night I raised with Senator Peter Baume, representing the Minister for Administrative Services in the Senate, the problem of there being two unanswered questions on matters concerning the Department in Hobart when there was every reason that they should have been answered. If I may quote from page 1614 of Hansard, the Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to Question No. 998 and Question No. 1000, I will take those up with the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) with a view to trying to expedite a response and will pass on to him the expressions of concern of the honourable senator. </PARA>
<PARA>Another week has passed and still no answer to those questions has been received, yet further action is being taken in regard to the matters that are the subject of the questions. First, in relation to the security service at the Commonwealth Government Centre in Hobart, the Hobart Mercury of yesterday contains an advertisement headed 'Service Security Watching', which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Registrations of interest are invited from companies wishing to tender for the provision of Security Watching of Commonwealth Occupied Premises in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the advertisement in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SERVICE SECURITY WATCHING</PARA>
<PARA> Registrations of interest are invited from companies wishing to tender for the provision of Security Watching of Commonwealth Occupied Premises in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed term of contract will be three years and the buildings involved are the Commonwealth Government Centre, Hobart, the Glenorchy Regional Offices, the Belerive Regional Offices and the Burnie Regional Offices. </PARA>
<PARA> The service required will be either security guard, patrol or alarm servicing, or a combination of these operations. </PARA>
<PARA> Registration is the first step in a two-phase procedure and tenders will subsequently be sought only from potential suppliers who respond to this invitation to register. </PARA>
<PARA> Registrations must reach the Purchasing Division, Department of Administrative Services, 4th Floor, Commonwealth Government Centre, 188 Collins Street, Hobart (Telephone 20 5223) (Postal Address: GPO Box 561-F, Hobart, Tasmania, 7001) no later than 2 p.m. on Tuesday, November 10, 1981. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LF4">Senator COATES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The advertisement indicates clearly that the whole substance of the action on which I wanted advice is continuing. The answers to the questions could have been given and they still have not been. It is an affront to the Parliament that the Minister for Administrative Services-the Acting Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Wilson), who could just as easily provide the answer-has not done so. This is having an effect on the staff currently employed in Hobart by the Department of Administrative Services. Week by week they are getting these little bits of information as to what is happening about their future. The advertisement indicates that there are very clear plans in that regard. There is no reason why the Government could not have answered the question. I hope that before the Senate rises today an answer to that question will be provided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other question relates to the Perpetual Trustees building in Hobart. I raised this matter on Thursday night. Again it concerns the Minister for Administrative Services. I mentioned then that the appearance of scaffolding around the building indicated that some work was proceeding but I have not yet had an answer. On Monday of this week I drove past the building and saw further signs of activity, yet still there has been no answer. Again, I believe that there ought to be a response from the Minister for Administrative Services on these matters. I hope that that response will be provided before the end of the sitting today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the report of the Department of Administrative Services and propose to confine my remarks to the section on page 42 under the heading 'Services for Members of Parliament and Ministers'. I wish again to raise a matter that I have raised in Estimates committee meetings and also through correspondence with the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman). I refer to the lack of parking facilities in the city of Adelaide for country members who do not deem to have their offices in the heart of Adelaide. A couple of us in the Australian Labor Party suffer an inconvenience in that regard. One is Mr Laurie Wallis, the honourable member for Grey, who has his office at Port Augusta in his electorate. I am the other person. I am the only senator in South Australia who has an office outside the metropolitan area; that is, at Murray Bridge. When Mr Wallis or I have to go to Adelaide by car on parliamentary business no provision is made for us to park there. However, members who represent country electorates-I might mention the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Giles) and the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter), who do not deem to have their offices in their electorates, or to live there, deeming to have them in King William Street-are provided with parking facilities. Mr Wallis and I suffer a great inconvenience because there are times when, if one seeks a public car park, it proves to be full and also one cannot find an available parking meter space. One might have an appointment at some government department on behalf of a constituent but find that, by the time one has driven round and round Adelaide square trying to find parking, one is late.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my view it would be a simple matter for parking facilities to be provided at the Adelaide city car park, in Currie Street, for the very few members who require it. We had a Commonwealth car park there until the Commonwealth Government disposed of the property to the Adelaide City Council. Then our parking facilities were taken away. We now suffer the inconvenience of have nowhere to park when we go to Adelaide. Again I make a plea to the Minister for Administrative Services, in the interests not of us as members but of the people we serve, that some facilities be made available to us for the parking of our cars in the city of Adelaide when we must go there on parliamentary business. I have pursued every avenue I can think of, even to the extent of writing to the Minister, but he still will not provide facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to raise another matter, which would be applicable to honourable senators from all States. I represent two non-resident country electorates in South Australia. I refer to the electorates of Wakefield and Barker. I have a responsibility to my party to serve electors in those areas. I have a regional office in Mt Gambier and must meet all the expenses of that office. No provision is made for that purpose. There is no electoral office in that electorate because the sitting member does not deem to live in the electorate or have an office there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The sitting member is Mr Porter, the honourable member for Barker. I have an office in Mt Gambier and must meet all of the expenses, even to the extent of installing a telephone and paying for telephone rental and calls. Provision should be made for honourable senators who want to serve their electorates properly and to have a member of their staff in their office in a country area. Provision has been made by the Remunerations Tribunal for the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) to have two offices. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Tambling) has an office in Darwin and another office at Alice Springs. I think there might be something in the pipeline to enable the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wallis), who represents about 95 per cent of the area of South Australia, to have a second office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The same facility should be made available to honourable senators who want to have a regional office in order to render a service to the people to whom they are responsible. If the Government will not provide honourable senators with such office accommodation, it could at least provide them with telephone facilities which would enable them or their staff to take up urgent matters immediately with appropriate departments in Adelaide if the departments concerned do not have regional offices in the city in which senators choose to have their offices. We are greatly inconvenienced in that respect. My office in Mount Gambier serves a very large area. Since I opened it a lot of work has come to it. We are restricted with trunk telephone calls. That imposes an enormous cost on a senator. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am told by Senator Coates that Senator Harradine is provided with not just one telephone but many telephones to enable him to service Tasmania. I think that matter was raised during an Estimates committee hearing when Senator Bjelke-Petersen asked a question about the emoluments paid to the extra staff of Senator Harradine. Whilst the Government can provide those facilities for one senator from whom it might expect support on contentious issues, members of the Parliament such as myself and Mr Wallis are not provided with adequate parking facilities and, because I want to have a second office, I have to bear the whole cost of that office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It might be argued that honourable senators are given an electorate allowance and we should meet the costs of office facilities from that allowance. But, that argument falls to the ground when we look at the situation of the honourable member for the Northern Territory and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, who are provided with second offices. Senators have to represent a whole State and not just a small electorate. In my State of South Australia at least the Australian Labor Party members service the whole State. We split the States up into areas so that we can service country areas. I represent, in particular, areas within an electorate in which the sitting Government Liberal member does not want to live; he wants to be within view of the General Post Office clock and to have his office in King William Street where country people do not have access to him. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two members. One is the honourable member for Barker, Mr Porter. I have two offices in his electorate, one at the extreme north and the other at the extreme south. The extreme north of that electorate borders on the extreme south of the electorate of Wakefield, so my main office is more or less in the centre of the two electorates. My other office is at Mount Gambier. What I am asking for is that the Government give due consideration to not only my desire but also the desire of other honourable senators to be provided with a regional office and facilities so that we can give our electors the service to which they are entitled. The electors pay us. We are their servants. At least we in the Labor party deem ourselves to be their servants; probably some Government members do not. Anyone who cares to read the record of what I have said might see that a couple of members do not believe that they are servants of the electors they represent because they neither live nor have an office in their electorates. Whilst Liberal members of the Liberal Government often claim that they have the interests of the country people at heart, I think the proof of the pudding is in the eating, particularly in South Australia, where they do not have the interests of the country people at heart. We have only two Federal members in South Australia who are so concerned about meeting the needs of their electors that they live in the country and have their electorate offices there. What I am asking for is to be provided with the wherewithal to enable me to conduct my regional office in a proper manner, rather than having to conduct it on a shoestring, having to scrounge around for furniture and having to pay the rent for the office. We have a good office. A I said, it is serving its purpose down there. But it would serve the purpose a lot better if we had support from the Government in that regard. I hope that the Government will take notice of what I have said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, I hope also that the Government takes congnisance of the fact that neither Mr Wallis nor myself, who are country members, has any parking facilities in Adelaide. I understand also that even the metropolitan members who have electorate offices in the suburbs they represent, if they have to go to Adelaide on parliamentary business, cannot find a place to park. Some of them are Liberal members, but mostly they are Labor members who deign to live in the electorate and to have an ofice there. If they come into the city no parking facilities are available to them. I hope that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Messner, being a South Australian-I hope that also, as a senator, he has the interests of his constituents at heart-will do something to help us to overcome the problem I have outlined. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The report of Commonwealth Accommodation and Catering Services Limited is one which has to be looked at with a great deal of misgiving and sadness. That organisation has been carrying on a very worthwhile activity in a variety of places throughout Australia, at the waterfront, with the Australian Federal Police, the Clyde Cameron college and so on. The Government is hocking off those enterprises. They are profitable enterprises. The income and expenditure accounts show that, apart from the taxation loss, they are able to provide a service at very little cost to revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to matters on which I do not believe we have had satisfaction. I do not think that Senator Evans received a satisfactory reply to a question he asked the other evening when we were considering the Estimates in Committee of the Whole. His question related to the effects of the decision of the razor gang, or should I say the Fraser Gang, to sell off all those public enterprises. The fact is that, despite the assurances given by the Minister for Finance, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, what is happening is that in the transfer of the enterprises the Government is not being sufficiently forceful and the new owners of the enterprises, be they responsible for catering or cleaning, are being discriminatory. Without equivocation they are preferring to accept the younger members of the labour force for employment and are not having a second look at anybody over the age of 40 years. Certainly they are not applying any criteria which would permit the employment of migrants. I do not think it is good enough that the Government allows those new contractors to make such decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> In the negotiations the Commonwealth Government should have made it mandatory that no labour would be displaced as a result of the sales. The undertaking given to this Parliament should be carried into effect in those enterprises. All labour employed by the Commonwealth Government in an enterprise should, on the sale of transfer of that enterprise to the private sector, be transferred to the private sector. We have made it quite clear that we are opposed to the sale of public enterprises. We do not believe that public property should be transferred to the private sector, irrespective of whether it is the catering service, or the organisation that handles cleaning or the supervision of public buildings. We feel that way also about the sale of Commonwealth properties such as Havelock House. The four Commonwealth Government guest houses that have been operating for many years in Canberra have been placed on the market. </PARA>
<PARA> We make it clear again that we expect the Government, in all humility, to pay some regard to humanity. A discriminatory policy is being exercised. The new companies, the private sector managers and supervisors, are picking and choosing in respect of labour content. That means, of course, that we are placing in jeopardy the future of quite a number of the persons who have been employed and who have given faithful service to the Commonwealth. I hope that the Government will be a little more determined, having regard to the statements made by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle to Senator Evans the other evening, to make sure that the livelihoods and the jobs of those affected by the razor gang decisions will be protected in the transfer of these public enterprises to the private sector. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite the obvious enthusiasm and energy of the lengthening cast of characters who seem to have been involved in the preparation of this report, I believe it is in several ways quite a disappointing document. It is disappointing in the first place because of its continuing evident pre-occupation with the fireworks and dress-ups aspect of the bicentenary rather than its potential for being the occasion for some rather more long lasting and significant national achievements. For example, the achievement of a renewed Australian Constitution along the lines I have suggested in various forums and on occasions elsewhere really would be the kind of significant goal for which an occasion of this kind might provide a momentum otherwise lacking.</PARA>
<PARA> In the second place, I think the report is disappointing because it reveals the continuing failure to date of governments at any level in Australia to give a clear indication of the likely financial commitment that they are prepared to make over the whole period leading up to the centenary. That state of affairs was adverted to by Mr Cohen in the other place when this report was debated there a few days ago. The failure of the governments to be prepared to make the kinds of contingent commitments that are necessary in this matter clearly has been quite destructive of the planning capacity of the Authority and other various offshoots around the country. They cannot be criticised for the Government's failure but it certainly ought to be acknowledged that there has been such a failure. The remaining matter that seems to me to be of real disappointment is the evidence revealed by the report of the evident failure so far of the bicentenary concept in any way to impinge on the national consciousness. On page 6 of the report it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A national survey early in 1981 showed that only one in four people could identify 1988 as the Bicentennial Year. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> This situation needs to be remedied quickly, but it must be done without raising expectations prematurely. </PARA>
<PARA>It also states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Authority has embarked on a programme aimed at increasing awareness among the Australian people of the significance of the Bicentenary. </PARA>
<PARA>I take this occasion to suggest in this respect that perhaps the best way of embarking upon a consciousness raising exercise about the bicentenary and what is involved in it and, at the same time, contributing to that sense of national pride, independence and unity which it is part of the bicentenary objectives to encourage, would be for the Bicentennial Authority to sponsor a competition to produce a design for a new Australian flag. I readily acknowledge that patriotic instincts have all too often been appealed to in the past in support of various ignominious tory crusages in national chauvinism of one kind or another. However, I believe that we ought to be proud of our country and that we should not be ashamed to demonstrate that pride from time to time. One of the best and time-honoured ways of expressing that pride is to embody it in national symbols including, of course, a national flag for which people do have some real, genuine affection. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I hope that our culture never becomes as sentimentally obsessed with flag waving as the culture of the United States of America appears to be-in this respect the United States, as in so many other contexts, does rather seem to do things to excess-I think we can do rather better than the present undistinguished and undistinctive bith of cloth which we have inherited from our colonial past and which manifestly does not set anybody's pulse racing in the community at large except, perhaps, the occasional Returned Services League blimp or a proportion of the tory back bench opposite. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ah, there we come on to it. I want to make reference to this and say simply in general terms that I endorse the kinds of remarks made by Mr Hurford in the other place when he spoke on this subject on 10 September, while not necessarily endorsing his preoccupation, which he apparently shares with my learned colleague, Senator Mulvihill, for medieval armoury. At the same time, I take the point he made about the desirability of there being some distinctive imagery of this kind to replace the rather indistinctive imagery that is there at the moment. One of the most important incentives to produce a flag which can generate a bit more enthusiasm than the present one must be said to be the flag pole which will occupy such a pre-eminent position in the new Parliament House. It is perhaps getting things rather tail about to let the architecture design the flag. I think one of the reasons people have been critical of the pre-eminence of the flag pole in that design is that nobody is especially happy about our present flag assuming for the future such an obviously central role in our imagery about ourselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am well aware of the endless argument that is possible on this subject. I certainly hope that we do not find ourselves in the Canadian situation. The Canadian Parliament was bogged down in 1965 for almost six months, almost to the exclusion of all other business, while it debated committee reports and kicked the arguments backwards and forwards both as to the colour of the flag and on what its content should be. I think it would be helpful to generate officially, perhaps through the auspices of the Bicentennial Authority, some sort of competition designed to elicit a systematic response on these questions, such as what our national colours should be. We should consider whether they should be the blue and the gold which seem to be the official status colours but which do not really appeal to anybody as having any relevance to what we think of as being the Australian colours-obviously the green and gold. What sort of design would best and most effectively assure recognition of the flag as being a genuinely Australian symbol?</PARA>
<PARA> I do not express any personal preference at this stage except perhaps to make a couple of points. One is that I am rather fond of the Eureka design-I am sure that will appeal to Senator Mulvihill-this being our one really significant indigenous attempt at flag making. I regret that that design seems to have been captured by the looney Left of this country in recent years and that its real potential for being a unifying symbol of the nation for the future has, to that extent, been somewhat diminished. I hope that as a result of this kind of exercise it might be possible to recapture some of the original democratic and national pride associated with that imagery. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am endeavouring to do that. If I ignite the honourable senator's flame at least that is a start. Failing that, I say that I have a sneaking preference-and I think this might appeal to Senator Mulvihill even more-for a design which embodies in some simple and elegant fashion Australia's most spectacularly well known symbol, and that is the kangaroo, perhaps in the form of a yellow and gold design. I acknowledge that this might be thought to be bordering a little on the kitsch to contemplate our fauna being elevated to this kind of status. But there are ample precedents elsewhere for various exotic bits of a country's fauna or flora appearing on the national flag. If we are talking about a flag as being a symbol of a country's recognition around the world, it is very difficult to argue otherwise than that that would have the greatest effect.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>On 22 September, the Senate agreed to the establishment of the Select Committee on the Government Clothing and Ordnance Factories to inquire into the future of the Australian Government Clothing Factory at Coburg and the Ordnance Factory at Bendigo. The Committee has to report by the first sitting day in November on the Ordnance Factory at Bendigo. It has become necessary for the Committee to have further time to consider properly this aspect of the reference. In a little over a month, since the matter was referred to the Committee, it has met seven times, twice travelling to Bendigo-once for a public hearing-as well as holding public hearings in Canberra with representatives of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA> A wide interest has been shown in relation to the future of the factory. To date, with the inclusion of a submission that arrived from the Australian Council of Trade Unions just a few minutes ago, the Committee has received 18 submissions, most of which are of considerable substance. To consider properly the issues raised in the submissions and the public hearings, the Committee requires additional time in which to report. Indeed, the view was expressed in public hearings in Bendigo that the Committee should not be limited in its investigations by a short reporting time. The Committee is mindful of the reasons for the short reporting time imposed by the Senate in relation to the Ordnance Factory at Bendigo and I can assure the Senate that the Committee is applying itself to the task of reporting as quickly as possible. I would hope that, if the Senate sits for two weeks when it resumes the week after next it might just be possible to have the report ready for presentation by then but, failing that, it will be available as soon as possible thereafter. I think the end of November would be about the best the Committee could do. A bit more time is needed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I express my concern that further time has been sought by the Select Committee on the Government Clothing and Ordinance Factories. I understand its reasons for seeking further time. It was my prediction at the time when the Committee was established that it would not be able to perform the task that the sponsors of the motion to establish the committee seemed so readly to give to it. My colleague, Mr Bourchier, in the other place and my colleagues in this place, Senators Missen and Hamer, and I have put an enormous amount of time into consideration of this problem in the city of Bendigo. We have considered representations from many people in Bendigo and we have also made a number of representations to Ministers. We were aware that it was more than likely that at least some 18 submissions would be received as Senator Martyr has confirmed has occurred, and that there was a wide interest in this matter in Bendigo. It was clear that a proper investigation of this subject would take considerable time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What concerns me is the effect that this inquiry is having on the people of Bendigo who have had their anticipations aroused by the sitting of the Committee. I recall speaking to Senator Siddons when he indicated that he intended to go ahead with this motion. I put to him outside the chamber that there was no chance of the Committee having an adequate consideration of this subject matter and coming up with its conclusion by 1 November. He assured me that he could see no reason why it could not comply with this timetable. Then, Senator Button, seeing the opportunity for some political gain from this matter, leapt in and supported the proposal that the Committee be established and that it report by the first week in November. </PARA>
<PARA> What absolutely staggered me was to discover that the Opposition had appointed Senator Button to the Committee. Senator Button must be, apart from Ministers of the Crown, the busiest senator in this place. For Senator Button to get himself on the Committee and to expect it to be able to bring down a report within a few short weeks was an absolute nonsense and a clear indication to me and to the members on this side of the Senate that he is involved in this matter only for the political gain that he can get out of it.</PARA>
<PARA> I am very disturbed about the people of Bendigo who are waiting on this report, apparently believing that it will in some way or other achieve the objects of the people who are concerned about this matter. Really, Senator Button is playing on their emotions by involving himself with this Committee. Knowing the amount of work that he has to perform, there is no possible chance of him being able to assist the Committee to reach a speedy decision., which is what he has been talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bourchier and I have made representations to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) that the Bendigo Ordnance Factory ought not to be sold unless it be sold to a company which does not intend to asset strip it, unless it be sold to a company which has sufficient asset backing and free-flowing capital available in order to put into this Bendigo Ordnance Factory the additional capital that it needs. Frankly, if the Government cannot find a purchaser with those sorts of qualifications, it ought not to sell the factory. I firmly believe that the Government has accepted the recommendations from Mr Bourchier and me and, frankly, I have never been able to see the need for this Committee or for a report other than for the political purposes of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make the point that it is important for the Select Committee on the Government Clothing and Ordnance Factories to proceed. It has become very obvious that the problems of selling the Bendigo Ordnance Factory to private enterprise are very great indeed. There seems to be no way that such a move could be guaranteed. The preservation of the important ordnance work at Bendigo-indeed, the preservation of important ordnance work for our defence production capability in the whole of Australia-is the issue that is at stake.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee has moved with all possible speed. I can only criticise in the strongest terms the comment that Senator Button joined the Committee for political considerations. He has demonstrated by his attendance and the time that he has devoted to the Committee that he is very concerned about the issue, as are the people of Bendigo. We are facing the problem of losing expertise and capability in defence production that has taken nearly two generations to build up. I believe that this Parliament would be acting with complete irresponsibility if it rushed into a decision on such an important issue without have exhausted all possibilities. </PARA>

We are about to sell the one factory than can manufacture naval ordnance and that can repair the ordnance of our ships which may operate in the Indian Ocean. It has become very obvious to the Committee that there is no way that we can guarantee the preservation of this factory in the hands of private industry. There are very real problems.

I visited Bendigo with the Committee. Members of the Committee are approaching their task with great diligence-with much more diligence than the Government approached the actual decision to get rid of the Government Ordnance Factory. Criticism was made that Senator Button joined the Committee so as to make political points. Maybe some political points have to be made because the representations of Senator Lewis and Mr Bourchier appear to have got nowhere. I will at least give Senator Lewis credit for staying in the country, not going away for three months and representing the electorate from some 12,000 miles away.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Gietzelt moving a motion relating to Notice of Motion No. 56. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that since 1977 the Government has been conducting a review of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. A number of senators, both Government side and, particularly, Opposition, have raised a number of questions with respective Ministers for Administrative Services. In this place we have directed our questions to Senator Withers, Senator Chaney and Senator Peter Baume, who represents the current Minister, Mr Newman, who succeeded Mr John McLeay. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's patience on the question of reviewing the Electoral Act is just about exhausted. The Opposition has sought the goodwill of the Government. Mr Hayden discussed this matter with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) with a view to establishing a joint select committee to look at the Commonwealth Electoral Act only to be informed over the last couple of days, due to the Government's haste to get the House up because of embarrassment caused by a whole series of incidents during 1981, that the Government had finally decided not to agree to the establishment of such a committee. As I indicated in June, the last occasion on which I raised this matter, it was the intention of the Opposition, having discussed this matter with the Australian Democrats, to establish a select committee in the spring session of Parliament. If we are denied the opportunity to do that, the task of reviewing the Commonwealth Electoral Act will not be able to be undertaken in the life of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to put it to Government senators that all we are asking for at this stage is that a select committee be established. It would be able to conduct one very short meeting before the Parliament rises for this year. Following that meeting we would be able to invite submissions from interested bodies throughout Australia. The Commonwealth Electoral Office would have the opportunity to make a submission. We would then be in a position to carry out that essential review of the Commonwealth Electoral Act during the following year and, depending on the evidence that is available, make recommendations to the Parliament in respect of this matter. Just to emphasise the point, Senator Chaney in reply to a question by Senator Button, said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chaney said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can give no indication as yet as to when the results of that review are likely to come forward for Government consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>That was on 12 September 1978-more than three years ago. Senator Mulvihill then directed a question to Senator Chaney, who said that it was the intention of the Government to bring forward a general review of electoral laws. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is my intention to discuss that general review with the officers of the Australian Electoral Office within the next few weeks and to get some idea of the parameters of that proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>On 17 October 1978 Senator Chaney, acting in his new capacity as Minister for Administrative Services, made that statement. Senator Sibraa asked a question of Senator Chaney on 20 March 1979. Senator Chaney said:</PARA>
<PARA> I will refer the matter . . . to the Minister for Administrative Services--</PARA>
<PARA>At that time Mr McLeay was the Minister. Senator Chaney continued:</PARA>
<PARA>who is responsible for the conduct of the review of the Commonwealth Electoral Act which is at present still with the Commonwealth Electoral Office and has not yet come before the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I then asked questions. Mr Braithwaite asked a question of Mr Newman on 2 December 1980, almost a year ago. Mr Newman said:</PARA>
<PARA> At present the Chief Electoral Officer and I are examining the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the conduct and the administration of elections. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked a question a couple of days later to which Senator Baume said that the matter was still under consideration. Senator Missen has asked several questions this year on matters relating to the Electoral Office. I have asked another two questions in recent times about tolerance, redistribution and the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I think we are entitled to say, without in any way discussing the substantive motion, that the patience of the Opposition has expired. I would believe that if the Senate were to look at this matter in an objective fashion it would agree with our attitude. We are not asking for approval of legislation. We are not asking for the Government to be put on trial. We are taking a position in respect of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. We are asking for the establishment of a select committee. I understand that senators from both sides of this House-that includes senators from the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and the Government parties-are prepared to serve on such a committee. All we are asking is for the right to establish such a committee. I have a copy of the report which has been referred to by previous Ministers and which this Government has had since 22 August 1979. That report states that there has been no substantial overall legislative review of the Commonwealth electoral law over the last three-quarters of a century and no major consolidation since 1918. </PARA>
<PARA> Are we going to leave it in the hands of the Executive, of the government of the day, which is clearly procrastinating and delaying for its own reasons? One cannot understand why it is doing that. That report has been in the hands of the Government for more than two years and I am led to believe that a second report has been called for. That has still not been made public. I have asked for this report to be made public. Fortunately, when I was walking around the streets of Canberra a document fell off the back of a truck and therefore I have that document. It indicates that from the Commonwealth Electoral Office there is a great, pressing need for a review of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The document draws attention to the fact that Australia has undergone many changes. Perhaps that of greatest significance in relation to electoral law has been the increased mobility of the Australian electorate. One could go on and talk at great length about what the report says. For example that since the Commonwealth Electoral Act was first enacted there has been a great change in the whole way in which elections are conducted. </PARA>
<PARA> The report draws attention to the fact that the major political views in Australia have hardened largely behind a small number of political parties-the National Country Party of Australia, the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party. It draws attention to the fact that communications have changed dramatically, that radio and television are now the main forms upon which advertising and election campaigns are conducted as distinct from the method used when the Commonwealth Electoral Act was first enacted during World War I. Of course then one stood on the street corner and explained one's point of view to those who assembled to hear it. There has been a very dramatic change in the way in which elections have been carried out in the last 60 or 70 years. The report refers to the importance now of talk-back programs on radio. It also refers to the electronic media blackout. I have some disagreement with the Australian Democrats about this, based on my early political experience of what happened in 1942, when we had this dramatisation of politics during the last 24 hours of an election, which brought about changes to the Australian Broadcasting Act of that time. Of course, the report also refers in great length to the need to have limitations placed on expenditure in respect of elections. Surely these are matters which the public at large, and the Senate in particular, would have some interest in. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also draws attention to the differences in the way in which election campaigns are conducted in Western countries. It mentions the changes that have occurred in countries of Europe, the United Kingdom and Canada and the need, therefore, to have some limitation on the amount that can be expended on election campaigns. Similarly, it talks about the differences that exist in the four main countries of the Western world-the United Kingdom, Western Europe, Canada and Australia. For example, it is interesting to note that in the United Kingdom if 50 candidates present themselves for 50 different electorates then those various political parties have equal access to the British Broadcasting Corporation for the presentation of their policies and their candidates. In Western Europe the general tendency is to have free time based on the degree of electoral support. </PARA>

We will do it now because we are facing a situation where we may have an election next year and it is essential that these matters be considered before that is done. Can we trust the Government over this matter and trust it to do this? I think that has a bearing on Senator Gietzelt's motion. I do not think we can. The Government very cynically, during a journalists' strike, when it knew that it would not get publicity, abolished and repealed those sections of the Commonwealth Electoral Act which concerned disclosure of expenses. Half of the Australian community still does not even know that that happened, that that matter had been put forward by the founding fathers in the Commonwealth Electoral Act as far back as 1902. I was looking through the Hansards. That provision was cynically destroyed by the Government so that it had the Electoral Act in such a state that it could spend as much money as it liked from any source it liked, without disclosing it. When we raised that question and I objected to it in this place, the Government said that it would hold an inquiry. But the Government was very careful not to have the inquiry until after the 1980 Federal election. The Government cannot be trusted in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This makes it urgently necessary for those of us on this side of the House who want this matter to proceed to do so by the suspension of Standing Orders now. It should not have been necessary for Senator Gietzelt to get up and suggest that we suspend Standing Orders. There is no reason why we should all have to use this device of the House as much as we do. The Government should recognise that it does not control this Senate, that it is not the majority here, it is the minority. I am not saying that in any threatening sense, but in the sense that it should reasonably accept the things that the Senate says and wants. </PARA>
<PARA> The idea that we should have a select committee has been a matter of discussion between the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party for some months now. We believe it will be a select committee of enormous importance and we believe it is a matter that the Australian people want discussed. One of its terms of reference will indeed refer to that cynical and cowardly Government action of deciding that it would remove from the Commonwealth Electoral Act any kind of disclosure of expenses so that it can go to its friends and get as much money as it likes. The Government does not say who that friend is, if indeed he is a friend. Believe me, that friend is no friend of this country. Such friends are the people who want to exert undue influence on the Government, and the Government has cleared the way so that they can do that.

<PARA> That at 8 p.m., after the further consideration of papers pursuant to sessional order, intervening General Business be postponed until after the consideration of General Business Order of the Day No. 62, Senate Elections (Queensland) Bill 1981; No. 89, Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Bill 1981; and No. 138, Industrial Democracy Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>I move this motion because of the agreement that on Thursday nights we debate Opposition business. Certain agreements have been reached to discuss three items of business tonight. Unfortunately, for some reason best known to itself, the Government has decided to change this arrangement and deny Senator Colston the opportunity to speak to his private member's Bill. We on this side of the chamber feel that it is inappropriate that Senator Colston should not be allowed to do so. He should be entitled to have his motions debated. No doubt he will have something to say on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It is disturbing to recall that Senator Colston has been trying to get his Bill before this chamber for some time. He has been very co-operative. He has been prepared to stand down from the list of speakers and deny himself an opportunity of making a contribution in an area that he was particularly keen to speak on in order to have his Bill debated. This opportunity is being denied. I do not intend to speak at any length, but co-operation to the Government seems to mean-we listen to the Government speak about a little goodwill and a little co-operation-that we do what it happens to want to do and not what we might want to do. The one night of the week when we have the opportunity to debate business that we think ought to be brought on, the Government has decided, capriciously I suggest, that it wants something different, despite the fact that this is contrary to an arrangement which we have made with it. That is why I have moved the motion that this evening Senator Colston, Senator Evans and Senator Siddons present their private members' Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to speak at great length on this matter. It is very difficult, when one is the person involved, to see some things objectively. We have just been given an amendment, which certainly I will oppose, which drops to the bottom of the list tonight, the private member's Bill which I presented to this Parliament. This probably suggests it will not get on. If we had been given some reason for that amendment by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) things might have been different. It is very hard to argue against what he has moved when he does not put any arguments forward himself. It is very hard to put counter-arguments to nothing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that what is going on at the moment is a deliberate ploy by the Government to shelve this Bill because it thinks it might go through this place tonight. It reminds me very much of the behaviour of the Government earlier this year. We all remember what a hard first session we had because of the amount of legislation that was going through the Senate simply because the numbers were here for the Government at that time but those numbers were not going to be here from 1 July onwards. In fact the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on the program AM recently admitted that this was so and used this as justification for getting Parliament up early. But that is not the real reason for getting Parliament up early; he simply wants to get the Parliament up so that he will not have people peering over his shoulder all the time. What is happening this afternoon reminds me very much of what happened earlier this year when the Government was using the temporary numbers it had to get some legislation through. Because it does not have the numbers today, because one of its supporters is away, it is fearful that this legislation might go through. I cannot see why it is fearful. There is nothing terrible about the legislation that I have presented. </PARA>
<PARA> What is happening here this afternoon also reminds me of something that happened in mid-1975 when I was not a member of the Senate. The Government then used contrived numbers in this place to make sure that an elected government was sent to the polls early. Some of those contrived numbers were put there because I was not here. I should have been here under normal circumstances, but because of a maverick government somewhere else, somebody else was put in this place to replace a Labor Party member who had died. I am reminded of these things this afternoon because of the way the Government is behaving. </PARA>
<PARA> I presented the Senate Elections (Queensland) Bill earlier this session. I had it ready well before the session started but I took my time and waited until it was satisfactory to people on both sides of the chamber for me to introduce it. I accepted that I might have to wait. I introduced the Bill in the session prior to the end of June and gave my second reading speech. There is nothing in the Bill that is really controversial. I have waited patiently to have this Bill debated. I thought perhaps I would come back with some comments at the end of the debate so that the Bill could pass this place and go to the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week it was indicated to me that by 5 o'clock some time would be set aside for the debate of that Bill. I realised at that stage that we might have a tight debate if we commenced at 5 o'clock. But I was willing to accept that we would start the debate then. A number of honourable senators were speaking on the appropriation legislation. I deliberately took my name off the list of speakers, even though I wanted to make a contribution to that debate, so that there would be more time available for the debate of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> A major statement was then brought down and at 5 o'clock a debate commenced on the Sinai peacekeeping force. At that stage I rose and mentioned that I had deliberately taken my name from the list of speakers on the earlier legislation and that I would be unable to make a contribution to that debate and to the Senate Elections (Queensland) Bill. I said words to the effect that it looked as if we would have to arrange a different time for the debate. I can recall Senator Carrick sitting and nodding very wisely and very gravely, giving me the indication, certainly not by words but by action, that we would debate this Bill at a subsequent time. It seemed, from some of the comments that were made, that it would be debated this week. This week when I came back to the Parliament and spoke to my Whip I found that the Government had decided that this Bill would be the last item of business for the next Thursday night. That certainly was not acceptable, and all this week my Whip and my leader have been trying to make arrangements to have this Bill brought on. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this is almost a deliberate breaking of an agreement that we made last Thursday. All of the indications were that the Bill would be brought on and would be debated. Of course, if it is debated today it might pass through this chamber and be transmitted to the House of Representatives. Last week an indication was given to me that, if the Bill were debated, a motion would be put forward to the effect that the Bill be held back until February next year. The indication was that it would be held back until February so there could be consultations with the Queensland Government. Honestly, I do not know what the Queensland Government has to do with this Bill. Those people who read the way the Bill is written and who look at the Constitution will know that this matter is one purely for the Commonwealth Parliament alone. If the Queensland Government were to be consulted to make sure that it agreed to the provisions of the Bill, we would be here in 100 years time still waiting for the Queensland Government to agree. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Queensland Government has not used the particular provision that I am talking about, the provision is still there for any government, which loses some speck of decency, to gerrymander the electorates in Queensland for the purpose of electing senators. What is wrong with this Government, if it has to consult with the Queensland Government before a Bill such as this comes on for debate? Is it afraid of the Queensland Government? That situation reminds me of one of the other powers contained in the Constitution that this Government can use which is in relation to making laws for Aboriginals. That power was given to the Government in the 1960s by an overwhelming vote from the people in a referendum. Yet this Government seems very timid to use those powers when it comes to doing anything for Aboriginals within Queensland. Unfortunately, this Government seems to be afraid of the Queensland Government and seems to be afraid to do anything that might peeve it or that the Queensland Government might think should not be carried out. This Parliament has the power to take the action neccesary in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, it seems to me that any agreement made by the other side has to be taken with a grain of salt. I made the point last week that I was beginning to understand what my Party Whip had to put up with in this place. I believe that, if an agreement is made by the Government, it should be kept. The Government should have known that the Bill was expected to be brought on for discussion this Thursday. Therefore, I will oppose the amendment moved by Senator Messner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats for reasons similar to those expressed by Senator Colston will oppose the amendment moved by Senator Messner. It seems to me totally inappropriate and rather petty that, in a Senate so evenly divided, on matters of Senate Business the Government should seek to bludgeon its way through on every occasion that it can. That is totally inappropriate. It would be far more appropriate if in fact it were possible for the progress of this type of business to be arranged by agreement. Traditionally, Thursday night is for dealing with Opposition business; therefore, it seems to me that, in dealing with Opposition business, surely the Opposition parties ought to be consulted. We have expressed a wish that the Senate Elections (Queensland) Bill 1981 should be brought on first.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Government wishes to operate in that fashion, we may go back to the time, mentioned by Senator Colston, when his Bill did not come on for debate for the reason that the Government wished to spend time in the Senate talking about the Sinai peacekeeping force. The Government by leave sought to talk about that. In fact that leave could have been refused as the Government did not have the numbers to force a discussion of that item here in the Senate. The Opposition parties allowed leave because obviously it was an important statement. To accommodate the Government and to allow it to have a statement made here in parallel with a statement in the House of Representatives, it was thought reasonable that we should accede to the Government's request in relationship to that matter. What do we find? Our reasonableness in acceding to that request was subsequently used against the Opposition parties in this chamber to their detriment. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that, if this chamber is to operate in any reasonable way from now on, the Government should look again at the Bill and allow the arrangement of business, as proposed by the Opposition parties, to be followed, firstly with consideration of the Senate Elections (Queensland) Bill, followed by the private member's Bill that Senator Evans intends to move and then the private member's Bill proposed by Senator Siddons. That does not seem to me to be unacceptable. It is a perfectly reasonable proposition. I appeal to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) that he see this as a reasonable proposition in terms of the arrangement of Senate business and allow it to go ahead so that in future weeks, before the end of this session, we may not have a Senate where leave is not always given and a variety of other devices of this chamber used to disrupt business. The motion moved by the Minister seeks to disrupt the business of the chamber. It is a direct disruption of the business that traditionally is allowed to the Opposition Parties on Thursday night. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I rise briefly to make the point that we understand that Senator Colston did in fact withdraw his name in respect of the appropriation Bills last week. In fact discussion was set down in respect of his Bill for last Thursday night but we did not discuss that Bill for the reason that there was an urgent matter in connection with Sinai and many other issues were raised in respect of the transport and communications area. As honourable senators might recall, a number of papers were dealt with in this chamber at that time and that delayed discussions. I say that perhaps Senator Colston should be in a better position to influence his colleagues in future. I think there is another reason which is more important and which supersedes all of those other factors. This relates to the fact that the Government is in a position where it needs to have legislation for social security pensions and repatriation pensions passed before 1 November; otherwise no pension rises will be paid after that date. Consequently, it is necessary for the Senate to consider this legislation as promptly as possible. Therefore, I invite honourable senators to carry on with the job.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I understand that I have a right of reply. I do not want to hold up the debate this afternoon but nothing of what the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) said when he originally put down his amendment or now justifies the amendment. Not one argument that he put had any relevance to what we were talking about. The first point I make is that Senator Colston's Bill has nothing whatsoever to do with the passage of social security legislation this afternoon or any other time. The time that has been given to the Opposition on Thursday nights is intended to enable us to deal with certain matters. It has been agreed that we will handle those matters on that night. All that we are talking about here is the order, nothing more. The three items that are to be debated tonight are in a certain order according to our wishes and in another according to the wishes of the Government. Not one statement has been made to suggest why we have to change our order.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps that is it. Perhaps Government supporters have the delusion that it is they who will make the decisions. As a matter of fact, if one might so comment, all this week we have seen examples of that. On one night we had the ridiculous situation of the debate being delayed from 10.30 to 11 p.m. simply because a Government Minister wanted that to happen. We sat until 20 minutes to 12 and achieved absolutely nothing except bad will-simply because that Minister said: 'I will say what is going to happen in this place'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This afternoon we are dealing with another Minister. I will not nominate him but he made the statement this morning that it is he who decides that the Opposition business will be in order such and such rather than in the order that the Opposition wants. Clearly, the Government had no objection to Senator Colston bringing on his Bill tonight because, very generously, it has said: 'You may have it as No. 3'. The Government has produced no arguments as to why it should be No. 3-simply that it wants it in that order. This is the one night of the week when, traditionally, we have been allowed to organise our own business. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me back to the point that the people on the other side of the chamber have no idea of tradition. We saw that in 1975 and we have seen it since. It is all very well for them to scoff. They like to get their own way all the time. Senator Withers, who is smirking in the background, is the person who said: 'We will never act as an Opposition. We will bring down the Government. That is the only job of an Opposition'. Yet we have Government supporters coming in here every day and saying: 'A little goodwill, gentlemen; a little co-operation, senators'. Goodwill means doing what Senator Carrick wants in this place. Co-operation means doing what the Government wants. I suggest that we throw out this amendment and, on our business night, employ the order that we want, not the order that the Government wants. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill provides for amendment of the Repatriation Act and associated Acts to give effect to the Government's Budget decisions and for certain operational and machinery amendments intended to facilitate administration. In the Budget context, service pension is to be extended to Australian mariners; repatriation benefits are to be extended to all representatives of Australia who suffer death or incapacity while serving with peacekeeping, observation and monitoring forces of the United Nations, or any other recognised international body; disability pensions are to be paid to former members of the Royal Papuan Constabulary and the New Guinea Police Force; and the proportion of disability pension to be disregarded in determining eligibility for service pension and fringe benefits is to be increased. In addition, the pensions payable for amputations or loss of vision, and the amounts payable for many other repatriation benefits are to be increased. Supplementary assistance, known as rent allowance, is to be increased. The operational and machinery amendments are simply to correct certain operational shortcomings, to clarify certain provisions, and to align the legislation with modern drafting practice. I will deal with these briefly after I give details of the Budget initiatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As announced in the Budget, eligibility to receive service pension is to be extended to Australian mariners who served in a theatre of war during the 1939-45 War. An Australian mariner is broadly defined as any mariner employed under agreement in sea-going service during the 1939-45 War on a ship registered in Australia. It includes Australian mariners employed in seagoing service in a ship registered outside Australia. Persons who served in a lighthouse tender, pilot ship, hospital ship, troop transport, tug, cable ship, salvage ship, dredge, supply ship, fishing vessel or fisheries investigation vessel are included in the definition. These men were not members of the Forces but civilians who, in undertaking their normal occupation, were subject to dangers from enemy hostility. This extension of service pension will be effective from 4 February 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Repatriation benefits are also to be extended to all representatives of Australia who serve overseas with peacekeeping, observation and monitoring forces raised or organised by the United Nations or any other international body. At present, for a member of the Armed Forces to be eligible to receive repatriation benefits he must have had three years effective full time service, or have been discharged medically unfit. Civilian personnel, such as members of police contingents, have no repatriation cover. This proposed amendment of the Act establishes a mechanism whereby Australian representatives performing peacekeeping or similar duties in areas outside Australia where a state of tension exists will be eligible for repatriation benefits. The extension will apply only to those members with service after 1 November 1981 in any force which on the authority of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is designated in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette as being a peacekeeping force for the purposes of the Repatriation Act. Currently Australian peacekeeping forces are serving in the Kashmir region, the Middle East and Cyprus. Following the announcement of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on a possible commitment of Australian forces to the Sinai peacekeeping force, the provisions in this Bill have been examined. The provisions of the Bill in relation to peacekeeping forces would not extend to such a force. The Government has agreed that it will bring forward legislation in the autumn sittings to cover such a force if it is sent to Sinai. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be pleased that the Bill gives formal recognition by Australia of the outstanding service of former members of the Royal Papuan Constabulary and the New Guinea Police Force who, although not strictly members of the Forces, served under Australian Army control from 7 December 1941 to 31 December 1945. Disability pensions will be paid to these veterans from the date the Royal Assent is given and under the same conditions as apply to other Papuans and New Guineans who served as members of the Australian forces during World War II. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, the Government introduced a measure that was widely welcomed by the ex-service community. It provided that only half of a disability pension be taken into account in determining eligibility for fringe benefits. The Government has decided that the proportion of any disability pension disregarded when assessing eligibility for fringe benefits and service pension is to be increased to 60 per cent from 1 January 1982, thus enabling more persons to become eligible for the service pension and still retain fringe benefits. In addition, this measure will increase the amount of service pension paid to many veterans receiving disability pensions for incapacities suffered because of their service. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision has been made in the Bill for increases in many other repatriation benefits to severely disabled veterans and pensions paid to orphans with effect from 12 November 1981. Over each of the past three years these benefits have been increased and thus protected recipients against the effects of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> The pension paid for amputations or loss of vision, which is payable in addition to the repatriation disability pension or service pension, is to be increased by approximately 9 per cent in respect of the various categories of disablement. Also, the rate of attendant's allowance is to be increased from $19.32 to $21.02 a week in the case of a veteran who is blind or is suffering a cerebro-spinal injury. In the case of a veteran who has had both arms amputated or is blind and has lost hearing or speech, the allowance is to be increased from $38.65 to $42.05 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the maximum amount of supplementary assistance, known as rent allowance, payable to a service pensioner to be increased from $5 to $8 a week from the first pension pay-day in February 1982. (Quorum formed). From that date supplementary assistance will be made available only if the amount of rent paid by a veteran exceeds $10 a week, at a rate of 50 cents for each $1 of rent above that amount. These changes are similar to those which will apply to pensioners of the Department of Social Security. The Government recognised that some pensioners currently receiving supplementary assistance could be financially disadvantaged because of the changes to the eligibility criteria and decided that payments would continue to be made to them at the existing rate. Overall the increased benefit will assist many who face increased rent charges. Other increases affecting veterans announced in the Budget, including increases in funeral benefits, clothing allowance, and recreation transport allowance, are to be provided for by the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> I now will refer briefly to the operational and machinery amendments contained in this Bill. Provision is made to bring the terms and conditions of service of persons appointed to the Repatriation Commission and Repatriation Boards into line with those currently applying to other statutory appointees. Provision is also made to simplify and facilitate the processing and hearing of applications for the review of decisions of the Repatriation Commission and Repatriation Boards by the Repatriation Review Tribunal. Certain provisions relating to the review of decisions by the Repatriation Review Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will be clarified. In addition, the Bill corrects certain operational shortcomings and aligns the legislation with modern drafting practice. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, this Bill reflects the Government's continuing concern to see that those who have served their country in times of war or war-like operations are appropriately compensated for any losses they have suffered or sacrifices they have made. It reflects this Government's belief that the main pensions and allowances directed toward the more seriously incapacitated and needy veterans should be kept under continuous review to ensure that these are not permitted to be eroded as a result of inflation. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy President. As I said, this legislation, the Social Services Amendment Bill 1981, is an omnibus piece of legislation, as are all such Bills presented at this time of the year. From our point of view, it contains sections which we support, sections of a technical nature which we do not oppose and two clauses in particular which we oppose absolutely. The Bill provides for many changes to the Social Services Act. Firstly, it seeks to alter the Supplementary Assistance Scheme to increase payments and it seeks to alter conditions of payment of the rent allowance to pensioners and some sickness beneficiaries. It seeks to exclude from the new supplementary allowance future tenants of government housing. It seeks to increase by $3 a week the rate of the incentive allowance payable to the sheltered workshop employees by increasing that allowance from $5 to $8 a week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It provides for the granting of a wife's pension under conditions which will be the same as those applying to the granting of an age or invalid pension. It seeks to increase the amount of child endowment payable for the third and subsequent children. It seeks to extend the circumstances under which double orphans pensions are payable in respect of refugee children. It seeks to prevent the payment of the unemployment benefit to the spouse of a person who is involved in industrial action or the payment of a special benefit to those people. It also seeks to prevent the payment of the unemployment or special benefit to persons who are spouses of people who have had their unemployment benefit cancelled or postponed due largely to failure of the work test or their being deemed to be voluntarily unemployed, except in very special circumstances. Finally, it seeks to increase from $53.45 to $58.10 the rate of unemployment benefit payable to persons aged 18 years or more without dependants. </PARA>
<PARA> Two aspects of the procedure by which this Bill has come to the Senate must first be referred to by the Opposition. The proposals contained in this Bill were announced in the Budget on 18 August this year, some two months ago. One further provision, the intention to correct the income avoidance practices of some pensioners in this country, was also announced in the Budget but it is not included in this legislation. It has been delayed until at least next February. One assumes that is because the Government cannot work out how to do it. One assumes that, once again, the Government has made an anouncement without thinking the matter through. It is typical of the Government that legislation like this, containing so many varied proposals, should be presented to this Parliament for debate at the absolute death knell of the session and should be brought into this House three days before some of the proposed increased payments-namely, those made to the unemployed without dependants-are due to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also typical of the Government that pressure should be applied to the Opposition to consider the Bill and its provisions in haste, using those very increased payments as a weapon to attempt to bulldoze the associated unsatisfactory aspects of the Bill through the House. That, in fact, is nothing less than blackmail. We heard the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner), in the debate immediately preceding this, using that sort of argument to encourage this House to ignore its normal procedures and, in fact, to rush through this legislation. It is also typical that the Bill after its long gestation period is, on the admission of the Government, a defective Bill. It is defective in drafting and will need amending at a later date to correct a mistake in the section dealing with refugee children. </PARA>
<PARA> The intent of the legislation was announced in the Budget. The introduction of the legislation has been delayed deliberately to truncate the debate. The legislation is not satisfactory, even in the Government's eyes, after that time has elapsed. The unsatisfactory and controversial sections of the legislation are tacked on to the inoffensive sections in an attempt to stifle opposition. The Opposition is expected to fold against this pressure to satisfy the desire of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to have the House of Representatives rise early to avoid the discomfort he is suffering from the exposure of his and his Government's inadequacies in that place. We have no intention of yielding to this pressure. We have no intention of assisting the Prime Minister who, in typically cowardly fashion, is running away from his responsibilities to this Parliament. Legislation of this type involving the well-being and the civil rights of the less fortunate members of our community should be introduced in time for proper consideration and proper debate by all members of this Parliament, and not rushed through in three days. The device of tacking on offensive legislation to essential changes to overcome opposition is cowardly. The Government should put its controversial items separately and debate and defend them on their merits. It is for this reason that I have given contingent notice of motion to seek to separate the segments of the Bill which we find offensive out of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me first deal with the aspects of the legislation which change the supplementary rent assistance system. At present the maximum assistance is $5 a week for pensioners in rented accommodation who have an extra income of less than $6 a week. After a free area of $1 a week the amount made available is reduced dollar for dollar so that after $6 a week no supplementary allowance is paid, with the exception of married couples who have their income calculated as half their combined income. Under the new system only pensioners who pay more than $10 a week will qualify. The rate of payment will be half the rent in excess of $520 a year up to a maximum of $8 a week and the amount will be reduced by one half the annual income of the pensioner. </PARA>
<PARA> Pensioners who are in government housing, particularly State government housing and Commonwealth government housing such as that subsidised at Glebe, at Jervis Bay and in some Aboriginal areas, in future will be excluded from receiving the supplementary rent allowance. It is worth while noting that those in local government housing, which is also subsidised, will still receive the supplementary rent allowance. In fact, there is also a saving clause which means that those who are already receiving the supplementary allowance and are in those circumstances of government housing will continue to receive it. </PARA>
<PARA> In June 1980 there were 400,000 people in this country receiving supplementary assistance. There were 188,000-odd aged pensioners, 102,000 invalid pensioners, 55,000-odd widow pensioners and 45,000 supporting parents. Under this scheme the Government claims that about 300,000 private renters will improve their situation and we certainly agree that that should happen. About 130,000 others currently receiving supplementary assistance will continue to receive it at their current rate, due to the savings provisions in the legislation. So only about 30,000 new people will come into the supplementary assistance scheme as a result of this liberalisation of the system. But this is only a guess, as is the estimate that this will cost $20m this year and $50m in a full year. This estimate was characterised by the departmental witnesses at the Estimates committee hearing who described it as being of broad orders of magnitude only. I suggest that that is roughly the departmental equivalent of: We really do not have a clue how many people will be involved and how much it will cost. </PARA>
<PARA> Supplementary assistance has been around since 1958. It has not been increased by this Governmeft since 1975. The strict means test of a dollar for every dollar over the $1 free area has not been increased at the same rate. Those pensioners who have been paying rent since 1975 have, in fact, received no extra assistance from the present Government. In that time there has been no real attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of this method of assisting people in housing. One can remember the housing allowance voucher experiment which cost the Government in excess of $1m. It was to be evaluated but it was killed before it got under way. It was an ill-conceived program but it was an expensive program which was destroyed halfway through its initial stages because, I presume, the Government came to realise that this was an ineffective way of providing housing. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, since 1975 the amount of money available for public housing has been effectively halved and the amount of assistance available to the States for public housing has similarly been reduced. In this legislation and in this change certainly the Government recognises what the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty recognised, that is, that there are far too many people, particularly pensioners on low incomes, who are in the private rental market. As such we welcome the liberalisation introduced in this legislation. But it is a complicated means test and one hopes that every assistance will be given to pensioners when they seek assistance in this area.</PARA>
<PARA> We do not agree with and we are quite unhappy about the introduction of the clause which in fact prevents those who are in State rental housing from receiving assistance. Those who are in State rental housing at the moment will certainly retain their $5, $4 or $3 assistance but new tenants of State government housing will receive no assisstance at all. The States do not subsidise housing in a uniform way. The States have different methods of calculating the subsidy they will give to housing. Some local governments provide subsidised housing. Their tenants will still receive the supplementary assistance but those in State government housing will not. This, we believe, is an unnecessary discrimination. In housing estates in this country we will have two groups of pensioners-one group under the saving clause receiving supplementary assistance and their neighbours, who have come in after the commencement date of this legislation, receiving no assistance at all. We believe this is a form of discrimination. It is unfair to State housing tenants. To a certain extent it will assist private landlords who will bid up the price of rent as they inevitably do when more money becomes available. It cuts down effectively the amount of housing assistance available to the States because the States, in calculating their subsidies, take into account the supplementary assistance which has been available previously through the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole exclusion of State housing tenants, we believe, is unfortunate. We believe we are in a situation where, with increased interest rates, increased costs of housing and increased costs of land, more and more people are being forced into public housing. At the same time public housing is not being made available to make up for this increase and we believe moneys would be better spent and, in fact, more money should be spent on the provision of public housing stock. In the amendment which I will move to the motion that the Bill be given a second reading we ask the Government to reconsider this. We ask the Senate to express the opinion that, in fact, people renting public housing should not be excluded from payment of this supplementary benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the situation where supplementary rent assistance will continue to be paid for those who have been on sickness benefit for more than six weeks. But once again, one of the poorest groups in the community, one of the most disadvantaged groups in the community, the unemployed, will receive no rent assistance at all. The Government, through this legislation, although it liberalises the provisions for some people, in the long run is saving money at the expense of pensioners in housing commission homes and pensioners in other forms of State accommodation. In fact, it does nothing at all to ease the very difficult housing problem which we face in this community, and which everyone realises we face in this community. </PARA>
<PARA> The next section of the legislation I will deal with concerns those who are on the unemployment benefit, who are adults-over the age of 18 years-and who have no dependants. This year this group will have its first increase in the unemployment benefit since 1978. The increase to $58.10 a week still leaves those people $11.60 a week and $603.20 a year poorer than single pensioners of the same age and in the same circumstances, and in fact who have the same needs. These people will receive $69.70 a week from next week. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that we realise the discriminatory nature of the Government's action in removing this group of unemployment beneficiaries from the provisions of the indexation clauses in the legislation. They are being paid less. They are not receiving the automatic increases received by others who are dependent on social security benefits. They have a more restrictive means test than other pensioners and although their level of permissible earnings has been improved, their current earnings limit discourages them from seeking part time employment or from seeking to assist themselves. Inevitably this encourages deceit; it encourages people to seek to get around the provisions. A single unemployed person over 18 years of age working part time can keep only $28 of his or her earnings before losing the rest on a dollar for dollar basis. However, a single adult pensioner can earn $20 without losing anything and then loses only $1 for every $2 earned. </PARA>
<PARA> If we really want to encourage the unemployed to take casual or part time employment to get experience in the work force and to help raise themselves above their difficult circumstances, the present financial difficulties are too severe; the disincentive is too severe and is not in keeping with the Government's asserted aim that it wishes to help those who help themselves. There are over 19,000 single people over the age of 45 years on the unemployment benefit. No one can accuse them of being dole bludgers, as so many members of the Government like to do; no one can say that they are sponging off their parents. Many of them are out of work because their skills are no longer appropriate. Many are out of work because of technological change in industry which has made great differences to and great inroads into the occupation levels of many industries. They should not be treated with any less dignity and they should not be given less support than their contemporaries who are on other benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reading speech says that the level of unemployment benefit has been struck with regard being given to the needs of such beneficiaries as well as to the continuing needs for restraint in Government expenditure. It is quite apparent that restraint in Government expenditure has won in this situation over any regard for the needs of this unfortunate group. Those aged 45 years and over make up one of the most rapidly increasing areas of unemployment in our community. It is for this reason that we include a section in the second reading amendment expressing our distress and concern that these people have once again been neglected. </PARA>
<PARA> Another group that is completely neglected in this legislation, and which has been completely neglected since 1975, is that of those on unemployment benefits who are under 18 years of age. Since April 1975 they have been paid $36 a week, which is now almost $40 a week below the poverty line for a young person living alone. Certainly most do live at home with their families but, as has been said in evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare over and over again, the situation of the young unemployed trapped at home because of the inability to move with this $36 payment, in what is sometimes a hostile environment particularly in those areas where unemployment for two generations is common, is potentially difficult and destructive not only to the person who is unemployed but also for the structure of the family itself. It contributes considerably to the problem of homeless youth. </PARA>
<PARA> For those people who are away from home, either because they live in rural areas where there is insufficient employment or in other areas of low employment and move to seek employment, the $36 a week is an absolute pittance. It is absolutely impossible to live on that, as has been repeatedly pointed out to the Senate Committee on which I serve. According to a survey of the Department of Social Security last May, there were 40,000 under 18 years of age unemployment beneficiaries. A total of 8,500 of them-more than one in five-had been on unemployment benefits for more than six months. Thirty-six dollars is an absolutely inadequate payment. It is impossible for anyone in this community, particularly living away from home, to live on $36. It creates the problems which we know are common amongst our youth. It particularly contributes to the problems of the homeless youth in our community. It is for this reason that we again include in the second reading amendment, as we have in past years, an expression of opinion by the Senate that something should be done about this unfortunate group. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now deal with the provisions in the legislation which the Opposition find offensive and discriminatory and which we utterly oppose. I refer to those sections of the legislation which deal with the spouses of unionists affected by industrial disputes and the spouses of unemployed persons who have failed the work test or are deemed to be voluntarily unemployed. Against vigorous opposition not only from the Australian Labor Party in this Parliament but also from the trade union movement itself, from welfare agencies in the community, from councils of social service, from churches and from most newspapers in this country, the Government introduced a provision whereby not only unionists directly involved in industrial action could seek no assistance from the department of Social Security-no one is advocating that that should be the case-but also unionists indirectly involved in the dispute could not do so. This included unionists stood down because of a dispute in the same union which may have occurred in another State or which may have occurred hundreds or thousands of kilometres away and of which they may have no knowledge, and certainly no opportunity to influence. </PARA>
<PARA> We pointed out at the time that the ridiculous situation could arise where there could be a dispute by one union in, say, Newcastle which means that people in car manufacturing plants in South Australia will be laid off work. The people laid off who are members of the union taking part in the dispute in Newcastle would not receive unemployment or special benefits. Their neighbours, in another union, could receive those benefits. This was discriminatory; it was using the social services legislation as a weapon in industrial relations and in industrial disputes. It demonstrated to everyone the absence of a sensible Government industrial relations policy. It was an abuse of the Social Services Act, which is an Act designed to assist people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Social Services Amendment Bill proposes to extend to the families of unionists the penalties involved in the existing legislation. The wives, and indirectly the children, of those involved in or affected by industrial disputes in which the members' unions are involved will now no longer be able to claim the unemployment benefit; they will be able to claim the special benefit only in cases of what the Bill describes as extreme hardship. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has told us in his second reading speech that, because of the operation of the social security system as it now stands, union members are largely insulated from the effects of their actions when they strike. This is simply not true. Families are very seriously affected when members choose to begin and prolong an industrial dispute. Their living standards inevitably drop because of the pay lost and as each day goes by that loss becomes greater. </PARA>
<PARA> Strikers in this country do not choose industrial action lightly. They are aware of the problems that they will face when they go on strike. The social services that their spouses have been able to qualify for have been minimal. They are certainly not an insulation against the loss of regular wages and salary. The wives who were able to claim unemployment benefit had to pass the work test. They had to go through the week's delay involved. They had to demonstrate that they were able and capable of taking part in paid work. They had to qualify in the same way as any other unemployed person to get assistance. They are now to be penalised because they happen to be married to someone who is involved in an industrial dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1979 legislation which extended the ambit of restricting the unemployment benefit for unionists was bad enough. This, however, is even worse. It is just another step in the Government's battle against the trade unionists of this country, in the Government's battle to restrict trade unionists from using the right to strike, a right which is only absent in totalitarian governments of the Right and the Left throughout the world. I believe that it is hard to understand how a government whose members are paid at the level they are and whose Ministers are paid at the level they are can say to the family of a unionist who is indirectly involved in a dispute that it cannot receive the minimal payment of the single unemployment benefit plus any assistance it may get on top of that because of children. As I said, it is part of the war against the trade union movement. However, to extend that war to the wives and children of trade unionists is ludicrous and discriminatory. We utterly oppose that provision in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> That provision is also being extended to the families of people who failed the work test or had their unemployment benefit withdrawn for the mandatory six to 12 weeks, a penalty which was also initiated by this Government. The latest figures show that work test failures accounted for only 1.6 per cent of the terminations of unemployment benefit. This is not a major social problem in this country; it is not a major problem for the Department of Social Security. The unemployed are already penalised by having their benefits postponed. Each month there are just over 1,000 postponements of benefits. Three-quarters of the persons affected have no dependants. So we are probably talking about a maximum of about 300 families who have had their unemployment benefit stopped or refused because they were allegedly dismissed for misconduct, were voluntarily unemployed or had failed the work test. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe we can make two initial comments about this. The first is that those families could be victims of some of the suspect primary decision-making processes which we know exist in the Department of Social Security and in any other large departments. In 1979-80 half of the appeals against the decisions of the Department which were finalised finished up in favour of the persons appealing, the majority of whom were unemployment beneficiaries or applicants for unemployment benefit. Almost one-third of the appeals were conceded by the Department as departmental error even before going to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. Furthermore, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has given decisions in some cases to appellants rejected by both the Department and the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. A wrong decision-one not taking in or accepting all the facts-can be made in an office of the Department of Social Security. Under this provision a whole family can be financially crippled because neither spouse will be allowed to receive unemployment benefit or special benefit. This kind of legislation is heavy-handed, it is unwarranted and it inevitably hits the innocent. It does not hit those who can work the system. It does not hit the smarties who know how to use the system. It will also affect voluntary agencies inevitably because these people seek help from voluntary agencies, such as the Salvation Army and St Vincent de Paul. They are run by people who know what will happen; they are run by people who protest as much as anyone about this sort of provision. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I wish to make is that the penalties for being voluntarily unemployed, failing the work test or being dismissed are already very harsh. Single unemployed persons can lose up to $600 when their unemployment benefit is postponed and married unemployed can lose over $1,000. We are penalising people from $600 to $1,000 in this situation where they fail to comply with the regulations of the Department of Social Security. Recently a 24-year-old man was fined $500 for having knocked down and killed a child while under the influence of alcohol. This was his third conviction. In 1978 when the maximum fine for drink-driving was $400, nearly two-thirds of the drink-driving convictions were between $100 and $200. In 1979, when the penalties were raised, four-fifths of drivers convicted for drunkenness were given fines below $500. Surely these are crimes against society. Surely these are crimes that deserve penalties. But these penalties are completely out of proportion to the penalties which are applied to people who fail to comply with the regulations of the Department of Social Security and therefore have their benefits removed for six weeks to 12 weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> It is totally out of proportion to treat people who it is alleged voluntarily leave a job or leave because of misconduct as more serious and deserving heavier penalties than drunken drivers with recorded offences. It is absolutely ludicrous to penalise on top of that their wives and children who have, and certainly usually have, no effect on their feckless or irresponsible behaviour, if that is what the Government wants to call it. It is getting at the people the Government is aiming to get at through their wives and children. This is ridiculous and harsh. No Parliament should tolerate the passage of this sort of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We feel so strongly about this that we believe we should wipe clauses 18 and 21 out of this legislation. We think it is outrageous in the extreme for the Government to say 'If you do this we then will not pay the unemployment benefit increases to the single unemployed' and to try to blackmail people in this Parliament who are taking a responsible attitude to this legislation by suggesting that we may deprive someone else. This part of the legislation should be excised. The Government should accept the legislation with this excision. It should accept that it was wrong and that it should not act in a discriminatory way. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) said in another place that people would be able to get special benefit in cases of extreme hardship. There is no departmental definition of 'extreme hardship', but it is probably related to the provisions for immediate hardship, which are roughly defined in the Department's manual of instructions on unemployment, sickness and special benefit. The manual states that persons may claim special benefit if a person has no work and no money. One cannot get much greater hardship than that. The manual points out that provided the applicant has a reasonable explanation for the lack of funds, it may be expected that hardship exists. The test of 'reasonable' is the same as the test of reasonable in the steps taken to obtain work and so on. It is never spelled out so that people can understand the position. It is always the Director-General of Social Security or one of his delegates who makes the decision about what is reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> We are informed by the Deparment that if there is less than the equivalent of a week's special benefit in the house-that is now $58.10 plus allowances if there are children-an applicant probably would be eligible for special benefit. It is far from clear that the possession of $50 or $60 which may be owned in rent or food bills will not exclude the spouse of a person work-tested off unemployment benefit or in an industrial dispute from waiting for an additional week for financial relief. That is an extreme hardship. There seems to be a definition of hardship which is rather more generous; that if there is less than two weeks special or unemployment benefit in the household then the applicant is deemed to be in hardship and eligible for special benefit. But this refers to extreme hardship. </PARA>
<PARA> All the instructions indicate that a person must exhaust all his funds before the special benefit is paid. There can be no right to payment until the applicant is almost demonstrably out of money. We know what will happen in those circumstances. These people will be forced to seek assistance from their relatives, where they can, from their friends, where they can, and from the voluntary agencies to try to get emergency relief where there are such agencies. The effect on some agencies can be gauged by the effect on the Salvation Army in Victoria, which had to close down at the time of the Latrobe Valley industrial dispute some time ago. There is no way that this legislation can be justified. There is no way that this Parliament should pass legislation which tries to get at-as the Government seems to do-the guilty through the innocent. For this reason we put a section in the second reading amendment expressing our disapproval and, we hope, the Senate's disapproval of this legislation. At a later time we will oppose the clauses which provide for this harsh legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We then come to the matter of family allowances, which were introduced by the present Government with a great fanfare. They were a substitute for the old child endowment which had become meaningless because of inflation over the years and the failure to increase the allowance. They were a substitute also for the rebate for dependent children in the taxation system. They were said to be, and I believe they are, a recognition of the fact that it costs money to bring up children and that there are costs involved with parenthood. During the last election campaign the Government and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in particular promised quite specifically late in the campaign that the increased oil revenues, which the Government said were then flowing in, would be used to help Australian families. The implication at the time was-there was no contradiction-that they would be used to increase the family allowances for Australian families, which had not been increased since they were introduced, despite roughly a 50 per cent inflation rate since then. In this same election campaign and in repeated speeches both inside and outside this Parliament the Prime Minister and his Ministers have said over and over again that they wish to direct funds to those in most need. In this Budget the Government has increased family allowances for those with three or more children. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not deny that those with three or more children deserve an increase in their family allowances. I do not begrudge that increase for one moment, nor would I oppose it. But the simple fact of the matter is that those families compose about a quarter of all Australian families. There are many more poor families with one or two children than there are with three or more children, even though the proportion of poor families in the large family group may be higher. This provision in the legislation gives 76 per cent of Australian families nothing. For about the same percentage of pensioner families in this country who have one or two children, this legislation provides nothing. When the Government introduced family allowances in 1976 the Prime Minister announced that it was the greatest advance in social services since federation. I remember that the present Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) was a bit more circumspect about it and she said that it was the greatest change in the decade. It was pointed out by speaker after speaker that it was a recognition of the costs of parenthood. It was pointed out on the Opposition side, which welcomed the change, that unless the allowances were increased each year to cope with inflation we would end up with the situation we have-of their value being eroded by some 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Government made the changes in this Budget-changes which are legislated for in this legislation-it said that it was part of a proposal to increase payments to those in greatest need. Not everyone agrees. Certainly no one on this side of the House agrees, and government members do not agree. Mr Ross McLean, a member of the House of Representatives, who is known to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> This money is distributed universally; that is, on the basis of a certain specified contingency-the number of children in a family-and not on the basis of whether a family is in a situation of financial need. The trouble with this approach is that millionaires' families and high income families, such as those of members of this Parliament if they have three or more children, will get help while low income families with two children or less will get nothing extra. I cannot see the equity in that. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with Mr McLean. I cannot see the equity in that. Mr McLean continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It means that those families in real need are not being specifically targeted for assistance. Low income families with three or more children will certainly benefit from this initiative, and that is highly commendable, but they will benefit accidentally rather than as a result of deliberate government policy directed towards the needy. </PARA>
<PARA>We must get to the stage in this country where we target the needy and where we aim our policies at the needy. If the Government wishes to introduce a universal benefit like this and if it were government policy to do so, then it is up to the Government to make sure that t'e universal payment increases in line wit' inflation. If it wishes to take an alternative approach, I suggest an alternative approach would be that of the Australian Labor Party before the last election, to target on those families which have low incomes and large numbers of children and direct the family income supplement to them. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Government wishes to persist with a universal benefit of this type, we believe that we should point out that it is not being honest with the people in the community, that it is not keeping up to the promises that it made when it introduced the family allowances and that it should therefore be requested by this House, in line with its own policy to increase those benefits to all families in the community. If it did so, if the family allowances had been indexed after their introduction, a family with one child would now get an extra $9.30 a month; a family with two children would now get an extra $22.37 a month; a family with three children would now get $25.07 a month; a family with four children would get $27.77 a month; and a family with five children would get $30.82 extra a month. That is how much these people have fallen behind due to the failure of the Government to continue with its stated policy of 1976, when these allowances were introduced, to assist those with families. It is for this reason that we include that item in the second reading amendment that I shall move. </PARA>
<PARA> I then move on to a couple of the less controversial parts of the legislation. The first is the amendment to bring wives' pensions of those who live overseas into line with age and invalid applications. In other words, they will need to make their applications in this country. We believe this is fair and brings it into line with the rest of the legislation, but there is still what I believe is an unfortunate anomaly for those Australian pensioners living overseas. Bearing in mind that we have a policy of portability of pensions, despite the opposition to it by some Government supporters, we should treat people who live overseas equally. The situation is that if a woman qualifies for a wife's pension under our legislation, she is paid that pension. She has been granted it in keeping with our legislation but if her husband dies, she must return to Australia and at great expense apply for the widow's pension; otherwise she is completely dumped by the Australian social security system at the very time her husband dies and at the very time she may need help. I can see no justification for this situation. I believe it is an anomaly which should be changed and I believe the Minister should consider seriously having his Department look at this anomaly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. The matter of providing the double orphans' pension for refugee children certainly has no opposition from this side of the House. We understand the Minister's difficulty with the drafting mistake and his attempts to correct that mistake. We are sure he will correct it as soon as possible but, as I said initially, that is typical of the problems which arise when the Government introduces legislation which has not been thought through. In general, the Opposition would want to see this legislation passed because we want to see the extra family allowances granted and we want to see the single unemployed receive their increase in the unemployment benefit. We would like to see increases in the unemployment benefit to those under 18 years. We would like to see an extension of the family allowance system to provide for those families which are in need. We certainly have no reason to object to the other provisions in the legislation. But I repeat that we do have considerable opposition to clauses 18 and 21-clauses which discriminate against the spouses of unemployed people and the spouses of those people who have lost their unemployment benefit through other circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These clauses are not essential to this legislation. They certainly have no real effect on the Budget. There is no attempt made to suggest how much these measures will save the public purse. There is no attempt able to be made because I do not believe the Government could even make a close guestimate at what it is trying to save. The basic aim of the exercise is to attack the trade union movement, to try to use the Social Services Act to prevent people from taking industrial action when they feel that they need to, action that they never take lightly. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that the contentious areas provided for in clauses 18 and 21 were so peripheral to the Government and to the Government's Budget that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) did not even bother to mention these proposals in his Budget Speech on 18 August. There is no reason for this Bill to stand or fall on the result of these two clauses. We find the principle involved in these two clauses so offensive that we will certainly oppose them. We certainly believe that the situation in the Senate is that they will be opposed, they will be defeated, a request will be made that they should go back to the House of Representatives. We urge the Government not to be bloody-minded, not to attempt blackmail, but to accept the view not only of the Senate-the view of the Opposition particularly in this place-but also to accept the view of everyone who has commented on these provisions, everyone who has knowledge in the area of industrial relations, in the area of social security and in the area of social welfare that these clauses should be struck out of this legislation. Then there will be no difficulty for the Government in getting its Bill through, no difficulty in paying benefits after next Sunday to the single unemployed over 18, no difficulty in fact with all those other provisions in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> An amendment has been circulated in my name. It sets out six points on which we believe the Senate should express an opinion as to how this legislation can be improved. We hope that the Government acts reasonably in this matter and realises the strength of conviction of the people who oppose those clauses that we find offensive. I move:</PARA>

<PARA> (1) the removal of the discrimination against tenants in government housing;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) the removal of the discrimination against the adult unemployed without dependants;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government would indeed like to see this legislation dealt with by the Senate today because, as Senator Grimes has indicated, the increase in the rate of the unemployment benefit payable to those persons aged 18 years and over without dependants is to commence from 1 November which, as Senator Grimes has already said, is in a few days' time. I am very sorry that this legislation has been introduced so late in this session but it was not deliberate, as Senator Grimes has said. Indeed, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) has been very clear on this. He has gone to great pains to explain why the legislation was delayed. He explained that the need as seen by the Government to strengthen the means test criteria relating to eligibility for the pension had proved far more complicated than was envisaged. As a result the introduction of this legislation was delayed, but not deliberately, as I said. For Senator Grimes to say it was deliberately delayed because the Government wanted the Parliament ro rise earlier than had been planned really has nothing to do with this matter. It does not matter when the Parliament rises. The Government needs this legislation passed by 1 November.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government cannot support Senator Grimes's suggestions to separate the provisions in the Bill or that there be a request to the House of Representatives for amendment.

But it is interesting to note the number of honourable senators who have put their names on the speaking list. There are eight of us. If we all intend to take the time that we are allowed to take I think it would be clear to everyone that the Bill would not be able to be returned today to the House of Representatives. I have decided because of the time restriction not to speak any longer on this legislation. As a matter of fact, I am rather disappointed because I believe the legislation is extremely good. But I am willing to forgo my speaking time in the hope that there will be some co-operation between the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. I am not asking for co-operation with the Government.

<PARA> This afternoon we are debating the Social Services Amendment Bill which attempts to bring into legislative form those initiatives which were outlined in the recent Budget. Talking about the Budget, it is quite remarkable that it is now late October and only four or five people have actually spoken on what we call the debate on the Budget Papers. I can recall one year, I think it was 1978, when, after the Budget was introduced, it was noticed that there was still one speaker on the Government side in continuation on the previous Budget papers. It seems as though we will have the same thing this year. Although we have been able to debate certain parts of the measures contained in the Budget as the legislation has come through to us, we have not been able to speak on the Budget as a whole because the Government does not seem to be able to arrange its timetable satisfactorily. This afternoon my colleagues and I on this side will make some comments in relation to those matters of social security contained in the Budget because they are oulined in the amendment Bill that we have before us now. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Budget was brought before us and we looked at the proposed social service legislation we saw little good news. There was some good news but not a great deal. I had hoped that the Government would have taken this opportunity, in a non-election year, to redress some of the injustices that exist in the social welfare area in Australia. I was disappointed, however, to see that some provisions concerning unemployment and sickness benefits were not included in the Budget. Having looked at the Budget, I wondered whether I was wrong and whether we would have had a better deal had it been an election year. The Budget was disappointing to me and to many people in the community who are dependent upon social security for their livelihood because so much was left undone. I should like to outline some of the things that were left undone and then go on to talk about some of the aspects that are contained in the legislation before us. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of us, quite rightly, meet pensioner groups to hear what they have to say. Many of us meet pensioners individually in the course of our duties as senators. When we do meet them, we find that the more militant pensioners are quite vocal about what they believe the Government should provide. I think they are quite rightfully vocal. If they are not vocal about their rights there will probably be very few people in the community who will support them. One of the difficulties is that many people in the community do not realise the problems of pensioners, particularly age pensioners, until they become pensioners themselves. I recently attended a meeting of pensioners in Brisbane where pensioners were outlining some of the demands, as they call them, or requests that they had of the Government. I was very pleased to see at that meeting a fairly youthful official from a trade union group. He had come to that meeting to listen to what these people had to say and perhaps even to give them a little bit of advice if that was warranted. He came to the meeting because he said it was quite wrong for him as a trade union official not to be interested in pensioner matters or matters of social welfare because so many of his members would eventually become dependent on social welfare. He thought the trade union should have some input into the area. I thought that was a refreshing attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> When we hear of the concerns of these people we realise that many of them feel that they have been let down. I should like to mention a few of these areas where nothing has been done. Perhaps we can have a look at these areas in future years. I refer firstly to the pensioners who are aged 70 and over. I can remember before the 1972 election that both major parties promised that they would ease the means test for certain pensioner age groups. Certainly there was a difference between the two parties about how they would do it, but prior to 1972 there was general agreement that whoever won the 1972 election would take some steps to ease the means test. In fact the Australian Labor Party won that election and it first freed the means test for people aged 75 and over. Later the age limit was reduced to aged 70 and over. I might use the words 'means test' from here on but I probably mean the income test, because that is what applies now. To talk about a free of means test or a free of income test pension for those people aged 70 and over is now a myth because this Government changed the policy in relation to these people and froze the amount of pension that a person could get free of income test. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people retired believing that they would be able to obtain a free means test pension when they were aged 70, and they ordered their life accordingly. Now they find that they are not in that position. The people I feel particularly unhappy about in this regard are not those who are aged 70 and over but those up in their eighties and nineties who cannot quite understand why suddenly their standard of living is dropping because the purchasing power of their free of means test pension is decreasing as inflation is increasing. They are falling further and further behind, and they cannot quite understand why this is happening. I think this is something that we must look at. I asked the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) earlier this year how much it would cost to restore a full pension to these people. It seems to me that it is an amount of money that we could have a look at quite readily. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I should like to mention the fringe benefits for these people in the 70 age group and over. Surely in this age group we could consider giving them a pensioner health benefit card. I believe that if we gave them this card we would not have half the problems that we seem to be facing with people putting money into non-interest bearing accounts. When pensioners talk about their fringe benefits, the thing that dwells mostly on their minds is the pensioner health benefit card. Certainly there are other things that concern them, such as their rail and rate concessions, but the pensioner health benefit card is something that they particularly look forward to having. As the Minister has pointed out in this place, probably some people are arranging their financial circumstances in such a way as to be a disadvantage to them, but they are doing this so that they can get fringe benefits. If we gave them the pensioner health benefit card I believe a lot fewer people would be arranging their financial situation to their disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, I mention a matter which does not receive much consideration, but which I believe is an injustice to people who are age pensioners. I have mentioned this matter to the Minister for Social Security. He has not been convinced, and I am sure that he will not be convinced this afternoon. Nevertheless, I shall mention it in the hope that by the process of mentioning it on a number of occasions eventually he will see the injustice in it. I refer to the fact that Service pensioners are able to discount a certain amount of their disability pension for income test purposes. At present they can discount 50 per cent. When legislation goes through in this session they will be able to discount 60 per cent of their disability pension for income test purposes. Age pensioners cannot do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument which has been presented to me is that ex-servicemen should be able to have something extra to provide for their having fought for their country and for having gone overseas and been members of the fighting forces. Certainly that is so, because servicemen are able to apply for service pensions when they are aged 60 years. As well as that they are able to discount any part of a disability pension which they might have. A disability pension does not have to come to from war service. It may have been granted for a disability received whilst the serviceman was in Australia. There are a number of aged pensioners who did not go overseas but who incurred a disability whilst in Australia and therefore obtained a disability pension. They cannot discount that disability pension but have to count all of it for income test purposes. I believe that we should look at this matter to make sure that the aged pensioner who is receiving a disability pension for service purposes is able to discount that pension in the same way as the person who receives a pension through the Department of Veterans' Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention a fourth area in which nothing has been done where pensioners believe they have been let down. There is no change in this Budget to the income level for the income test for pensioners. The permissible income for a single person remains at $20 a week and for a married couple remains at $34.50. If they exceed either of these limits, they incur some loss of pension. If the amounts of $20 and $34.50 had been increased in line with rises in the consumer price index that $20 would now be about $34-which is quite a difference-and the $34.50 would now be about $50 . It seems to me that it would be more equitable for pensioners if this were increased especially considering the current high rates of interest that these people might earn on money invested. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in reference to the areas that have not been included in either the Budget or the legislation I mention a matter about which pensioners on a lot of occasions have complained to me. They have complained that the cost of living seems to be catching up with them even though their pensions are increased in line with the consumer price index. If we we look at some of the indices which are much more important for pensioners, especially the food index, we find that they are increasing at a greater rate than the consumer price index. Perhaps the consumer price index is not the best index that we could have for determining increases in pensions in order to keep them at a purchasing power the same as they had before inflation took its effect. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter that Senator Grimes mentioned is particularly important. I suppose that concerns another thing that was not done in the Budget, although it was indicated that that might be done then. That matter concerned the Government's giving a clear indication of what was happening in relation to the clamp down on people holding money in non-interest bearing accounts. There was something in the second reading speech of the Minister, though this did not really go far enough because pensioners are still apprehensive about what might be coming next year. I believe that there are a few things that the Minister should do. First of all, he should increase the ridiculously low permissable weekly income of $20 a week for single pensioners and $34.50 a week for married pensioners. As well as that, he should bring down the legislation that he intends to bring down or he should announce a total abandonment of it so that pensioners will not remain apprehensive as to what might happen in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Budget and certainly in the social services legislation there is some indication of increases in supplementary assistance. Supplementary assistance will increase by $3 up to a mapimum of $8. This is some relief but it is still pitifully small. If the $5 we presently have had been increased in line with the consumer price index, it would be so close to $10 that it would not matter. If the increases had been made, that $10 would be available to everybody. But the $8 is not going to be made available to everybody. Apparently the Government does not believe in making adjustments to some of the benefits in line with the consumer price index. </PARA>
<PARA> That $3 is not available for all. It will be available only to those living in non-government housing. Those who are in government housing will not receive any increase but will stay on the $5 a week, if they are receiving the maximum of $5 a week at the moment. After the legislation comes into effect, they will not be able to receive the full amount. They will not be able to receive any amount if they move into non-government housing after a certain date. Those who do receive the full $8 will have to be paying $26 a week for their shelter whether it be housing, board or lodging or something like that. I guess that it is not possible to find housing for less than $26 a week so those who are paying rent will probably receive the full amount. It must be remembered that not everybody will receive the extra $3 a week. I do not believe that this is the real answer to the problem. The only way that we will really get to the bottom of the problem is to have a dramatic increase in the amount available for welfare housing. That would provide some relief for those people faced with exhorbitant rents. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage, I mention that earlier this session I was given some misinformation by the Minister. I hope in his reply on this debate that he might indicate that I was given some misinformation. I seemed to ask a rather long question on 9 September. I do not like to ask long questions but I asked my original question and then a supplementary question, which I admit is unusual for me. My question concerned the first dollar of income that a person had if that person were receiving supplementary assistance. It had been indicated that that person would lose 50c out of that first dollar. In fact, in the supplementary question I said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget Papers mention that there will be a loss of $1 for every $2 of other income, which I suppose is the same as saying it is a rate of 50c in the dollar. At the moment a person who has $1 of extra income does not lose any part of the supplementary assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the situation at the moment. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Does it actually mean that from February next year a person who has $1 of extra income will lose 50c out of that first dollar?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Chaney gave me a very succinct answer by saying 'Yes'. I notice that the second reading speech, amongst other things, said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . $1 of assistance is withdrawn for every $1 of income in excess of a $1 'free area' for single pensioners and $1 for every $2 above the first $2 for pensioner couples. </PARA>

<PARA> I now turn to the matter of unemployment benefit. One area that is disappointing here is that there has been no increase for those who are less than 18 years of age. The amount that is available to them has remained at a miserly $36 a week. I say 'miserly' because the amount has not been increased since this Government has been in power. It is the same amount as was available in 1975 when the Whitlam Government was in power. It seems the Government has abandoned this area altogether or it has abandoned this group of people under 18 years of age. It may be that the Government has the philosophy that the family should care for these people. But I ask: What if the family is in poor circumstances? What if the person does not for some genuine reason wish to live at home, or cannot? What about those in rural areas, where employment prospects are poor, who decide to go to some other rural area or perhaps to the city to seek work? How is he or she to do that on $36 a week? This anomaly must be looked at because there are significant problems for young people who are dependent upon that payment of $36 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as though in Australia this is a small problem. Youth unemployment is a massive problem. Some recent figures that I was able to find show that, of the 15 to 19-year-old group, almost 100,000 are unemployed. That represents about 15 per cent of the members of that age group. The figures are perhaps even more telling when we look at the breakdown. About 12 per cent of the males in that age group are unemployed but about 18 per cent of the females are unemployed. Thus, about one in five of all girls in the age group lacks employment. This is a large problem and one that is producing some fairly severe social effects. </PARA>
<PARA> I noticed in the Courier Mail of 22 October a headline which read: 'Boredom with lack of work led to robbery'. I would like to quote some parts of this rather long article to indicate what I mean. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Two young women, well educated, from good homes, but bored and depressed by unemployment, robbed a 70-year-old taxi driver at knife-point, the Criminal Court heard yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Justice Sheahan described the robbery as 'dangerous and stupid'. Two respectable girls had embarked on an armed robbery with a knife. </PARA>
<PARA>The article went on to describe what had happened, how the girls were brought before the court, where they had been living and so on. Then it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Justice Sheahan said the case was most unusual . . . </PARA>
<PARA> He felt strongly that the girls' robbery motive was a mixture of boredom, frustration and depression and being unemployed and a shortage of ready cash. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the sort of situation that we face when we have a large group of unemployed, in that age group especially. If as a society, we ensure that they will be short of cash by paying them only $36 a week when they are actually looking for work we are looking for trouble. It seems to me that in regard to this group the Government has its head in the sand. It is time the Government was given a push to bring it back to reality. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect which was mentioned by the Opposition's spokesman in this field, Senator Grimes, is the way in which the Government has failed to honour its responsibilities in regard to family allowances. The Bill allows for an increase in family allowances for the third, fourth and subsequent children of a family. That is fine. These people definitely do need an allowance. But families with one or two children have been left out in the cold. I remember well that when the family allowance system was brought down in this Parliament great play was made of the fact that it was one of the major advances in social welfare in this country. Probably it was, but at the time a trade-off was required. Taxpayers used to be able to claim deductions for their children. Those deductions were taken away. The amount that was spent on family allowances that year equalled exactly the amount that was saved by removing taxation deductions for children. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall that when I mentioned that fact a former senator, Sir Reginald Wright, who was sitting on one of the front benches opposite, interjected in his gruff but very perceptive way: 'Ah yes, that is correct but you must remember that the redistribution will be much better'. It may have been but the point I would like to make is that if those tax deductions had remained we would have expected them to be indexed in the normal way. If they had not been there would have been an outcry from the taxpayers. However, now that they have been subsumed in family allowances they have not been indexed. They should be so that the Government can keep itself honest in regard to trading one for another. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, we must remember that many people are heavily dependent on family allowances. It is unfair that those with only one or two children should be denied an increase. As an indication of how some people are dependent on family allowances, I would like to read part of an article which appeared in today's Sydney Morning Herald. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> A mother of six who was put on a bond yesterday in Blacktown Court of Petty Sessions for stealing goods worth $2.04 said later she only did it because she was tired of always having to ask for charity. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Mrs . . . who is separated from her husband, said she received a pension worth $232 a fortnight but it was not enough to keep her family. </PARA>
<PARA>The article is accompanied by a picture of the mother with five of her six children. Certainly, $232 is not much with which to look after one adult and six children. This sort of person does depend on family allowances very heavily. We should ensure that such allowances are indexed. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to mention the aspect of the legislation that concerns me most. I refer to the decision in the Budget to prevent the payment of unemployment benefit to the spouses of people who are engaged in industrial action, who have been refused unemployment benefit or who have had such benefit cancelled or postponed. </PARA>
<PARA> In Brisbane at the moment some women are actually drawing a benefit because their spouses have not been able to obtain a benefit due to some other provision in the Social Services Act. One of the plants in Brisbane has been idle because it has not been able to get parts. There is in Victoria a dispute involving a union which also has members in the Brisbane plant. Therefore, those in Brisbane who have been laid off have not been able to get unemployment benefit; but at least their wives and children have been able to do so. Those wives and children did not have anything to do with what went on down in Victoria, yet under this type of legislation they will not be able to draw such a benefit. That seems to be an old fashioned measure which belongs to the Dark Ages-certainly not the type of democracy in which we live. If the Government wants to do something in regard to industrial relations to force people to stay at work and has a mandate to do so it surely should do so by way of industrial relations legislation, not social security legislation which, as the name implies, is intended to promote the welfare and well-being of people in the community. That as a proposal that the Opposition will be trying to remove because it believes that it is alien to social security legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) will be relieved to hear that the majority of the 24 clauses in the Social Services Amendment Bill are uncontroversial so far as the Australian Democrats are concerned-which is not to say that they are beyond criticism, because they are not. In the main, the Bill is an unexceptionable one. It provides for some increases in some pensions and benefits, although I would argue with the statement made by the Minister in his second reading speech that it embodies improvements in the field of social service pensions and benefits-unless he defines an improvement as something which manages to stop some recipients from finally tumbling into the realm of total and abject poverty. I do not question for a moment either that this Bill reflects the priority given by the Government to ensuring that assistance is provided to high need groups, as the Minister asserted in his speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I do question is the morality of defining groups in the community as either needy or not needy and then dividing the group labelled 'needy' into two other groups, one marked 'needy-no extra assistance provided' and the other marked 'very needy-some extra assistance provided'. The proposed amendment to the motion that the Bill be read a second time indicates clearly the groups that we consider are discriminated against. They include: Some tenants of government housing; the adult unemployed without dependants; unemployed people under the age of 18 years; first and second children in some families-all first and second children have not been given an increase, but obviously some are more in need of an increase than others; the spouses of union members affected by industrial disputes; and the spouses of unemployed persons who fail the work test and who, therefore, are disqualified from gaining the unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> To us the present situation really is not good enough. Either there are needy people in the community, all of whom warrant government assistance, or there are not. If a goverment does define one or more groups in the community as needy, it should do adl within its power to provide all those groups with enough assistance to lift them out of that category. A lot of people in Australia believe that any government which can budget for a surplus of $1,500m can afford to be a little more generous to the poor. A great many people in Australia too wish that the present Government would be as generous and as sympathetic to the plight of the needy in the community as it is to the demands of the mining companies or the big multinationals, many of whose industrial relations and pricing policies are contributing to the hardships experienced by ordinary Australians. All that means, of course-to come back to the Minister's original statement-is that it is a matter of priorities. Clearly this Government's commitment to the needy is low in comparison with its commitment to things such as the oil companies, for example, or perhaps more appropriately at the moment the banking institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no point in quibbling about this issue. We know where this Government stands on the matter. I think most people know where the Australian Democrats stand on the matter. The proposed amendment to the motion that the Bill be read a second time, which we support, makes that quite clear, as do our policies. Our policies have done so since the party was formed in 1977. It is our firm belief that a country allegedly as prosperous and developed as Australia should not force anyone, should not allow anyone, to live below the poverty line. Yet millions of people in this country are doing just that. Inevitably, they are the most vulnerable, the most susceptible, the least powerful members of the community, that is, children, supporting parents, pensioners and the unemployed-the very people for whom a truly compassionate government should and would show the greatest of concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to spend a great deal of time arguing about how much money the Government could have poured into its welfare system. That is a fairly futile activity at the best of times. It is enough to say that more could be done and more should be done-in fact, that much more could be done and much more should be done. It is enough to say that the additional assistance given to pensioners, supporting parents, the children of large families, refugee children and the unemployed over the age of 18 years, does not go far enough, but it is better than nothing. In fact, that is all that can be said of this Bill. If that is damning the Bill with faint praise, I am afraid that that is about all the Bill deserves. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the clauses of the Bill of which I am critical-the ones which seem to me to have no redeeming features; the ones which should not have been included in this Bill in the first place as they have more to do with industrial relations than they have to do with welfare, as Senator Colston has already pointed out. Those clauses are clauses 18 and 21. They are clauses about which I, apparently like Senator Grimes, have had more frantic phone calls from individuals and organisations in the last few days than I can remember having received about any single issue for a long time. Clauses 18 to 21 are the ones which the Government is putting forward as its nomination for the 'blame the victim' award. They are clauses which wreak a punishment on people who have committed no crime and who are not even accessories to a crime. They are the clauses which deny the unemployment benefit to the spouse of a person engaged in industrial action and which deny special benefits to persons ineligible to receive the unemployment benefits under certain circumstances. The Minister had this to say in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA> The present legislation permits a situation where trade unions can choose to strike knowing that through the operation of the social security system their members will be largely insulated from the effect of their actions. The Australian public for its part is attacked from two directions. First, it has to bear the personal disruptions, inconveniences and associated costs brought about by the strike. In addition, it is then called upon to meet the cost of providing income support for the families of those involved in that industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA>Having read that, one is forced to wonder just how aware members of the present Government are when it comes to such mundane matters as the day-to-day needs of families on low or limited incomes; of how far money goes and where it goes in such families; of the sorts of economic pressures those families live under; of just what it is like to try to live on the unemployment benefit or special benefits, even for a limited time. How can anyone seriously make statements like those I just read out? How can anyone believe that unemployment benefits can largely, or even partially, insulate strikers from the effect of their actions?</PARA>
<PARA> How can anyone believe that it is wrong or immoral for a government to provide income support for the families of people involved in industrial action when those families had no say in the decision to strike? It might be, of course, that the Minister, the Government or a bureaucrat is assuming that the situation which applied in Whyalla some years ago should apply in all strike actions; that is, that the wives of strikers should withhold their marital favours, for want of a better expression, until the men go back to work. How can anyone justify making innocent women and children pay twice over for actions which are not of their making? This proposal is worthy of a Shylock at his very worst. If this Government cannot handle the unions in this country other than by taking its pound of flesh, with a good helping of blood, and tears, if not sweat, tossed in from the families of those concerned, it ought to hand the reins over to someone who can. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government argues as well-this was stated in the Minister's second reading speech also-that some women in one-industry towns apply for the unemployment benefit when their husbands are out on strike but 'have no intention of joining the workforce'. One is forced to ask the question, first of all: Why penalise everybody because of special cases applying in one-industry towns? More importantly, is the Government not aware that it is in just those places-places like Whyalla, for instance-that the situation is most parlous for the families of strikers? It is in towns like Whyalla that people are likely to have the least money in reserve to cover times of emergency. A strike is a time of emergency, particularly for the families of the people concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no good to argue that people should not go out on strike and that if they do they should be prepared to take the consequences. That argument is fallacious on a number of counts: Firstly, the fact that some unions are irresponsible is no reason for the Government to follow suit and, secondly, denying unemployment benefits, even single unemployment benefits, to wives of strikers is punishing them and their children for something which was not their fault. If I am beginning to sound like a cracked gramophone record, I do not apologise because that is the whole problem with the clause. It is penalising innocent people for something over which they have no control, presumably in order to achieve an end that the Government cannot achieve by any other method. </PARA>
<PARA> The irony is that the Government is ignoring the fact that it very quickly gets back into its coffers whatever small amount of relief it pays to families in these desperate financial straits because those families spend the money almost immediately-they have to; they have no other choice; they are not likely to save it-on the necessities of life, on the food and clothing they need to survive. It is absolute rubbish to suggest that any special benefit paid by this Government will be spent on luxuries or even more ludicrous is the suggestion that it is sufficient to let families keep up with their 'normal financial responsibilities', which was the term the Minister used. It will not and it does not. What it does do, and what they are entitled to have it do, is help tide them over, in the most minimal way possible, a period of intense hardship. If it is taken away from them it will place an additional and intolerable burden on local welfare agencies, as Senator Grimes pointed out, such as the Salvation Army, the St Vincent de Paul Society and others, which are in receipt of some Federal Government funds and which are already strained to their limits. This, in itself, will be a cost to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> On the matter of the denial of unemployment benefit or special allowances to people 'who voluntarily and without good reason give up their job or who are dismissed through misconduct', I would like to raise the question of just who defines what is a good reason for voluntarily leaving a place of employment. Unfortunately, during yesterday's debate on the matter of public importance I was cut off, if not exactly in my prime, certainly before I had finished what I intended to say. The matter omitted was that of harassment, particularly sexual harassment, of women in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> Instances have been brought to my attention, as well as to the attention of the Women's Switchboard in Adelaide, the Working Women's Centre Inc. and the South Australian Commissioner for Equal Opportunity of women who have been forced to leave their place of employment because of harassment of one sort or another which has made their working conditions absolutely intolerable. When they leave, they do not list sexual harassment by either the boss or a colleague as their reason for leaving. A more tactful, more face-saving and less embarrassing reason is given and it is likely to be a reason which does not meet the requirements as defined by some bureaucreat and hence entitle that woman to unemployment benefit or special benefit. I acknowledge, as I think previous speakers have, that there are people who abuse the system. There will always be people who abuse the system. But we are being asked today to approve two clauses that will allow the system to abuse the people-in fact, to abuse an already disadvantaged group of people. That is simply not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA> I and my party are prepared to accept the fact that the Government does not see its way clear at the moment to extend family allowances to first and second children, despite the fact that to me at least for a variety of reasons those children are more expensive to feed and clothe than any subsequent child. But that is the Government's decision on that matter. We are prepared to accept that when money becomes available presumably it will extend the increase in family allowances to second and, hopefully, to first children as well. I and my party are not prepared to accept that clauses 18 and 21 are necessary, either to this Bill, which they are not, or to the community generally, which they most definitely are not. They are Shylock clauses; that is all they are. The Australian Democrats intend to do whatever we can to prevent them from becoming nothing more or less than instruments of welfare harassment in an industrial relations situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Far from ensuring assistance to those in 'the highest need groups', in the words of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), some of the amendments proposed in this Bill indicate an approach to social welfare which is hardly surprising to those of us who have no illusions about the capacity of this Government to apply anything but superficial solutions to the deep-seated problems which have become such a pervasive feature in this wealthy country. How can the Minister posture about his Government's concern for Australian families when three out of four Australian families continue to receive no more in family allowances in money terms and considerably less in real terms than when this reform was introduced with great fanfare in 1976? Erosion in the value of children's allowances now means that those families with two children, and that includes 820,000 families of whom 63,000 are pensioners, are approximately $22 a month worse off than if the allowance had been indexed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why has the increased allowance been granted to larger families with no apparent concern for those on low incomes? It seems to me to be a very raskq assumption that those with more than two children are the impoverished and in most need of assistance. In the absence of evidence to back up that assumption-and I see nothing to that effect in the Minister's speech-it occurs to me that larger families in these days of more or less effective contraception may well include a fair proportion of the more affluent. We do know that at the end of June 1980 there were 162,000 pensioner and unemployed families with one or two children all living-'existing' might be a more accurate term-below the poverty line. If it were possible for the Government to find no more than an extra $124m for family allowances, surely the money could have been directed towards those in greatest need-a gesture at least towards halting their rapidly deteriorating living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> It is becoming very clear not only that the unemployed are in chronic financial difficulties but also that low wages and greatly impaired purchasing power are amongst the prime causes of poverty. The policies of this Government are accelerating the process to a point where it is becoming intolerable for many households. Escalating home payments, greatly increased costs of keeping a car on the road, pressure to take out private medical insurance and cruel State utility charges will inevitably lead to wage pressures as workers attempt to maintain their living standards. This piece of legislation acknowledges this by clear implication and seeks to impose the crudest imaginable sanction-withdrawal of the right to a benefit from the spouse of the worker who dares to take industrial action. The very fact that this provision appears in the Bill indicates that this Government will stop at nothing in its mindless determination to depress still further the real wages of Australian workers. Because the Government has tried everything else, intimidation of spouses and dependants is the new name of the game. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Haines has suggested, these are people who have committed no crime. I might remind the Minister that even the dependants of convicted criminals are entitled to social security benefits. About 38 per cent of Australian households are dependent upon one income and of these about two-thirds include dependent children. At least, I suppose, if the breadwinner is on strike these latter will have the family allowance between them and complete destitution, providing pension day comes at the right time. It is a wonder that the Government has not thought of stopping that too as further punishment. What a use of social security legislation! Perhaps it is not so surprising, considering the Government's lack of success with its industrial legislation. I refer to the Australian Financial Review of 14 August 1981 and to an article entitled 'ABS on strikes: who solved what' by Paul Malone. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Intervention by Federal Government officials did not lead to the settlement of one industrial dispute during 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> Figures released yesterday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the year show that 21 per cent of disputes were solved by negotiation and 7 per cent by industrial tribunals under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In 65 per cent of the disputes, work was resumed without negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA> Federal intervention has not led to the resolution of one dispute in the last five years. </PARA>
<PARA>There is, as most of us know, a generally acknowledged right to strike. It is concomitant with the right to bargain collectively, which was the subject of Convention No. 98 of the International Labour Organisation, a convention which has been ratified by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The appearance of this anti-worker/anti-union clause in social security legislation indicates just how little regard this Government has for international labour conventions and for its own international obligations. The Government knows well just how vulnerable the families of ordinary workers can be. Average minimum award rates for males in August this year were just on $5 an hour, a little less for females. Even where there is more than one income, the second income is likely to be a part time job, bringing in from $60 a week to $80 a week-just enough to lift the household out of poverty and, incidentally, in many cases to make it ineligible for a disadvantaged health card unless there are several children. </PARA>
<PARA> The capacity of most households to save is very limited. To use Frank Crean's phrase they are just one week's wage off destitution. In many cases they are just one pension cheque off destitution. In at least a third of the cases, this can be the very reason for industrial disputes amongst the employed. These are the people who, if the Government has its way, will be forced to go begging from the emergency relief agencies which are already finding that their meagre resources are stretched to capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> In my own State of Western Australia, the Opposition spokesman on community welfare, Mr K. J. Wilson M.L.A., was reported in the West Australian of 26 October as having said that the demand for emergency relief had increased by 65 per cent in the last financial year. As the combined policies of State and Federal governments bite into the budgets of those with low incomes, it is not uncommon for some people in Western Australia to live without electricity until they can afford to pay the bill and a reconnection fee. Some are able to get a once-off payment from a voluntary agency and then hope that they will be able to pay the next bill in two months' time. </PARA>
<PARA> Another article in the West Australian of 26 October quotes Mr George Smith, the director of the Christian Welfare Centre. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> People have given up luxuries and no longer come to us with hire purchase bills. They are battling for food, power and rent money. </PARA>
<PARA>These are the people whom the Government plans to penalise if they are forced to take industrial action to maintain or to try to improve their standards of living marginally. And what of those 38 per cent of workers involved in disputes in the March quarter of this year, for which we have the most recent information, who stopped work because of what the Australian Bureau of Statistics describes as managerial policies? There are countless well-documented cases of stoppages being deliberately provoked by managerial policies, especially in the mining and construction industries, which the speech of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) singled out for special mention as being a target for the proposed victimisation of workers and their families. One of the most protracted stoppages in recent years in the Pilbara was the Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd strike of 1979. Its cause and its protraction had much more to do with the stockpile of iron ore than with the intransigence of the workers. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the proposed withholding of benefits will give no heed to the rights or wrongs of any individual dispute, of any individual union or of anq individual worker. The Minister and his Government may have been seriously misled if they believe that bullying and threatening workers and their dependants are likely to be an effective way of quelling industrial unrest. Workers' spouses are more and more likely to be workers themselves, or potential or hopeful workers. It should not be assumed that they will not be ready and willing to support industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that there are reactionary organisations and institutions which are dedicated to confusing the public, especially the nearest and dearest of striking workers, about individual industrial disputes. However, over the years of Australian industrial history, there have been heartening examples of workers' wives who have fully understood and thoroughly supported their husbands' industrial action. The Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd strike of 1979, to which I referred, is a case in point. The women of Mount Tom Price, Paraburdoo and Dampier organised to pool their resources and set up a co-operative. Their cohesion and support proved to be a tower of strength. Incidentally, the Tom Price co-operative is still functioning. I do not know whether the payment of the unemployment benefits on that occasion was a significant factor. I doubt it very much but I am sure that withdrawal of the benefit, as the Government now intends, would only add to the resolve of such workers and their spouses. </PARA>
<PARA> Inevitably there will be hardship if the Government has its way. In particular there will be hardship for those who do not necessarily have the support of the trade union movement. I refer to those who are out of the work force, who are categorised as unsatisfactory people, having failed whatever work test happened to be enforced at a particular time. I am absolutely certain that this type of action will have no discernible effect upon the number of industriad disputes. I doubt very much whether the availability of the unemployment benefit was a significant fact in the very determined support of the wives for their spouses of the Queensland coal miners last year or, in another instance, in Pinjarra, Western Australia, where the wives of striking Alcoa workers, despite being bombarded with anti-union propaganda, held a picket line while their husbands attended meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> By seeking to apply primitive social welfare sanctions the Government aligns itself with provocateurs. This particularly nasty section of the Bill cannot be allowed to become law but at least all workers and their families can now clearly understand the priorities of this Government and can be able more adequately to assess just how genuine are its assurances of concern for their economic and social welfare. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate on a rather pessimistic note. The second reading speech encompasses 16 printed pages. Speakers in this debate, in common with that speech, have put emphasis on various categories of social security recipients. I contrast those with a very effective paper that was prepared-I think fittingly-by my deputy leader, Senator Grimes. That paper deals with the history of social security payments in Australia. We started our meagre social security payments just before World War I. Spotted action was taken by some of the States in this area with the most notable being New South Wales on child endowment. Ultimately these efforts were consolidated by the Curtin and Chifley governments during the War and post-War years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Grimes emphasises the contrast between our attitude and that in Europe where a better system of funding was introduced. I say 'a better system' because, at the end of the Chifley era, a surcharge of, I think, 0.25 per cent was imposed on taxable income. The money collected was to go into a welfare fund. The man who brought the operation of that welfare fund to an end was the former Country Party member, Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer, Artie Fadden. I do not think anyone needs a super brain on financial matters to visualise how much money would be in a fund of that nature after a long period of high employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The theme that comes through here is that people who suggest certain innovations in some area in which there has been unquestionable hardship or mixed priorities are told that the Government is limited by its Budget. The value of imposing a surcharge for a welfare payment is that the levy is based on income. As a result a process worker would not pay the same amount as a production manager. The Whitlam Government had one or two other social security initiatives in this regard on the blocks at the end of its era. The Government can always offer excuses but its Budget revenue is such that by robbing Peter to pay Paul it can placate the more vocal element. The Government has to go into the market place, as it were, every succeeding year in the compilation of the Budget and decide who will get what. </PARA>
<PARA> The paper produced by Senator Grimes indicates how we missed the bus. We had opportunities. A very costly inquiry was undertaken into national insurance at the beginning of World War II. That inquiry recommended that a national insurance scheme should be funded on the basis of a contribution of 1s.3d each from the employee, the employer and the Government. This scheme was put in mothballs until after World War II. Of course, a much more stable system operated in Europe during the Bismarck era. Senator Giles referred to the Government's endeavour to portray industrial disputes as the evil dragon that is affecting these things. Probably the main reason why most Western European countries have had effective and stable industrial relations is that social security payments have been self-funded and taken out of the realm of annual Budgets. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, David Connolly, in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald, referred to population trends and the ratio of those working to those who will be retired in 10 years and beyond. I do not agree with his conclusions. Whilst he did not come out with what I advocate in respect of the levy concept-the Chifley welfare levy-it is obvious that he thinks that something has to be done. It is true that people want reduced income tax. However, they also want reasonable welfare payments. I hope that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) will give me more hope than is indicated in the written word about how he will cope with the situation and provide an equitable solution. By that I mean something like the social welfare fund levy which was part of the Chifley thinking and which was sabotaged by Fadden, who only looked from one year to the next. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to deal with specifics. I read a in a certain newsletter that Elaine Darling, a member of the other place, had made a suggestion about permissible income to a Minister. I would like to draw attention to the incidence of stress in industry today. Unskilled female factory workers in their late thirties are often employed in uncongenial work. In some cases unskilled operatives in the printing industry are put on the scrap heap when the firm for which they work is unable to be awarded a tender. A woman of about 40 years of age who uses a guillotine in a biscuit factory and who has to do a lot of bending to pick up things can suffer from varicose veins. In many cases the boss looks upon such a worker as stock for the paddock when it comes to re-engaging her. Senator Grimes and Senator Coleman, with whom I have served on Estimates committees, know that the Director-General of Health and his friends had to do mental somersaults in trying to define what was meant by 85 per cent disability. We know that the pressure on women in non-craft industries is tremendous. The great tragedy is that when workers crack under the system some people say: 'They are only 38; they should be able to rehabilitate themselves'. I know of cases in Sydney where women have cracked and, following psychiatric treatment, have been told by social workers: 'You had better apply for an invalid pension'. There is no doubt that medically one could argue such a case. Some of these women say: 'I want to get back into the work force'. They are faced with a dilemma-they have to try themselves out. </PARA>
<PARA> A girl can work in Sydney on Saturdays and Sundays as a Totalisator Agency Board operator-Senator Giles probably would know more about female awards than I-and bring in with penalty rates about $40 for the weekend. A girl who did that as rehabilitation would be transgressing the social security regulations. It would be difficult for her to move out and rehabilitate herself. If she tried and failed after a few weeks she would have to get back on side to be eligible for an invalid pension. I believe that we would not be so locked into Budget commitments if we adopted the levy concept of funding which I am advocating. I have talked about females in receipt of invalid pensions. However, a male manual worker who experiences back injuries could seek such a pension. It is very easy for the top insurance bureaucrats who sit on their fat bums and who do only half a day's work every two days to talk about phoney compensation claims, but they do not think of the other cases where people try to get back to work. Take the case of a male manual worker with two or three children who has to put off a hernia operation for 12 months. The great tragedy is that in many of these cases the initial ailment is compounded by the higgledy-piggledy approach taken to social security. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines and Senator Giles drew attention to the Government's belief that the man out on strike is an evil person. We hear much about the danger that such strikes pose to society. However, very few strikes these days go more than a week. One of the reasons for this is that people cannot afford to go on strike and get behind with their hire purchase payments. However, we have to look at the double standards. The crimes against society by Gale and Huxley were much greater than the crimes being committed by strikers who go out for a week and cause production to be impaired. Mr Huxley is now living on the north side of Sydney in luxury. It could be said that he paid his debt to society. He may have. But so have a lot of other people who have gone back to the bottom rung. However, the Gales and the Huxleys do not. </PARA>
<PARA> We can talk about the morality of society. People may occasionally transgress in respect of an extra week of eligibility for a social security payment, saying: 'He gets away with it in bigger chunks than we do'. The law has never been geared to meet that situation. Not only should the Gales and the Huxleys have done their gaol sentences for misappropriation but also all of their moneys should have been confiscated by the state. I stand by that. All of the assets of the big financiers who milk Australia should go back into welfare to help the people they swindled. It is time that we got our ethics straightened out and did not have double standards. The judge regards people who went to posh schools as great men and in many cases reduces their sentences. However, the judge is never quite so friendly to people from Blacktown or Richmond and disposed towards giving them the benefit of the doubt. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, in this whole general discussion on social security the whole theme seems to be: 'We will give you a little advantage here but we will recover what we spend in other areas'. Overdue adjustments have been made in some areas. But it is quite apparent to me that we have to get back to the concept of Prime Minister Chifley and build up the coffers for social security during boom years and periods of high overtime. We should adopt standards comparable to those that apply in Western and Eastern Europe. I say Eastern Europe because I went to Eastern Europe during the 1950s and at that time some of the industrial conditions there were far superior to ours. Former Senator John Wheeldon had some outstanding visions about what could be done in the social security area. However, insurance companies and other vested interests do not want any change at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret the punitive nature of the legislation which will apply if someone's husband or the main defendant is on strike. If definition is to be argued, I venture to suggest that there could be cases where it could be very close to a lockout. It could be an indirect effect caused because the boss stands down people in another section. I suggest that there will be as much trouble here with appeals to the Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court as there has been in relation to other legislation dealing with deportation. When one gets into definitions, one gets into a lot of difficulty. Honourable senators will find that we could try to placate some of the newspapers and the National Country Party elements like Mr Anthony who was talking about his blind prejudice on trade unions. I can think of somebody else at the moment going through a legal Gethsemane who was a good friend of Mr Anthony's. I will not name him. I believe that long term funding is lacking, preferably that under the Chifley system. I hope that in reply the Minister will give us some indication of what the Government proposes in that area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is at present debating the Social Services Amendment Bill 1981. It is always good to listen to my colleague Senator Mulvihill speaking on social security measures, because he has, I think, proven to the Senate over the years that he has been here that he has very great concern for the lower paid people and, as we term them, the have-nots. He is never afraid to put a case for them or to criticise the haves. Unfortunately in this country the gap is continually widening between the haves and the have-nots. In many instances this Government shows little concern for those people who, we on the Opposition side claim, are the underprivileged section of the Australian community, particularly many of those in receipt of pensions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While the Government claims that social security is one of its largest costs in the Budget each year, it fails to admit that many of the people in receipt of pensions in this country today are those who worked hard to make this the great country that it was until some six years ago. Unfortunately the situation is getting worse as the years go by. The time is well nigh for another election to bring about a change of government and put into office an Australian Labor Party government which has at heart the welfare not only of people in need but also of people in industry right across the board. We have their welfare at heart. In doing that, we also have the welfare of all Australians at heart. We need to get this country back on the good footing that it was being put on under the jurisdiction of the Whitlam Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that we were not allowed to carry out our task in remedying many of the problems which were created under 23 years of conservative governments. We were not given time to rectify those matters. The first thing that this Government said when it came into office was that it would not interfere with Medibank which was of great benefit to people in social need. That was one of the main planks of Fraser's platform. He said: 'We will not interfere with Medibank'. But the Government was not in office very long when it started tinkering with Medibank, and after six years Medibank no longer exists. Under the Labor Administration and under the Hayden plan for Medibank when Bill Hayden the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Social Security, people who could not afford the necessary medical attention for themselves and their children could receive that medical attention without any fear. But now we have reverted to the position where people who receive over a certain income and who need medical attention, both for their families and, in particular, for their children, have to pay for it out of their own pockets if they do not belong to a private medical fund. Of course, we know by looking at history, that this Government supports private medical funds and private doctors. It is for those organisations and people that this Government shows the most concern. When we were in government we showed our concern for the real needy people of the community. It is unfortunate that because of the many amendments to the National Health Act, we are now back to where we started prior to 1972. The clock has been turned back some nine years. But we have made the promise that immediately we are elected to government we will advance the clock again and bring justice to those in social need. The Opposition spokesman on social security has moved an amendment. I will repeat the words of the amendment for some of those who may not have heard it. I think that the terms of that amendment are worthy and I hope that it will be carried. The terms are:</PARA>
<PARA> The removal of the discrimination against tenants in government housing. </PARA>
<PARA>Previous speakers from the Opposition have broadened that out and pointed out to the Senate a lot of the problems that will beset those people because of this discrimination. The next point states:</PARA>
<PARA> The removal of the discrimination against the adult unemployed without dependants. </PARA>
<PARA>The third one states:</PARA>
<PARA> An increase in the unemployment benefit for the under 18 unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is something that this Government deserves very severe criticism for, because, in my view-I have reared three children-a human being who is 14, 15, 16 or 17 years old in the main wears the same size clothes as a person who is 18 years old. He eats just as much food and burns just as much electricity in his parents' home, if he is living at home. As a matter of fact, he uses exactly the same commodities as a person over 18 years of age uses. Yet here we have a government saying that those people can live on less. I think it is very unfortunate for any government to have to have that sheeted home to it. The fourth point states:</PARA>
<PARA> The inclusion of the first and second children in the provision of increased family allowances in line with those for third and later children. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what we are advocating in our amendment. The fifth point states:</PARA>
<PARA> The removal of the provision discriminating against the spouses of union members affected by industrial disputes. </PARA>
<PARA>My colleague from Western Australia Senator Giles spoke at length on that matter and I will have a few words to say about it too. The final clause states:</PARA>
<PARA> The removal of discrimination against the spouses of unemployed persons who fail the work test. </PARA>
<PARA>It appears, when we look at this document that we are now debating, that the Government is doing everything possible-or trying to do it by way of legislation-to force people to work in industry against their wills and for a very small pecuniary interest. I heard Senator MacGibbon yesterday talking on the education legislation. He used that as a vehicle to once again castigate the trade union movement and tell the people of this country of all the evils that are brought about by activities of trade union members trying to get justice for themselves. He also spoke against the trade union secretaries for trying to get justice for their members. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us who have come up through industry know what a battle it is to get proper working conditions and wages. Senator Mulvihill, as an ex-railway worker, well knows this, and I, as a person who has done every menial job that it is possible to do in this country, apart from coal mining-I spent over 20 years as a shearer and then worked as a poultry farmer-know it. When I was in industry no benefit was even given to a working person in this country unless he fought for it. No matter how good a worker one is, no matter how loyal one is to the boss, he never comes along and says: 'You have done a good job. I think you are entitled to better working conditions, shorter working hours or an increase in pay'. The only way that the work force of Australia can get benefits is to go to the barricades and fight for them. Then we find people on the other side saying: 'You are holding the country to ransom'. They have gone further and coined the term 'dole bludgers'. That is a terrible thing to say against young people, and this Government does not provide work for them. </PARA>
<PARA> When we get up and talk about that we find people on the other side immediately saying: 'But look at the unemployment figures when Labor was in government; look at those unemployment figures'. Those unemployment figures have certainly escalated now that we have a change of government. We do not even see the true unemployment figures now because of the method used by this Government to find out who is unemployed. When we were in government we used the true figures from the Commonwealth Employment Service of those people in receipt of unemployment benefits. But what does this Government do to come up with the statistics of the unemployed? It uses the Australian Bureau of Statistics. We all know-we have discussed this in this chamber many times-how those figures are arrived at. They are arrived at by the ABS sending people around to do a random sample test, knocking on doors-not every door in the district. If a person who answers the door admits that he has worked for one hour in any one week, he is classed as employed. So every month when the unemployment figures come out from the ABS we find that they are not as high as they really are because many people who have worked for one hour in one week-the rate of pay would not be enough to keep them for one week-are not considered to be unemployed. This Government is using fictitious figures. Many thousands of unemployed people are hidden from the public gaze because they are not recorded in the proper way. I think that also leads to some very stringent criticism of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that the cost of social security is escalating every year. But why is it escalating? It is escalating because this Government is cutting down on the Public Service. It is paring money for public works. It is not prepared to create public works projects so that the people in this country who are prepared to work can get some dignity by having a job. These people cannot get jobs. When they cannot get jobs the Government says they are dole bludgers. This Government claims that it is a great advocate of private enterprise. Governments manufacture nothing except, as I have said in speeches I have made before about most governments and particularly Liberal governments, hot air to attempt to fool the electors. If the Government had any sense at all it would be prepared to create public works projects because its own friends in private enterprise are the first who will benefit. The people who will benefit secondly are those people in the work force. If the Government is not spending money on public works there is no avenue for private enterprise to tender for and to construct the works which are necessary for the benefit of this country. When we have a look around every State and in every town if Australia, we find any amount of work could be carried out if only the Government had the ability to do it. When Labor was in government we had what was known as the Regional Employment Development Scheme under which people were able to go to work. The benefits that local government achieved under that Scheme can still be seen around the country. When that Scheme was stopped we made money available to State Governments under what is known in South Australia as the unemployment relief scheme. Anyone who looks around will see in many country towns the great structures which were built-civic centres, halls and swimming pools. </PARA>

What is it today? It is one of the great wonders of the world and it is the salvation of the south-eastern States. Senator Peter Baume may well laugh, but that is a fact. I well remember the criticism that was levelled at a Labor government when it spent taxpayers' money on constructing the transcontinental railway. Until recent years that has been the main link between the east and west of this country. All those projects were commenced by Labor governments as were many other schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That brings me back to the point I was trying to make. If this Government were prepared to make money available for public works it would not have to spend so much money on social security. In the first place, it would not have to pay so much in unemployment benefit and, secondly, by putting people into work it would get something back into the Treasury by way of income tax. It is time that somebody in the Government considered these things instead of saying all of the time when it is criticised about high unemployment figures that it is all because of the dole bludgers. Government supporters have only to look at the number of job vacancies that are advertised every day in the Press. They do not even add up to the figures that Government supporters use. They are fictitious figures. There are not enough jobs to go around, whatever way one looks at it. </PARA>

<PARA> Getting back to the matter of pensions, Senator Chaney stated that the pension rate has risen 70 per cent in six years under this Government. However, under Labor it rose 94 per cent in three years. I can well recall when we were elected to government in 1962, because of the very low rate of the pension, we immediately increased the rate for pensioners so that they had something worth while to exist on. I have tabled in the Parliament and I have incorporated in Hansard on many occasions a table setting out the figures over a number of years. It can be seen from that table that under successive Liberal-Country Party governments in some years there was no increase in the pension; in other years there might have been an increase of 5s or 7s 6d, as the currency was then. The only year in which pensioners could expect any worthwhile increase was in an election year. Just prior to an election the Government would give them 10s or #1 a week. But Labor saw fit to bring in a decent increase. As Senator Grimes has pointed out, and as I have already said, our increases in the pension amounted to much more over three years than the increases this Government has made in six years. </PARA>
<PARA> My memory goes back to another thing which Senator Chaney's predecessor tried to do. This illustrates how niggardly this Government is in respect of people in need. The Liberal Government tried to take away the $40 funeral benefit for pensioners. I well remember Senator Guilfoyle, sitting where Senator Chaney is sitting today, was most vicious about that proposal. But because there was a split in the ranks of the Government she had to capitulate and that proposal did not come about. But of course those people who split the Government's ranks could not have achieved the defeat of that proposal if it had not have been for the Labor Party. The same position applies today in respect of the amendments which we have moved. They will be carried, I am sure, or they should be and we will endeavour to get some benefits for those people who are in need. </PARA>
<PARA> Criticism has been levelled by the only speaker from the Government side so far in this debate. It astounds me that the Government has put up only Senator Walters to speak in support of this legislation. If it is so good--</PARA>

My colleague from Tasmania, Senator Coates, has very many important things to say about this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think my colleague from Western Australia, Senator Giles, outlined very forcibly the problems that will occur if this legislation which takes away the unemployment benefit from the husband when he is on strike is carried. The Government will force these people on to the State authorities, to go cap in hand to community welfare organisations asking for a hand out for themselves and their kids to exist because of the heartlessness of the Government in this part of the legislation. The Government has no concern for these people at all. If these companies were prepared to pay a decent wage and were prepared to give the workers decent conditions they would not go on strike. No worker goes on strike unless there is some good reason for it. In talking about strikes I recall these well paid people on the Government side going on strike here in 1975. They would not get off their backsides to pass the Budget. Honourable senator's opposite cannot criticise a working man for going on strike when members of parliament went on strike here for months and refused to deliberate on the Budget and to pass it. As time is getting on and my colleague Senator Coates wants to say a few words, I will resume my seat to allow him to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was referring to the total lack of Government interest-not only the lack of speakers from the Government side but also to their attendance in the chamber for a large part of the debate. The only person in the chamber was the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) with no back benchers at all even to listen to the contributions from this side of the chamber. Senator Walters spoke very briefly but she did not even attempt to refute any of the accusations made by Senator Grimes in his speech on behalf of the Opposition. It was a totally weak contribution from the Government. But I suppose it just reflects the generally grudging attitude of the Government in social security matters. The whole difference in the atmosphere, in comparison with the Labor Government period of 1972-1975, is very marked. That was a period of exciting advances. The present Government claims some innovations such as the family allowance and the change to the income test as examples of its innovations. It cannot rest on those laurels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Previous speakers have emphasised the matter of family allowances. Point four of the Opposition's amendment refers to the need for the inclusion of the first and second children in the provision of increased family allowances in line with those for third and later children. Even the increases for the third and later children are inadequate. But the fact is that the present allowances for the first and second children are the same as those which were introduced in 1976 when the changeover was made from the tax allowance, and the lack of any increase in this area at all shows how far behind family allowances have fallen. For the Government to keep on referring to family allowances as a great innovation rings hollow and has done so for the last couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA> Also there is the supposed great innovation of the change to the income test in place of the income and means test. Again that has fallen flat because of the Government's attempts to fill the gap that has shown itself in recent times because of people abusing that change. The Government claims that it introduced indexation. The Government actually put it into the relevant Act but it was the Labor Government in 1972-75 which began the regular indexation of pensions and benefits. While indexation is worthy and this Government actually included it in the Act as a permanent feature, honourable senators will recall that in 1978 the Government attempted to apply indexation once a year instead of every six months. So we have a situation where pensioners and beneficiaries are permanently behind. They have still not caught up. They have lost about $60 permanently because of that lack of indexation in 1978. Certainly the Government finally succumbed to public pressure and reverted to six monthly adjustments-not for all beneficiaries, as we know-but this did not catch up with the permanent loss which pensioners suffered. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be emphasised that indexation as an adjustment applied to an amount which is not the minimum wage or anything like it. It is an amount much smaller than that. Pensioners in the community are falling behind all the time in real spending power because the indexation is applied to a fraction of the amount that it takes people in the work force to live on. I think the time has come for a quantum jump in such rates, a catch-up as it is referred to in industrial relations terms. This applies especially to the rate for children and to those who are furthest behind, those who are most below the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA> One particular absence from the Bill that is referred to in the Opposition's amendment is an increase in the unemployment benefit for those under 18 years who are unemployed. That rate still remains at a disgraceful $36 as it has done for the last six years. If one adjusted that rate for the last few years by indexation it would be almost doubled. It ought to be almost doubled to catch up. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have before us an issue which involves whether a substantial number of Australians will get benefits. I suggest that we address ourselves to the issue rather than engaging in petty chiacking. Before the suspension of the sitting, we were considering the Social Services Amendment Bill 1981. We had not concluded the second reading speeches. The fact that the Government wished to have the Bill considered and completed today was indicated quite clearly by Senator Walters who was the only Government senator who spoke. She made it clear that it was necessary for the legislation to be dealt with today if the beneficiaries who are to benefit from the beginning of November are indeed to benefit. Senator Walters pointed out that as a result she would restrain her speech and that the Government would be seeking to have the legislation dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> She also made it clear that if any action was taken in this place in respect of the Bill-that is a possibility that the Government has to consider-the message would be sent to the House of Representatives and dealt with there. The motion which I have moved is to enable the Senate to complete its consideration of the legislation and for a message to be sent to the House of Representatives so that the matter can be dealt with. I am a little surprised that, in the debate which has taken place this afternoon, there has been no concern expressed-except I think, by the first speaker for the Opposition-about the effects of this legislation not being dealt with. The fact is that it will result in at least a delay in the improvement of the position of some 200,000 or more single unemployment beneficiaries without dependents and special beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a great deal of debate about the difficult situation in which some Australians find themselves. Indeed, there have been many complaints about the failure of the Government to improve more greatly a number of areas of pensions and benefits. Therefore, I think it would be very fitting if this chamber devoted its attention to something which it does have an influence over, namely, the improving of the position of a group of beneficiaries who, honourable senators opposite assured us, are being rather shortchanged. The fact is that there is an opportunity here for the beneficiaries position to be improved as from next week and it is this chamber that can prevent that happening. </PARA>
<PARA> Two clear areas of concern have been expressed on the other side of the chamber. I understand that it is the right and the duty of honourable senators opposite to raise matters which are of concern to them and to seek to amend legislation. In the present case, that is complicated by the nature of the legislation which is before us. I think that, to assist the Senate in its consideration of my motion, it would be helpful if I indicated that the means are within the Senate's power to deal with the concerns which have been raised. As I understand it, the concern on the part of the official Opposition and the Australian Democrats is in respect of two clauses of the Bill. From memory they are clause 18 and clause 21. There were objections to those clauses. The balance of the Bill was supported except that there were some complaints that more was not being done in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> On my understanding of the constitutional position, it would not be possible for the Senate to amend this legislation. It is also my view that it would not be possible for it to divide the legislation. That is a matter on which there may well be differences of opinion. There could be no argument that the Senate has the power to request amendments to the legislation. There can be no argument that it has the power to request the deletion of any clauses which it wishes to delete. Whatever view one has of the constitutional position, there is no argument that this chamber has the power and the authority at least to do that. In those circumstances it seems to me that it is the clear duty of the Senate, on the views expressed this afternoon, to express the view in some proper way-not merely in debate-that changes ought be made by the legislation and for the legislation then to be returned to the House of Representatives. It seems to me that, at the moment, we have a situation where the Senate has, I believe by use of a filibuster, simply avoided coming to grips with this legislation on a day when it is important that it should do so. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now in a situation where there has been no vote on the legislation; there has been nothing but debate on it. I suggest that it is most appropriate that we should move to the stage where we can vote on the second reading and where the Opposition and the Democrats, if they intend to act in unison, can put down the resolution that they wish to put down in respect of the legislation. The motion that I moved makes clear that we would anticipate, if that were done, that we would hope to get a message from the House of Representatives in respect of the legislation and to deal with it this evening. The important thing about what I am proposing is that this seems to leave the onus in this situation on the Government. At the moment, however, it is clear that the onus is on the Opposition and upon the Australian Democrats. They are in a position to deny the opportunity for this legislation to pass. They are in a position to deny the 200,000 plus people who, they told us earlier today, are people in need, the benefits which the Government indicated in the Budget that it wished them to have. I believe that it is appropriate for the General Business of the Senate to be postponed until we can give further consideration to the legislation which was before us this afternoon, so that the opportunity can be made for the benefits which flow from this legislation to be made available to the people for whom they are intended. </PARA>

In other words, this is not a situation where honourable senators opposite are being asked to give away anything that they believe in. They have expressed themselves as being opposed to only two clauses of the legislation. Unless, in the unlikely event, there is a Labor senator who crosses the floor against Caucus it would appear that the position is that they are prepared to deny those 200,000 plus people. I make it quite clear that at this stage the responsibility is clearly on the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. Let me say that if a message is sent to the House of Representatives and returned here, clearly the responsibility will then lie with the Government. I am very happy to pick up that challenge but I say to honourable senators opposite that if they refuse to deal with this legislation and regard that on the Notice Paper at the moment as more important than legislation which affects the unemployed of Australia, fine; but I would like to make quite clear on whom the onus rests. At the moment it rests on the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. I would be more than happy to have the onus rest on the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise merely to support Senator Chaney and to draw attention particularly to the situation with regard to beneficiaries under the repatriation legislation. The doubt that now exists with regard to the passage of the Repatriation Acts Amendment Bill does show very clearly the lack of concern on the part of the Opposition for those who really are the most disabled and in the greatest need. In fact, there are benefits which are in some doubt with regard to the payment of persons with two arms amputated, those with two legs and one arm amputated, and those with two legs amputated above the knee, as well as many other persons in these categories. It would be of the greatest concern to the Government if this legislation were not passed and consequently we were not in a position to meet our payments and commitments to that group of people in November. That is the appointed hour which the Government did agree to support and which was mentioned in the Budget statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are also other categories of persons in this field, the payments to whom are now thrown in doubt. I refer to perhaps the most disadvantaged group of all, the orphans of repatriation beneficiaries. Again, the Government expresses its grave concern at the situation. As Senator Chaney has pointed out, clearly there is a course of action open to the Opposition and to the Australian Democrats in this regard and we look to them to fulfil their responsibilities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have witnessed tonight an act of cynicism the like of which I have not seen since I have been a member of this place. Before I entered this chamber tonight I was approached by several journalists who said: 'What is happening in the Senate at 8 o'clock? Mr Barnett, the Prime Minister's Press Secretary, has been running around telling us all to be in the gallery of the Senate tonight because Senator Chaney is going to do something sensational'. We have now seen Senator Chaney's sensational performance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the history of what has happened here today and how this situation has arisen. We are dealing with two pieces of legislation. The first to which I will refer is the Social Services Amendment Bill 1981. The provisions of that Bill were announced two months ago in the course of the presentation of the Budget. The Bill was produced in the House of Representatives on Tuesday of this week, two days ago. I suggest that the delay was deliberate. I suggest that it was to enable to arise a situation in which the Government would try to blackmail the Opposition, and the Australian Labor Party in particular, into bulldozing this legislation through with two clauses, clause 18 and clause 21, which we find extremely offensive and utterly discriminatory, which we oppose and which the Australian Democrats have said they oppose. Senator Chaney has explained that the reason for the delay was the difficulty that the Government had in deciding what it would do about pensioners who were using means whereby they could avoid the income test. That does not apply to the Repatriation Acts Amendment Bill, which is being similarly delayed. </PARA>
<PARA> Last Thursday night in this place we were to have discussed General Business. That was delayed because the Government introduced an important statement and wished to continue with it. This afternoon the Government introduced the legislation in question. We had a guarantee from the Government that General Business would be continued tonight. Now, on the phoney excuse that the Government needs to get this legislation through at once, we are asked to give up General Business again. We are not going to be blackmailed in this way, any more than we were blackmailed at the time Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle got up in this place and told us that if we opposed the funeral benefits pensioners would not be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple fact is that we are willing to sit tonight and tomorrow, after General Business has concluded, to get this legislation through. If the Government wants the Opposition to sit then it will happily do so and, as it has said in the past it would, it will carry through the legislation. But we are not going to be stood over in this way. The simple fact is that the single unemployment beneficiaries who are to receive some $4 out of this legislation will receive it, after the legislation has been passed, from 1 November. If the Government wants to come back next Tuesday and pass it there will be no delay at all. If it wants to come back next Thursday there will be a minimum delay for a few people. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight Senator Chaney is indulging in a stunt and he knows it. He knows that he and his associate Minister have been approaching me for two days to see whether we could do a deal about this situation, and they have not succeeded. They are not going to succeed with standover tactics like this tonight. We believe that General Business, which is on the Notice Paper for tonight, should be proceeded with. The Government has already interfered with the order of General Business tonight. We are willing to continue to consider this legislation after General Business has been completed. We will deal with the legislation and send it back to the House of Representatives then. The problem is that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) wants to get the House of Representatives up and does not want to accept the consequences of facing the House of Representatives in that regard. The simple fact of the matter is that the offer is there. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, an alternative would be for Senator Chaney to say that the Government will accept the requests that would obviously go back from this House. Those two requests will involve clauses 18 and 21 of the legislation. They are not essential to the operation of the rest of the legislation. They are absolutely peripheral to the Government's Budget. They make no difference to it. The Treasurer did not even mention them in his Budget Speech. If Senator Chaney is willing to get up and say on behalf of the Government that the House of Representatives-which means his Government-will accept those requests, we will proceed to pass this legislation. Otherwise, we will proceed in the normal way and return after General Business has been completed to discuss the legislation tonight, tomorrow, Saturday, Sunday or whenever the Government likes; but we are not going to be stood over by publicity stunts like this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not been here quite as long as Senator Grimes has, but events of the last couple of months have indicated to me quite clearly that we ought not to be surprised at anything the Government tries to put over the Senate. The simple fact is that this legislation could have been here weeks ago if the Government had not dithered around trying to catch some groups of pensioners. The Government delayed the legislation until it discovered that it could not get them as adequately as it wanted, and the provision has been put aside. What Senator Grimes says is quite accurate. If the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), who should know the answer to this question, will give an assurance that the Government will accept the requests that are put by this side of the House there is no reason why we cannot accede to the Government's request. However, this is quite unlikely to happen because the rather veiled hints by the Minister that this is the likely outcome of sending them back were just that, merely veiled hints.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats are not in the business of giving up the General Business of this Senate on the first night that it has been given the opportunity to apply. The late receipt of the unemployment benefit by the 200,000 people to whom the Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, referred will not hurt those people in the long run. As we all stressed in the debate this afternoon, a very small amount is involved-what I think Senator Macklin last night kept referring to as a piddling amount, in fact. They will receive it in the long run. They will be no worse off in the next week, or in the next two, three or four weeks, than they were in the last week, or in the last two, three or four weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> What is involved here is a particularly important principle involving the question of what legislation can be presented with what other form of legislation. No matter what the Australian Labor Party chooses to do in the future, the Australian Democrats will not accept the concept that the Government, in order simply to play grubby little games, can tack on to one set of legislation other pieces of legislation which are totally irrelevant to it. The Australian Democrats will not accede to the Government's wishes tonight. </PARA>

After all, we have to look at the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Bill 1981, a matter of pressing importance which I doubt has the public of Australia panting for an early decision; the Industrial Democracy Bill 1981 of Senator Siddons, which again I doubt that the public of Australia are panting for a decision on; and the Senate Elections (Queensland) Bill 1981, which I do not see as having any immediate short term relevance. I also reject the suggestion that an approach was made to do a deal. I certainly spoke with the spokesman for the Australian Labor Party on this matter and I indicated to him that I was anxious to have the legislation dealt with. I spoke to him on that basis.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not have mentioned any conversation I had with the shadow Minister had he not raised the matter here a few minutes ago. I simply deny that there was anything in what I said other than that I was anxious to get the legislation dealt with because of the problem of payments next week. One serious question was raised in the debate, as against the abuse which has been hurled across the chamber; that is, the question of what will happen with respect to any messages. I made it quite clear that if a message were sent to the House of Representatives it would become a problem for the Government and the onus would then be upon the Government to decide whether those payments would be made. The responsibility now rests on honourable senators opposite-on honourable senators from the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats. I am happy to accept the responsibility for what follows if the Senate goes on to deal with this legislation. It will then become my responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One other matter I wish to address is the allegation of deliberate delay and the allegation of blackmail. I have explained publicly the basis on which the legislation was brought into the Parliament later than I had wished. That has been referred to. The fact is that additional clauses in the legislation were removed because, after careful consideration, it was decided that they were not in a form in which we should bring them before the Parliament; they were not sufficiently certain. That has been said clearly; it has been said publicly. It is a fact. That is the fact and I reject any suggestion to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA> I again remind honourable senators opposite that they cannot say that they have been blackmailed because it is clear that they have the numbers required to send a request to the House of Representatives. They have that very clear power and, in using it, they can put the onus upon the Government. If I were seeking a course of conduct from the Opposition which took the matter out of its hands and left the Government free to do as it wished, I think there would be some force in the points that have been made. I wish that the journalists who are in the Press Gallery now had been here for the earlier debate. Had they been here they would have heard and they would have seen for themselves that the bulk of the debate this afternoon was for no purpose other than to delay the consideration of this Social Security Amendment Bill. It was a clear tactic. The floating nature of the list of speakers, the preparedness to go on adding names to it just to make sure that no vote would be taken on the Bill before 6 p.m., is proof of that. Mr President, I say to honourable senators opposite that if they are genuinely concerned about this legislation they will proceed to deal with it and, if they believe that sections of the legislation are objectionable, they will move requests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, the first annual report of the Bicentennial Authority is disappointing. Although the objectives of the Bicentennial Authority are set out very carefully and very properly on pages 4 and 5, it is nevertheless a disappointing report. The report relates to the 18-month period from the beginning of 1980 to the middle of 1981. It has more to do with the financial accounts and staff arrangements for the Bicentennial Authority than it has to do with substantial planning or programs for the bicentennial year. I believe that we should expect in the second report a much more substantial set of determinations for the programs for the year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Maybe we are too optimistic in thinking that the first annual report of the Bicentennial Authority should be more substantial. I believe that we have a 20-page report which is only a very initial offering, one that needs considerable substance to be added to it if we are going to see the kind of bicentennial celebration that many Australians are looking for. At one point in the report there is reference to fireworks and historic re-enactments. Whilst these may be popular and jump immediately to mind when one considers bicentennial celebrations they are, nevertheless, not the substance that most Australians are looking for. They are looking for things that are lasting, for evaluations of where Australia has come from, where we are now and where we are going. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans has spoken along these same lines about his disappointment in this report. But I want to disassociate myself from his comments about the Constitution needing reform as coming from the Bicentennial Authority. It is inappropriate for us to look to the Bicentennial Authority as a constitutional convention. I believe that any constitutional reform in this country is much more in the hands of parliament, the people and constitutional conventions. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a political matter. It is a matter which I believe the Bicentennial Authority has wisely left untouched. It may well be argued that constitutional reform is something that politicians and others may promote in the year of the bicentenary. I happen to think that there is room for some reform in the Constitution because the Constitution is so important. It must continue to endure and to be a living document on which the parliamentary and political life of our country is based. But that is for others to initiate. It is not fair to relate that matter to the Bicentennial Authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second initiative that Senator Evans called for was a new flag for Australia. I am puzzled that he should be seeking such wild, kitsch innovations. I think he was even self-aware on the matter. I believe that at a time of our bicentennial celebrations we should remember the flag that has flown proudly and high in all the years of our history. The traditional and historic elements of the Australian flag should continue to inspire Australians to acknowledge the continuity of our history. For all of the remarks that have been made about the Southern Cross-I happen to have a particular fondness for and a real sense of personal identity with the Southern Cross-it is on the Australian flag and no one has complained about it. It is something of pride to most Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not accept at all the innovative and minority views that Senator Evans expressed on that matter. So much for the interjection by Senator Button. The one particular matter I suggest with regard to the Bicentennial Authority relates to the year of 1988 itself. As everybody knows, Australia Day is on 26 January. I believe that on that day there will be a number of celebrations throughout Australia, in every State and indeed here in the capital, Canberra. One matter that is unresolved and that I believe we ought to comment on at this stage before the program for that year has been planned by the Bicentennial Authority is the involvement of this Parliament in the events of Australia Day 1988. Some senators and members believe that the new Parliament House should have its official opening on Australia Day 1988. I do not agree with that. I believe that there will be so many other popular events to celebrate the bicentenary of Australia on 26 January that it would be quite inappropriate for the new Parliament House to be officially opened on that same day. It would draw people away; it would draw the focus of attention here to Canberra rather than having some focus of attention on every city, town, country district and territory of Australia where the people themselves can be involved in the celebrations. Accordingly, I register my view that the Parliament should begin to operate in the Budget session of 1987. In August 1987, we should move from this chamber to the new Parliament House.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not my birthday; my birthday is in September. May 1988 is a very appropriate time as May is the month of the year in which this Parliament House was opened. We should seek to set that month as the time for the opening of the new Parliament House. I want quite genuinely to register that view at this very early stage of the Bicentennial Authority's planning for the celebration by all Australians in the bicentenary year. I hope that other senators and members will urge a common view towards the acceptance of the idea that the new Parliament House be opened in May of 1988 rather than having an unnecessary complication of the very popular celebration throughout all of Australia on 26 January, Australia Day, 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to agree with Senator Teague's criticism of the report of the Australian Bicentennial Authority, although perhaps not with the other matters to which he alluded. It is a very disappointing report. I find centenaries and bicentenaries to be a total and utter bore. They are really just meaningless symbolism, an absolute heyday for people wanting to market logos and an absolute bonanza for jingoistic cliches. To make it worthwhile, one really has to pick up some sort of theme or focus of activity. We did think of several activities. The first idea was to have an Olympic Games in Australia. That fell through in Sydney; it was then naturally taken up in Melbourne but it fell through there because it was going to be too costly for the State Government. Then the Minister down there, Mr Brian Dixon-the Minister for getting his photo in the paper-decided to approach private enterprise, that gung ho institution in Melbourne, to take it over but it would not have it either.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to refer to one or two areas-I know that Senator Evans has concentrated on the constitutional aspect-that we might take up. We might make 1988 a year by which we have actually helped the Aboriginal population of this country. In many ways, the bicentenary celebrations will be a celebration of shame for the way that we have treated the original inhabitants of Australia. Maybe for the next seven years we could set as a target the raising of health, educational and economic circumstances of Aboriginals in our community. The second thing we could do, as Senator Evans said, is to try to get a new Constitution by 1988. I am not much of a betting man but I am sure it is a rather hopeless chance. The third area in which we could take action is to make 1988 the year that we introduce democracy throughout the whole of Australia. Why do we not make changes to the Constitution and the various electoral Acts to make this a democratic country. We will then be able to go to the rest of the world, celebrating this 200 years of Australia and pointing out to countries like the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics what a democracy is like. Are we not proud of that democratic heritage? Of course, any time we want to take action such as this, as Senator Gietzelt did this afternoon, what happens? We are blocked, as he was blocked, at every turn. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other aspect to which I want to refer which relates to parliamentarians is the Parliamentary Handbook. We have all been issued with proposals to have a special handbook in 1988. I agree with most of the suggestions and ideas in regard to that. It seems as though it will be a different type of handbook that will record almost forgotten aspects of Australian political history. I would encourage those who are working in that particular area to continue their work. As I said at the very beginning, this particular report is disappointing because the only theme I can find in it is under the heading of 'Objectives' where it says that the major promotional theme will be 'Living together'. I might have a different interpretation of what that means but I think we might be in for a bonanza year in 1988. It will not be too good for the churches or the civil marriage celebrants, but I am looking forward to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take about 60 seconds to make a couple of comments on the report of the Australian Bicentennial Authority. Unlike Senator Teague, I find it very difficult to get enthusiastic about the bicentennial or bicentenary, whichever it is. I wish we could get an authoritative ruling whether it is a bicentennial or a bicentenary. I suspect that by 1988 we will be heartily sick of the jingoism involved in this whole thing. There may well be some worthwhile things which will come out of it, such as some history writing and that sort of thing, but overall I cannot get enthusiastic about the whole idea. However, I can report that the former Leader of the Opposition in this place, Ken Wriedt, has settled in as the Executive Director of the Bicentennial Council in Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only other thing I want to mention relates not to the report of the Authority but to its newsletter which I received in the last few days. It has a beautiful photograph on the front cover of one of the nicest parts of Tasmania, Table Cape, near Wynyard. The only problem is that the caption is wrong. It refers to the photograph as Table Cape near Stanley. It has obviously got The Nut mixed up with Table Cape. I suggest that the Authority do a lot more about getting its act together. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>It is unfortunate that when I prepared my notes for this debate earlier in the day the report was not available. I think it will be necessary, if we are to make the sessional order we are talking about work, for these papers to be made available to us. When we were talking about the introduction of this system we put it strongly that we would need to have the papers in front of us 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours before we are to debate them. If we do not get them, obviously the system is not going to work. I put it to the Government that either it makes the papers available or it leaves debate on the papers till the following week. I do not think that this is a good idea. There is no doubt at all that we want to debate the papers. We have given over one day a week to it. We have worked out a system which should be fair to everyone. With a little of the good will and co-operation that Senator Carrick speaks about we will be able to debate all the papers and give them reasonable treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am going to say in the few comments that I am going to make may not refer directly to what is in the report-I do not know what is in it because I have not had a chance to read it-but they certainly refer to the broad general area.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the motion for the second reading of the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Bill 1981. This private member's Bill was presented by Senator Evans on 19 August of this year. Senator Evans, in his second reading speech, dealt fully with the purposes of the Bill and the proposals in the Bill. Although this is a private member's Bill brought forward by an Opposition member, it is in essence a Bill which is an implementation of the very thorough report of the Australian Law Reform Commission entitled 'Insurance Agents and Brokers'. I know that the Bill which Senator Evans has introduced is a replica of the draft Bill which was presented in that report to which he has added provisions relating to penalties under various clauses which were not set out in the report. That was contemplated. I must say that I think the bill faithfully records the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make it clear that I support the Bill and I propose to vote for it. I trust that many of my colleagues on this side of the Senate will likewise support the Bill. I am aware that the Government, in the person of the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), who represents the Treasurer (Mr Howard), expressed opposition to the Bill at an earlier date and that the Government is generally opposed at this stage anyway to the implementation of the Commission's report. I believe that Law Reform Commission reports are prima facie deserving of acceptance. This report has taken some years to compile. The Commission had before it a vast number of witnesses. With unstinting effort it has travelled across Australia and seen the people who are concerned with and affected by the problems that this Bill deals with and has made a report which I believe, failing other cogent reasons, should be accepted. The need for this legislation is well set out at the beginning of the report. The Commission said:</PARA>
<PARA> The private insurance industry is today organised on a national basis. It is undesirable that, in important aspects of the law governing relationships with the insuring public, this national industry should be subject to vague and uncertain rules developed long before the growth of modern insurance. It is equally undesirable that it should be subject to differing legislative requirements from one jurisdiction to another. The needs of the industry and of its customers can only be met by development of a national law of insurance contracts in Australia. This law should promote:</PARA>
<PARA> uniformity, to the extent that the Federal Constitution permits</PARA>
<PARA> clarity, by removing doubts in existing case law and statutes</PARA>
<PARA> relevance, in recognising the realities of the respective positions of the insured, the insurer and the intermediaries (agents and brokers) who facilitate and effect contracts of insurance. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that that statement sets out, very fairly, the need which was there and the recommendations justify the action which has been proposed. A curious course has been adopted over a number of years in getting to some position where there will be regulation or some control of the various defalcations and losses which have been suffered by the investing public due to the defaults of a number of brokers. This problem has been with us for many years. Indeed, after this Government came into office there was in April 1976 a statement by the then Minister Assisting the Treasurer, the Honourable Eric Robinson, who announced that the Government would introduce legislation for the licensing of insurance brokers. On 11 March 1977 the Government changed its mind and announced its intention to pursue a scheme of self-regulation. I shall certainly be dealing with that matter of deregulation during my speech. The decision at that time to refuse the regulation of the industry was based on the complexity of the proposals and the thought that it was too excessive a weapon to use. </PARA>
<PARA> In February 1979 the Treasurer announced that he was seeking the Government's approval to develop legislation for a voluntary regulation arrangement for brokers. After six months there was a change in those plans. The Government then, saying that there was no consensus in the industry, decided to await the delivery of the Law Reform Commission's report. That report was subsequently tabled in September 1980. It must be pointed out that the Government gave the insurance reference to the Law Reform Commission. The Government sought that the Commission should do this work and find a solution to the problem. Unfortunately we waited some considerable time before there was a further development. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it also ought to be borne in mind that the report of the Commission came down in 1980. The consumer affairs Ministers of the States met in Melbourne after that-on 14 November 1980-and resolved as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Insurance Brokers</PARA>
<PARA> Ministers agreed to express their concern to the Commonwealth the need for urgent action to implement the Australian Law Reform Commission's proposals to regulate the activities of insurance brokers. </PARA>
<PARA> It was agreed that there was a need for the Commonwealth to examine legislation involving a fidelity fund to compensate consumers for losses caused by cases of brokers failing to perform. It was also agreed that the legislation should provide for the registration of insurance brokers. </PARA>
<PARA>That is very clear. It is all States. Of course this is not something which has been imposed on the States. It is something which the States have requested. Subsequent to this, in a few short months, this was repeated when the Honourable Jim Ramsay, the Victorian Minister, pointed it out in May this year. He urged the Federal Government to introduce legislation to register insurance brokers and require them to set up trust and fidelity funds. He pointed out that there had been recent examples of collapses of insurance brokers. In March one liquidator had been appointed for Kinloch (Insurances) Pty Ltd with debts of $3m. Later the same month Anthony H. Bown and Associates Pty Ltd went into liquidation and One Stop Insurance Shop Pty Ltd collapsed with debts of $322,000. So there is a constant need. Those examples call for action. State Ministers have supported those claims and demands. </PARA>
<PARA> To complete the order of events, let me say that since that time the other action taken was that Senator Evans introduced this Bill, the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Bill 1981 on 28 May this year, which, as I say, implements the Law Reform Commission recommendations. Then the Treasurer (Mr Howard) made a ministerial statement on 10 June 1981 which rejected the recommendations in the report. So we come to a position where we are endeavouring to decide whether we will implement the recommendations in this report. The legislation is based upon the report. As I have said, and I reiterate, the recommendations are based upon consultation which went into the making of that report. They are also based upon the fact, of which details are set out in the second reading speech, of defalcations, something of the nature of $7m in the years before the report, and from the time that the report was prepared at least another $7m appears to have been defaulted. From my inquiries and discussions with representatives of the insurance industry-I have spoken to quite a number of them in the last two or three months-the total is probably more like $20m now because it is not known precisely what are some of the losses among a number of the companies. The report has pointed out that there is a need to do various things. It first sets out the action needed with respect to the responsibility of insurers for the conduct of their intermediaries. There have been many examples where they have failed and taken moneys and not accounted for them. The report also shows that:</PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary to protect members of the public from financial loss necessary to resolve conflicts between interest and duty inherent in the form of remuneration of brokers. </PARA>
<PARA>There are a number of other aspects in the report, nearly all of which are picked up in this Bill. The Bill clarifies the law, which is obscure in regard to agents. It also provides a statutory system of broker registration. I think it is worth recalling that when this report was being agreed upon many people in the insurance industry contributed their work to the Commission's action. It is described in information supplied to me by the representative of the Australian Mutual Provident Society. It appears that some 24 senior officers, brokers and agents from life and general insurance companies gave up weeks of time at their own and their companies' expense to act as consultants to the Commission. The Commission travelled all over Australia and hundreds of other members of the industry attended full day meetings in all capitals. That time, faithfully devoted, was wasted as were tens of thousands of dollars of company funds and thus policy holder's money in a fruitless exercise-that is assuming that this Parliament does not proceed with this legislation. The AMP Society further asserts:</PARA>
<PARA> While there were differences of opinion within the industry on the exact form of controls which should be introduced, all elements favoured controls to protect the public against embezzlement of premiums and insolvencies by brokers and against professional misconduct. </PARA>
<PARA>They are greatly disillusioned at the lack of Government action. I hope that we and the Government can do something. If this Bill is passed and it goes before the House of Representatives, I hope that the Government will be in a position to wipe away that disillusionment. There is no doubt that the Commonwealth has power to deal with this matter. This is not a case of the Senate and the House of Representatives seizing some power that is not properly there. There is such a specific power in section 51 (xiv) of the Australian Constitution which enables this Commonwealth Parliament to make laws 'with respect to insurance other than State insurance, also State insurance extending beyond the limits of the State concerned.' So the founding fathers had this very much in contemplation even before the insurance industry spread, as it has, right across the country, enmeshed, with agencies all over the country. Even before that situation they realised the desirability of giving this power to the Commonwealth and they gave it. As I say, it is even more, a fortiori, now that that industry is an Australia-wide industry, both in life and general insurance, and that power ought to be exercised by a responsible parliament. I do not apologise for the references which I make now to paragraph 8 of the Commission's report. It has been said that we ought not to proceed with this matter, that we ought to leave it to the States and not take Commonwealth action. The Commission had this to say about that in paragraph 8:</PARA>
<PARA> Given the existence of Commonwealth power over the vast majority of life insurance contracts and, equally, over a large majority of general insurance contracts covered by the Commission's proposals, Commonwealth legislation ought not to await agreement following attempts at a Ministerial level to obtain uniform, complementary, State legislation. To delay action pending agreement in such a matter might be a formula for inaction. There is a pressing need for reform of the law relating to insurance contracts. As the private sector insurance industry is organised and regulated on a national basis, it is appropriate that the laws which govern the relationships between the industry and the public should also be national in character. Commonwealth legislation to effect the present recommendations would not place the private sector at a disadvantage compared with State Government offices. </PARA>
<PARA>So I think there is no doubt about the need and no doubt about the fact that the States have requested and want this. They do not want to see themselves setting up eight different registering agencies, eight different systems the cost of which somebody has to pay. It will either be governments or, more likely it will be the people who take out insurance policies who will pay for it in some way or other. I suggest that this is a total waste. It is not the same situation of, for example, registration of lawyers, because they are controlled under State Acts and there is no Federal power to deal with them. But in the case of the insurance industry, this is a responsibility which we have as a Federal Parliament. The Government, in its reply, which I referred to, and which was delivered by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, made what I think are four different arguments. I propose to deal with them individually. It was said in the first place that there was really no need for Commonwealth regulation, that the States could do it, and it had been traditional. As the Government states:</PARA>
<PARA> Such a need has not been established. </PARA>
<PARA>It also recognised that the States traditionally are the regulators of intermediaries such as solicitors and estate agents and in areas of general consumer protection. Honourable senators will note that it was the State Ministers responsible for consumer affairs who asked for the Federal legislation. I think I have answered that as far as the lawyers and these other bodies are concerned. There is a different situation in regard to them. Here we have clear Commonwealth power. The Commonwealth Parliament has already intervened and taken action in regard to insurance. We have the Life Insurance Act of 1945 and the Insurance Act of 1973. There are certain regulatory bodies and commissioners operating already in this field. As is proposed in the Bill they will play a very active role in the regulation of brokers. So we are already in this field but we are not yet effectively in it. Obviously during the period we have been ineffective in this field there have been great losses and we cannot deny the responsibility to an extent for that. It was also said in the Minister's speech that there has not been very much loss really. She said:</PARA>
<PARA> We are fortified in our approach to this matter by the fact that the vast majority of broker transactions have been conducted in a satisfactory manner. </PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say that the figure of losses is small, and represents less than 0.1 per cent of premiums handled by brokers. Of course, superficially that sounds attractive but the important thing is that in any of these regulatory activities it will be found that most of the people are honest and most of the payments will be honoured. But the amount of $20m which appears to have been defaulted in the last 10 or 12 years is still very substantial. It is also, I think, important to note the extent to which a number of these companies are involved in many small claims and many individual claims. I think it was in respect of the one-stop insurance body that there were 34,000 separate claims. I think that is significant. One of the interesting statements on this matter was made by Mr Nick Renton of the Life Insurance Federation of Australia, after the Government had indicated that it would not implement the recommendations in the report. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Opponents of legislation to control insurance intermediaries sometimes point out that losses from broker failures represent only a small proportion of the total premiums involved. Mr Renton said that such arguments completely overlooked the fact that if a client is hurt by a broker failure then his personal loss can be one hundred per cent of his premiums and in some cases could be one hundred per cent of the payments he was entitled to expect in the event of a claim. </PARA>
<PARA>This occurs not only because a person has paid his premium to a broker, found that he was not covered and then very often that the insurance company will not meet the claim but also because brokers often default on payouts on claims. The claimant loses the whole of that claim. Possibly the claimant is in very great need of the money from that claim because of an injury which has been suffered. Consequently, I suggest that the losses argument is not an answer to this problem. The losses are quite considerable. Regulation in the interests of the honesty of this industry and particularly, as the honourable senators will see in what I have to say, because the industry wants it as well, are reasons for the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The third argument that was put forward by the Government on this subject was that self-regulation should be tried. The Minister said that the Government's view remains that the most effective approach to the basic issues relating to insurance brokers is the development of sound self-regulatory practices. We know, as I have said before, that the Government has toyed with self-regulation on occasions in the past and then has changed its view. In fact, self-regulation is rejected by the industry. In this industry, which is not as big as some others but which is big enough, it is agreed by practically all parts of it that self-regulation is not satisfactory to deal with the matter. The report of the Law Reform Commission considered this aspect very closely. I want to read to the Senate from paragraphs 125 and 126 of the report which deal with this proposal. Paragraph 125, which gives examples of evidence that was before the Commission, states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not without significance that it was because of the danger of anti-competitiveness that the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, in its submission to the Inquiry into the Australian Financial System, specifically rejected broker self-regulation. </PARA>
<PARA>The report of the Commission quotes from that submission in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . this Department recently strenuously opposed suggested legislation which would have had the effect of limiting competition in the insurance broking industry. This Department was concerned that if the legislation was enacted brokers would have been permitted to engage in collective anti-competitive conduct, without the government directly supervising it to ensure that it was in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>That point was made by a department of this Government. Further, in speaking of the competence and self-interest that would be involved in self-regulation, the report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> But even if the competence of brokers as administrators could be guaranteed, the prospect of decisions being taken by members of a relatively small occupational group who may have a direct or indirect personal stake in the outcome of those decisions is simply unacceptable. As the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange-</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will recall that that important Committee of this Parliament stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . regulation of a securities market involves inquiry into fraud or abuse which will not be voluntarily confessed and with respect to which governmental investigatory power is needed. We do not believe that such investigatory power or the power to apply sanctions should be conferred on a 'self-regulatory' body. We consider that such powers should be entrusted to the administrative executive and judicial arms of government. </PARA>
<PARA>I rely therefore on the Committee of this Parliament with its repute as supporting the case I make against self-regulation. The last major argument which is used in the Minister's speech is that somehow there are divided views in the insurance industry about this self-regulation of the industry. Senator Evans in his second reading speech said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . there has been a striking unanimity in the calls for compulsory regulation of brokers, for professional indemnity insurance and for implementation of the Law Reform Commission's other recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>It was stated on behalf of the Government:</PARA>
<PARA> In fact, we are advised by the major insurance industry bodies, representing both insurance brokers and underwriters, that they are most concerned about a number of provisions of the kind contained in the Bill. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, as Senator Watson says, we can tidy them up. But in fact I have been very careful to ask the various parts of the industry about this. Sure they have different views about some aspects of the Bill. But at the same time they are quite determined, and quite unanimous as far as I can see, about the need for regulation by the Commonwealth. I read to the Senate earlier a note from the Australian Mutual Provident Society from its statement about the agreement which exists but I also read this further note from a letter recently written on this subject by that Society. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Evans has said, there is a good deal of unanimity within the industry on many points. On the other hand there are some aspects where it seems most unlikely that any compromise will ever be reached, because of the differing commercial interests of the parties. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Senate to note therefore that one expects that those different views will never be satisfied completely but of course there is agreement upon the need for regulation. The letter from the AMP goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> It is for this reason that the Society has steadfastly maintained, as a mutual organisation concerned for the public welfare, that self-regulation will be sheer impossibility, and that the Federal Government (hopefully not eight State and Territory Governments) must act as ''umpire'' to protect consumer interests. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out that this society is important in the sense that it has between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of the life business in this country. In addition-I briefly give to the Senate these other views-the Insurance Council of Australia Ltd, which represents the general insurance section, in a letter to me dated 25 August the Council stated:</PARA>
<PARA> For some time this Council has expressed concern at the lack of control over the operations of insurance brokers. We believe that it is essential for Federal regulation of this important sector of our industry. However, there are a number of provisions in the Private Member's Bill which may create difficulties for insurers and brokers. </PARA>
<PARA>I have discussed those areas with the Council and although I do not at this stage support the alterations which it has made, I think there is considerable merit in the argument it has advanced. If the Government is to consider this Bill, seriously of course, it ought to look at those matters. In addition in a Press release the Life Insurance Federation of Australia stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A speedy announcement by the Commonwealth is necessary, as several State Governments are contemplating their own legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpose to say that I think Western Australia has already done so. The news release continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In fact, Western Australia has already introduced its own Bill. LIFA strongly believes that separate State measures would be a poor second best and that all insurance regulation is an appropriate subject for national legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition the Australian Consumer Association has supported Federal legislation. Finally, the Confederation of Insurance Brokers of Australia-the people most directly affected by registration-in the editorial in the latest copy of its report states:</PARA>
<PARA> We were very disappointed when the Commonwealth Government announced that it would not proceed with the introduction of legislation to regulate the activities of brokers. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of this decision State Governments are now proceeding independently to prepare and implement legislation in each State. </PARA>
<PARA> CIBAust and IBA are working closely with representatives of each State Government, including the Northern Territory, but it is already clear that there will be differences in legislation being introduced by the various States. </PARA>
<PARA> No matter how carefully State legislation is prepared clearly it will not be as cost effective as a National system. </PARA>
<PARA> The public service in each State will have to be involved in the administration of the local Act, brokers who operate in more than one State will face the additional administrative costs of complying with supervisory requirements in each State and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Commonwealth Government decided that there was no cause to regulate insurance brokers, the State Governments obviously disagree and are determined to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> Given this, surely it would be in the best interests of taxpayers, the insuring public and the insurance industry if the Commonwealth Government were to acknowledge the fact that there is a desire by Government across the Nation to regulate insurance brokers and this could be achieved more effectively and efficiently through a centralised national system introduced through the Commonwealth Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I cannot think of putting it in any better way than it has been put by the very people most directly affected by this legislation. I think that answers the last of the arguments raised by the Government against the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, I support the Bill. I believe it is a matter of judgment and I have made it very clear for some months that I am persuaded very strongly by the arguments raised. I have discussed this matter very fully. I have not heard very much, I am afraid, from the Ministers or the Government on this subject but I have pressed it-I make no apology for that-among my colleagues. I have given what assistance I can give by bringing facts before them about this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that in the course of debate on this Bill there has been some criticism by some sections of the industry. There is a feeling that multi-agents ought to be included with brokers and regulated in the same way. I have certainly found some persuasiveness in those arguments. But I fall back finally on the Australian Law Reform Commission and its belief that this is not necessary and not desirable. But I say again, in whatever form this Bill goes through this House I think the Government should look at this particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The second of those major problems is a question of time limits and a desire by some of the insurance groups to amend clause 13. The problem is that many of the brokers hold back money and the insurance companies maintain that they do not have sufficient control to deal with this aspect and that credit control is necessary. On the other hand again the Australian Law Reform Commission does not see the necessity of this, and it heard a lot of evidence on the subject. It has been pointed out to me that cases where there has been default mostly relate to small brokers and that they are the people over whom the insurance companies have or ought to be able to exercise reasonable control. I say again that there is quite a strong argument for such a provision. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the Bill. I trust that my colleagues, having heard the argument over the last few months, will also support it. I believe that there is a strong prima facie case in all circumstances for the support of the Australian Law Reform Commission. Its recommendations should not be turned down unless we are satisfied that they are unsound. I have seen no reason to believe that they are unsound and therefore I trust that the Senate will carry this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise very briefly to support the Bill proposed by Senator Evans which is very similar, as Senator Missen has just pointed out, to the Bill appended to and recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission's report No. 16 of September 1980. The report determines that while there were differences of opinion within the industry on the exact form of controls which should be introduced, all elements favoured controls to protect the public against the embezzlement of premiums, insolvencies by brokers and professional misconduct. The industry is greatly disillusioned by the lack of government investigation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My investigations have shown that the registration system recommended by the Law Reform Commission falls far short of what many in the industry feel is necessary. Perhaps the Commission was influenced by Treasury submissions that the controls should be as few and inexpensive as possible. Nevertheless, it is very clear that the industry prefers to have something rather than nothing at all. Worse than that, if this Bill is not passed the industry will be saddled with negotiations with eight different State and territory authorities and, ultimately, with a patchwork of differing State and territory statutes. This negotiation and these statutes will cause great expense to the industry and thus to the insuring public. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of no use for the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to talk of the Commonwealth's lending its aid to achieve a uniform State and territory system. The States are already proceeding on widely divergent paths and the lessons of workers compensation legislation, the companies and securities legislation and all the rest make a mockery of the suggestion that we can get uniform State legislation with the assistance of the Commonwealth. It is clear that the Commonwealth does have the power. It also has the existing insurance legislation and the experience which the States clearly do not have. It has the responsibility to see that policy holders are protected, and not by unnecessarily expensive State and territory schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Government spokesmen have raised the bogey of a new bureaucracy to administer the Law Reform Commission's proposal. In fact, this is nonsense. The Bill does not propose a new bureaucracy; it does not propose a new police force; it does not propose new imposts on the Commonwealth. All sections of the industry-insurers, brokers and agents-have said that they are willing to take on the work and the expense involved in regulation so long as they get the legislative backing essential to make the regulation work. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats made it clear when this Bill was introduced last May that they supported its concepts. I and my colleagues have had many discussions with representatives of the industry and we have had voluminous correspondence on the subject. The Bill was designed to meet the needs of both the insured public and the industry. A number of amendments have been made at the suggestion of various people within the industry and other interested parties. We believe that this Bill is the best solution to the problems revealed in the Law Reform Commission's report. It is the simplest approach that can be adopted in view of the conflicting interests withan the industry and the urgent need for the public to be protected. I commend the Law Reform Commission's report to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge that I may be one of a few Government members, along with Senator Missen, to support this private member's Bill which seeks to control and regulate certain activities of insurance agents and insurance brokers. I do so with a very good reason. I believe that in Australia today too many innocent Australians are being ripped off-I repeat the words 'ripped off'-by some unscrupulous operators who are giving the decent people in the industry a bad image and a damaged reputation. I am here to protect those people in society who cannot help themselves. I believe this is one of the important roles of politicians and I seek to use that position to support this Bill tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although there is a call for less government intrusion into business, I believe that it would be wrong and an abrogation of my parliamentary responsibilities to the people whom I represent to allow on an occasion like this the Bill before us tonight to lapse. Therefore, I will support the Bill. In doing so, I do not really believe that I am in any way embarrassing the party that I represent in this chamber. After all, this is a private member's Bill. I believe that essentially the Bill flows from the deliberations of the Law Reform Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Many words are spoken by politicians about the problems of being bound by party dogma and discipline but I believe the private members initiative in bringing forward measures such as this are indeed good for democracy. I believe that appropriate Bills, the right Bills with the right wording, should be encouraged. On the other hand, I recognise that it is very difficult for a private member to be able to muster sufficient support to pass a Bill. Some members may have utopian ideas and the implementation in the practical world of those utopian ideas may be difficult. I believe that this is an attempt to seek some justice in a difficult world. I believe some changes are necessary to the Bill. But let us talk about the Bill; let us get it towards finality: Then, perhaps, the appropriate amendments will come. Let us not wipe it off the slate in the first instance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill attempts to do a lot of things. But in an attempt to do a lot of things-for example, in income tax law-one will essentially get inconsistencies and problems. This Bill is attempting to provide a code of ethics, to protect innocent and uninformed individuals and to set penalties. Naturally for these sometimes conflicting ideals-these are just some of them-there is criticism or praise depending on one's philosophy towards the legislation before one. But I believe that the Bill is a step in the right direction. There are some shortcomings. My own attitude would tend to suggest for example that there is a need for the trust bank account to be audited by a registered auditor or accountant-at least once a year-in the same manner as solicitors' trust funds are audited. There is no point in having a trust fund if no one will exercise discipline or control over that fund. An independent audit by a registered company auditor, for example, would provide that discipline and would report differences and deviations to the appropriate authority. I believe that this is essential if the Bill is to succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> While section 25 attempts to ensure that the insurance brokers give certain information, I believe that there is an escape clause in sub-section (2) where some of the more astute could tend to seek shelter under, say, section 15. I believe that the more astute and the more devious will tend to seek this type of protection. Also registered insurance brokers are deemed to be the agents of the insurer. This is a commendable provision. But, unfortunately, the funds-this is the inconsistency -do not have to be handed over immediately or even expeditiously by the broker to his principal, that is, the insurer. I trust that the lawyers with wisdom and integrity will put together a form of words with an appropriate provision to overcome this problem and also to require appropriate audit of the trust account. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people may say that these remarks could destroy the intent of the Bill. However, it must not be seen to give brokers and insurance agents what I refer to as a protected or closed shop situation thus not allowing an entirely clean industry. I think some cynics could say that this is what the Bill is trying to do. They would attack the Bill on this particular score. In our Federation, there is always the danger of each State enacting laws for the protection of its own citizens although the implications of some of those laws could flow across State boundaries. Therefore, we have a problem of different standards and different laws. For example, a person could be insured in one State and require the insurance in another State. I believe that, through the multiplicity of State laws, some people could escape some of the obligations and penalties of individual State laws. Hence we do have a need for a Federal law to govern this area. </PARA>
<PARA> As in the company area, where we are moving towards Federal regulation, I believe that it is appropriate, to avoid difficulties of standards and ethics in law, that we should attempt to make sure we get as soon as possible a statute. (Quorum formed). Before the quorum was formed, I referred to the problems of having different ethics and different standards with different laws in various States where, for example, a person could be insured in one State and the agent be in another and so on. With this possibility there could be opportunities for unscrupulous people, by virtue of moving contracts between States, to overcome individual State laws. Hence we have a need for a Federal law to cover insurance agents and brokers. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the problem of differing standards. There is recognition of this in the Bill. I acknowledge that the Insurance Council does not like this aspect of brokers and agents being the agents to the insurer. But I believe it is important to have this relationship. Some people may argue that we need go no further than this and that, having established this relationship, there should be sufficient discipline by the insurers over their agents to exercise sufficient authority. Coming back to the question of bank accounts and the agent being able to invest money on his own account, I would have thought there would have been a moral duty on every honourable agent to hand over to his principal as expeditiously as possible moneys to the company that is going to carry out the insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I believe it is here that these high ideals tend to break down since not only have the brokers power to invest in prescribed securities but the interest, dividend, or any other income which flows from that investment, need not be paid into that trust account. In fact, it can be paid into another account. The matter goes even further. That income does not flow to the principal; it does not flow back to the person seeking the insurance. The real problem lies in the fact that it flows to the broker himself. I believe that here we have a fundamental breakdown in the high ethical standards that we are trying to achieve with this Bill. I believe that this provision certainly needs amendment. Otherwise there will be a problem of hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that, if we are to try to clean up the industry, we have to clean it up entirely and not allow these people to invest money except under very rigid conditions. The income flowing under those tight conditions must flow back either to the person who is taking out the insurance or to the insurer which is the company involved. In the present form this aspect is certainly open to a lot of abuse. Certainly, I will be looking to lawyers to formulate appropriate words to overcome this anomaly. We must make provision in the Bill so that those funds flow as quickly as possible from the agent through to the insurance company. Therefore we must limit those circumstances which permit the broker to hold funds in his account for what is an unduly long period. I believe that it is appropriate and proper for the Federal Government to legislate in this area. At the beginning I referred to the rip-offs that had occurred in the industry. Too much money has been lost on the general insurance side. Earlier tonight my colleague Senator Missen referred, I believe, to some of those circumstances and to the extent of some of the losses as a result of defalcation. If we can eliminate or reduce that it will be a very good thing. </PARA>
<PARA> To my understanding, the more recognised life assurance companies and the Insurance Council, according to a letter I have received, appear to support the Bill. However, the Insurance Council has reservations about clauses 10 and 11. Clause 10 places liability on the insurers for agents' conduct and clause 11 provides that certain insurance intermediaries shall be agents of insurers. I disagree with the Council's view, since this responsibility is fundamental. Reputable insurers, such as the CMLs, the AMPs and the Royal Insurance companies of Australia, would exercise their proper and appropriate obligations. Unfortunately, in recent years we have seen the emergence of a number of fly-by-night companies. Some of my colleagues would argue that the Bill should go no further than establish this principal-agent type of relationship, but unfortunately a lot of these newcomers to the life assurance and general insurance business scene are not as morally responsible and may be called fly-by-nighters or sharks or be given some other appropriate description which would indicate self-interest or rip-off. That is what I am determined not only to identify but also to try to eliminate from the industry. That is the purpose and intent of the Bill and it is what we, as senators, should see fully enacted. Laws are made not for the honest, the upright, the principled but rather for the exploiters of this world. Regrettably, laws, regulations and sanctions go only part of the way and I do not believe always get the real crooks. Western Australia and Queensland have statutes which regulate brokers and South Australia and New South Wales could well be moving in that direction in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> To illustrate the general confusion and the multiplicity of bodies involved, I point out that six State life assurance bodies and one Federal body constitute the Life Underwriters Association, which has some 2,000 members. Unfortunately they exercise no overriding power concerning individual members. Some argue that the Association should be able to discipline itself, but there are no sanctions and there is a multi-agent situation. Because of the advent of these new companies to the insurance industry, cut rate premiums are offered and excessive commissions paid to certain brokers just to buy business. Although excessive bonuses are promised in regard to life insurance, it is not until a person is deceased that his relatives realise that perhaps he was sold the wrong sort of policy. There is a need to protect people from that sort of operator. Those who seek protection and pay for it must be looked after, otherwise the widow is placed in a distressing situation. All too often, as politicians, we see the financial plight of people who have been unable to protect themselves and who have been exploited. I, for one, am not going to stand for that and therefore will support the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat, the situation is confused because there are various State and Federal bodies and an absence of discipline. Agents with whom I have had extensive discussion all agree on the need for this Federal legislation. I hope that tonight, or at a later date, the Senate will resolve to look at some of what I might refer to as the self-interest clauses which might unduly help brokers. I believe that certain purging amendments are necessary to purify the intent of the Bill. Over the years the problems of the general insurance industry have been exacerbated by the strength of the brokers in the general insurance industry, who are said to be milking the general insurance companies dry. One has only to look at the profit performance of many of the insurance companies which operate in Australia to see the truth of that remark. If one is not satisfied with that-because there are always exceptions to the general rule-one need only look at the annual report of the Insurance Commissioner, who complains constantly about problems created by low level premiums, cut throat competition and difficulties within the industry, but some of the main problems arise from what I refer to as multi-agents, who exploit their position by directing business to the company which offers them the highest commission, kick-back or reward. Perhaps we should consider registering these multi-agents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains a provision which requires the furnishing of a document showing the amount of commission or payment received by them and this must be communicated expeditiously to the person who has taken out the insurance. I hope that such a provision will be adequate. If a person sees that someone is going to get several thousand dollars, or an unreasonable reward, as a result of his taking out insurance possibly he will give thought to going to somebody else who might take a slightly reduced commission and thereby lower his premium or give him greater benefits or bonuses. So a provision which requires a person to state the emolument or commission that he is to receive should be sufficient inducement to weed out the less scrupulous in the industry. I support the Bill but hope that in due course appropriate amendments such as I have suggested will be agreed to. I repeat, I support the intent and purpose of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to support the Bill introduced by Senator Evans. I will not delay the Senate unduly. I, as well as many other senators, have a plane to catch at 7 o'clock in the morning, so I will speak in brief and general terms about the desirability of such legislation. However, at the outset I must commend two of my colleagues for their role in getting the Bill to this stage. The first, of course, is the honourable member for Hawker in another place, Mr Jacobi, who, for over 10 years has sought persistently to have legislation such as this implemented. We can learn from the history of his efforts that no matter how necessary and desired legislation and reform may be, the road to reform in this parliament and country is extremely hard and difficult. The other person I must compliment is Senator Evans who, despite facing hurdles tonight, has been able to succeed in having this piece of legislation introduced and debated in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation that we are discussing tonight is not radical. Its history has been well documented in earlier speeches. I will not go into any great detail but the need for the legislation has been shown time and time again over the last 12 years. The Australian Law Reform Commission, in its report in 1980, presented the draft Bill which is very much the subject of our debate tonight. In its report the Commission managed to document that for the 10 years to 1979 insurance brokers had gone insolvent to the extent of causing a loss of $7m to consumers. Since that time, in the years 1980 and 1981, a further $7m has been lost to consumers because of insolvencies. The need was great in 1979, when the matter was presented to us by the Australian Law Reform Commission. The need has become much greater in the last two years, as can be evidenced by the facts. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Federal Government has shown great reluctance in supporting this piece of legislation. However, that has not always been the case. In April 1976 the Acting Treasurer at the time gave a commitment that the Government would introduce supervisory legislation to cover that field. That was a follow-up to the Bill prepared by the Whitlam Government in 1975; it was a follow-up to legislative measures taken in Queensland as early as 1960; and it was a follow-up to legislation enacted in the United Kingdom in 1977. However, the Government, having made that commitment early in 1976, time after time since then has moved itself away from that initial commitment. In March 1977 it revoked its promise and said that it would be looking at a system of self-regulation of the industry through the Insurance Brokers Council. Then, in 1979, the Treasurer announced that no longer would the Government look at that sort of system but rather that a system of voluntary regulation would be implemented. Six months later the whole commitment of the Government to reform in that area was scrapped. To quote another person in another time, the Government in this respect has taken 'more positions than can be evidenced in the Kama Sutra'. </PARA>
<PARA> The States have recognised the need for such legislation. As late as November 1980 a council of State Ministers met and decided that Federal legislation should be enacted. In the meantime, three State governments have adopted measures to implement some type of regulation of the industry. What we will have has been very well stated by Senator Siddons, who spoke before me: We will have a mismatch of legislation; we will have a number of organisations implementing legislation with no real consistency, with no real ability to have consistent regulations and industry controls. That was something which the Australian Law Reform Commission in its 1980 report, suggested was vital. That is something which the Government, by its inactivity in that area, is disregarding. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems involved, which this Bill tries to meet, are varied and wide-ranging. They range from the ability at the moment for anybody, irrespective of their qualifications or background, to set up in the industry, be it as a broker or an agent. At the moment one does not know how liquid or financial a broker or agent is when one deals with that broker or agent. We are not talking of petty amounts of money; we are talking about big business and millions of dollars. In fact, the Australian Law Reform Commission indicated the amount of money involved in the industry. As I mentioned earlier, we also talk of collapses which in 12 years have involved over $14.3m. The need for regulation is there. The Government has not responded to that need. However, I am pleased to note that the Government honourable senators who have spoken thus far in the debate tonight have accepted the Bill, albeit in principle. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the needs are many. I list them very briefly without going into them to any extent. I have mentioned the way in which a broker can set up business without training or qualification. There is the way in which the moment brokers are bound to, or heavily influenced towards, the policies of one particular company, be it by some type of financial commitment or otherwise. but what derives from that situation is a situation in which brokers find that they deal with companies that give them the greatest commission. Those companies might not be those which offer the best security for their clients. In this respect it is the interest of the broker that is primary and not the interest of the person for whom he or she is acting as agent. In that respect one also looks at the further danger that a person interested in obtaining insurance can be seriously misled by incompetent, careless, biased or dishonest advice. It is the advice not of the honest broker but of that sort of broker which this legislation attempts to cover. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment there is no clear cut, coherent code of financial practice governing the handling of money by brokers on behalf of insurance companies. The Law Reform Commission report in that instance, recognised that there very well could be a situation in which, because of insolvency of a broker, an insurance company might also find itself in financial difficulties. Of course, we have also the other area of concern; that is, that in the case of insolvency of brokers, consumers lose money in one of two ways: They may have to repay their premiums, but in many instances, as has been instanced time and time again in the last twelve years, they may find themselves in a situation in which they have no insurance at all because of the deliberate action of brokers to maintain funds in their own accounts in order to obtain financial gain from those funds. I believe that previous speakers in this debate have canvassed the area quite widely. As I said earlier, I do not want to speak too long on this area. In summing up, I give one quotation from the Law Reform Commission report No. 16 on insurance agents and brokers. I turn to page 81 of that report, which at paragraph 127 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations for imposing regulatory controls on insurance brokers are directed primarily at ensuring financial probity. </PARA>
<PARA>I can now understand why this Government, with its ministerial record, does not accept that financial probity should be applied in government administration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Bill 1981. There seems to me to be an unholy alliance at this stage. At one point in my career in this Senate I was called 'the underwriter' by Senator Wheeldon, who was the Minister for Social Security at a time when the Opposition was trying to nationalise the insurance industry. I have had a continuing interest in that very important sector of the Australian economy. I think that people often tend to disregard the significance of the insurance industry in Australia. That industry is committed to providing a considerable amount of revenue for the Government for its purposes. I think that for some time now this measure has been requested and desired, yet the Federal Government has chosen to sweep it under the carpet repeatedly, although I think that inherent in some of the previous activities of the present Government is an admission that something of this nature may be required. But it has never accepted the challenge associated with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Law Reform Commission gave consideration to submissions made to it by the industry. In many instances, although the Law Reform Commission recognised some of the points made by the industry, it did not entirely agree with some aspects of the industry's submissions. However, I think that the Law Reform Commission has made a good contribution in this matter. The industry stated in a submission to the Law Reform Commission:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a multi-agent (i.e. an intermediary who acts as agent for more than one insurance company in respect of a single class of business) operates like a broker, in that he is free to recommend to his client which insurance company (out of those for which he acts as agent) will best suit the client's needs. To this extent the multi-agent, like the broker, acts as agent of the insured not of the insurer. Secondly, it may be difficult or impossible for an insured who receives wrong or misleading advice from a multi-agent to determine to which of the agent's principals he will be able to have recourse for the conduct of the agent. </PARA>
<PARA>The Law Reform Commission's response to that was:</PARA>
<PARA> It is in the public interest that there should be a clear demarcation between agents and brokers: any insurance intermediary other than a regulated broker should be deemed to be the agent of the insurer . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In the second paragraph it goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the problem of recourse to an insurer for a multi-agent's misconduct arises only with respect to conduct during the (usually) short period of time before the multi-agent identifies a particular insurer with whom the insurance will be placed-from that moment on, that insurer is liable for the conduct of the multi-agent in relation to that contract of insurance (Bill cl. 10 (1)). The limited risks to the public which arise before particular insurers are identified do not warrant the additional regulation of tens of thousands of life and general multi-agents for the sake of requiring them to possess professional indemnity cover. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission that was set up to examine this subject goes on to give other reasons why that submission does not entirely appeal to it. I think it is significant to realise that the industry wants some sort of regulatory control over agents in the interests of the protection of people. I think it is evident throughout the community that some agents have not acted in an entirely ethical way and have offered enticements to their clients to accept propositions which are not soundly based or in the best interests of the client concerned. I think that has been quite clear in many cases where people have been coerced into undertaking an insurance cover either in the life or general area. In the long run it has been shown that the cover has not been in the best interests of the client who the agent purports to serve. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly-this is quite important to me and it has been mentioned before by previous speakers in the debate-the six States of the Commonwealth agree that it is a requirement and a necessity to bring some regulatory control into the whole industry. That weighs very heavily on me and persuades me to support the Bill quite clearly. Some people may suggest that the Commonwealth may not have the constitutional power to do this but I am assured by reading the background papers that have been presented that that is not the case. The Commonwealth clearly has the constitutional power. I have checked that with my learned colleague, Senator Missen, who has reinforced that conclusion. I believe it is a requirement that should be introduced. This is a necessary Bill that should be passed in the interests of the industry at large and the community that that industry serves. With those few remarks, I hope that the Senate will support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not surprised that Senator Withers says: 'Shame'. It is well known that he has supported the insurance industry for years. That should teach him to interject. The first reason I oppose the Bill is that its introduction would be yet another interference by the Federal Government into commerce in a completely non-useful way. Secondly, my State of Western Australia has already legislated quite well, thank you very much, and I am quite certain that the Premier of my State would say exactly the same as I am saying. The State has legislated quite effectively to prevent the excesses of crooked or careless brokers. We have to concede that there has been quite obvious crookedness on the part of some people and, on the part of others, outright carelessness with moneys that were entrusted to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have to say that I am not really impressed by the insurance companies' case which seems to attempt to drive brokers out of business. The companies obviously do not like being harrassed by brokers who, on behalf of clients, will always seek the best deal for those clients. The biggest problem for me and others who are concerned about this situation is that, as Senator Watson pointed out, there are many simple, good people who are robbed by the unscrupulous and the smart. This happens in any industry, not just in the insurance industry. The big problem is how far one can go to protect people who have money in their hot little hands. As we all know, one is quickly parted from the other. There are some people who thrive on doing that; it is their living and their businesses to do just that. Our wonderful English language is so comprehensive and varied in meaning that it becomes almost impossible to frame laws about commerce which do not have holes.

The holes in the legislation which we try to frame are of a size that would allow a team of horses to drive through. In fact, a panzer division could not only drive through the holes; it could drive all over them. Honourable senators know that that is the whole essence of the laws in commerce; it is impossible to protect members of the public completely from those who are determined to rob them. I can see that it is our duty as legislators, when there is sufficient evidence, to try to protect people. We are here on their behalf to protect them if we can. But as I have said, the difficulties of doing that sometimes leads us into greater difficulties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe the Western Australian State Government has done the job of protecting the public in Western Australia sufficiently well for me, as a Western Australian senator, to accept that and to say that we in Western Australia have reasonable protection. Therefore, I do not want Commonwealth legislation which may confuse, interfere with or attempt to override Western Australian laws on this matter or-I will say this while I am on my feet-any other matter. I think we have sufficient difficulty between the Commonwealth and the States now and, for the sake of my own skin, I do not intend to spend too much time emphasising those difficulties. They have gone on for a long time. There is enormous resentment in many of the States, particularly in Queensland and Western Australia, about the interference of the Commonwealth Government. Already I, as a comparatively new senator in this place, have found myself in situations where I have had to spend a lot of time explaining what we are doing here. That does not seem to be understood by people in the remoter parts of this continent, particularly in Western Australia and Queensland. I will not contribute in any way to the difficulties that already exist. I think we can say, as a general statement, that there is far too much legislation about everything. </PARA>

Frankly, I find such a request absolutely horrifying. Whatever evidence is available to us, inquiring as we do and from moving about the country, from our constituents who complain that they are being robbed by unscrupulous brokers should force the States to take the necessary action. But, when the industry comes to the Government and asks for guidelines and regulations, I would say that that industry is in a very sad state of repair.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to state the Government's position with regard to the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Bill. The Government's attitude was quite clearly spelled out during the speech of the Minister for Finance, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, during the second reading debate in this place on a previous occasion. The Government will not proceed with the introduction of any legislation along the lines recommended by the Law Reform Commission for the regulation of brokers. Substantially the arguments that have been put down by Senator Martyr on this matter are the ones which the Government generally supports. Clearly our position is that we oppose this Bill and we will continue with that attitude throughout.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I am indebted to honourable senators who have spoken tonight for, for the most part, their careful, thoughtful, well researched and conscientious contributions to this debate. I am grateful also for the contributions made not only originally by the Australian Law Reform Commission, on whose shoulders my effort and that of Mr Jacobi ultimately rest, but also by those representatives of all the various parts of industry who have been so active in recent weeks and months in talking to all of us and putting their points of view. Not only have they put their views as to the necessity of national legislation-in fact they have been unanimous about that-but also they have put different points of view as to what the contents of the legislation should be. It has been very helpful to those of us on all sides of the chamber in reaching here tonight what seems to be very close to a consensus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Several criticisms have been made of the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Bill, most notably in the original second reading reply of the Minister for Finance, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, back in August and also tonight by Senator Martyr and more briefly by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Messner. Those criticisms seem to be five-fold: That no demonstrable need has been established for the Bill; that no demonstrable benefit would flow from it; that the costs involved in applying the resources needed to police it are not justified by the return to the industry or to the community that would flow from that application; that the industry is not in fact completely unanimous as to every jot and tittle of the content of the Bill; and that there is no need for legislation of this kind so long as the States are capable of enacting their own legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the time and the anxiety of most honourable senators to have this matter wrapped up tonight if possible, I will not say anything more about the questions of the need or the benefit that would flow from this legislation. Senators such as Senator Missen very amply stated that case tonight, as indeed have several others. Nor will I say anything about the state of play within the industry except to acknowledge the fact that, as I have indicated, not all sections of the industry are completely happy with every aspect of the Bill. That is inevitably the case with major regulatory legislation of this kind. Compromises are inevitable and not everyone will be perfectly happy. But it is certainly inaccurate to convey, as Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle did originally in her reply, the impression that there is genuine hostility to this. On the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me focus on the two questions of the resource cost of this legislation and the capacity of the States to produce a satisfactory solution in this area. In regard to the resource cost of the legislation it needs to be said, and said quite clearly and specifically, that first of all, there is certainly no necessity or justification for superimposing a new and highly costly structure for the receipt and investigation of complaints in relation to offences or potential offences under this legislation, given the existing avenues for consumer complaints through the Consumer Affairs Bureau, the Trade Practices Commission and of course the offices of the Insurance Commissioner and the Life Insurance Commissioner, not to mention the existing industry organisations. Where it appears to any of these bodies that an offence may have been committed under the legislation, the matter can, should and will be referred to the Australian Federal Police for investigation and, if necessary, prosecution. To the extent that we are talking about an elaborate enforcement apparatus being necessary, that enforcement apparatus in fact will be the existing police force. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point is that it was never intended to establish investigative machinery within the offices of the Life Insurance Commissioner or the Insurance Commissioner because the emphasis in this legislation is on establishing standards of conduct with which all participants in the industry are obliged, subject to heavy penalties, to comply. Obviously there will be a degree of scope for evasion but the Law Reform Commission is confident-I think honourable senators who have spoken tonight are equally confident-that the vast majority of insurance operators will comply and that the prospect of heavy penalties for individuals will be, in itself, a very severe disincentive to illegal conduct where there is any possibility, as there will be, of that conduct coming to light subsequently, not least in the context of insolvencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining point that needs to be made about costs is this: Staff duties and the kind of staff quotient that we contemplate being involved in the apparatus established under this Bill will be quite limited. The staff will be involved in no more than the registration of brokers, the receiving of fees and the checking that insurance requirements of the basic kind have been met. The commissioners have the power to order an inspection and audit of a broker's accounts. Clause 33 covers the worries that I think Senator Watson had in that respect. But this power is expected to be used sparingly and the cost of those audits can be expected to be covered by the brokers themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that it is possible to do any arithmetic about this, it is our estimate that the costs of establishing this kind of secretarial apparatus will in fact be covered by the registration fees themselves. If we base our calculation on an estimated registration of about 1,000 brokers nationally, and that is out of the existing estimated population of between 2,500 and 3,000 intermediaries which are presently describing themselves as insurance brokers but, of course, not all of them are properly so described, and if we base the calculation also on a registration fee of around $200 per broker, the administrative budget for the whole exercise would be about $200,000 only, which would allow for two permanent staff plus a couple of casual staff together with the costs of phones, rent, equipment and so on. That will in fact produce a situation where we have a thoroughly manageable apparatus within the framework of a self-financing registration system. </PARA>
<PARA> The costs to a small broker, looking at it from his point of view, we would estimate roughly as follows: The annual audit of the insurance broking account, the centrepiece of the regulatory apparatus, about $500; the minimum payout that would be required for professional indemnity and fidelity guarantee insurance, which is also a central component here, about $1,000; a registration fee of about $200; creating a total annual liability of about $1,700. They are the sorts of orders of magnitude we are talking about. I think it is important to get that into perspective, not least in the light of things like the Age editorial of 25 May 1981 which came up with this extraordinary proposition:</PARA>
<PARA> The draft legislation would require the creation of another 50 to 60 Public Service positions and cost the taxpayers more than $1m per year to operate. </PARA>
<PARA>The not very invisible hand of the Treasury is at work again, I think, when we are looking for a source for that piece of inaccurate and wholly misleading data. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining point to make in response to the criticisms that have been advanced of the Bill, particularly by Senator Martyr, tonight relates to the capacity and enthusiasm of the States themselves to legislate in this area. I think the basic point to be appreciated is that as late as November 1980 the consumer affairs Ministers from all States, including Western Australia, were requesting explicitly, overtly, on paper that the Federal Government implement the Australian Law Reform Commission's recommendations as a matter of urgency. What has happened subsequently, with the Commonwealth announcing its position as it has, is that each State successively, regrettably, has been obliged to talk about enacting legislation of its own and in the case of Western Australia actually proceeding to such legislation. The difficulty about this, although the mere existence of that legislation does acknowledge the fact that everyone believes there is a need for legislation in this area, is the difficulty of keeping that legislation uniform across the country in a situation where we are often talking about what is essentially a national industry with nationally based insurance companies, many national sized brokerage firms operating around the country and a fast flow of cash to service the various clients involved. It is a national industry; it needs national legislation. Indeed, that national legislation has long been sought by the States themselves. For those reasons, I urge the Senate once again to follow the lead of the many honourable senators from all sides of the chamber who have spoken so carefully and effectively tonight in support of this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> 1. Page 4, clause 10, leave out sub-clause (1), insert the following new sub-clause:</PARA>
<PARA> ''(1) An insurer is responsible, as between the insurer and an insured or intending insured, for the conduct of his agent or employee, being conduct which-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) it was reasonable for the insured or intending insured in his circumstances to rely on; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) was in fact relied on in good faith by the insured or intending insured,</PARA>
<PARA> in relation to any matter relating to insurance and is so responsible notwithstanding that the agent or employee did not act within the scope of his authority or employment, respectively.''. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Page 14, clause 28, sub-clause (2), paragraph (a), leave out '', as soon as it is reasonably practicable,'', insert ''forthwith''. </PARA>
<PARA>The first amendment is to clause 10 of the Bill. The amendment is designed to modify slightly the proposition contained in the original Law Reform Commission Bill governing the liability of insurers for the conduct of their agents, whatever it might be and whether the conduct of the agent went beyond the scope of the authority that had in fact been granted to the agent in question. It has been argued by some people, I think plausibly, that that perhaps imposes an excessive obligation in some ways upon the insurer in situations where no reasonable insured could possibly have thought that the conduct in question was in fact that of an agent acting as an agent. It is for that reason that the modification of language embodied in this amendment is in fact advanced. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendment proposed is to clause 28, which relates to the obligation, again, of agents to pay over the premiums they receive to the insurer. At the moment that obligation is cast in time terms as an obligation to pay over 'as soon as it is reasonably practicable'. It has been felt, I think rightly, by some critics of the Bill that that is not sufficiently precise for the kind of financial obligation that ought to be involved here. The proposal in this amendment is accordingly to substitute the word 'forthwith'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition I would like to pay a compliment to the sponsor of this Bill, the Industrial Democracy Bill 1981. I suppose it could be likened to the early British trade union movement developed by the Cadbury family in Britain. I think Senator Siddons's influence in the Victorian industrial relations area as a very benevolent employer is well known. There are two points to be made about the Bill. Its ramifications on industrial democracy have to be evaluated against some of the experiments in countries as far away as West Germany and Yugoslavia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The one point I would make is that I understand that the honourable senator who sponsored this Bill is to meet the Australian Council of Trade Unions tomorrow. Our own party manpower committee has examined the Bill. It was very receptive to it in principle, but we realised that with our dual wage structure, with Federal and State awards, there would be areas about which we would certainly want to consult the trade union movement. The fact that this preliminary conference is taking place between the honourable senator sponsoring the Bill and the ACTU, I think, justifies the discussion being adjourned.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) has moved that the Senate do now adjourn. I think it is important before the Senate adjourns that there be some understanding of what has taken place here tonight. I do not want to enter into recriminations but I think it is important that the position be on the record. What happened tonight, leaving aside the debate earlier today in relation to the social security legislation, which in part was somewhat acrimonious, was that two motions were moved, one by the Opposition and one by the Government, in relation to the program of General Business which would take place tonight. They were not voted on. Honourable senators will recall that they were not voted on for very obvious reasons-because neither side is succeeding much with procedural motions in the Senate at the moment. The position was accepted by us that the order of General Business tonight would be according to Senator Messner's amendment to Senator Robertson's motion. So what we had tonight was, first of all, a debate on the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Bill and that was disposed of by vote. Then we had the calling on of Senator Siddons's private member's Bill, the Industrial Democracy Bill. In order to facilitate the progress of the Senate's work and to facilitate the carrying out of the offer which was made quite explicitly by Senator Grimes this evening, that the Government could introduce its social security legislation and we would be quite prepared to deal with it tonight-that offer was made by Senator Grimes-Senator Mulvihill spoke on the Industrial Democracy Bill for just five minutes and then moved that the debate be adjourned. It was then resolved that the debate on that Bill should become an order of the day for the next day of sitting. That was done to facilitate the progress of the Senate's business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next matter which was due to be called on in agreed General Business order was Senator Colston's Bill, which has had a very chequered career in the Senate in relation to Senator Colston's capacity to have that Bill dealt with. The suspension of Standing Orders was moved in order that Senator Colston could bring that Bill on. I must say that I consulted at the time with both the Government Whip and the Minister in charge of the House, as I thought, about that Bill and I was told that there were no Government speakers on that Bill. So the intention of the Opposition was to bring that Bill on and dispose of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the matters of considerable interest tonight in the Senate has been the social security legislation about which there was some discussion earlier this evening. I understood that it was common ground that it was important legislation and that the Government was evidencing a little more concern than other elements in the chamber about the fact that if we did not process the legislation tonight there would be delays in payments which are to be made under that legislation. The proposition was put to the Senate that if it dealt with my motion at 8 o'clock or soon thereafter the Bills could be dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I pointed out that if the Opposition and the Australian Democrats wished to make changes to the Bills we had the machinery to send messages to the House of Representatives. My motion included a requirement that the messages should be returned to us, and I offered the prospect that the Bills therefore could be dealt with this evening. That, of course, is one of the points which are still floating around in the subterranean currents in the chamber at the moment and which are causing some agitation and concern. As I said earlier, I have been agitated and concerned myself to see that the legislation is passed for the reasons that I will not canvass again. However, it is quite clear that further consideration of the Bills will take a considerable time. My own understanding was that, if we accepted that there was a way of meeting the objection which the Opposition had to several clauses in the Bill by sending messages to the House of Representatives, then it was perhaps feasible that the Bills could be dealt with, and indeed I had made every effort to arrange it so that the Bills could be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not simply a matter of running over to the House of Representatives and saying that we have done something. It does require certain technical things to be fulfilled. Compliance with section 56 of the Constitution is necessary if one is to make a change to those Bills as is a further message from the Governor-General to the House and so on. It is not simply a matter which can be dealt with by saying that we will do it any time of the day or night. </PARA>
<PARA> The brief conversations that I had with some of those concerned with the legislation indicated to me that it was thought that there would be many more hours of debate. There would probably be some constitutional dispute about the ways in which it was dealt with. Senator Grimes indicated to me, and I understand that he has indicated this publicly, that he is not going into any debate with any conditions imposed. So the position is that we have no chance of dealing in an orderly manner with these Bills, of getting them to the House of Representatives, of having them dealt with and of getting a message from the Governor-General. </PARA>

I thought that there was an invitation to give some indication. I indicated at 8 o'clock that I thought that this legislation should be given priority. I indicated that the mechanism was available to enable us to get a message to the House of Representatives, if that was the will of the Senate, and that it could be processed this evening. That is no longer the case. We can, if we wish, stay here and, for the edification of those who like to think that Parliament is a pretty hopeless place, try to prove them right. I personally think we have got past that point. We have clearly got past the point where this legislation can be passed tonight, and I believe therefore that the Senate should now adjourn.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to clarify the issue and give a contrary view to that which we have just heard from Senator Chaney. I made the offer on behalf of the Opposition, shortly after 8 o'clock, that after General Business was dealt with tonight we were perfectly happy to deal with Chaney's Bill, the Social Services Amendment Bill. We could have finished the second reading debate and gone into the Committee stage and moved our requests on clauses 18 and 21 without much debate. The Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats had made the reasons for their objections to those two clauses perfectly clear. Those requests could then have gone to the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The House of Representatives is still sitting. Opposition members of the House of Representatives have been told that they can be expected to sit into the early hours of tomorrow morning. Those requests could have gone over to the House of Representatives, been considered, come back here and we could have sat tomorrow as we offered to do to consider those requests. The obligation is now on the Government. If it wants to complete this legislation, it can do so by allowing us to continue the discussion of this legislation tonight. It was not willing to do so. The Government was not willing to do so because I believe Senator Chaney got his messages garbled. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is still possible under the Standing Orders for Senator Chaney, if he is fair dinkum, to move for the suspension of Standing Orders so that we can very briefly consider this legislation tonight and send our requests to the House of Representatives. We offer to do so. We offer to come back tomorrow and consider any requests which come back from the House of Representatives. It is obvious the Government does not want to do that. It wants to make cheap political capital out of the fact that this legislation did not get through this House today. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation, which involves 28 per cent of Budget expenditure, was debated in this House for only a couple of hours today. The only contribution we have had from the Government was four minutes from Senator Walters-someone who is notorious for getting up and taking her full time. The opportunity is there for the Government to suspend Standing Orders to bring this legislation on. If the Government does not want to do so, so be it. If the Government is saying that the single unemployed will have their increased payments delayed by a short time, it is the Government's responsibility; it is not the responsibility of anyone on this side of the House.

They will be brief but I do wish to have the record clear. The first thing I would like to say is that, at my request, Government senators did not put themselves on the speaking list, for the reasons outlined by Senator Walters-briefly, to endeavour to ensure that we could reach these Bills, deal with them today and have them passed into law.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Teague interjected that he wished to make a long speech and I understand that a number of honourable senators on this side wished to speak in support of the positive aspects of the Bill. I will not canvass at length the matters raised in the debate but I draw attention to the fact that this legislation represents the minor part of the changes made to the social security payments system during this financial year. The major part of the payments are made under the automatic indexation provisions and were referred to in the second reading speech. The annual cost of the increases which are granted automatically in respect of pensions and benefits this year is of the order of $700m. It would have been very easy, from listening to the major debate, to forget that this year we are looking at a social security budget which is $35m short of $10 billion-an increase of $1,265m or 14.7 per cent over last year's figure. I just say that to indicate the framework within which only limited discretionary changes could be made to the system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the debate Senator Grimes suggested-other honourable senators referred to it also-that there was a need for a more selective approach to welfare. I point out that the changes made do generally meet that category. I do not believe that anyone would dispute that the increase in the supplementary assistance to pensioners and the assistance to single unemployed are in that category. Although there was criticism of the change in family allowances, in that it was not selective, I point out that even Professor Henderson suggested that the position of poor families should be tackled by making considerably increased payments to large families. I believe that if one examines the speeches made on the Bill one will find a considerable amount of conflict between speakers on the other side about whether it is desirable to be more directive, but that will have to wait for another day. Usually I have to thank honourable senators on the Government side of the chamber for their support of a Bill. On this occasion I have to thank them for their restraint in trying to reduce the time spent on the legislation with a view to getting it passed. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to an item of great contention upon which presumably brief speeches will be made in Committee-the question of reducing the right to unemployment benefit of spouses of strikers-I can only say that whilst that has been described in this chamber as an example of the Government using the social security system for industrial purposes I ask honourable senators to contemplate whether indeed it is not a case of the reverse being true, of the present social security system being one which provides a buttress to the industrial situation and ensures that the burdens which are incurred when strike action is taken are not borne by those who are responsible for taking the strike action but are spread to taxpayers generally. Whilst it was said during the debate that many letters had been written objecting to what is proposed in the legislation, I can only say that I received much correspondence objecting to a situation in which the taxpayer generally is called upon to subsidise the cost of strikes in this community. It is a matter on which I have had a great deal of correspondence and I believe that there is a very strong feeling in the community that that situation should not occur. </PARA>
<PARA> Needless to say, the Government opposes Senator Grimes's amendment and does not accept it. In the interests of brevity I will not canvass all of the items. I simply say that we reject all of the points listed in the amendment and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>The reason for our objecting to this clause has been made pretty clear in the second reading debate, I believe. It is obvious that any legislation introduced into this place which will impose a penalty on the innocent-in this case, the wife of a person involved in an industrial dispute, or the spouse of a person who has lost entitlement to receive the unemployment benefit-should not be tolerated by this Parliament, this Committee or any other place. It is for that reason that I have moved this first request to excise clause 18 from the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Remove the discrimination in the provision of supplementary assistance against those in government housing;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) provide repatriation benefits for those who served in peacekeeping forces before 1 November 1981, and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) provide eligibility for service pensions for all Allied ex-merchant mariners as is provided for Allied ex-servicemen'. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment is self-explanatory. The first part of the amendment refers to the discrimination against those in government housing and is the same as the amendment which was moved to the Social Services Amendment Bill. It refers to the fact that those in State government housang will not be able to receive supplementary assistance. We believe this discriminates against those people and we believe that that discrimination is unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the second part, we believe that repatriation benefits which will be provided to those who serve in peacekeeping forces after 1 November 1981 should be provided to those Australians who served in peacekeeping forces before November 1981, in particular those who served in Kashmir, in the Middle East or in Cyprus. We see no justice in introducing these benefits for people who serve after 1 November 1981 and not for those who have served before then.</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the third part of the amendment, the Government has promised on many occasions-many Government members support this-that allied ex-merchant mariners would be provided with service pensions. We believe it is quite wrong to provide these pensions only to Australia ex-merchant mariners when many persons who are presently Australian citizens or residents served in war zones during the last world war as Allied merchant mariners in conditions which were as dangerous or more dangerous than those experienced by some servicemen. I think the reasons for the amendment are clear and it is for those reasons that I have moved it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish briefly to rebut the arguments of Senator Grimes in respect of the amendment he has moved. In particular I refer to the second part of his amendment which is in connection with peacekeeping forces. It relates to the period prior to 1 November 1981. This is a matter which was decided by the Budget Cabinet as part of its policy and it is the undertaking that was given in the Budget Speech. With regard to any other representations on this particular matter, of course the Government is prepared always to consider them in terms of the Budget context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the third part of the amendment regarding allied ex-merchant mariners, as has been pointed out in the Senate on previous occasions, the Government's position was to support Australian ex-merchant mariners and, therefore, it moved to extend eligibility for service pensions to that group of mariners rather than to the broader group at this stage. This is a matter of using the resources available in the best possible way on behalf of Australian ex-servicemen and those other categories of ex-servicemen and beneficiaries who are entitled to benefits under repatriation legislation. In the light of the hour, the Government opposes the amendment. I wish the legislation a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a Bill in relation to the provision of senators for the State of Queensland. I think it would be worth while to read the relevant part of the Constitution so that we know precisely what it is we are debating. That part states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate shall be composed of senators for each State, directly chosen by the people of the State, voting, until the Parliament otherwise provides, as one electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> But until the Parliament of the Commonwealth otherwise provides, the Parliament of the State of Queensland, if that State be an Original State, may make laws dividing the State into divisions and determining the number of senators to be chosen for each division, and in the absence of such provision the State shall be one electorate. </PARA>
<PARA>The important proviso there, of course, and the reason that this Bill is before this chamber, is that the Constitution says quite clearly 'But until the Parliament of the Commonwealth otherwise provides'. This is not a matter for the State Government; it is a matter for the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> If I relate some of the history leading up to the inclusion of this provision, I think it will be clear why this provision was put in the Constitution and why the Commonwealth ought to make provision under that section. Initially it was conceived in the constitutional conventions that the senators would be chosen by each State parliament. That remained the settled opinion of the conventions till well into the 1890s. At the juncture of 1897 there was generated some considerable debate about the selection of senators by the State parliaments. At that time Queensland and New South Wales had upper Houses nominated by the Crown. The argument propounded at that time was that since these Houses were not elected by the people it would be undesirable to have Federal senators elected by any legislation one branch of which was not elected by the people and therefore was not responsible to them. The argument was put that it was highly desirable that senators representing the various States should be elected on a uniform basis, but there would be no such uniformity if some senators were elected by nominated chambers and others by chambers deriving their existence directly and democratically from the people. </PARA>
<PARA> That proposition was debated most strenuously with people taking opposing sides for quite some time until it was finally settled that indeed the people ought to elect the senators; that senators ought not to be elected by the State parliaments. Once that became the settled view it was a very simple step to move to the provision which is now currently embodied in the Constitution; that is, one State, one senatorial electorate. The view was easily pressed, and with great force, that the people of each State in choosing senators for that State should vote as one constituency. It was argued in the conventions that if a State were divided into electorates and if a locality became the guiding principle of selection, the special purpose for which the Senate was constituted would be obscured. That purpose was that each State should be represented as a whole, as one entity, and not as divisions or sections. </PARA>
<PARA> The counter argument proposed to that was that the election of senators was a matter of State concern and that each State should be allowed to decide how the senators were selected, by whatever means and whatever type of divisions they so chose. That was in fact opposed by all the leading members of the conventions. It was pointed out that if such a proposition were adopted it would endanger the principle of State representation in the Senate and would indeed prevent in some cases and in some States a fair view of what the people of that State might decide. It was further argued that local representation was adequately provided for in the House of the people; that is, the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> That then became the settled view and the clause which was agreed upon to go into the Constitution was the first paragraph of section 7 of the Constitution. However, at the last hour at the Premiers Conference in 1899 the Queensland Premier, in response to a vote that had been taken in the Queensland Parliament some eight months previously in which it was decided to divide Queensland into three States, argued forcibly that he could not possibly bring Queensland into the Federation unless an additional provision were provided. That provision is currently enshrined in the third paragraph of section 7 of the Constitution. I will come shortly to the proposition in respect of new States. But I believe that the idea of new States was the basic underlying reason why that item was included in the Constitution. I invite the honourable senators who feel that that may not be the case to read the transcript of that Premiers Conference, which is readily available. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is that the Premier of Queensland, as shown in the transcript, made it quite clear that he was happy and he felt that the State of Queensland would be quite happy if that recognition of the regional differences which existed in Queensland were contained in the second paragraph of section 7 of the Constitution. He made it quite clear that he was happy that the power to take it out be reserved to the Commonwealth. The argument has been propounded from time to time that, if the clause were taken out and if any action were to take place under this provision, that type of action ought to be initiated by the State Parliament. Unfortunately the proposition that it ought to be initiated by the State Parliament is based on an historical inaccuracy. History makes quite clear where the Premier of Queensland stood in 1899, why he argued for that provision and why he was satisfied that the power to act under that provision ought to be retained by the Commonwealth, not by the State of Queensland. I think it is extremely important to make sure that what we are arguing about in historical terms is understood by everybody because there has been some fair misconception of this whole proposition over the 80 years of Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> The arguments in relation to the item have been canvassed exhaustively by Senator Colston in his second reading speech and I do not intend to go through them again. I simply raise the point that what we would be looking at here is the possibility-a possibility which, by the way, was discussed in quite some detail at the conventions-of a gerrymander. It was not put in those terms. The terms were that by a careful adjustment of the boundaries of districts and the grouping of populations within those districts a State parliament would be able to colour unduly the political principles of the senators returned for the State. That is a nice way of saying that a group of people would be returned from a State because of the way that those boundaries were drawn. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are looking at here pre-dates the solidification of the party system. The major concern of the Premier of Queensland at the time was that Queensland could be subjected to far too many protectionists lumping themselves into the Senate so that free trade in Queensland would be disadvantaged. But, of course, the party system soon solidified and in six to seven years into the Federation this proposition about an undue colouration of the political leaning of honourable senators who came here would and must now mean that we would have an undue weighting from one or other of the political parties, depending on who controlled the State Government at the time. I think that honourable senators in the chamber tonight would see that the proposition in relation to one State would not only colour the political affiliations of those honourable senators but also would have a marked effect on the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I would like to reiterate is that since 1949 the numbers have always been fairly close. We have changed the electoral system in the Senate in such a way as to create a fair distribution. What happens in that case is that any move on the part of Queensland to arrange boundaries for the election of senators would affect not only the honourable senators from Queensland but also all the governments of Australia. I believe that the change in the electoral law in relation to senators since 1949 must be given due weight and emphasis in any discussion in relation to movements on this constitutional item. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the proposition in relation to new States. For a long time-indeed, ever since I grew up in north Queensland-I have been a promoter of the notion that we should have new States. One of those is that we ought to have a new State in north Queensland. I believe that such a move is long overdue. But I would not support this item because I believe that it would militate against north Queensland. It would not enable north Queensland to move forward with the thrust which is currently under way to gain a State government of its own which would be concerned, interested in and responsible to, the people of north Queensland. To attempt to move under this provision would enshrine the second-rate citizens standing that the people of north Queensland currently have. It will not enable them to move forward to what is their reasonable expectation; that is, if the Northern Territory can be a new State then north Queensland-which has larger infrastructures, a larger population, more transport, more educational facilities and more expertise in a whole range of primary, secondary and tertiary areas-and its people ought also to be able to look forward to a new State. </PARA>
<PARA> I speak as a strong supporter of the new State movement. I know that Senator Colston is not in agreement with me on that issue, but we coincide in our views that it is necessary that if we are to get any movement in this area, if we are to get justice for the people of Queensland either as one State or as more than one State, then it is absolutely necessary that the Commonwealth Government pronounce on this item. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested that the situation could be left as is. After all, it has been going on that way for 80 years. I believe there are strong arguments why this ought not continue in relation to this provision. It was a temporary provision included for temporary purposes. The fact that no movement has taken place to date does not absolve this Senate-which must have a special interest in this item-or this Parliament from inaction if others have engaged in inaction. It is not a valid argument in any shape or form to point simply to the past and to the inactivity as to the reason why we ought stay our hand in relation to this. Neither is it an argument to suggest that the Queensland Government has no intention of acting under any of these provisions. I think no honourable senator could stand up in this chamber and rightly claim that he would be able to predict what the current Queensland Government might do or what a future Queensland government might do. Such a proposition could not be tested or upheld. It would be open to a party of any political persuasion, whether it be a National Country Party government, a Liberal Party government or an Australian Labor Party government in Queensland--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A government under any political party could seek to change those boundaries in such a way as to advantage itself in the Senate, and it could do that with great rapidity. I suggest that the urgency of this Bill lies in our recent history as well as in our past history. I think that the items surrounding the resignation of Senator Gair point very clearly to the fact that it is open to a State government to move with great rapidity in relation to any item that it so chooses. One wonders sometimes, looking at the forms of this House, how it is possible for State chambers to operate so efficiently from time to time when I am quite sure that if such a similar proposition were put to this House we would probably spend weeks debating whether we should even look at the motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This proposition is important for another reason apart from the ones I have already raised and that is, that Queensland is a State which, of all the States of the Commonwealth, is growing at a tremendous rate in terms of its population, its infrastructure and its industries. It seems to me that we need to make sure that Queensland has the possibilities and is capable of being treated in this chamber and in the Commonwealth as an equal. In that sense that particular provision is a concession that my State no longer needs. It is a concession which accepted that, because of internal problems, it was not possible to undertake a particular move. </PARA>
<PARA> Regional differences have not diminished. Rather, they have increased. But that very increase paradoxically means that we need to introduce this motion that the Commonwealth Government, as set out under the Constitution, ought to take action so that it is decreed that the principle enshrined in those conventions with one State, one senatorial electorate, ought to be enshrined not only in States other than Queensland but also in Queensland. As movement takes place, as growth takes place in Queensland, there will be increasing pressure-I hope successful pressure-for the creation of a new state in north Queensland. At that point it will be vitally necessary to have this out of the way because the creation of a new State in north Queensland, or a division of the State of Queensland, in constitutional terms, if this is left in, will raise the ticklish problem of whether the north of the State is allowed to have this provision or the southern part of the State is allowed to have this provision. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be quite happy at any stage to have a lengthy debate in relation to the new States. The representation of States and new States within the Commonwealth is very clearly provided for within the Constitution. The Constitution provides that a founding State or an originating State cannot have less than six representatives. The proposition I think to be adequate would be to create an additional State in the Northern Territory and an additional State or two in Queensland. I believe Queensland is such a prosperous and growing State that it could very well support three States. What we would have then would be 60 senators-ten States, six senators from each State. There would be equal numbers, as we have now. I am certainly not proposing that we should have any more senators in this place-not unless, of course, we manage to increase our population to such a vast extent that that may seem to be desirable. The proposition that I am putting forward is that I hope the imminent division of Queensland into a number of States needs to be settled before we move ahead into the next item.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legalities in relation to new States are relatively complex. There have been in fact a variety of judgments in relation to this. If the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) is interested in this item, he will be able shortly to purchase a book which I have edited on the whole legal and historical basis of new States. If he purchases that book-(Quorum formed). Madam Acting Deputy President--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just suggested to Senator Baume one possibility in which we could engage. The final reduction line without a change to the Constitution would be six. I think that clarifies the numbers in relation to that item. The proposition boils down to one simple item, that is, that Queensland's senators ought to be chosen on the same basis as senators from all other States. It is a simple equality of representation-equality of the methods of choosing senators. I believe, as it was argued in the conventions, that it would be intolerable for one State to choose its senators by one method which is at variance with the methods used by the other States. I believe the strength of the Federation has been based to a large extent on the type of power that this chamber can exercise and also on the type of moral power that this chamber has because of the way senators are elected. In any democracy, the very essence of a chamber is the way its members are elected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So I suggest that the proposition enshrined in Senator Colston's Bill that Queensland's senators ought to be elected by the same method, in the same way and based on the same types of divisions as every other State, is one which is based on a democratic thrust, and that is equality of representation. The one difference with this chamber compared with the House of Representatives is that the House of Representatives is based on people and the representation of people. Senators represent people on a State boundary basis, not a population number boundary basis. That essential difference characterises the different thrust that this House has compared with the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that to maintain and to enhance the equality of this chamber we must secure that proposition, that is, that senators from Queensland be directly chosen by the people of that State voting as one electorate, and that the Commonwealth Parliament should make it mandatory for the States to operate in that way. It should make quite sure that the State of Queensland does not make laws pursuant to section 7 of the Constitution which would allow it to divide the State because to allow the State to act in such a way would not only divide Queensland but also would create a serious imbalance within the political structure of this country. It would create, I suggest, enormous instability within our parliamentary system. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that that item ought now to be disposed of and that that instability ought to be taken care of because if there is anything that we are aware of concerning this chamber it is that it is necessary to repair a lot of the damage that has been done in this decade to this chamber and to the relationship between it and the House of Representatives. (Quorum formed). I was on my last sentence. The proposition which is contained in Senator Colston's Bill I believe ought to receive the support of the Senate in order to do two things: Firstly, to enhance the position of the Senate in the Federation; and, secondly, to make sure that the State of Queensland has exactly the same laws in relation to the election of senators as all other States and, it is hoped, of the new States which will come into being in the Federation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> (12.21 a.m.) I understand that Senator Jones was seeking the call. I imagine that there will be time for all honourable senators interested in this debate to speak. I was attracted to Senator Macklin's speech. I will make clear in my remarks as I proceed that the Government is quite attracted to the idea behind Senator Colston's Bill, the Senate Elections (Queensland) Bill. I want to make that clear at the outset. But I should like to start by commenting on one of the points raised by Senator Macklin, I think in response to a question asked during his speech, about the number of senators who might make up the Senate if there were new States. Senator Macklin indicated that it might be possible to have Queensland divided into three States and the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory classed as States. In that way we would end up with 10 States each with six senators. He pointed out that the Constitution provides that none of the original States would have less than six senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I sat down and did some pencilling and found that that is indeed a very quaint proposition. There are five senators, I think, from New South Wales in the chamber and five from Queensland. It is very interesting. The representation in the Australian Capital Territory, with its 200,000 citizens, would go from two to six senators. The Northern Territory representation would go from two to six senators and representation in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania would come down from 10 to six senators. I wonder who would be the ones to go. I can imagine the preselection battles. But the nicest part of Senator Macklin's suggestion is that Queensland would move from 10 to 18 senators. So his proposition, put with the highest degree of statesmanship as only a statesman could put it, would mean that all the populous States of the Commonwealth would lose senators. New South Wales, with its four million people, would come down from 10 to six senators. Senator Reid's State, with 200,000 people, would go up from two to six. Queensland, however, would go from 10 to 18. I understand that the honourable senator says that he is a north Queensland boy. I can believe him after that altruism, thinking only of the good of the Commonwealth, thinking only of the good of the Federation. We are looking forward to the book of which he says he has been the editor, and I would say that with that kind of logic I am glad that it is not a book on selling motor cars. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to set down in a very calm way the events of about a week or so ago as I recall them. Senator Colston's Bill has been before the Senate for approximately two months. The second reading speech was made in August or some time thereabouts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week we tried to list for debate and for determination Senator Colston's private member's Bill. I believe that it was listed for debate during last Thursday afternoon in a program that should have allowed us to commence the debate and to have made some kind of decision. We were quite serious in our desire to discuss the Bill. I had advisers present and I had received advice. I had in fact advised Senator Colston of the course that I intended to take in dealing with the Bill. I made it quite clear and open to him what we intended to do. I had indicated to him our desire not to reject his Bill because many of the arguments that have been put are arguments that we find quite attractive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I did put to the honourable senator at that stage was that we were seeking to delay the Bill for a short period, and I will set that out later. If one reads the Hansard of last Thursday and examines the way in which the proceedings were conducted and the time spent on resolving matters one will see that at 5 p.m. we had not even got anywhere close to dealing with the Bill. We had hoped to have it through before the dinner break last Thursday. We were ready to do so. What has happened since then is that with the absence of Senator Harradine from the Senate this week a fortuitous majority has developed. This is an attempt-I do not blame people for their desire; they are members of parliament-to make use of that situation. But I still say that the course which we have proposed to Senator Colston is a desirable course to take. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that one can look at the stated purpose of the Bill which is to ensure electoral justice and find that unattractive. Certainly we do not find that unattractive. The Bill does attract us. The problem with Senator Colston's Bill is not so much a problem that has to do with the substance of what he has proposed, although I will mention later in my remarks some concerns that have been expressed on expert advice we have received. But they are things that we can look at given some time. Our concern is not so much with the substance of the Bill but rather with the construction of the Bill-I will mention that point later-and with the problems of speed and timing and the proper way in which we should proceed. (Quorum formed). </PARA>
<PARA> I was developing an argument about Queensland's Senate representation. I started from the point of Senator Macklin's ingenious suggestion for almost doubling Queensland Senate representation. I had stated that the problems that we see with Senator Colston's Bill do not really relate to the concept, to the idea, of what he is trying to achieve. As I said, they relate to the construction of the Bill and to problems we have with timing and the proper way in which we should move so as to show courtesy to everyone involved and so that we can show, what one might call, fair dealing between governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, we know-you know, I know, we all know-what the numbers are in this place. I have no doubt that Senator Colston can look to a majority of senators, at some time or other, supporting his Bill and giving it the imprimatur of the Senate. The question that concerns us is: When is that proper time? Like Senator Macklin, I was attracted to the background of the Bill. Like Senator Macklin, I went back and looked at section 7 of the Constitution which, of course, has given rise to the concerns which have been expressed today. Section 7 of the Constitution states2</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate shall be composed of senators for each State, directly chosen by the people of the State, voting, until the Parliament otherwise provides, as one electorate. </PARA>
<PARA>I immediately make the point that this Parliament has the capacity to provide the worst kind of gerrymander in any State if it so wishes. That is stated in the Constitution. This Parliament could, if it determined, elect nine senators from Cape York and one senator from the rest of Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to read the rest of section 7. The Constitution clearly provides for a gerrymander by the Federal Parliament of the Senate electorates. I find that one of the curious provisions of the Constitution. If we are going to look at the kinds of reforms which Senator Colston wants us to look at, the kinds of improvements he seeks to make and the kind of electoral justice he wants, should we not also consider the need for some kind of constitutional referendum to pick up this anomoly which would provide for a gerrymander by a corrupted national parliament, and should we not seek to deal with that as well.

I say that that provision of the Constitution gives me some concern when I read it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Section 7 of the Constitution further states:</PARA>
<PARA> But until the Parliament of the Commonwealth otherwise provides, the Parliament of the State of Queensland, if that State be an Original State, may make laws dividing the State into divisions and determining the number of senators to be chosen for each division, and in the absence of such provision the State shall be one electorate. </PARA>
<PARA>The remainder of section 7 makes a number of other observations which are not immediately germaine to what we are discussing. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been attracted, like Senator Macklin and other senators, to examine the way in which this section came to be written and in the way it was written, to try to examine the pressures which came to bear, which led people to put this quite extraordinary provision into the Australian Constitution and to examine what the consequences of that have been. Some quite interesting observations are available. </PARA>
<PARA> It would appear that the reasons for this special provision, relating to the election of senators for Queensland, lie in the historical conditions existing in the 1890s. In the Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth, Quick and Garran said that the provision was inserted in section 7 of the Constitution because of:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the special circumstances of Queensland, its vast territory and scattered population, coupled with the fact that its population seemed to be naturally growing and developing in three divisions which may hereafter become separate States. </PARA>
<PARA>I found that quite intriguing. I will come back to that comment later. </PARA>
<PARA> Two other authorities on the Constitution, Lumb and Ryan, in the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia-Annotated said something quite different. They stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the provision was designed to assuage the feeling of separateness prevalent in the northern and central areas of the State-feelings which had adversely affected Queensland's participation in the convention activities. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, not everyone takes such a view of section 7 of the Constitution. Professor Colin Howard in his discussion of Australia's Constitution in a penguin book published in 1978 said on page 84:</PARA>
<PARA> The second paragraph of section 7 was a transitional provision for special conditions existing in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>He further said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is no longer of any force or effect. </PARA>
<PARA>I was quite attracted to the proposition that Professor Colin Howard would make a statement that most of us here would say is quite patently incorrect in view of the analysis we heard from Senator Colston first and then Senator Macklin, that is, that it is no longer of any force or effect. I think it probably is still of force. </PARA>

<PARA> The question might then arise whether there is any validity still to section 7 of the Constitution. Is Professor Colin Howard correct when he says it is 'no longer of any force or effect'? That is a fair question to ask and it was asked of the Solicitor-General when this Bill was presented. The Solicitor-General was asked to advise whether the Parliament of the State of Queensland may still make laws dividing that State into divisions and determining the number of senators to be chosen for each division. He was also asked to state what steps would need to be taken by the Commonwealth Parliament should it wish to prevent such action. That would be an appropriate opinion to seek. He developed the argument at some length-probably at too great a length to read it to the Senate. However, he concluded by agreeing that probably the section does still have effect but he does not believe the State has been denied power under it. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think they are talking about early 1891. Queensland certainly was present in 1899. That is where the Premier of Queensland made the intervention that the honourable senator mentioned in his address. I shall continue the quotation:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the Conference of Premiers which met at Melbourne in January, 1899 . . . Mr. Dickson, the Premier of Queensland, pleaded hard for an amendment in the Constitution enabling the Parliament of that colony, if it became an Original State, to divide it into divisions for the election of Senators and to determine the number of Senators for each division. The Conference decided that, although this concession would involve a departure from the fundamental principle, yet the Conference, considering the special circumstances of Queensland, its vast territory and scattered population, coupled with the fact that its population seemed to be naturally growing and developing in three divisions which may hereafter become separate States, and considering also that Queensland had not been represented in the Convention and was therefore deprived of the opportunity of having her views and interests adequately considered, decided to recommend the insertion of the special provision which now stands as the second paragraph of the section. </PARA>
<PARA> That Queensland would be an Original State was ensured by the affirmative vote of the people of that colony . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The problem which made this necessary was that Queensland had not been involved during the 1890s in discussions and had not been represented at the conventions. I am not saying that it had not been permitted. As Quick and Garran said, Queensland 'was therefore deprived of the opportunity of having her views and interests adequately considered'. That view was given sufficient weight in 1899 when that amendment of the Constitution was sought. I come back to where I began. We find considerable merit in what Senator Colston says. We believe that this provision has been present in the Constitution for 81 years. We understand that Senator Colston has set in train a process, but we do not want to go back and repeat the mistakes of the 1890s. I believe the saying is that people who fail to learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them. If it was inappropriate not to involve Queensland in the conventions in the 1890s, if it was inappropriate then that she was denied the opportunity of having her views and interests adequately considered, it is equally inappropriate now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am merely drawing attention to the fact that it was not desirable then that the views of one of the States had not been heard on a matter which, in the end, affected it as it did the other States. I am making the point that the lesson we learned from 1899 is one that we do not want to repeat now. If ever Queensland might have used this power-if it had been a State capricious enough to want to use it-surely the political divisions and tensions of the last Senate election, which I mention with deference to my colleague, might have provided an ideal opportunity for seeking political advantage. There is no doubt about the result which would have been obtained had a certain division of the State been undertaken-no doubt whatever. It would have ensured a representation of senators that was different from the one which emerged. The State Government, despite its capacity to interfere, chose not to do so because, like us, it values the electoral process and did not want to interfere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This matter does affect Queensland. We are interested in the views of that State. We are interested in knowing how the Queensland Government will respond to the proposition that there should be Commonwealth action as provided for in the Constitution. At this stage it is not a matter of confrontation between the Commonwealth and the State. What Senator Colston has done is to set in train a process. The only matter for us to determine is how that process should now be taken on. We are interested in knowing Queensland's view. </PARA>
<PARA> A good deal has changed since Federation and it has been suggested that it might not be unreasonable to conclude that the conditions which led to the insertion of the special constitutional provision no longer exists. For this reason, the general subject matter contained in Senator Colston's Bill has been, and is, one of the matters under consideration as part of the general review of electoral legislation by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman). I do not know whether we have made that clear to Senator Colston, but the issue which attracted his attention and led to his drafting a Bill has also attracted the attention of the Minister and has been under Government study for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> Given these facts, as a responsible Government, the moment Senator Colston's Bill was introduced we sought advice as to its legal and constitutional efficacy. Again we went to the Solicitor-General and obtained his advice. The advice we received-I have not the details-can be summarised as follows: First of all, the Bill as drafted, if enacted, probably would be effective to negate the power of the Queensland Parliament to legislate under section 7 of the Constitution. Secondly, significant improvements could be made to the drafting of the Bill to enhance its constitutional validity. I put it to Senator Colston that that is a very important consideration. He would not want any legislation passed by this Parliament in pursuit of a goal which he has identified as being desirable, as being appropriate, to be found to contain a drafting inadequacy which renders it open to challenge. Thirdly, such improvements would be desirable, though not essential, if there were a challenge to the validity of the Bill when enacted. </PARA>
<PARA> It was the view of the Solicitor-General that, generally, there would need to be some substantial reconstruction of the Bill. I do not have to point out to honourable senators, who no doubt have been following the passage of this Bill very closely, that it is in fact a brief Bill-it contains only two clauses. I think that for the Solicitor-General to say, nevertheless, that the Bill should be reconstructed has to do simply with the way in which the safeguards have been put into the Bill to achieve the goals which Senator Colston wanted to achieve. I merely relate to Senator Colston those concerns which have been expressed by the Solicitor-General. The Minister for Administrative Services, with that information, has been examining ways in which the Bill might more appropriately be couched if, in fact, it is desired to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government is of the view that before undertaking to exercise our rights under the Constitution and deciding to determine under section 7 how the electorates should be set up in Queensland the concept of the Bill, restricting as it would the legislative power of the State of Queensland-that is what we would be doing-should at least be fully discussed with Queensland. It should at least be discussed with the Queensland Government. At present discussions are being arranged between the appropriate Ministers of the Commonwealth Government and the Queensland Government. It is our view that those discussions should be expeditious; they should take place. But, pending the outcome of those discussions, the Government is of the view that it would be quite irresponsible for us to proceed further before Queensland has had an opportunity to express a view on a matter which would restrict its legislative powers. </PARA>
<PARA> Those honourable senators who believe in co-operative federalism might say that, whilst perhaps it is appropriate to consider moving in the direction in which Senator Colston wants to move, it is not inappropriate for us to consult Queensland, to advise it of what is proposed and to advise it on how we would like to move. It is not inappropriate for us to get the views of Queensland. It may be that Queensland has valid points to put to us which otherwise we would not learn of. I cannot see that there is any need for us to proceed quickly with this legislation before that consultation can be undertaken. The Minister for Administrative Services is out of the country this week. Before he left I asked him about the negotiations with the Queensland Government. He was able to inform me that contact had been made and that arrangements had been made for those consultations to take place. They are under way. They are required by the Government and they have been set in train. The Government is attracted to the proposition put by Senator Colston that there should be some tidying up of that section of the Constitution. The Government wishes to do two things. </PARA>

<PARA> I am not pretending that these concerns are an insuperable barrier. I mention them to Senator Colston because I know that he would want any Bill which went forward from this place to be impeccable in a constitutional sense. He would want it to be able to withstand any kind of constitutional challenge from any individual or any group that may wish to test it. This concern does not detract from our interest in the proposal, our interest in what Senator Colston has put forward or our appreciation of the service that he has done. What we are saying, however, is that we should delay a little while. My proposal is, since we think that we are coming towards the end of the session-well, we can think these things, if not this week or next week; certainly we are close to the end of session-to agree that at the beginning of the next session we will come back to Senator Colston's Bill. We will determine it and thus give the Commonwealth Government a known and finite period-two or three months-in which it can do those things which I have said are desirable. </PARA>

They made the point that, whatever the reasons-Senator Macklin has pointed out that there were reasons-it was the fact of non-consultation which made some problems. It is my belief that they are problems which can be overcome. To give time for this kind of consultation to take place makes a lot of sense. I am not attacking and have not at any time in my remarks attacked the concept of what is in this Bill or the desirability of ensuring fair electorates for Senate elections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was in my mind to propose an amendment-I am not moving this amendment-to leave out all words after 'that' and to insert the words 'that this Bill be not further proceeded with until the first sitting day of the Senate in 1982 to provide an opportunity for appropriate and necessary government to government discussions'. The reason I will not oppose this amendment at this stage-one of my colleagues might do so later but at this stage we are not proposing it-is that if agreed to it would have the effect of taking Senator Colston's Bill off the Notice Paper. I think that is correct. Again, it is not our desire to have the Bill taken off the Notice Paper. Senator Colston would then have to go through the procedure of the introduction of his Bill, the second reading speech and everything else. That seems to us to be an unnecessary imposition on a colleague. One of my colleagues at a later stage might seek to adjourn the debate. If we could secure the adjournment on the basis of the undertaking that I have given this would enable us to keep the Bill on the Notice Paper and that would enable it to come back for debate at an appropriate time early in the next session. </PARA>
<PARA> I submit to the Senate that the course that we have outlined is really quite eminently reasonable. We are not opposed to what is being put up by Senator Colston in the Bill. We are attracted to the arguments which he advanced but we have a need to follow some procedures as a matter of courtesy and fair dealing. On that basis I am going to leave it to honourable senators opposite or to honourable senators who have taken part in the debate to respond to what I have offered. One of my colleagues who will be following me in the debate may wish to move an appropriate procedural motion at some later stage that would enable us to make some appropriate disposition of the Bill without, I hope, taking it off the Notice Paper so that it could come in for determination before too long. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a third time. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to speak briefly to that motion. The response to the message indicates, of course, that the House of Representatives has considered the request of the Senate. That would indicate also that the Government has considered the request of the Senate for the deletion of clauses 18 and 21 from the Social Services Amendment Bill 1981. That was what I indicated the Government would be prepared to do, that is, to consider the requests if they were made when I spoke at 8 o'clock this evening. The Government believes that these provisions should be enacted into law. It does not accept that the provisions relating to unemployment benefit should be used to protect trade unions against the effects of their actions. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Government wishes to maintain the ability to provide the special benefit in cases of hardship it does not believe it is fair to the Australian taxpayers that they should subsidise the cost of strikes in Australia through their social welfare system. I therefore make it absolutely clear that the Government intends to pursue this proposal. However, to have pursued it by refusing the request would have penalised over 200,000 unemployment and special beneficiaries. Increased payments to them would inevitably have been delayed if the Government had rejected the requests and sent the Bill back to the Senate. This Government has no intention of allowing vulnerable sections of the Australian community to suffer because of the failure of the Senate to accept one aspect of the Government's proposals. Accordingly, the Government has accepted the requests but at the first available opportunity it will introduce fresh legislation containing the provisions which have been deleted pursuant to the requests. The House of Representatives will be asked to pass that legislation as soon as possible and in due course no doubt we will have it before us again in the Senate. I am sorry that the expeditious way in which the legislation was dealt with in the latter part of this evening did not occur during the afternoon. If that were the case we might have had an earlier rising. In any event I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to the motion moved by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney). I find his speech incredible. We are, of course, very gratified that the House of Representatives has accepted the requests sent to it by the Senate, requests arrived at in a very reasonable way and which will result in a much more reasonable Bill. I find it extraordinary that a Minister in another place and a Minister in this chamber would suggest that this legislation was delayed and that the House of Representatives agreed to these requests as a result of any action by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said, it was not by any action of the Government. The Government did what it could to bulldoze this legislation through this chamber. It expected the Opposition and, I assume, the Australian Democrats to accept the blackmail which Senator Chaney repeated in the speech he just made-blackmail to the effect that unless we pass this legislation 200,000 people will not receive the increase in their unemployment benefit. The fact is that the only thing that would have happened is that the increase in their unemployment benefit would have been delayed. The length of that delay would not have been dependent upon any action by the Opposition, but upon action by the Government. If the Government, through Senator Chaney, had been willing to indicate to the Australian Labor Party and to the Australian Democrats at 8 o'clock tonight or at 5 o'clock this afternoon that it would accept those requests the legislation would have gone through at that time without trouble. Senator Chaney was unwilling to do so. He was unwilling to give such a guarantee. Therefore we had to ensure that legislation which was introduced into this Parliament last Tuesday and into this chamber today was not bulldozed through without proper consideration and without proper scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind you, Mr President, that today this legislation passed through the Senate following contributions to the debate from the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats. The only contributions from the Government were a four-minute speech from a back bencher and a slightly longer speech from the Minister. Tonight's result, however it occurred, happens to be a triumph for civil liberties, a triumph for democracy and a triumph for decent legislation in this country. For that reason we are grateful that the Bill has been passed. I feel that it is a sad thing that the Minister in this place and the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) in another place should have tried to paint this as an example of reasonable Government behaviour. In fact it is an example of reasonable behaviour on this side of the chamber in insisting that legislation which is discriminatory and which penalises the innocent should not go through this chamber. If Senator Chaney and Mr Hunt wish to put up this legislation again and, as Mr Hunt suggested, turn it into a Bill for a double dissolution, we will be perfectly happy for them to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator knows very well what he should have done. The situation is that, since 1974, we have had nearly three dozen nights on which the Senate has sat past midnight when its usual time of adjournment is 10.30 p.m. or 11 p.m. On the average, one would presume that one dozen of those nights would have been on nights with an 11 o'clock adjournment and the other two dozen would have been on nights with a 10.30 p.m. adjournment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It should not be thought for a moment that I mind sitting here for as long as is necessary. But I think it is about time that this Senate considered when it should sit. I do not suggest that it should sit less hours. If it is necessary I will sit more hours or longer hours, at any time of the week that is required. The times at night until which the Senate sits are crazy. No one in the rest of the community does it and I think it is about time we stopped. I would support any motion proposed which suggested that we sit on Tuesdays from 12.30 p.m. to 7p.m. continuously, on Wednesdays the same hours as we do now and on Thursdays, 10.30 a.m. to 7 p.m. It is time this Senate paid due regard to the health not only of the people in here-many members of this chamber have died, since I have been here, due to the stress that has been on them-but also to those others involved in the operation of the Senate. It is very important that we do this before somebody else has a heart attack and dies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not take the time of the Senate for very long. I place on record that Senator Townley is not the first person who has raised this matter in the Senate. Repeatedly over the years I have fought with Senator Carrick, since he has been Leader of the Government, over his deliberately keeping this Senate back to the early hours of the morning to get legislation through. Senator Townley had the remedy in his party room; he could have done something there rather than come in here tonight and grandstand about trying to do something for the attendants in this place. He is not the first one who has done it. Honourable senators on this side have raised the matter repeatedly; for years they have tried to get decent hours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The hours that Senator Townley now suggests will make it harder perhaps not for attendants on this side of the building but for the people who work in the dining rooms. He is going to ask them to work longer hours. He will keep the Senate sitting until 7 o'clock and people will be in the dining room until 9 o'clock or 10 o'clock at night expecting waitresses and cooks to attend to their needs. I say finally that he is not the first person to raise this matter. It is a pity that he has not raised it in his party room because the Government parties have had the numbers in years gone by which would have enabled them to do something about it. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) (2) (3) (4) The Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service is currently operating and providing legal assistance to Aboriginals in Victoria. The Service did suspend operations on the two days, 24 and 25 August 1981, of its own accord, despite the fact that it had already received $140,000 from the Commonwealth for its operations from 1 July 1981 and in the knowledge that its total allocation for 1981-82 was $502,000, some 14 per cent above the allocation for 1980-81. In the light of problems subsequently identified in the Service's financial control and general administration, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has approved an allocation of an additional $16,000 to cover the costs of employing a suitably qualified Executive Officer.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. Page 6 of the Budget speech indicates only that the total Budget deficit in 1981-82 would be reduced by almost $1,000m. The Budget deficit, or more accurately the domestic Budget deficit or surplus, is only one of the factors determining the overall growth of the money supply. Nevertheless, the reduction in the Budget deficit will make a major contribution to the Government's policy of slowing monetary growth so as to exercise appropriate restraint of inflationary pressures. In keeping with this objective, the Government is seeking to achieve growth in the monetary aggregates consistent with growth in the M3 definition of the money supply of 10 to 11 per cent over the course of 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The latest national accounts estimates are that real gross non-farm product grew by 4.0 per cent in 1980-81, and at an annual rate of 1.6 per cent, after seasonal adjustment, in the second half of that year. In the notes to the published accounts, the Statistician has pointed to the special problems affecting estimates for periods of less than a year and to the fact that the estimated change in gross non-farm product is liable to substantial revision. Allowance also needs to be made for the sources of the slowing in the growth of GDP in the second half of 1980-81 as measured by the national accounts. Stock movements, which can be particularly volatile at times, contributed importantly to that measured slowing. Final domestic demand, which grew at the very strong annual rate of 6.9 per cent in the first half of 1980-81, continued to grow firmly at an annual rate of 3.5 per cent in the second half. Private business fixed investment continued to grow in the second half of the year at the extremely strong annual rate of 21.2 per cent. As to the outlook for 1981-82 and the Budget forecast of growth in non-farm product of 3-3 1/2 per cent, I refer the honourable Senator to the considerable supporting detail to be found in the Budget documents, particularly Statement No. 2 of Budget Paper No. 1. Developments since the Budget was brought down-for example, the figures published recently by the Commonwealth Statistician relating to his most recent survey of private business fixed investment expectations-remain consistent with that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The repeal of the ACT Companies (Life Insurance Holding Companies) Ordinance 1968 came into effect on 21 August, 1981. The relevant repealing provisions are contained in section 66 of the Commonwealth Functions (Statutes Review) Act 1981. A proclamation was gazetted on 13 August, 1981 fixing 21 August, 1981 as the date for commencement of that section. The costs involved in the repeal of the Ordinance cannot readily be segregated, but would have been negligible.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) On the basis of work-load estimates by the office of the Australian Government Actuary, the cost equivalent of administering the Ordinance if it had been allowed to stand would currently have been around $4,000 per annum. Other minor costs would have been incurred outside the Actuary's office. The decision to repeal the Ordinance was not, of course, taken primarily on financial grounds but was, rather, part of a broader attitude by the Government towards needless regulation.</PARA>

<PARA> The report to which the honourable senator referred was, I understand, based on information included in a paper that was prepared for the Australian Financial System Inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA> The Foreign Takeovers Act applies to acquisitions by a single foreign interest or associated foreign interests of a substantial shareholding in an Australian corporation (this being defined as 15 per cent or more of the voting power or 15 per cent or more to the issued shares of the corporation) and to acquisitions by two or more foreign interests of an aggregate substantial shareholding in an Australian corporation (defined as 40 per cent or more of the voting power or 40 per cent or more of the issued shares of the corporation).</PARA>
<PARA> The information in the paper referred to above indicated that the estimated 21.8 per cent foreign ownership of BHP was of a fragmented nature. As such, the shareholdings do not exceed the relevant threshold of 40 per cent laid down in the Foreign Takeovers Act.</PARA>
<PARA> The foreign portfolio equity investment that has been undertaken in BHP and other Australian companies has the advantage that, by comparison with foreign direct equity investment, it provides Australia with access to overseas funds on a basis that does not involve foreign control.</PARA>
<PARA> For this reason, the Government does not require foreign investment approval to be sought for investments of a purely portfolio nature. The Government is, of course, concerned to ensure that Australians should have opportunities to participate as fully and effectively as practicable in the ownership and control of the country's natural resources and industries, and considers that the present features of the foreign investment policy are being effective in achieving this objective. These features include the Australian equity participation guidelines, which provide opportunities for Australian ownership and control of natural resource projects, and the naturalisation provisions, which provide an incentive for companies that are predominantly foreign-owned to introduce higher Australian ownership and Australian control. It should be noted that the Australian equity guidelines are not primarily concerned with levels of Australian equity in particular companies, but are directed towards ensuring that appropriate levels of Australian ownership and control of natural resource projects are achieved. Careful consideratoin is given by the Government to cases where the size of foreign portfolio shareholdings in a participant in a foreign investment proposal is of potential significance for the purposes of consideration of the proposal against the requirements of the foreign investment policy.</PARA>

The Minister for Science and Technology advises as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been no cuts in the funding of basic research and in particular in the areas of genetic engineering and related sciences.</PARA>
<PARA> The funding of Australia's research effort was reviewed in the budget context and the following levels of funding established for the current financial year:</PARA>
<PARA> The allocation to the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) was increased from $19.2m (which included $0.5m for the provision of a new building for the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research) in the 1980-81 financial year to $23.27m for the current financial year, an increase of 21%.</PARA>
<PARA> Direct appropriations for CSIRO in 1981-82 will total $281.1m, an increase of 23.1% over 1980-81, of which $49.5m is for major capitad projects including $35m for the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory and $6.9m for a laboratory complex for the Division of Chemical Technology. It appears that the 1981-82 appropriation will represent a slight reduction in the level of activity for CSIRO compared to the previous year, as the increase over 1980-81 will be mostly absorbed into the CSIRO's employee's superannuation scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> The allocation to the Australian Research Grants Committee (ARGC) was increased 12.5 per cent from $16m in 1981 to $17.98m which will maintain the same level of activity in 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> Through these agencies the Government has been supporting a wide range of activities which will contribute to our stock of fundamental knowledge essential in the long term development of genetic engineering.</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the Department of Science and Technology in association with the Bank of New South Wales and the Australian Institute of Management (NSW Division) is organising a symposium to be held in November entitled-Genetic Engineering: Commercial Opportunities in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The symposium will aim to alert companies to recent developments in recombinant DNA research and to potential commercial development in Australia. It will provide an opportunity for interaction among industry, research, marketing and finance personnel; assessment of the opportunities and problems of Australian commercial exploitation of genetic engineering techniques and for discussion of the principal issues likely to impinge on such developments.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, provisions have been made under the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act for universities to be classified as approved research organisations for the purposes of the Act. The Minister has recently written to universities and colleges of advanced education pointing out the advantages of this provision. This mechanism will allow universities to make research expertise and facilities available on a contract basis to firms involved in high technology industries and in particular to firms involved in genetic engineering.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 September 1981 (Hansard, page 986), Senator Watson asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice concerning revaluation of the Australian dollar. The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia's exchange rate at any time is determined in the light of both domestic and external economic considerations, and with a view to maintaining and strengthening the overall health of the economy. As far as is appropriate, exchange rate policy is intended to support the anti-inflationary stance of the Government's economic policies. However, the net appreciation of the Australian dollar over the past twelve months emerged, in large part, as a natural consequence of the marked strengthening of Australia's balance of payments over that period.</PARA>
<PARA> It is certainly true that one effect of this appreciation would have been to lower the prices received for exports in Australian dollar terms, including exports from the rural and minang sectors, below what they would otherwise have been. But an offsetting effect would have been to reduce the price of imports in Australian dollar terms, including imports destined for the agricultural and mining sectors. More generally, appreciation tends to have beneficial price effects domestically. The appreciation of the Australian dollar in 1980-81 improved, directly and indirectly, the cost situation for all Australian industry, including the rural and mining sectors.</PARA>
<PARA> Without pursuing the matter in great detail, it seems reasonable to conclude that any net reduction in the income of exporters which may have resulted from exchange rate movements in 1980-81 would have been a good deal smaller than might appear from focussing only upon the exchange rate effects on their gross returns.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the more recent slight decline in the trade weighted value of the Australian dollar, associated with the seasonal deficit in the Australian balance of payments in the recent September quarter, will have tended to reverse the effects outlined above.</PARA>
<PARA> In implementing its exchange rate and other policies affecting the external account, the Government will continue to pay attention to the important interests of Australia's traditional export industries. However, the Government also has to take into account the interests of all sectors of the community, exporters and importers, producers and consumers. In particular, it has to pursue exchange rate policies which will be helpful in returning the Australian economy firmly to a non-inflationary and hence sustainable upward growth path.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the particular aspect of the matter which has been raised by the honourable senator, it is worth noting that changing the mix or basket of currencies used in the process of exchange rate determination would not, in itself, necessarily mitigate the trend in the value of the Australian dollar, whether up or down.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 14 October 1981 (Hansard, pages 1156-1157), Senator Keeffe asked me a question without notice about compensation payments resulting from the Government's call for a boycott to the Olympic Games and sanctions imposed against the Soviet Union and Iran. I responded on the same day (Hansard, page 1166) to three of the matters raised by Senator Keeffe and undertook to have an investigation made of the remaining matters, namely, the total income lost by Australia as a result of the Government's decision selectively to ban various exports to Russia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to advise on the total income lost by Australia as a result of the Government's decision to ban various exports to the Soviet Union. This is because claims relate to unrecouped expenditure, not income foregone, and it is not clear whether the claims received represent the full effects of the Government's actions. It should be noted that the Government's actions would also have resulted in a loss of income by the Soviet Union.</PARA>
<PARA> However, I am advise by my department that only two claims relating to prohibitions on exports to the Soviet Union were received. In one of these cases the export subsequently proceeded and in another the commodity was disposed of at a higher price on the domestic market. Where claims were not lodged, it is probable that commodities affected by the Government's actions were able to be disposed of at a profit on alternative markets.</PARA>
