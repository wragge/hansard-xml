<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister representing the Prime Minister seen a number of articles in newspapers recently relating to the war in Afghanistan, particularly an article in the Melbourne Age entitled 'Afghans abandoned by their friends'? What good did sanctions such as the boycott of the Olympic Games, the wheat embargoes and the cancellation of the student exchange scholarships do? I ask the Minister whether on 19 February last year he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government sees these measures as the beginning of a long sustained haul. There will be no quick fix to the situation we now face.</PARA>
<PARA>Did he also say that, if these things are not done, the lesson which the Soviet Union is allowed to draw is that all it has to do is to sit tight and allow the storm of protest to blow itself out? How does the Minister equate those statements with the Government's decision to lift the wheat embargo against the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and with the Government's general lack of policy and its inaction in relation to the Soviet's continued presence in Afghanistan?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen various articles. I do not recall seeing the one in the Age. I was asked: What good does the Government believe the actions taken by the Government did? The actions taken by the Australian Government, combined with its team work with other governments of the free world, brought to both the United Nations and the whole of the world a strong voice of protest against the USSR, a message that could not have been otherwise conveyed. Undoubtedly the action on the Olympic Games brought more opportunity to say to the Russian people, through the obvious absence of certain delegations to the Games, that significant parts of the world outside were very angry about the action of the Soviet Government in Afghanistan. Generally throughout the world a very strong body of opinion was mobilised against Afghanistan and that, I would put to any reasonable person, was of enormous importance. For example, the Islamic world was mobilised, as never before, in a united view that Afghanistan was not a local thing but an aggression against the Middle East. I would have thought that all those things were of enormous importance. Therefore, I would have thought that the action taken by the Australian Government in common with other governments would merit praise and not criticism.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IE4">Senator ARCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Transport. Is it correct that the domestic pilots and engineers awards are due for revision late this year? What action has the Government taken or can it take to ensure that such negotiations are concluded before the due date without crisis conditions, particularly to ensure that the travelling public is not thrown in as the pawns in what many believe will result in an inevitable strike situation?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2734" SPEAKER="Messner Sen The Hon A.J." NAMEID="9I4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="VETERANS' AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport has provided me with some information on this matter. Ansett Transport Industries Ltd and the Australian Federation of Air Pilots have finalised negotiations on their pilots award which now has an expiry date of 30 June 1982. The Trans-Australia Airlines award covering pilots expires in June of this year. The Federation has drawn up a log of claims but it has yet to present it to the airlines. That is the information known to me. Negotiations are expected to follow shortly. Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett are joint respondents to a claim served by the Australasian Airline Flight Engineers Association in respect of its award which expired on 31 March. The Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association has served identical logs of claims on Ansett, TAA, East-West Airlines Ltd and Qantas Airways Ltd in respect of licensed aircraft maintenance engineers whose awards expired on 1 March.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Preliminary negotiations on the claims are being held in Sydney today. The conclusion of negotiations before the expiry date of awards is not of vital significance to the industry. Negotiations frequently continue beyond the expiry date, with current award provisions continuing while those negotiations proceed. Whilst the industry has a history of direct action in respect of award claims and whilst unforeseen circumstances can arise, we have no grounds at this stage for believing that negotiations between the parties will not be settled satisfactorily. The Government is not a party to award negotiations in the industry, which are conducted within the machinery provisions of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Government does, however, liaise with the parties to ensure that the Government's policies are fully understood and known to all parties.</PARA>

I should also be able to obtain the statistics on meatworks he has asked for. I am not quite clear from the question as to whether the honourable senator would also be concerned with the seasonal openings and closings of meatworks.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for National Development and Energy. It follows from a statement made at Australia's first national energy conference held in Sydney last week which claimed that Australian industry could save $1,000m per annum through the application of energy conservation measures. Can the Minister inform the chamber of the level of demand for oil and other primary energy sources since the introduction of the Government's energy conservation program?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2735" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is general acceptance throughout the Western world that if all reasonable conservation steps were taken in all forms of energy there could be a saving of energy of between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of currently consumed energy without any damage at all to the living standards of the countries concerned. If that could be achieved, of course, it would be of very great importance. The savings of industrial oil products in Australia have been most encouraging. The import parity pricing policy, which was introduced in August 1978, and the conservation campaign have had very significant gains since that time. Whereas up to 1978 the trend in the consumption of oil was very strongly upwards, there is now a very significant trend downwards. Fuel oil and industrial diesel oil consumption in manufacturing industry is expected to be something like 26 per cent less this year than in 1977-78. That is a very big saving. The total primary energy consumption in manufacturing industry is expected to be only 2 per cent greater than in 1977-78, even though the gross domestic product is expected to have increased by over 10 per cent. In general terms there is a healthy trend towards conservation. That is not to say that we should be complacent. It is necessary to keep up the trends both in conservation and in conversion. There is a very encouraging effect now on exploration and the seeking of alternative fuels. In general terms, what is being said in the Press is attainable and we should all work towards its achievement.</PARA></TALK.START>

I draw his attention to the Nationwide program of 2 June 1981, of which I have a transcript, concerning standover tactics against small businessmen in the Indooroopilly shopping centre. Is the Minister aware that these standover tactics are taking place and that a major row is looming in Australia over the business practices of shopping centres and the way in which they treat some of their leaseholders? Is it not a fact that the Federal Government's free market forces policy will result in small business people being left at the mercy of landlords?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Watson, being a Tasmanian senator, would be particularly concerned with the capacity of his State to maintain its communications not only within Tasmania but also with the mainland. I understand that some work bans were imposed for two days this week and that, during two days of negotiations, no further bans were applied. I understand that the situation at present is that negotiations are in some difficulties. I am not certain whether further bans are to be applied in the next day or so. Considerable difficulties have been encountered throughout Australia. I am informed that a coaxial cable failure occurred between Toowoomba and Pittsworth and that that has resulted in severe subscriber trunk dialling congestion on the eastern seaboard, in particular on the Melbourne-Brisbane route. That is not going to help those who are involved in the commercial life of that area, those who are trying to communicate between families or those who need communications for any other reasons. There has been a breakdown in the Sydney-Canberra route, resulting in significant STD congestion between Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne. A Sydney-Tamworth radio bearer has failed. That has resulted in congestion in the Tamworth, New- castle and Armidale areas as well as affecting international traffic by limiting Overseas Telecommunications Commission circuits to Moree. I am sure that all honourable senators will be alarmed to know that earlier this week all direct circuits to Goondiwindi were out of order. Goondiwindi was cut off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On a more serious note, any honourable senator who has read this morning's Sydney Morning Herald will have noticed a report on the front page that yesterday a major fault occurred in the trunk exchange at Haymarket and that disrupted Sydney's STD networks. Against the background of my comments earlier this week that the union was trying to allow for life and limb situations, I also draw attention to the fact that it is reported in this morning's newspapers that the fault at the Haymarket exchange is affecting the emergency number 000 in Sydney. This is a most serious matter for people who use this number for precisely the kind of life and limb situations which were thought to be protected. The Government's concern is that the people of Australia should be able to use communication facilities for legitimate purposes. We are concerned at the extent of the breakdowns that have occurred. The Government is continuing to monitor the situation and to try to ensure that these breakdowns are kept to a minimum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of issues relating to land under claim which are presently the subject of consultation among the Northern Territory Government, the Commonwealth Government and the three land councils in the Northern Territory. As honourable senators will be aware, these three groups have been meeting for some months to try to develop a series of agreed positions in relation to the Aboriginal Land Rights Act in the Northern Territory. One of the issues has been the status of land under claim particularly as it applies to applications for mining exploration licences and other matters of this kind. The matter is unresolved at present. The negotiations, which have been tripartite and constructive and have been designed to try to reach an agreed position, are continuing. I am not aware of the particular Lake Amadeus situation to which Senator Ryan referred. I would appreciate it if she would make this information known to me so that I can follow it up.

I will ask the Minister to look at the matter on behalf of Senator MacGibbon and make sure that every effort possible is being made to ensure that that is being cleaned up. The other matters about which the honourable senator asked are matters of very real concern as well. It would be the Government's intention, I think, to ensure that people have the right of access to Parliament House and have the right to demonstrate and make their point in a proper way.

There are considerable difficulties in having appeals and assessments handled by the repatriation system as quickly as we would all like.

I am sure all honourable senators have enjoyed some sampling of South Australian prawns. The prawn industry in South Australia, I remind honourable senators, is divided into two parts-that in State waters and that in Commonwealth waters. The St Vincent Gulf Prawn Boat Owners Association represents that part of the industry which is in State waters and which is threatened, the Association alleges, by the fishermen taking the prawns in the Commonwealth waters. As a result, the South Australian Government, the State Department of Fisheries, the South Australian branch of the Australian Fisheries Council and the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industry, it is alleged, all seek some restriction on, if not the complete closing of the prawn industry in Commonwealth waters.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the second question this morning on the prawn industry. I am more pleased to get this one because I have some information from the Minister on the position in the north. This year 604 vessels were engaged in prawn trawling in Commonwealth waters in northern Australia; that is, extending from Cape Londonderry in Western Australia to Bowen in Queensland. Of that number, 277 vessels operated on the limited entry northern prawn fishery from Cape Ford in the Northern Territory to Cape York in Queensland. There are, of course, concerns about the possibility of overfishing in this industry. Two principal management controls are imposed in the northern prawn fishery, namely, a limitation on the entry of vessels to that fishery and seasonal closures for a 12-week period to 15 March in two specified areas of the fishery. These areas are Fog Bay and waters in the south-eastern sector of the Gulf of Carpentaria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Outside the northern prawn fishery there are no restrictions on prawn fishing around the northern coast. The fact is that prawn catches can fluctuate widely. The catches from the prawn trawlers in northern Australia have varied between 4,900 tonnes and 13,000 tonnes in recent years. The 1980 catch of 11,600 tonnes was the third highest on record. In 1979, 12,900 tonnes were landed and the record catch of 13,000 tonnes was landed in 1975. Recent catches have been at high levels. I am advised that banana prawns in the Gulf of Carpentaria are heavily fished. However, there is no evidence available to indicate that this or other species are jeopardised by the current level of fishing effort. The management of these fisheries is under continual review by the Commonwealth-State fisheries management committee which comes under the general direction of the Australian Fisheries Council. Additionally, the Queensland Government has limited the number of prawn trawlers operating in territorial waters off the Queensland east coast.</PARA>
<PARA> The only other thing I wish to say is that many honourable senators this week have had the opportunity of talking with ex-Senator Glenister Sheil. Those who did so and discussed the prawn fishing industry might have been very relieved to know that prawn fishing or prawn farming as a commercial venture is being developed in the Pacific area. A very small number of female prawns can be used to produce quite vast numbers of prawns. Those who are addicted to the night of the long prawn, which seems to be a feature of the operation of this Parliament, might be relieved to know that, notwithstanding the very substantial natural supplies of prawns which are available, it does appear that these in the future will be augmented by very substantial numbers of farm prawns.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen the Sydney Morning Herald this morning, but my attention was drawn to the article during Question Time. Honourable senators will be aware that in the past the provision of emergency housing in general has been a matter of State concern and State jurisdiction, although the Commonwealth has been involved in the provision of some assistance in regard to night shelters, and has assisted organisations to provide accommodation for the chronically homeless. That is an important area of Commonwealth activity. The field of emergency housing generally has been largely in the hands of the States and particular responsibilities have been borne by State housing authorities in most parts of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am interested to hear of the figures mentioned in the article. In one sense I hope that they are correct because if it is true that in New South Wales empty government-owned housing is available it should be true, as was indicated by the honourable senator in another reference to what was said in the article, that provision can be made for the emergency accommodation needs of New South Wales citizens. One might ask what that has to do with the Commonwealth Government. It does have something to do with it because, at the last elections, we indicated that we were interested in discussing with the States new policy developments in the field of emergency accommodation for families. Within the last week or two, and in the context of the questions which have arisen about women's refuges, the Prime Minister has written to the State Premiers indicating that the States may expect to hear from me with respect to the Commonwealth's interest in the area of emergency accommodation for families. Therefore, it is a matter of interest to me that there may already be available within the State of New South Wales resources that can be utilised for that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there is a good deal of goodwill in Australia, and indeed in this chamber, towards those Australians who for one reason or another are in need of emergency accommodation. I believe that it is an area in which a co-operative effort between the Commonwealth and the States may succeed in ensuring that the needs of these people are better met in the future than they have been in the past. I say that while acknowledging the premier role which the States have played in this area and without in any way wishing to suggest that the Commonwealth would want to take over the very substantial responsibilities which have been exercised by the States, very often to the considerable satisfaction of their citizens.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will be aware that the Commonwealth has, in recent years, been pursuing the matter of closer economic relations with New Zealand. I think they will be aware that within the last few weeks the Deputy Prime Minister has again visited New Zealand and had talks which, I think, he described as being generally satisfactory over a range of issues of concern to both countries. The honourable senator in his question raised the particular concerns of potato growers who fall within a group which has been concerned about the implications of what is happening. As a result of that concern there has been a series of meetings which have involved representatives of those particular industries, both among themselves and with government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised that a special meeting of the Australian Horticultural Growers Council was held in January last and a working party was formed to analyse the implications. The working party met with officials in March and, following that, the Department of Primary Industry prepared detailed background information papers for the working party. I am advised that the Australian Horticultural Growers Council delegates met with the Minister on 29 April to put their views on closer economic relations. I am further advised that, with the exception of the potato growers of Australia, industry representation on the Council supports freer trade with New Zealand in horticultural products, subject to certain safeguards and conditions. The potato growers of Australia oppose the inclusion of potatoes in the closer economic relationship with New Zealand, on the basis that low priced New Zealand imports would cause serious disruption to the local industry. I think that is in line with the sorts of concerns which have been expressed by the honourable senator this morning.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue of the registration of chiropractors has been running in various States for some time. The question that governments have to consider is where the major benefit to its citizens lies. The word 'chiropractic' covers a whole range of disciplines, some of which require formal training and some of which require much less rigorous training. It is generally felt that, without a registration scheme, some people, believing that they are attending a chiropractor who has training, may in fact be attending a less trained person. That is in no way to offer any comment upon the appropriateness or otherwise of the philosophy or theory upon which such training is based. I believe some States have already gone some way towards registering chiropractors who have adequate amounts of training. I think New South Wales has already taken this step and South Australia has followed. If that means that people will know that a person who is registered has an appropriately approved level of training, it will be of benefit to the citizens of the State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a problem with chiropractic in Australia, as the honourable senator will know. There are two major streams of graduates who come from two major training areas, one being the United States school of training and the other being a school in Australia. They do not seem to get on very well. They do not seem to talk very much to each other. The battle they have been having has tended to make more difficult the kinds of negotiations that would go with registration. The honourable senator will also be aware that this has spilled over into the appropriate support for training schemes for chiropractors. I am not aware whether Mrs Adamson has made representations to my colleague the Minister for Health.</PARA>
<PARA> The question which the honourable senator raised as to whether there should by Commonwealth rebates for chiropractic and, if so, how they should be structured and to whom they should be available is another area entirely. Again, one has to ask about benefits to patients. Such a decision would have to be taken in a general Budget context. The Senate will be aware that only a few years ago the Commonwealth extended its coverage to pick up optometrists. Senator Jessop would have an expert knowledge of that matter. That was a major extension, as it were, of the medical benefit rebate principle. To extend medical benefit rebates to chiropractic would involve another major policy decision and I think that the Government has yet to address itself to that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not recall the nature of the Prime Minister's statements concerning the President of the ACTU on the particular day, but the Prime Minister, in common with the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, is keen to see adopted wage fixing principles which will provide two things: First of all, sufficient wage restraint to keep inflation down and, therefore, to make the purchasing power of real wages stable and to give an opportunity to the people of Australia to enjoy the standard of living we have; and, secondly, avoidance of over-award or hours breaches which will drive up inflation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the question of the cost of living and price fixing, if Senator McIntosh knows history he will know that doctrinaire price control has failed wherever it has been imposed. Where price control has been imposed, it has created corruption, has generally made the maximum price the minimum price and has forced up prices. Senator McIntosh would be aware that, when the Commission determines wages, it takes into account the consumer price index and, therefore, there is a direct relationship between prices and the wages fixed. Overall it is the Government's desire that the people of Australia should increase their capacity to share in higher living standards. By doing that, they must, of course, all take part in a restraint which will keep costs down so that we can continue now to hold the restoration of our trading pattern with other countries which gives us our capacity to expand our social welfare and other facilities.</PARA>

Did members of the Tertiary Education Commission travel to Darwin just prior to the Prime Minister's announcement to make an on-the-spot assessment of a proposed Northern Territory university?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of any travel to Darwin in recent times by private charter or other means by members of the Tertiary Education Commission; nor am I aware, if they did travel to Darwin, for what purpose they did so. I am aware that, during the four years I was Minister for Education, the Tertiary Education Commission took a very keen interest in the development of tertiary education in the Northern Territory both as to the Darwin college and as to the ancillary development in Alice Springs. I am aware that the Tertiary Education Commission had a very real understanding of the difficulties of creating tertiary institutions of very high quality and offering a range of choice in such a huge area with such a sparse population. My recollection is that in that time the Tertiary Education Commission was certainly not contemplating any suggestion that on top of the Darwin college there should be superimposed an additional body, a university. That is my clear recollection. The aim of the Tertiary Education Commission and of the then Minister-me-was to ensure that the college would be so developed that it could provide, both in excellence and in choice, a range of disciplines to meet the demands of the people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the great difficulties with setting up a new institution in areas of sparse population is, first of all, that it may well not attract academic staff of a high calibre and that it may have such a small population that it would have a handful of faculties which would in fact cannibalise the existing institutions and draw away from them. I hesitate to enter into the reasons which might have been in the minds of the Tertiary Education Commission. I am not aware of any recent view of the Commission. I imagine that what the Government has done would be in line with the Commission's view. It is certainly in line with its previous views. Lest that has any inaccuracies, I will seek out the information from the Minister for Education and let the honourable senator know.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to make a personal explanation. On 6 March 1980 the Australian Broadcasting Commission television program Nationwide reported on a number of elections in the State seat of Kimberley in Western Australia. At the time of the Nationwide report I was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. In the course of the report reference was made to one of my brothers, John Chaney, and to the fact that he is my brother. It was suggested that he had taken action during the 1977 election at the Turkey Creek polling station with the intention and effect of depriving Aboriginal voters of their vote. By association with that allegation, reflections were also cast on me as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Subsequent to that report in Nationwide the matter was referred to in Parliament on a number of occasions. On 1 April 1980 it was referred to in the Senate by Senator Walsh. As I indicated to the Senate on 1 April 1980:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From a personal point of view, the reflections on me and on my brother for his part in the 1977 election, reflect the difficulty of being involved at all in this field-</PARA>
<PARA> I referred there to the field of Aboriginal affairs-</PARA>
<PARA>without attracting odium. I regret that the views which were expressed with respect to my brother were expressed in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA>I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to answer them now but maybe I will do so at some more appropriate time later. </PARA>
<PARA>On 16 May 1980 in the Senate Senator Robertson referred to the Kimberley election and stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is understandable that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Chaney) is sensitive about this area. He is sensitive because he is a member of the Liberal Party of Australia and because the Western Australian Liberal Party took the shameful action against the people of the north-west. He is sensitive because his own brother was involved in this matter. I do not like to raise these personal matters but . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Once again, I made no reply at the time but I think honourable senators would know that I would have found that reference objectionable. It is also true that the matter was referred to in the House of Representatives prior to the Nationwide report on 27 February 1980. Mr Dawkins said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the brother of the present Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Chaney) who engaged in a plot to deprive Aborigines in the Kimberley of exercising their right to vote in the State election at that time. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a pity that neither the ABC nor any of those who raised this matter in the Parliament took the trouble to check the public record in this matter. The facts relating to my brother were readily ascertainable in the record of the Court of Disputed Returns. Neither I nor my brother could take action for what was said in this place or in the House of Representatives. My brother did, however, take appropriate action against the Australian Broadcasting Commission and that action has now been settled on the basis that the Commission pay him damages for the defamation. The apology which I now intend to read was read on Nationwide last week and has been published in the Australian and the Age newspapers. The apology reads:</PARA>
<PARA> On the 6th March 1980 Nationwide carried a report from Andrew Olle concerning the recent Western Australian State elections. In particular it dealt with the supply of a 44-gallon drum of port to Aborigines at Turkey Creek in the Kimberley region. </PARA>
<PARA> During that report reference was made to the previous State election in 1977, and to the subsequent decision of a Court of Disputed Returns upsetting the result of the election in the Kimberley electorate. It was suggested that a Liberal Party scrutineer at the Turkey Creek polling station had insisted upon the use of technical provisions of the Electoral Act with the intention, and effect, of depriving Aboriginal voters of their vote. The scrutineer referred to was Mr John Chaney, the brother of Senator Fred Chaney, who was the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs at the time of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Any such suggestion is entirely without foundation. In his decision in the Court of Disputed Returns His Honour Mr Justice Smith, having heard evidence from Mr John Chaney and others present during voting at Turkey Creek in 1977 said that there was no evidence that the actions of (scrutineers) played any significant part' in the informal votes cast. The Court found that there was nothing improper whatsoever in the actions of Mr Chaney who was in fact only at the polling place for about half an hour. During that time only 5 or 6 votes were cast out of a total poll of 69 for the day. Neither at Turkey Creek nor anywhere else did Mr Chaney use or seek to use any technical provisions of the Electoral Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Nationwide unreservedly withdrew any suggestion that Mr Chaney's actions in the 1977 Western Australian State Election were in any way improper and apologises to him for the concern and embarrassment caused to him by its report. </PARA>
<PARA>I too express regret that the fact that he was my brother brought him to public attention. I am pleased that the apology has now been published by the ABC. </PARA>

I think it is to his credit that he did decide to pull out and ultimately, of course, to spill the beans on the rest of the Liberal Party. The fact remains, however, that a plan was devised by the Liberal Party of Western Australia at the highest levels, the clear intention of which was to prevent Aboriginals from exercising their right to vote. Although Senator Chaney's brother can be commended for the fact that, having originally co-operated, he then pulled out and in effect mutinied on the Liberal Party, Senator Chaney and, as far as I know his brother, are both still members of the Liberal Party and cannot entirely shed the responsibility for the actions which that party took on that occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In today's Canberra Times there is an article commenting on the current plight of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, a once great and still good broadcasting service. In the course of that article the author sets out a current program for ABC television as he sees it after the cuts foreshadowed by the Government come into effect. The program reads like this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 6.30 Epilogue (repeat) PGR</PARA>
<PARA> 7.00 Test Pattern</PARA>
<PARA> 8.00 Transylvanian Clog Dancing Competition (B &amp; W) (1934, repeat)</PARA>

<PARA> 6.00: Monkey (cheap Japanese rubbish)</PARA>
<PARA> 7.00: National News (Courtesy of Channels 7, 9 and 10)</PARA>
<PARA>So the program goes on. That would normally be funny. In fact, I suppose it is funny. The Australian Broadcasting Commission has been a great innovative broadcasting organisation and a real alternative to the predominantly commercial media in Australia. Through the arts, through music, through the spoken word, through journalism and through creative film, it has set a pattern for broadcasting and television in Australia. The public affairs programs now succeeding on commercial television had their origins in the pioneering efforts of the ABC. The same can be said about news programs and drama programs. </PARA>
<PARA> That great organisation is now fighting for its life. The Government has so wound down the Australian Broadcasting Commission's activities that it will be very difficult to wind it up again. If the infrastructure of an organisation like the ABC is destroyed or is allowed to become completely outdated or outmoded, it is a very difficult and a very expensive thing to restore it to its proper condition. There have been savage reductions in the amounts which the Australian Broadcasting Commission can spend on programs and there are no other ways in which costs can be reduced. The Australian Broadcasting Commission management has, in a sense, betrayed the creative people who made the reputation of the ABC. The ABC has committed itself, for example, to spend $2m on cricket-$2m which will go to rights to broadcast the cricket through satellites and circuits. That $2m is not, in my view, a necessary item of expenditure. It is a result of ABC management's obsessions with its successes of the past. The obsession to take on the Packer television interests led management and the Commissioners of the ABC to squander $2m on cricket coverage that Packer would have taken with no cost to the public. When stringency was needed, that sort of money should not have been spent on coverage of the cricket. </PARA>
<PARA> This week the Dix inquiry will be reporting to the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) on the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I hope it will give advice on the way in which the Commission has been managed in the past and how it ought to be managed in the future. There is an important reason for seeking an early debate in this Parliament on the recommendations of the Dix Committee. The members of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, headed by Mr Norgard, were hand-picked by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I say that without fear of contradiction. The last Minister responsible for communications, Mr Staley, suggested names of some very distinguished and objectively minded Australians for the positions of commissioners of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. All his recommendations in relation to these people were overruled by the Prime Minister. Instead, we have a Commission now presided over by a man who made his name as the chairman of a pipeline authority-singularly inappropriate experience, one would have thought, for a national broadcasting service appointment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has imposed his standards on the national broadcasting network by the appointments which have been made to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The Commission's management failures are, in a sense, his. The present members of the Commission are so dreary, stale, flat and unprofitable that David Williamson, the great Australian playwright, could not tolerate being on the Commission and, after nine months, resigned. The sins of this dreary management should not, at this point, be visited on the employees of the ABC who have given it its high public standing or on its loyal viewers and listeners. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what the Government has done to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. In five years under the Fraser Government, the allocation to the ABC has gone down by 22 per cent in real terms. That is revealed in the last report to the Parliament by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The ABC has recently been told by the Department of Finance that a further cut of more than 10 per cent in real terms will occur in the next financial year. Since the Fraser Government came to power--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Teague" NAMEID="PJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator Teague</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is speculation.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said that the Australian Broadcasting Commission has been told by the Department of Finance that there will be a further cut in the coming year. The staff numbers of the Australian Broadcasting Commission have been cut by 1,400-20 per cent-in five years of Fraser Government. As a result the ABC spends more money engaging people in contract employment than it would if some sections of the staff were still there. Because of the razor gang's report it has had to reduce staff numbers by another 2 per cent, representing a loss of another 130 jobs. Of course, more jobs will go. The ABC has been told to cover comprehensively the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne in September and the Commonwealth Games, which will require additional people. This will impose additional strains on the resources of the ABC. The Government has told the ABC that it must act as host broadcaster for CHOGM. Added cost in providing editing suites and other expensive facilities for visiting television and radio journalists will result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As well as the razor gang's cuts, there is also to be a 3 per cent cut in non-salary expenditure. This message has been conveyed to the ABC by the Department of Finance. So other departments and statutory authorities can probably anticipate losing 3 per cent of their non-salary expenditure in the August Budget. The Department of Finance has assumed that the ABC should earn about $10m next financial year, the same as this year. That income normally would come from selling publications based on ABC programs. But last year's result was up by about $700,000 because of the sale of the program The Timeless Land. There will be no The Timeless Land this year because there will not be enough money for that sort of program and consequently there will be no increase in the ABC's revenue. Because of the Government's parsimony, the ABC has been carrying over unpaid bills year after year since 1975. This now amounts to $7m. This has been done with the connivance of the Department of Finance in Canberra. The ABC is now carrying debts to the extent of $7m which have accumulated over the last few years. </PARA>

That will not now be possible because the debt obviously will continue to grow. That is a scandal of enormous proportions in relation to a national broadcasting organisation such as the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The fact is that as a result of this process it has been getting further and further into debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One directive from Canberra underlines the Fraser Government's ideology and also its idiocy. The ABC leases premises at 165 William Street, Sydney. That is the head office of the ABC news services amongst other things. The Department of Administrative Services decided recently that that lease should cease. The ABC has been directed to move from those premises. The cost of that move will be $600,000. The ABC is not being provided with $600,000 to make that move. It certainly will not have that sort of money after July of this year if the present proposals are allowed to go ahead. More recently, the extraordinarily incompetent razor gang-the Review of Commonwealth Functions committee-decided that the ABC should rationalise its accommodation. For years now the Australian Broadcasting Commission has been asking the Fraser Government to concentrate its building operations in fewer buildings than the 24 in Sydney alone which it rents, to save some money and increase efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA> In the last report of the Australian Broadcasting Commission attention was again drawn to the desire of the ABC to rationalise its building program. When the razor gang report came down one of its recommendations was that the ABC should rationalise its building program. The ridiculous muddle-headed nature of this recommendation can be seen from the fact that the razor gang was totally ignorant of ABC requests over three years. Unfortunately, as I said earlier, the commissioners of the ABC have been hand picked by the Prime Minister and share, predominantly, the Government's views. Yet even they are now crying out 'this is enough'. I hope they will have the same sort of success as the former chairman of commissioners-I refer to Sir Henry Bland of long memory and short duration in his role-who also had to cry out that the ABC, as he put it in 1976, had been 'cut to the bone'. That is what Sir Henry Bland, the tough bureaucrat, said about the ABC in 1976. In every year since 1976 the ABC budget has been cut further and further. The commissioners have pointed out continually in their reports that the ABC is losing its capacity to compete with the commercial networks. The ABC, in its last annual report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The ABC is now in a relatively worse financial position than it was five years ago, while the commercial broadcasting organisations are considerably stronger than they were and are looking forward to significant further expansion. </PARA>
<PARA>The report went on to state that that expansion was arising from increased advertising revenue. Yet in this Parliament on this date in June 1981 when these cuts are foreshadowed for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, a national broadcasting service which is respected by 80 per cent of the population for the integrity of its news bulletins, when its plight even in the mealy mouthed words of its Chairman is desperate and when it will have to cut programs to the ridiculous situation described in the extract from the Canberra Times this morning, legislation is being debated which will increase concentration of commercial ownership, which will increase the power of the major commercial proprietors in the capital cities and which will increase domination of commercial radio and television by foreign companies. All these things are happening in the one Parliament at the same time. It is an indictment of the total lack of broadcasting policy of this Government. It is an indictment of the disrespect which it has for great institutions such as the ABC and its many viewers and it is a total abdication of the so-called philosophy of the Liberal Party both in terms of the Liberal Party platform and that turgid speech made in Adelaide on 5 December last year when the Prime Minister talked at such great length about the Liberal Party's commitment to diversifying power from various sources. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the ABC is one of our great institutions and it should not be allowed to decline further. That comment is qualified by noting the poor decision making of the commissioners and some members of management. Those defects of the Commission, of senior management and, more particularly, of Government policy should not be allowed to destroy the integrity, the hard work and the talent of many broadcasters, producers, and production staff and so on of the ABC who remain with it in spite of a great drift away from it in recent years in search of better salaries and conditions. The quality of management in the ABC-one would hope the quality of the Commission itself-will be a subject of comment and discussion no doubt in the report of the Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, commonly known as the Dix Committee. What the Government does with the Dix report will of course be an interesting subject, and I hope the subject of considerable debate in this chamber. That report should be debated in this Parliament as soon as possible because the situation in the ABC has now reached such a parlous state that something has to be done in quite a dramatic way to restore the integrity and fortunes of the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know what it is about the philosophy of this Government which is so distinct from the philosophies of all the successful democracies of western Europe and Great Britain, but somehow in this country we cannot even have pride and concern for the preservation and enrichment of a great national broadcasting service such as the ABC. It is part of the sordid, narrow-minded commercial priorities of this Government that it has no sensitivity or concern for those sorts of issues. It is about time it showed such concern because there are many thousands upon thousands of Australians who still regard the ABC as a great institution because of the vast range of services which it is still capable of providing on the sort of shoestring budget that it is given by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Funding for the ABC has to be maintained at its 1979-80 level as promised by this Government, that is, with adjustments for increased costs and consideration of extra expenditure on their merits. It is about time that this Government did something about honouring the promise which was made nearly three years ago to provide triennial funding for the ABC. That is yet another promise of the Fraser Government which has been totally ignored and dishonoured and which the Chairman of the ABC felt it important to draw attention to on Tuesday of this week. All of those matters require attention from a complacent, cynical and indifferent Minister. They are matters which I hope the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume), who purports to represent the Minister for Communications in this place with the strange answers to questions he gets from the other side, will be able to convey to the Minister for Communications and, indeed, to the Prime Minister, because they are now becoming matters of national concern. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance before the Senate today concerns itself with two alleged matters. The first alleges excessively new stringent financial restrictions on the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the second is the assertion by the Labor Opposition that there is a threat to the Commission's future ability to comply with its charter. I listened carefully to what Senator Button had to say in order to learn the extent to which he addressed the two matters which made up the content of the letter he put to the President to bring on this matter of public importance. I found too little material to justify the claims. I was dissatisfied and disappointed with what he presented to us. He put out his socialist paradigm. He was talking down the ABC and its present performance. He completely failed to identify the important place which the ABC plays, can play and is playing in Australian life today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting at this time of year to identify that we are in the run up to the Budget. This is the time of year when all the vested interests-the people who wish to press legitimately for their own Budget allocations-come out of the woodwork and come to Canberra from all areas. The ABC of course is one of the organisations which is fighting for its Budget allocation. However, after listening to some of the honourable senators opposite over a series of weeks, I find that what has emerged is a fairly constant litany that the Opposition will agree with any group of any kind seeking support for anything because, of course, not being in government, the Opposition is not answerable for what it says. Secondly, it constantly recommends increased expenditure and of course will oppose any measures to impose taxation. That is the classic kind of formula-lower taxes and higher expenditure in all areas. A nation simply cannot run that way. </PARA>
<PARA> In building a Budget a government must work out the resources that are available to it and how they should be shared, what the revenue flow from taxation is to be, what is to be the mix of expenditure and how is that to be apportioned between different areas of government activity. Anyone who is involved in government must be able to address these questions with honesty and directness. Sometimes that means saying to one group or another that it too must play its part in any restriction of overall expenditure or can share in any increased expenditure that is available. </PARA>
<PARA> The current situation concerning the ABC is that the Government has made certain general decisions following the Review of Commonwealth Functions on the need to exercise restraint on overall expenditure in respect of all departments and functions. I believe that defence alone has been excluded. These decisions have application to all government departments and statutory authorities. The ABC is part of that structure-part of that decision-but is in no way being singled out for attack. It is strange for an Opposition to call for greater tax cuts at various times, to give the Government lectures about tax indexation and taxation generally, and then to oppose any effort to restrain Commonwealth expenditure. The ABC is not being singled out. It is part of the exercise of general restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> Budget desisions for 1981-82 in relation to the ABC have not yet been taken. Senator Button puts us at a disadvantage because he argues from figures which are not available to me. I am sure that they are not available to my colleague, Senator Teague, who will speak later. We cannot determine the validity of the figures that the honourable senator has put before the Senate. One can only really argue as to whether the ABC has been properly treated when one sees what its Budget allocation turns out to be in the end. The facts on the table then give us a basis for argument and debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Teague asked a significant question by way of interjection a short time ago: 'What is the evidence for the figures that you are putting out; where do they come from?' If we had such evidence we could discuss them, but in the end it would be the Budget statement, to be brought down in August, that would tell us what will be available to the ABC, to any department of State or to any statutory authority. We are dealing now with speculation based upon statements made by persons with a proper vested interest in looking after their own organisation and activities, but a vested interest nevertheless. Such submissions can have no reality in the run-up to the Budget presentation-until there has been a Budget Cabinet and Budget allocations have been determined and presented in public. Prior to that stage, it is a matter of speculation and nothing more. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat, Budget decisions in relation to the Australian Broadcasting Commission have not been taken. In fact, estimates discussions on ABC funding for the coming financial year continue. Recently the Government asked the Commission to justify its claims in respect of areas for which it has sought additional funding. I put it to honourable senators that the Government, by seeking justification for the extra funding sought, has left the door open for negotiation with the ABC on a number of areas. It is not possible for any honourable senator to say with certainty what the allocation to the ABC will be. Therefore, it is not possible for people to draw conclusions as to what consequences will flow from ABC funding for 1981-82. People simply do not know what the level of funding will be, and because they do not, they cannot know what its effects will be. It is not the practice of the Government, nor has it ever been, to outline specific Budget provisions prior to the presentation of the Treasurer's Budget statement of August and I do not expect that the provision to be made for the ABC will be announced in advance this year either. </PARA>
<PARA> The position of the ABC is no different from that of any other statutory body or department concerning decisions taken following the recent Review of Commonwealth Functions. That review was a genuine effort by the Government to examine its own operation in an effort to rationalise it, to cut out fat and to eliminate unnecessary functions. I have a great admiration for the Australian Broadcasting Commission but I have observed that usually when outside broadcasts or interviews are conducted and teams are present from both the ABC and commercial television stations, the ABC has more people to do the job than do its commercial counterparts. That merely leads one to wonder whether the Australian Broadcasting Commission operation runs as leanly as it might. </PARA>
<PARA> The Review of Commonwealth Functions was designed to contain the size of the public sector and the reasoning behind that is well known to most Australians. The Government is determined to keep the growth of the public sector within what seems to be appropriate limits. Australian Broadcasting Commission expenditures are considerable. It is interesting to note that Senator Button did not bring them out during his contribution to the debate. In 1975-76, the ABC received a little more than $137m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ryan interjects 'peanuts'. It will be interesting to see how the honourable senator responds in regard to every other request. She wants big government, high expenditure and therefore, by inference, wants higher taxation of the Australian public. There is no other way in which her kind of progamming could be accommodated. In fact, if she is a high expenditure senator she is a high tax senator. The budgetary provision for the ABC has risen progressively from $137m in 1975-76 to more than $183m in 1980-81. The Opposition asserts that that is excessively stringent. Perhaps Senator Ryan, who is to follow me in this debate, will indicate the amounts that she thinks should have been provided and how high they should have been. As I have mentioned, the allocations have risen from $137m to $183m over the term of office of the Fraser Government. If those increases are not what the ABC wants, let me add that the increases that are given to any department probably are not what that department wants. Most departments and statutory authorities can spend more money than they are given and have plans for expansion and extra programs which they could put in place if funding were available, but the job of government is to divide the cake in what seems to be the most appropriate and equitable manner. No one can say that, given that increase from $137m to $183m, the charge that this is an excessively stringent government allocation can be sustained in any way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I recall that the first political letter I ever wrote as a teenager was to my local member concerning the independence of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I asserted at that stage, as I still do, that the ABC should be able to carry out its functions and public duty free of political interference. I received a response from a former very distinguished member of this Parliament, Mr Harry Turner, who was my local member for many years. In taking up my point about the ABC, he presented to me the first reasoned understanding that I had had of the complexities which faced the ABC as a government instrumentality and of the interdependent relationships and responsibilities between it and the rest of the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in that kind of context that I am interested to see that decisions relating to the ABC will be made not in some kind of isolation, not apart from other decisions affecting government functions, not apart from considerations affecting other statutory authorities, not apart from considerations of how welfare will be helped or how taxation policy will be formed but against the background of consideration of all these matters as an integrated whole and as part of Government Budget strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as that, the Australian Broadcasting Commission is under examination at the moment. Honourable senators will be aware that the Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the Dix Committee, has been established. It will report shortly on the services policy and the performance of the Commission. It is an evaluation exercise, if one likes. It is proper that any government instrumentality, department or function should be placed under review. The Review of Commowealth Functions was one such review from which a number of decisions flowed. The Dix Committee inquiry is another review. That review will examine the funding arrangements of the ABC including forward planning, budgeting and the revenue question. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will consider the financial position of the ABC not only in the Budget context, which I have outlined, but also in the context of the Dix Committee inquiry and in the light of the recommendations which it makes. The Committee of Review is in existence. I believe its report is ready. I know from questions asked this week that honourable senators assert that it is in the hands of the Government, and it may well be, but no Budget decision on the ABC have yet been made relating to 1981-82. There is a need for the ABC to be seen to be functioning with other departments and with other authorities in line with the decisions of the Review of Commonwealth Functions. Of course, a need exists for the Government now to consider the results of the inquiry which it commissioned before it makes any major changes to funding or to policy with relation to what has been properly called by Senator Button a valuable national asset. </PARA>
<PARA> I have seen details of Mr Norgard's statement of 2 June. I do not intend to comment on his particular propositions. Let us not forget that Mr Norgard's function is to act not as a dispassionate observer-I have no doubt he could do that with a different brief and under different circum- stances-and not as a disinterested public official. His function is to be there as an advocate of his authority. I read his statement when he is wearing the hat of Chairman of the ABC as that of an advocate who is putting a case for his authority and who is presenting the matter in a way designed to be most likely to bring about the kind of result he wants. The kind of result he wants, of course-again, it is a proper result for an advocate-is the most favoured funding, the most favoured treatment and the best result for his own particular organisation. Of course, I read the kind of consequences which he proposes. I wonder whether they were not made, as it were, to create a pressure point upon those who have to make decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button referred in the letter which he read, but not in his speech, to the charter of the ABC-a charter which requires the Commission to provide adequate and comprehensive programming. I join with honourable senators in hoping, requiring and expecting that the ABC will in fact meet and satisfy that charter. The issue which has been raised by the Opposition has to be examined in the light of Australia's cirumstances. It is not an open cheque policy which can be applied to the ABC any more than it is a blank cheque policy that can be applied to any department of State. What is ahead of us is the question of how we balance the use of available resources to maximise equity between functions and how we do it to maximise efficiency within any particular function. That is the issue facing every organisation. It is an issue facing the ABC no less or no more than any other organisation. The goal which any government must seek to satisfy is to provide or to make possible the provision of first class programming with variety, standard setting and access to the national network. The ABC is our flag bearer in many of these functions but it must operate in terms of its funding and resource base as part of a co-ordinated plan by government. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of equity between sectors is one which cannot be ignored. Certainly in the debate to this stage there has been no demonstration of excessive stringency. There has been no demonstration that stringency has been of a degree which would threaten the Commission's future ability to comply with its charter. As I have said during this debate the negotiations on the Budget are continuing. It is not possible for any Opposition senator to assert that he knows what the Budget outcome will be because to do so would be patently ridiculous. I emphasise once again what I said earlier. The ABC is being examined by the Dix Committee which will assist government and, no doubt, will determine new long term policies and directions which this great national body might wish to follow. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the matter of public importance introduced into the Senate today by my colleague, Senator Button, in these terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's excessively stringent financial restrictions on the Australian Broadcasting Commission which threatens the Commission's future ability to comply with its charter. </PARA>
<PARA>I must express my disappointment with the statements made by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) who represents in this place the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair). Instead of addressing himself to the very serious and very concerned criticisms and issues raised by Senator Button on this subject, which is of concern to all Australians, the Minister instead has delivered himself of a rather pedestrian homily about the difficulties of public expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> Insofar as his remarks had any theme or consistency at all it was that public sector expenditure must be cut across the board. The Minister's theme was that if the Government is going to cut expenditure for one sector it has to be cut for all and it is not proper to distinguish between the functions of the various public departments and statutory bodies which are being dealt with. I suppose that really does demonstrate just what the Fraser Government thinks of the ABC. The Fraser Government accords no special position to our national broadcasting service. The Fraser Government is not prepared to give recognition to the historical achievements of that national broadcasting service in education, culture, bringing services to remote areas, technological innovation and so forth. So far as the Fraser Government is concerned, the ABC is just like the Department of Supply-an area of public expense. Therefore in itself it is repugnant to this excessively capitalistic, ideological government. It is an area of public expense which deserves no special consideration for the role it plays in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> The point of view of the Australian Labor Party is quite different from that. It is quite contrary to that in fact. So far as the ALP is concerned, public expenditure ought to be so tailored as to meet the needs of the functions on which the money is being spent. We do not see the ABC simply as another tedious area of public expenditure. We acknowledge that, in our democratic society, an objective, independent national broadcasting service is integral to the proper functioning of that democratic society. In the particular circumstances which apply in Australia where we have a very decentralised population, a far flung population and large areas where people live in remote and isolated places, the unifying effect of a national broadcasting service cannot be over-emphasised. If it were not for the ABC, I would say that national life in Australia would be far more fragmented, far more disunified and far less coherent than it is. It has been the historical role of the ABC to inform citizens in virtually any part of Australia about current affairs, the actions of governments, and to bring to them Australian culture, news and culture from overseas and to raise the educational standards of the Australian population. It is that national role, that unifying, informing and developmental role, that we believe gives the ABC the entitlement to be treated a little differently from, say, the Department of Transport. It is that role which the Fraser Government rejects, has no time for and, indeed I would say, in a rather sinister political way actually wishes to downgrade. It is clearly not in the interests of the present Government so intent on perverting public debate, on concealing the realities of our economy from the community and on making the way easy for its own friends and supporters to gain control of all business and communications in this country, to have an independent and objective source of information and comment for the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister also said that it was improper or irrelevant to raise the question of the future budget of the ABC because we do not know the details that the 1981 Budget will contain. Of course we do not. But it is our job, as a responsible Opposition, to look at the record of the Fraser Government with regard to funding the ABC and to make very informed speculation about what is in store for the ABC. With new cuts being announced prior to the Budget and prior to the report of the Dix committee-most untimely-we can only properly speculate that the ABC will continue to be singled out for especially harsh treatment, as it has been so singled out for the last 5 1/2 years of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister complained that there was insufficient evidence of that particularly harsh treatment of the ABC. Let me give him some of that evidence. During its period in office the Fraser Government has forced a cut in the ABC staff of 1,150; that is, 7,350 jobs have been cut to 6,200. It has now ordered a reduction in salary expenditure by a further 2 per cent-the wonderful across-the-board technique which Senator Baume is so happy to defend. That will bring the total cut to 1,400 positions or just under 20 per cent of the ABC's staff in five years. Nowhere during the period of those cuts have we seen a proper justification of them. I stress that the Labor Party is not interested in bureaucracy for bureaucracy's sake or in public sector jobs for the sake of public sector jobs. We are interested in efficiency and performance. In terms of those two criteria we have never had from any of the Ministers responsible or from the Fraser Government a justification for cutting the staff of the ABC by 20 per cent in five years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said that there had been no particularly harsh treatment of the ABC compared with the rest of the public sector. That is simply not true. By comparison the overall Commonwealth Government work force between 1975 and 1980 was cut by less than one-half of one per cent but by 20 per cent for the ABC. Yet the Minister has the effrontery to say that there has been no especially harsh treatment of the ABC. In terms of funding also the ABC has been singled out for discriminatory treatment by the Government. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table of figures which illustrates the funding of the ABC since 1974-75. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those figures show that since 1974-75 the ABC has sustained a funding cut in real terms of 22 per cent. Its budget, as a proportion of total government outlays, has declined from 0.83 per cent in 1974-75 to 0.6 per cent in 1980-81. There again we have a real and large cut which is out of all proportion to cuts which other government authorities have sustained. In 1979, when Tony Staley was Minister for Post and Telecommunications, he indicated that cuts in the ABC were to end. I think many of us will remember the fanfare and triumph with which that progressive matter was announced. There was to be triennial funding tied to an agreed base figure and indexed for inflation. We were told that the ABC now had a stable base for forward planning. That promise was confirmed in the 1980 Budget Speech, which said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the period 1981-82, subject to review as necessary, the annual provision to be made for the ABC should not be less than the initial appropriation for 1979-80 after due allowance has been made for cost increases. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition, the ABC and the general public welcomed that announcement and that commitment. We welcomed the Government's promise that there would be a stable base for funding for the ABC. What do we now discover? As in so many areas of public promises made by the Fraser Government, that promise has been abandoned. We now find that the Government has perpetrated another massive deceit on the Australian public; that, despite Government assurances, the ABC's 1981-82 budget will not be indexed to inflation. On top of that the ABC will be subjected to a further 3 per cent cut in non-salary expenditure. The triennial funding announced by Mr Staley and confirmed in the last Budget, like so many other of the Fraser Government's promises, has been abandoned. Cuts to the ABC are more visible than cuts in other areas of Commonwealth departments and authorities. For five years we have been watching deteriorations in ABC programs, the downgrading of radio and television current affairs and the replacement of Australian drama with cheap British imports. I do not believe there is a senator in this place who cannot confirm what I have said. Although for a period I was responsible for this portfolio and, therefore, attracted a lot more correspondence on the topic than I do in my normal duties as a senator, I have been inundated with complaints from the general public about those deteriorations I have just enumerated-the lack of Australian content, the downgrading of news and current affairs and the downgrading of sport. All of us have received constant complaints from the general public about the inability of the ABC to perform the functions that the general public wants it to perform and is prepared to pay for it to perform. I would like to quote from a short article which appeared in the National Times of 24 May 1981. It is typical of recent reports about the ABC. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Funds are apparently so tight in the ABC that it can no longer afford to send its Australian-based correspondents on overseas trips-not even with the Prime Minister . . . In another puzzling decision, the ABC hierarchy have decided against appointing a national political correspondent at least in the short term. The post has now been vacant for about four months. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are the sorts of things that we have serious complaint about. How can the ABC bring to the people of Australia proper, up to date and informed news and comment when it no longer has a correspondent in Canberra and when it can no longer send a correspondent to accompany the Prime Minister, even when he makes overseas visits? That is the manner in which the Fraser Government is destroying what was once a strong and independent national broadcasting organisation. Another area which has suffered greatly is television drama. In 1974-75 the ABC produced 156 hours of television drama. This year it will produce about 70 hours of television drama, about 45 per cent of the 1974-75 output. </PARA>

That is what the Australian Labor Party is really concerned about. What sorts of services is the Australian public getting from the ABC? That is the first question to be asked. The other questions which Senator Baume raised about across the board cuts for public expenditure and so on, of course, have their place. But the national broadcasting service is there to provide, as contained in its charter, adequate and comprehensive broadcasting of the highest standards to all Australians. That is not being done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to Australian drama, I have a copy of a telegram sent to Mr Sinclair from the following organisations: Actors and Announcers Equity Association of Australia; Australian Society of Authors; Australian Writers Guild; Producers and Directors Guild of Australia; and Film and Television Production Association of Australia. I do not have time to read that telegram but it points out the dreadful effects of the cuts in television drama production and the effect that this has had on the whole of the creative work force working in those areas in Australia. The further cuts that have already been announced will leave the ABC with very few options for coping with such cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the matters that has been of great concern to the general public and the Federal Opposition is that some of the most talented and experienced journalists, directors, producers and so on are being drained away from the ABC. I point out to a government which is so concerned with restraining the public purse and avoiding wastage of public money that every time one of those talented, experienced journalists, producers or technicians leaves the ABC and goes to the commercial sector there is a waste of the public investment in that person. Those people have been trained at public expense by the ABC. They have gained their experience by working in the public sector in broadcasting and they are being forced out through inefficiencies in administration and inappropriate structures of the ABC but mainly through Budget cuts administered in such an irrational and chaotic way that they are unable to do the work for which they are trained. They are a great loss to the Australian public generally in that their services are no longer available nationally, but to the specific organisations they go to, and also because they have been trained and gained their experience at public expense. I wish that the Government would think a little bit more carefully about its fanatical concern about public expenditure when it makes these decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the fact that the new cuts have been announced when we are waiting for the first massive investigation into the role and structure of the ABC is a very bad omen. These cuts are most untimely. They suggest that the Government will not be responding positively to the Dix Committee's report and will not be taking the opportunity, which I hope and expect that the report will present, to allow the ABC to be again what it has been historically-a great national broadcasting institution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The Senate is debating the allegations raised by the Opposition in this so-called matter of public importance of excessively stringent financial restrictions placed by the Government on the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I reject that. I believe that this is a premature debate because it relates to the Budget. The Budget will come down in mid-August. It is then appropriate for the Senate to discuss the Government's provision for the Australian Broadcasting Commission as well as the Government's provision for every other area of government spending. It is also premature because only this week, I understand, the Dix Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission has brought its substantial report with recommendations to the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair). The report has not been tabled in the Parliament. There has been some speculation in the Press as to the contents of the Dix Committee's findings. When that report is before the Parliament then it will be appropriate to talk about the very weighty matters of restructuring the Australian Broadcasting Commission. It is entirely premature for the Opposition to allege a matter of public importance before the Budget is made clear and before the findings of the Dix report are made clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Ryan, in her concluding statements, talked about an omen of cuts. She alleged that this omen is disconcerting as the Dix report is about to be brought down. These cuts and this omen are entirely speculation and rumour that have been put forward in the Senate, not on the basis of any government decisions and any clear announcement by the Minister, but rather on the basis of rumouring. These rumours have been exacerbated by the series of telegrams to which Senator Ryan referred from the Actors and Announcers Equity Association of Australia, the Australian Writers Guild, the Producers and Directors Guild of Australia and the Film and Television Production Association. </PARA>
<PARA> Those bodies, of course, have an interest in the discussions currently taking place in the run-in to the Budget. They are important vested interests. Of course, they will be doing all that they can to call for public discussion and to try to gain some public pressuring of the discussion that is leading to the Budget decisions. If the Opposition uses those rumours and allegations to try to put forward this so-called omen or this picture of the Government's cutting back of the ABC funds, they are alarmist and entirely premature. In the current year there has been a 15.6 per cent increase in government funding provided to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. That is $183m compared with $158m last year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That more than accounts for inflation. There is a real increase in funding provided to the Australian Broadcasting Commission this year. Is that stringently excessive financial restriction? I ask the Senate and the Australian public whether they can see a real increase in this year's funding provided to the Australian Broadcasting Commission as being a restriction. There is increased expenditure. Why then has the Opposition raised this matter? As all honourable senators know there is provision in our Standing Orders for matters of public importance to be raised. If a matter is really urgently important and needs to be brought before the Senate an honourable senator, accompanied by some others standing in their places, can raise the matter and so have a matter of urgency added as a special item to the Senate's agenda for discussion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The running of this procedure is left mostly to the Opposition and rightly so because that is the Opposition's role in the Senate. It so happens that we are coming towards the end of the session and Senator Button, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, has not had his turn. A matter has come up that is in his area of interest as shadow spokesman on communications. He is told: 'John Button, it's your turn. What can you drum up as a matter of public importance to raise in the Senate this week?' So it has come about that the Opposition has tried, as valiantly as it can to make some attempt-a hopeless attempt-to raise allegations and rumours about the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Members of the Opposition conveniently forget the marked increase in government commitment this year to the ABC. They conveniently forget that the discussion is premature and that the Budget discussions are only at the negotiating stage and still proceeding. They conveniently forget that the appropriate time for a full-bodied debate on the ABC is when the Dix report is tabled. </PARA>
<PARA> How is it that vested interests can gain the attention of the Opposition in this way? I will say how I believe this has arisen. I believe that when the ABC commissioners met in Sydney on Tuesday of this week they were nervous-anticipating the Dix Committee's report-about the whole structure of the ABC. They were nervous not only about their future as commissioners and the future priorities of programs within the Australian Broadcasting Commission but also that every area of the Australian Broadcasting Commission would be reported upon and reviewed by the Dix Committee. This week the report was pending and they thought it would be in the Government's hand. When the ABC commissioners met they put forward certain statements of a general kind about the dialogue currently being engaged in between them and the Government with the Budget in prospect. </PARA>
<PARA> Immediately, the secretary of the ABC Staff Association takes up one or two of the lines put out on Tuesday by the commissioners and starts a rumour that severe cuts are pending for the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Of course the Press is interested and it interviews Mr Collis-George about this. He says: 'I have been to see the Chairman of the Commissioners, Mr Norgard, and I have put to him these fears that we and the Staff Association of the ABC rightly feel'. Mr Norgard does not fully assure him that his fears are groundless, but he listens to him. So Mr Collis-George is able to say to the Press: 'I have put these views to the Chairman of the Commissioners'. Then the Press, quite rightly, as is its investigative role, rings various interested bodies. It speaks to Mr Williamson, the President of the Australian Writers Guild, and to Mr Windt, the assistant general secretary of Actors Equity. </PARA>

Of course, these vested interests-they are correct vested interests-will get on the bandwagon and start to exaggerate the position, saying that has begun. So the allegation runs that there may be restraints on expenditure in the ABC in the coming Budget. The Press reports of what the spokesmen for the writers and actors said gain not only this fear but also some red hot political statements. That always makes for good controversy; so it gets into the newspapers too. Mr Williamson said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The obvious answer is that the Country Party feels the employees of the ABC are not the right political shade. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Windt says:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fraser's political vindictiveness and single-minded determination to rub out the ABC is something to behold. </PARA>
<PARA>What ridiculous statements! What bias! What unfounded allegations against the Government parties and against the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)! But it is good controversial stuff and the media picks it up. Already in the last few days there has been a snowballing effect that there is something running in the ABC. I put it to the Senate that this is a series of allegations and a series of rumours which are in the nature of discussion in any run up to a Budget. Could we have had a matter of public importance, if it had been some other shadow Minister's turn today, about one or other area of public discussion on what the Budget may contain? We would have had the same sort of debate and it would have all been groundless because there is no firm Government decision. The only firm ground on which we can talk is on this year's Budget. In this year's Budget there is a 15.6 per cent increase in the Government commitment to the ABC. Even on the figures that Senator Ryan incorporated in Hansard, there is an increase on last year's Government commitment to the ABC of $187.8m, compared with this year and the greatly increased amount of $215.6m. They are the only facts--</PARA>

According to Senator Ryan and the Opposition, in real dollar terms the increase is from $111m to $116m in 1974-75 prices. So the table that Senator Ryan puts down shows that there is a real increase this year in the Government's commitment to the ABC. I believe that the matter of public importance alleged by the Opposition is entirely unfounded. It cannot claim that there have been excessive, stringent cuts. I find it ironic that the Opposition claims that the Commission's futureability to comply with its charter is being somehow jeopardised by the Government. That is the very question that is at the heart of the Dix Committee of inquiry. The whole ABC charter is to be reported upon by the Dix inquiry. How ironic it is that the Opposition seems to protest that that may be happening. This is not a matter of public importance; it is a matter of proper vested interests speculating and trying to lobby even the Opposition to raise some public attention in the hope that it may gain a little more in the Budget.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Normally when reports of the Joint Statutory Committee on Public Works are tabled, they are tabled without any additional comment. But I believe this report raises some matters that ought to be brought more directly to the attention of the Senate. The reference was to housing to be provided for the Army in Townsville. The members of the Committee held long hearings into the problem. One problem that arises out of it and that I think deserves more attention is this question of scales and standards for Army housing. We found a great shortage of housing for Army personnel who had to move to Townsville. The whole purpose is to provide them with housing which, as the Army says, must meet scales and standards. One of the problems we found was that in many instances where good houses could be bought on the market, they were rejected by the Department of Administrative Services because they were above the Army's scales and standards. In some instances they were above the scales and standards because they had one extra toilet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The thing that concerned us was that whilst good houses could not be bought on the market and people were left in substandard houses or were not able to take their families to Townsville, we found that 1,142 of the houses in which Army personnel presently have to live in Townsville are below the scales and standards. When we say that they are below the Army's scales and standards, we mean that some of those houses had to be seen to be believed, especially when one takes into account the rent that one has to pay. But we are most emphatic on the point that this hiding behind firm scales and standards is not a sufficient excuse for the Government not to make the Department of Administrative Services buy houses on the market so that people who have to be stationed in Townsville can live in a decent fashion. But the matter went even further than the Department not buying houses because of the scales and standards. When people move into houses in Townsville they find that the houses do not provide a great many of the amenities that might make life more pleasant in that sort of area. They do not even have the sorts of amenities that people take for granted these days-amenities such as a barbecue. Honourable senators would have to admit that due to the climate in Townsville a barbecue may be a very pleasant way of entertaining or for the family to relax. To our astonishment we found that if a soldier moves into a house in Townsville, builds a barbecue in the back yard and then, as Army procedure seems to lay down, he must be moved on within two years, that barbecue is knocked over by the Army. It is entirely removed. It is not offered to the person next door or to the person moving into the house; it is entirely removed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. It is indeed a scorched earth policy. That barbecue has to be removed. Nobody is consulted; nobody is paid: It is removed. It seems to us to be absolutely absurd. To use such excuses as scales and standards is not really tenable. The Committee has discovered in inquiries that similar things are done in other areas of the defence forces. I found for instance that in the Air Force area in Laverton in Victoria things had to be returned to the state they were in when the tenant took occupancy. One tenant had gone into a house and set up a beautiful flower garden and a lovely vegetable garden. When that tenant moved out, Defence put in a rotary hoe and hoed up the entire garden, leaving it in that state for the next tenant. I think that this is like Gilbert and Sullivan. I think it is time that the defence forces caught up with reality or that some logic was applied to the situation, especially as Defence Force personnel are moved around Australia every two years with no thought given to the schooling of their children or to any career that their wives might have.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Iolanthe. Other matters came up that I think should be drawn to the attention of the Senate. In talking about the sort of house that should be built in Townsville, we were told that the Defence Department tended to try to build houses that fitted in with community standards. That is all very well but, if the community standard has been forced down because of economic conditions, because of the lack of work in the area and because people literally cannot afford to build to a higher standard, it does not seem to us to be logical that the Army personnel who are forced to go there should have to take the lowest common denominator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In talking about the sorts of houses that should be built in a tropical area, we found that there was an extraordinary lack of imagination and a lack of willingness to look at a problem from a new point of view in the Department of Defence, the Department of Administrative Services and the Department of Housing and Construction. For instance, in our duties as senators we had discovered that in other places in Australia people had looked at such problems as housing in tropical areas and tried to introduce new ideas. We discovered that, in the Kakadu National Park, the National Parks and Wildlife Service had built for its rangers houses that provided comfortable living without power-supplied means of comfort such as air conditioners. The houses had been built to use the maximum of natural cooling devices to give people a pleasant life. That seemed to us to be an excellent idea. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting when we asked officers of the Department to comment that their first comment was that such houses were in excess of current Defence married quarters standards in that they had an additional water closet. It took them some time to get to the point that these houses also have natural ventilation, with a living area in a natural breezeway so that people could live in some comfort. They went on to point out that in their opinion these houses would have to be built on three conventional blocks. I question what sort of tape measure they took up with them. I have been in those houses and I swear that they do not provide any more accommodation than does an ordinary suburban house, but, very sensibly, the cooking and bathing facilities are located in one block and the bedrooms-very ordinary sized bedrooms-are located in another block with this breezeway in between in which people can live and be comfortable. It is interesting that even the Department had to admit that the average cost of these dwellings is approximately $85,000, including a 40 per cent loading over and above Darwin costs. We all know that Darwin costs are over and above other costs in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be nice to think that the Department, after having had this situation drawn to its attention, would take a more imaginative and realistic look at problems of housing in various areas of Australia and get off its tail and go out and look for them. If a Senate committee can find them, one would think that a department could apply itself to finding other answers to the problems of housing in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of costs was one that intrigued us. As I have said, the overwhelming number of houses in which Army personnel have to live in Queensland are leased by the Commonwealth Government from the Queensland Housing Commission. The overwhelming majority of complaints by tenants in those houses leased by the Army is that no repairs, renovations or maintenance are done on the houses. When we asked the Army why that was so, it said that under the agreement it was unable to do any of that work on houses that it leased from the Queensland Housing Commission. Yet the tenants, the Army personnel, leaving those houses, have to pay for any wear and tear on the houses. If the walls are badly marked, if the floors are badly scratched, if the flywire has to be replaced in the screen doors, they have to pay the Army for repairs and renovations. Yet that money is not applied to putting the houses into some sort of decent order before new tenants come in. Departmental officers take a note of any damage, they tell us. They write in a book that there is a scratch on the floor or a hole in the wall, so that if when a tenant leaves there is a bigger hole he will be charged only for the extra size of the hole, and if there is another mark on the wall he will not be charged for the original marks but only for the new marks. But nobody fixes up the marks, the holes or the scratches. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate will note in the report that the Department has put down a figure of $1.8m for renovations. One might be tempted to think that that money is to be used to put these houses at least back into the condition they were in before the Army moved in. But, no, that money is not to be used for that purpose. It is to be used for such things as venetian blinds, concrete under the ground and a lock-up shed if it is needed, but not to do maintenance. So we have houses in which water comes in, where the floor has fallen so that an almighty draught blows through and insects can get in. We have houses in which the stairs lean so that people are afraid of using them. We have all those problems, yet none of the Commonwealth departments can touch them. None of the money that is taken from the tenants to repair and renovate these houses is used for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another interesting point in relation to the Commonwealth's association with the Queensland Government. The Commonwealth agrees that these houses will be rented by it for use by Army personnel. In our report we state:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . under the existing Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement funds were provided by the Commonwealth to build these houses which are now rented back to the Commonwealth by the States at rentals ranging from $72 to $104 per fortnight. Of this amount, an average of $64 . . . per fortnight is collected by the Department of Defence as the Service tenants' rental contribution. </PARA>
<PARA>So there is a shortfall between the amount that we collect from the tenants and the amount that we pay Queensland. The story gets better. A telex that was sent to the secretary to our Committee reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The average rental paid (six houses) to the Queensland Housing Commission for married quarters occupied by Army personnel Captain or Warrant Officer rank in Townsville is $227 per fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that these officers are charged $75 per fortnight by the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA>I warrant that that $75 a fortnight is more than sufficient for some of the houses that those people have to live in; yet we are being charged by Queensland an average of $227 a fortnight. So we have an agreement to provide funds to build these houses, the Queensland Government pays interest on those funds and we subsidise it. We are in fact paying the interest on the funds that we are lending to the Queensland Government. Given the sorts of houses that we are getting for that price, I think that this is scandalous. I hope that the Government will take close note of what is going on in this area. We were led to understand that the same sort of agreement exists with every other State of the Commonwealth when it comes to defence housing. The States are using defence housing to milk the Commonwealth of funds. I do not think that this is good enough. It is sad because in the long run the State governments do not even provide decent housing with the money that they take. </PARA>

<PARA> That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the debate on General Business Notice of Motion No. 41, standing in the name of Senator McLaren and relating to the setting up of a Senate select committee, being proceeded with forthwith. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a matter of extreme urgency. That is why I am taking this course. I had hoped that I would be extended somewhat similar courtesies as were extended to Senator Jessop. I gave notice of this matter on 27 May. I had hoped that it would be declared formal and a select committee would be set up. To acquaint the Senate with the notice of motion I gave for the setting up of a select committee and the need for it, I will read the notice of motion. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) That a Select Committee of the Senate be appointed to inquire into and report by 27 August 1981 on . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is why it is so urgent. This inquiry could have been held during the winter recess when ordinary Senate committees are not so much bogged down with work. The Committee could have done its work and reported back to the Senate by that date. The notice of motion continues:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the viability of the Ralkon Agricultural Company of Loveday Bay Road, Narrung, in the State of South Australia, and the competency of the Company to successfully farm (in the interests of the Aboriginal residents of Point McLeay) the three properties it now occupies;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the relationship between the Company, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Point McLeay Aboriginal Council from the time of formation of the Company in 1975 until 30 June 1980; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the relationship between the Company, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Point McLeay Aboriginal Council and the Aboriginal Development Commission since July 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) That provisions relating to membership, powers and proceedings of the Committee be contained in a subsequent Resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>I have done that because in my view and in the view of many others, including the local district newspaper, the Murray Valley Standard, from which I will quote later to highlight the matter of urgency, the need for a full inquiry is a matter of urgency, as I will now relate to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Three years ago the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare was given a reference to inquire into the management and financial affairs of the Ralkon Agricultural Co. Pty Ltd, Narrung, South Australia. Unfortunately for all concerned, nothing was achieved by this reference, which was passed on to the Commonwealth Ombudsman, whose report has never been made public. I have spoken to Professor Richardson about this matter. Under the terms of the Ombudsman Act, he is unable to make that report public because of certain things that happened. The inquiry dragged on for so long-I will not relate the details at this time-and the Aboriginal people at Point McLeay became so frustrated that they wrote to the Ombudsman and told him that they thought that they were getting somewhere with their problem and they asked him not to continue with his inquiry, although the report had been written. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequent events now call for a more far-reaching inquiry than was thought necessary in 1978. Senator Baume, who was the Chairman of the Social Welfare Committee at that time, is fully conversant with all the problems that were abroad in that community at that time. At his request, I wrote to him on 6 June 1978. He wanted some information about the company and its problems. I gave him a quite large document. I do not need to go into that today because he is well aware of the problems there from the letter which was sent to him as Chairman of that Committee. On 26 June 1978 the Chairman of the Ralkon Agricultural Co., Mr Koolmatrie, wrote to Mr Thomson, the Secretary of the Social Welfare Committee, at the request of Mr Thomson, and gave him the history of the company and details of the problems that that company was facing. It is a quite lengthy document and is on the record of the Committee. No doubt Senator Baume is fully conversant with the contents of that. He had two documents-one from me as a senator who was approached by these people to do something to help them and one from the Chairman of the Ralkon Agricultural Co., Mr Koolmatrie, who unfortunately has passed away. </PARA>
<PARA> On 24 August 1978, Senator Baume put down a statement in the Senate which is on the record. I will not take the time of the Senate by relating it, except to say that he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, on 31 May 1978 the Standing Committee on Social Welfare received from the Senate the following reference:</PARA>
<PARA> The management and financial affairs of the Ralkon Agricultural Company Proprietary Limited, Narrung, South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we informed the Company of our view that recourse to the Ombudsman could be appropriate and might be available. </PARA>
<PARA>Subsequent events revealed that the Committee then passed the reference which it was given by the Senate to the Commonwealth Ombudsman. I have already told the Senate that, because of certain happenings, that report has unfortunately never been made available. With the benefit of hindsight it might have been better if I had moved three years ago that a Senate select committee be set up; and we may not have been faced now with all the problems that exist in that area. On 24 April 1980, Senator Elstob, who was a member of that Committee, put down a statement in the Senate. I spoke at some length on that statement. I have repeatedly raised the matters before Estimates committees over the years, long before that reference was given. There is plenty of information on the record for anyone who would like to read about the problems faced by that company. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, the company and the Aboriginal people living in the community were so frustrated that they put out this 8-page document setting out their history and the problems they faced. That document was sent to every member of the Federal Parliament and to every member of the State Parliament in South Australia. So no member, if he read his correspondence, can use the excuse that he was not fully informed of the viability of this company and the problems it is now facing. The reason why this matter is urgent now is that the media have taken it up. The local Press including the Adelaide Advertiser has taken it up and Channel 7 has run several programs on it in its current affairs program. One program containing interviews with the Aboriginals concerned is available in the Parliamentary Library. But I will not refer to all that in detail because I know that I am restricted, under this Standing Order, to pointing out why the appointment of a Senate select committee is so urgent. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Murray Valley Standard of 3 July 1980, the column, 'Viewpoint', which is the equivalent of an editorial in any other paper, is headed 'Black prospect'. Senator Baume would also have a copy of this article because I sent all this information to Senator Chaney when he was the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. He would have as much information on this as I have. No doubt the minutes were passed on to Senator Baume when he took over from Senator Chaney as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I will not read the editorial in full because it made some very unkind remarks about Senator Chaney, and that is not the purpose of my exercise today. The editorial states in part:</PARA>
<PARA> The Ralkon people have convinced us that they don't want to be treated like 'native children', but as the successful farmers they've proved they are. </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial continues:</PARA>
<PARA> They've convinced us. . . Who should they approach now for a fair deal?</PARA>
<PARA>A further 'Viewpoint' editorial of 2 October 1980 referred to the problem as a 'Black hole'. Part of that editorial states:</PARA>
<PARA> Too many of us, though, are prepared to ignore the problems, and to accept the empty theory that 'more money and a bigger public service will make everything OK'. </PARA>
<PARA> The record proves us wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Now is the time for reasonable people to demand reasonable answers-or that black hole will just keep getting bigger. </PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the reasons why the need for an inquiry into this matter is so urgent and why it should be conducted without delay. On 12 January 1981, Mr Bill Nankivell, the previous Liberal Party member for Mallee in the State electorate in which this company is situated, wrote to Senator Baume. I point out that Mr Nankivell was a well respected member of parliament and he is still a well respected member of the community. He is chairman of a consultative committee. I will quote only parts of that letter to Senator Baume because Senator Baume will be well conversant with it. He has it on his file. Mr Nankivell wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> As you are no doubt fully aware, there are factional problems on Pt McLeay, one faction associated with Ralkon and the other working through the Community Council which appears to have the support and advice of the Regional Department. Consequently, we as a Consultative Committee to Ralkon, find that we are called upon to provide legal advice more often than managerial and financial advice and as a consequence have quite unintentionally become involved in these factional arguments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. As I said in my opening remarks, I am well aware that I am restricted in what I can say. My Whip had negotiations with the Government Whip to see whether this committee could be set up and we were told no, the Minister would not agree. That is why I have had to take this action in the Senate to try to get the Senate to agree. I am not asking for anything outlandish. To prove my point as to why the matter was so urgent I felt I had to refer to some of those matters. However, if Senator Baume does not want me to do so, I suppose that under the Standing Orders he can prevent me from doing so.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what I was trying to point out, Mr President. I am not the only one asking for this inquiry because Mr Nankivell who is the chairman of the consultative body advising Ralkon and who was also the local State member for many years is also concerned. I was trying to point out some of the matters which he has drawn to Senator Baume's attention, to the problems which exist at Ralkon and how, in my view, whoever is in the right, we could get to the kernel of the matter if this Senate committee were to be set up and were allowed to do its work. It will not be at any great cost to the Government, I am sure. Because the Minister has intervened, I have now run off the track, and I will have to leave that paragraph on page 2. But I do want to refer to the latter part of Mr Nankivell's letter in which he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, I wish to assure you that we as a Committee have only one desire and that is to see Ralkon be given a fair go and assisted in its further development and possibly used as a model for other such enterprises rather than it should be destroyed for petty reasons. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the real crux of the matter-petty reasons. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> At the moment the future of Ralkon has never been more delicately balanced. </PARA>
<PARA>There are other letters from Mr Nankivell to Senator Baume in his capacity as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I have copies of them but I will not refer to them today. As I said, this has become a public matter. It is getting a lot of publicity in the Press. In the Adelaide Advertiser of Thursday, 14 May, there is a statement by Mr Bourke of the Aboriginal Development Commission. According to the article, Mr Bourke, because of some report which he got from a farm management consultant, accuses the Aboriginals at Ralkon of poor farm management. The article is entitled 'Aboriginals' farm ''poorly managed'' '. This is of great concern to people. In the Adelaide Advertiser of Friday, 15 May there is an article entitled 'Ralkon report not disputed'. According to the article, Ralkon agrees with the report because it has not been able to get proper tenure of the land to work the property properly. The Murray Valley Standard of Thursday, 14 May carries an article headed 'ADC reply on Ralkon'. On 21 May, just a week or so ago, that same newspaper carried this article: 'ADC ''declared to overthrow'' Ralkon'. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these things are very confusing to many people. In my view, there is only one way to solve them and that is for a Senate select committee to be appointed to examine all of the problems which exist on both sides. As I have pointed out to the Senate, this is a very urgent matter and when I moved that Standing Orders be suspended, I asked honourable senators to agree with me. This matter has gone much further since 1978. The Aboriginal Development Commission has been formed and accusations have been made about the regional office of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. There have also been many problems associated with the previous local Aboriginal councils at Point McLeay. Fortunately there has been change but still a lot of things are simmering under the surface and they are causing great anguish to people in the community. The Murray Valley Standard of last week-I have given a copy of the article to Senator Baume-contains a photograph of the Minister talking to Aboriginal people at Point McLeay. The editorial in 'Viewpoint' is headed 'Dirty washing?' and states:</PARA>
<PARA> It seems more likely, however, that Senator Baume (like Senator Chaney before him) finds it more convenient to back off from what threatens to become a very messy issue. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Whose dirty washing is nearly on the line?</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> There's need for an official and open inquiry on the Ralkon farm controversy-right now. </PARA>
<PARA>That is why last week I gave notice of motion relating to the setting up of a Senate committee. I say to you, Mr President, and to Senator Baume that I had no idea at all on the day I moved that notice of motion that that editorial was going to appear in the paper. I was rather astounded that it coincided with my notice of motion. But I was pleased that it did because I thought it might help Senator Baume to agree to the setting up of this Senate select committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been involved in this problem for nearly 10 years now, ever since I have been a senator. It goes a long way back. I have expressed my concern on many occasions. Mr President, as I have pointed out to the Senate, this is a very urgent matter. I ask the Senate to agree to suspend Standing Orders to allow me to move motion No. 41 standing in my name on the Notice Paper which calls for the appointment of a Senate select committee to inquire and report as outlined in that motion. The date is in my motion. I have read it out. If the Minister would allow the committee to be set up, it could do its work and report back to the Senate when we resume. It will not inconvenience the running of the Parliament. Such would be the case if a select committee were to sit during the parliamentary session. As I said, the work can be done during the recess. I hope that that Senate inquiry will be able to talk to all people concerned, hear all points of view and let every person involved-everyone from Ralkon, the local people who live in the Point McLeay township, and officers from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs-hear the points of view instead of learning of them through the Press. Also, let us get members of the ADC before the committee so that it too can be made fully aware of all the problems that exist. For those reasons, I have moved my motion:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the debate on General Business, Notice of Motion No. 41 standing in the name of Senator McLaren and relating to the setting up of a Senate select committee, being proceeded with forthwith. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion and I do so briefly because we do not want to delve into the history of the Ralkon Agricultural Co. Pty Ltd. I was associated with this matter, before it had the additional farm, in the last days of my position as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. It is one company which has successfully grown. I think it made a $30,000 profit last year. There is a fight as to who should own the land. There should be no fight. It was land which was given to the Point McLeay Aboriginals' organisation which leased it out to a company, but now there is an allegation that there is influence on some departmental officers to get it away from the company which employs the manager and give it back to the people on the reserve. The council operating the reserve does not really want it. It decided to give it to the company. There are continual fights, including attempts to stack the Point McLeay Council meetings for the purpose of getting a decision one way one day and a decision the other way the next day. This shows the urgency of the matter. Ralkon is one of the few profitable Aboriginal ventures. It is now being run down by internal fighting. There has been some neglect of the property by virtue of the fact that no one knows the tenure of his occupation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know the answer. I do not know who is right or who is wrong. I have had discussions with the manager of the company and the assistant director of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Adelaide. I cannot make the decision, and I would not attempt to do so. But in the meantime, a sound, profitable investment is running down. Seasonally, it is the right time for the property to be improved. It is time something was resolved. To resolve one point of view as against another point of view would solve nothing unless one had the full facts of the inquiry. A decision by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) or the Department would solve nothing, and those who felt left out would be disgruntled. There would be an opportunity for them all to put their case before a committee. I think there would be a consensus of opinion to abide by the decision to let the industry go on. But valuable property is being run down and neglected because of this internal fighting. It is important to have this inquiry at least before the season gets too far advanced so that superphosphate can be applied and planting can be undertaken. It is important to solve the matter at an early date. Therefore, I think it would be a shame if it were left until the Budget session. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not know that this motion to suspend the Standing Orders was coming on for debate. It has taken this side of the chamber by surprise. Senator McLaren is asking the Senate to agree that a matter of urgent necessity exists which requires the reference of the Ralkon Agricultural Co. Pty Ltd case to a Senate select committee. It is not a question of my not agreeing to a particular reference. That is a matter for the Senate. It is not for me to say how the Senate decides it will proceed when the question of setting up a committee arises. I was asked for my personal view and I gave it, based on my knowledge of Ralkon, which is not as great as that of the two honourable senators who have spoken; but it is greater than that of most other people in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall refer to the reasons I think it is inappropriate to agree to the suspension of Standing Orders. A standing committee of the Senate has already had a reference from this place, has examined the matter of Ralkon and has determined that it should not be followed up further. That finding came down with no dissenting views. It is an exceedingly complex matter. I do not wish to refer to the issue except to say that it is basically, as in so many Aboriginal communities, a question of a disagreement between groupings within the community. The issue affecting Ralkon at the moment is simply the question of title to a piece of property. There is no immediate question that people will stop farming. There is no urgent issue over which the Senate has any authority in relation to the issue of a title. The Parliament and the Senate-I remember Senator Bonner giving the second reading speech in the Senate-set up the Aboriginal Development Commission, and the questions relating to the title of Bartlett Farm are in the hands of that Commission. It is not within our competence to say how that title should be given. I would not welcome the day when we move, by way of urgent procedure, to have a group of white parliamentarians attempting to tell an Aboriginal body which we set up how it should proceed on an issue of title. Unless we change the legislation, it is not required to take instructions anyhow. Comments in newspapers, on television and in the Murray Valley Standard do not of themselves create any urgent necessity. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall refer to some of the events. There is a history of this matter goes back many years. It is not a recent occurrence which would indicate an urgent and immediate problem. One of the Senate's standing committees took some action on the matter of the Ralkon-Point McLeay issue. On our suggestion, the issue was referred to the Ombudsman as an appropriate person to consider the matter. Senator McLaren referred to this. The Ralkon company withdrew the request to the Ombudsman just before his report was due to be released. The effect of withdrawing it was to prevent the release of the report which may well have been adverse to one or other party. Whatever report the ombudsman had ready-whichever side it was adverse to-it could not be released because the Ralkon Agricultural Co. asked that the complaint be no longer there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking about the questions of title at present. It is the question of title that is urgent. The other issues are not urgent; they are long term issues. I am not commenting on whether we should set up that committee. The question before the Senate is whether we should proceed now-immediately and urgently-to set aside the Standing Orders. I suggest that at the very least this is a matter that should be resolved by negotiation and by agreement, as is generally the case with references to Senate committees. I am not in a position to say that a reference will not take place, but I give a personal view, if I am asked, that this may be one that is not appropriate. Then again, it is not for me to say. It is for the Senate to decide that matter in due course. It is my view that there is no urgent necessity here and that the urgent intervention of the Senate could in fact inhibit the negotiations which are taking place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have a very considerable program of business today which has been agreed upon by honourable senators. We have had a fairly full exposition from our colleagues as to why they thought Standing Orders should be set aside. I indicate that we will vote against the suspension of Standing Orders. That in no way indicates how we would respond, in due course, to the question of setting up a select committee. Let us negotiate and see how we should proceed from here.

<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Australian National University Act 1946 to clarify the intention of certain provisions in the Act relating to the funding of student organisations at the University. This Act was amended in 1979 to introduce into the Act provisions to implement the Government's policy on the membership and funding of student organisations in universities and colleges. This policy includes the principles that membership of student organisations is to be voluntary, that there is to be no discrimination against students who elect not to join such organisations and that compulsory fees charged by institutions can be used only for the provision of amenities and services. Such fees are not to be used to support socio-political activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1979 amendments place on the Council of the University the obligation to ensure that these fees are used only in accordance with the requirements of the Act. A number of questions of interpretation have arisen in connection with the implementation of these amendments, and the Government has consequently decided that there is a need to amend the Act to clarify the intention of the amendments and to ensure, in particular, that compulsory student fees cannot be used, directly or indirectly, for purposes other than for the provision of amenities and services. The Bill is directed to clarifying the provisions of the 1979 amendments in three ways. First, it makes income derived from compulsory student fees subject to the same conditions as apply under section 29A of the Act to these fees. Second, it provides that where income is received by student organisations through the use of both compulsory fees and other income, it will be necessary to apportion this income in determining the proportions available for amenities and services and for other purposes. The third aspect is that the administrative costs of student organisations, including any allowances paid to office holders, are also to be apportioned to the extent that these expenses may be attributed to the provision of amenities and services. Only the proportion of such administrative costs that can be directly attributable to the provision of amenities and services may be funded from the compulsory fees. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of the use of income derived from compulsory student fees arises in such cases as where funds obtained from these fees are invested to earn income or where fees are applied to other purposes, such as the production of a student newspaper, that lead to income. It is the intention of the Government that income obtained in such ways should be subject to the same conditions as apply to the use of compulsory fees through the requirements of section 29A of the Act. The amendments I have outlined do not represent an essential change in the framework provided by the 1979 amendments. The principles that underlie the Government's policy towards student organisations will continue to be given effect under arrangements that recognise the legitimate role of the University Council in the management of the University. It will continue to be the obligation of the council to ensure that compulsory student fees are used only for the provision of amenities and services. With the clarification that the Bill provides on certain aspects of the 1979 amendments that have led to issues in their implementation, I believe that an appropriate framework will exist to regulate the funding of student organisations at the Australian National University. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I refer to my proposed amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Independent Air Fares Committee Bill I wish to raise a matter which is of considerable concern to me personally as well as, I would imagine, to most other senators. As will be recalled, it was the Government's intention last evening for the Senate, within 24 hours of these four very contentious Bills having been introduced to complete both their second reading and Committee stages. As a consequence, we had to undertake a great deal of research into the Bills and take into consideration the debate that had taken place in the House of Representatives. The Government decided early this morning, because of the hour, to deal as a matter of procedure with only the first of the four Bills before the Senate and to continue the discussion with respect to the other three some time this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I arrived at my desk this morning I found that all of the papers dealing with the second, third and fourth pieces of legislation involved in the cognate debate had been removed. They included not only the Bills themselves and the amendments which the Opposition wished to move but also all of my notes of discussions with colleagues in the other place, which took account of my party's attitude on the matter. In their place, the Bills which were introduced subsequently, at a late hour last night, were upon my desk. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a serious matter that a senator, particularly one on the front bench with a certain responsibility to acquaint himself with the procedures and policies of his party in the other place, should find that all of his notes of discussions and research have been removed without his authority. That represents an interference with the personal papers of honourable senators. I would like to put a hypothetical case to you, Mr President. You will recall that we rose after 1 a.m. this morning. It is conceivable that an honourable senator who might wish to raise very confidential matters as a result of representations made by a constituent, having decided not to raise them because of the lateness of the hour, would leave his papers here, only to find next morning that they had completely disappeared. That is a disgraceful affair, an unforgivable interference in the rights of honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true to say that I have raised the matter with the Government party and it has been considerate enough to postpone for an hour or so this morning the debate on this Bill so that we would be in a position to carry out further research and discharge our responsibilities adequately. I raise this as a matter of procedure because I do not believe that papers left on our desks should be interfered with. I concede that sometimes there is such a welter of papers before us that someone may decide to clean them up, but surely such papers could be put aside so that if they were not required the next day by the senator they could be disposed of. I realise that the officers of the Senate have attempted to remedy the situation but that it has not been possible. </PARA>
<PARA> That only emphasises the point that I raised yesterday concerning what is happening about the security in this place, the role of the Parliament, and the rights of honourable senators. I drew attention to the diminution that was taking place in that respect, a matter which I hope will be taken up by the Presiding Officers and by the Senate itself. I am sure that the experience that I have related might well have taken place in the House of Representatives also. Mr President, I direct your attention to the matter for the purpose not of engaging in a witch hunt but of establishing procedures which will ensure that the papers of individual senators are protected, that confidentiality is preserved and that such papers are not interfered with in any way whatever. </PARA>

<PARA> (a) cost allocation reviews on a sufficiently comprehensive and frequent basis;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the involvement of the public, including consumers' representatives, in the review process; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) recognition of the profitability of the major airlines in the conduct of reviews by the Committee.'</PARA>
<PARA>Although it is true to say that some of these matters have been addressed in the cognate debate which took place last evening, we are provided now with an opportunity to remedy, in relation to this particular Bill, the fact that last night, by a narrow vote of one, the amendments proposed by myself, Senator Chipp and subsequently Senator MacGibbon failed to receive the approval of the majority of the Senate. Surely we can expect the Senate to adopt a more responsible position in respect of this amendment than it did last night in respect of those that I have mentioned. We should examine the democratic process involved. Senators elected at the same time as were members of the House of Representatives are unable to take their seats until 1 July 1981, a delay of six or seven months. Thus the Government has been able to use its brute force, its strength of numbers, to impose upon the Parliament an arrangement which will exist for 10 years. If there had been some synchronisation in regard to members and senators taking their seats in the Parliament and thus reflecting the majority decisions made by the Australian electorate in the federal elections of 1980, we would not be in the position in which we find ourselves today. We would have had sitting in the Senate senators who were elected at that time. They would have been taking part in the determination, as indeed have those who were elected at the same time to the other place. </PARA>
<PARA> Although there is much talk of the need for electoral reform, I state clearly and unequivocally that the Labor Party will not support a four-year term for members of the House of Representatives unless substantial changes are made in regard to synchronisation between the House of Representatives and the Senate concerning fixed terms of office and a number of other needed improvements in electoral procedures in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of this legislation would be regarded by any business organisation as normal day-to-day practice. That is to say, before rises are approved by the Commonwealth through its various agencies, with respect to the monopoly position that we have developed with Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans-Australia Airlines, there should be a cost allocation review on a sufficiently comprehensive and frequent basis. Approval of fare increases for the two major airlines should not be given just because the airlines themselves have made submissions when they feel like it simply to maintain profitability. Regular reviews and comprehensive reviews should be undertaken. Such a review has not taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Opposition's amendment is to establish the principle that regular and frequent reviews should be undertaken and that the organisations involved, both TAA and Ansett, comply with the requirements of the government of the day to ensure that they are able to justify the increase in air fares both in their incomes and expenditures. We all know, of course, that air fares have more than doubled in the last year, that substantial increases have been approved but that no evidence at all has been placed before the Government or the Department of Transport in these matters. It is conceded, however, with respect to the Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares, the Holcroft inquiry, that TAA submitted a case for an increase in air fares in relation to the major trunk routes of Australia. Ansett did not, as the Holcroft inquiry indicated, make available a submission. Nevertheless, on several occasions the Government has approved increases in air fares. Of course, the Holcroft inquiry pointed out these deficiencies and indicated to the community at large the grave deficiencies of that mighty organisation which was taken over, as honourable senators will remember, in a coup by Sir Peter Abeles and Rupert Murdoch about a year or so ago. They were able to get the assent of this Government without seeking to justify in any way the massive increases in air fares which have been significant since the Fraser Government came to office. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (2) of the Opposition's amendment seeks to show that because we have something like 11 million commuters using the airways of Australia a consumers' representative ought to be appointed to such a review organisation-a public inquiry concept. A representative of the travelling public ought to be involved in the review process to protect and demand the sort of information that normally would be available in any other type of commercial, public or private organisation. We find it incomprehensible that the views of the travelling public which, after all, contributes to the success of the airlines and contributes substantially to the profitability of the airlines, cannot be put in any way, shape or form. At no time does the travelling public have the opportunity to present a view to the Government not only in respect of the price fare structure but also in respect of the parallel scheduling of airlines. Parallel scheduling of flights has been referred to constantly in this Parliament by members of all political parties from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> Reference also has been made to the lack of competition and the lack of concern for the rights of the travelling public. We have all expressed discontent about that matter. Sometimes we find that there are delays of two or three hours on some of the major trunk routes. We find that both TAA and Ansett have flights leaving within five minutes of one another which causes great inconvenience to the travelling public. We believe there is a case to be put-an unanswerable case-that the travelling public ought to have a representative appointed to represent what we must all surely concede is a justifiable point of view with respect to these matters. Paragraph (3) of the Opposition's amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA> Recognition of the profitability of the major airlines in the conduct of reviews by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Surely we are entitled to question what is reasonable and unreasonable in relation to the profitability of airlines. No honourable senator on the Government side can tell us whether the profitability of the major airlines is high or low. No government supporter surely can justify this concept. I am referring to the free marketeer element of the Liberal Party, those who believe in market forces and who constantly parade and espouse that view about free market forces and about free enterprise. Honourable senators opposite ought to be prepared to support this amendment. The Opposition is saying that some consideration ought to be given to recognising what is fair or unfair profitability as a result of the regulatory influence and the non-competitive nature of the major airlines in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely reviews should be held regularly. I have yet to hear any honourable senator on the Government side say that regular reviews should not be held. The Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) when speaking in the debate in the other place could not and did not justify the view that there is not a need for a regular review by the Independent Air Fares Committee of the activities of these two airlines. Despite the decisions which have already been reached in respect of the airlines agreement legislation which was debated in this place last night an opportunity now exists for those honourable senators who believe and espouse that philosophical position and who claim that there ought to be free competition and free enterprise to indicate their views. The Opposition believes it will be difficult for them to sustain their opposition to the amendment to which I am now referring. </PARA>
<PARA> I take the view that if in fact honourable senators opposite reject this amendment to the second reading of the Bill then they are unable to defend adequately the policies of the Fraser Government in these matters. It would be just another indication of the way in which this Government has been bought, lock, stock and barrel by the Abeles-Murdoch empire. Whatever those companies want the Government to do in respect of the airline industry and whatever those individuals want it to do in respect of our communications in this country, the Government is prepared to dance to the tune and react to the whims of those particular organisations and individuals. That caustic and critical view is held honestly by the Opposition. If in fact that is not so, then the Opposition challenges the Government to say that it sees nothing wrong with the amendment which I have moved. </PARA>
<PARA> After all, the Opposition is attempting only to establish the principle that proper business practices should be applied with respect to the way in which the airlines industry in this country operates. Proper business principles should apply with respect to the two companies that have been given a monopoly position, the two companies which are protected by guarantees and are protected as a result of this legislation. These two companies have now got themselves into a gilt edged position and, consequently, are not accountable either to the Parliament or the general public for their activities. Therefore, if honourable senators are in fact confident of their philosophical position then they will in fact give this amendment more consideration than they gave to the debate held yesterday. </PARA>

When you, Mr President, make inquiries I hope you will make some allowance as to why Senator Gietzelt's notes and copies of the Bills have been taken. It is not the attendants' fault.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is opposed to the amendment. I do not think I specifically mentioned anything about the amendment in my reply during the second reading debate of the Airlines Agreement Bill; so I think I should just put down very briefly why the Government rejects it. The Bill contains provisions for cost allocation reviews to be undertaken at certain periods, but in addition to that, the Government takes the view that we have already had, in the Holcroft inquiry, a cost allocation review of very major proportions. The Government announced last night the appointment of consultants to complete the Holcroft review; so the new provisions will be starting against the background of that very major review to be undertaken. The Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) has already said that he will ask the new committee to commence a cost allocation review within six months of its establishment. The Bill provides for minimum periods of between two to three years after the completion of that review for the holding of cost allocation reviews.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the involvement of the public in the review process, the Government takes the view that the committee's three members should be appointed from as wide a field of people of quality and substance as possible for a task which in many ways will be a very technical operation. The Government believes it should have wide flexibility in the appointment of the committee and does not believe it should be constrained in the way the second proposal in the amendment would require. The third point concerns a recognition of the probability of the involvement of airlines in the conduct of the reviews. The Government does not believe so many arbitrary restraints ought to be placed on profits. Undoubtedly the profits that are likely to be made from any level of charges to be debated and approved by the committee will be of vital importance in its considerations. We believe a matter of that kind should be left to the experts who will be on the committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to deal with the amendments to the Independent Air Fares Committee Bill. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Page 4, clause 3, sub-clauses (5) and (6), lines 19 to 33, leave out the sub-clauses. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition takes the view, which I have expressed perhaps more forcefully in the debate on the motion for the second reading, that these sub-clauses, in fact, place an impediment on the airline users and permit the government of the day to allow a continuation of the processes we have seen in recent years which have brought about huge hikes in air fares generally. I think it has to be said that if that continues-and I think the two-airline agreement, in fact, will enhance the capacity of the major operators to get their own way-it will be very detrimental to the tourist industry. I would have thought that as the tourist industry is labour intensive and there are many advantages in having a competitive fare situation for our airlines in this country we would be wanting to take whatever steps are available to us as a parliament to influence the fare schedules in such a way as to assist the tourist industry very tremendously. </PARA>
<PARA> If, in fact, we have a high fare situation-and we do have a high fare situation-it acts as something of a damper upon the tourist industry. The advantages of the tourist industry are tremendous from this point of view. Not only is it an income earning area of our economy but also it is an area which provides a range of jobs. The tourist industry is also decentralised. There would be hundreds, if not thousands, of places in Australia which would be of interest to overseas visitors. But expensive costs of accommodation and the expensive nature, which is a feature of our airline industry, of travel on our major trunk routes may well deter people from coming to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I think sub-clauses (5) and (6) of clause 3 of this Bill give strength to the monopoly nature of the airline industry and strengthen that section of the Act. They do so at the expense of the smaller operator. No doubt East-West Airlines Ltd and the other small operators in our country are in an inferior position in respect of their capacities to have some influence on the air fare structure. I find it just incomprehensible as well as inconceivable that the National Country Party, which claims to represent the rural point of view-and the number of people in that political party is shrinking in the Senate-and particularly its representatives from Queensland must surely appreciate the disadvantages suffered by the small operator as a result of this section of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> If they are not prepared to examine this matter because of party disciplines and party decisions and because they have been cowed by the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, and the tremendous economic and political power of Abeles and Murdoch, one can conclude only that they have become stooges to the party and thrown away their responsibilities as representatives of their States. Particularly those National Country Party senators from New South Wales and Queensland ought to examine what this amendment seeks to do. It seeks to protect the small operator and not place him at the dictates of the market forces which are concentrated, emphasised and protected by the major operators, Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Transport Industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we on this side of the Parliament recognise that when we talk about TAA in these terms, quite contrary to what Senator Rae said last night, we mean that TAA, in fact, is tremendously disadvantaged as a result of the influence of Ansett Transport Industries. It has been in that secondary position throughout the whole of the 1950s, the 1960s, the 1970s and now, obviously, in the 1980s as a result of the decisions made by the Senate last evening. We are now tied into a ten-year arrangement which means that for over 30 years TAA will continue to be in an inferior position. Under the provisions of these sub-clauses so will all of the small operators in Australia. The major operators will be able to set the pace, set the price and set the policies of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This is, in fact, further confirmation that despite all the rhetoric of Government senators, and particularly those who talk about market forces, these sub-clauses create an unfair, discriminatory position. It is such a discriminatory position that the matter ought to be referred to the Trade Practices Commission because it puts the small operators at the complete mercy of the major operators and places the rights of all those who use the airline industry in an inferior position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will oppose this amendment. The purposes of these provisions in the Bill are really quite fundamental to an airline policy which is maintained by the legislation. The Bill provides that by and large for the operations on the trunk routes that are to be carried out by the trunk operators-even though there may be some other operators on parts of the trunk route-approval will have to be given for the nature of the fares that they can charge. There are provisions in the legislation indicating that the fares they charge must not be such as to increase the basic economy fare permitted for the trunk operators. These sub-clauses are part and parcel of that scheme and the Government cannot agree to their deletion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Page 5, clause 4, after sub-clause (2), insert the following new sub-clause:</PARA>
<PARA> ''(2A) At least one member shall be a person who is a member or officer of a body having functions in relation to consumer protection.''. </PARA>
<PARA>I fail to appreciate why the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) refused to take this suggestion on board in the other place. It seems to me to be a logical and reasonable proposal to appoint to the Committee a representative who shall have some association with consumer organisations and who shall fill the role of protecting the rights and interests of the 11 million commuters who make or break the functions of our airline industry. As we have said, those people have views which clearly have not been taken into consideration in the past. From time to time members of all political parties have expressed in some way, either publicly or privately, their concern about the lack of competition in the industry and the failure of the airlines to look after the interests of the travelling public. The Minister said in the House of Representatives that the Government had noted the views of the Opposition in this matter but intended to leave the clause in its present form. Here the Senate has an opportunity, which it rarely takes up but which it could if it wanted to, of exercising its power of amending, reviewing or considering views which have not been given proper consideration by the Executive Government in the other place. I think it is fair to say that the travelling public should have a voice on the committee which is being set up to examine air fares-the Independent Air Fares Committee. The Government's proposition is that there should be a Chairman and two other members of it. I do not think it is unreasonable to put to the Government that one of the other two members shall be a person representing consumer interests, so that the members of the travelling public will have the opportunity of referring to him their complaints and concerns from time to time about what happens as a result of the monopoly position that the airline industry occupies in this country. </PARA>

<PARA> Page 9, clause 13, sub-clause (2), paragraph (A), sub-paragraph (II), line 6, leave out ''at least 2 years, and not more than 3 years,'', insert ''not more than 2 years''. </PARA>
<PARA>These amendments relate to the need for a public examination of the costs involved in the airline industry in our country and to the question of allocating cost procedures in establishing air fares and putting into effect the very excellent work that was done by the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares. We believe that that committee should have the opportunity to review the cost allocation details specifically. We are concerned about how airline operators apportion costs and how they attribute them to the flagfall and distance components of an air fares formula, which is the basis upon which increases in air fares are determined. It also has a relationship under these provisions of the legislation to the first class fare differential. </PARA>
<PARA> It is pretty clear to the Opposition that the Department of Transport has been rather remiss in its failure to have a proper examination of the costs involved in the operation of the airlines. For example, the Holcroft inquiry stated that the Department of Transport in fact had not carried out such a survey or examination. Therefore, the Department of Transport, as the regulatory body, was not carrying out its proper functions. I suggest that the reason why that has happened is that the government of the day has not been interested in interfering with the functioning of, particularly, Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. That applies not only to the new proprietors of that organisation but also to the proprietors before it was taken over by Sir Peter Abeles and Rupert Murdoch. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the Department of Transport, as the regulatory authority, has not carried out this function is a default by the Department of Transport. We say that this is because the Government has not wanted to carry out a proper examination. It has been quite happy to assist its wealthy friends in the Ansett organisation, so the Department has just been carrying out a rubber stamping exercise over a number of years. The Department, as mentioned in its Domestic Air Transport Policy Review, has not been able to get adequate information from the private sector of our airlines industry. Trans-Australia Airlines, despite what has been said ad nauseam by Senator Rae, has carried out its obligations and made its fare structures and its cost allocation procedures available to the Department of Transport as a matter of proper business practice. But Ansett has not been prepared to do that. It did not do it for the Holcroft inquiry. I would say that the action of the Holcroft inquiry, made up of the eminent membership that it had, in drawing the Government's attention to the refusal of Ansett Transport Industries to co-operate in this matter was one of the reasons why it was sacked by this Government. The Government does not want a proper examination to be conducted of the way in which the costs are allocated and how the components involved in the fare structures are determined. </PARA>
<PARA> The big men of yesterday are the meek men of today. They are not even in the chamber to try to follow through their responsibilities as they saw them yesterday. Having been cowed by the attitude of this Government, by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and by the very powerful influence that Sir Peter Abeles and the Murdoch group has upon this Government, they are not even prepared to sit in the chamber, and to listen, let alone participate, in the debate. The rest of the Government senators are a disgrace to the Parliament. They are not prepared even to listen to or take part in the debate the issues that we suggest are reasonable. The practices we advocate are common to the whole commercial world and to the way in which the private sector operates. They are not followed in the airline industry because this Government is a captive of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition's fifth amendment deals with clause 15. It is a quite substantial amendment and expresses some of the views that I have already put forward in the Senate. It requires a public inquiry to be held into any matters involving a major air fare review. The Opposition seeks in this amendment to establish processes and procedures whereby the committee must consider profit limitation. As the Bill stands we have a ludicrous position. In the absence of information, just on the application of the private operator, the Government can approve fare increases without giving any consideration to whether the operators' profits are reasonable or unreasonable. We suggest in the amendment that the Government ought not approve any further fare rises without receiving basic information from the operators and without examination of the operators' profitability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After all, this issue has become a public issue. It is not a private issue. The Parliament is being asked to give its assent to legislation which establishes a watertight position for the two domestic airlines that operate in our country, one of which in its annual report to this Parliament has to justify its position, running the gauntlet of public criticism, parliamentary criticism and government criticism. It does this in an open, honest, logical and businesslike fashion. All we want is to have the other section of our airline industry, the private sector, subjected to the same scrutiny, the same public inquiry and the same business procedures. I do not believe that that is an unreasonable proposition. I think it is a proper and reasonable approach. The Opposition has said this consistently. We have not taken a narrow view. We have taken the view that there ought to be some regulation of the airline industry and some competition in the airline industry. In order to do this effectively and properly the same scrutiny that is given to the public functions of Trans-Australia Airlines and the same regulations and procedures that apply to TAA should apply in respect of Ansett Transport Industries, operating as it does with the guarantee, the protection and the acquiescence, to a remarkable degree, of the Fraser Government. We are saying in our amendment that air fares should not rise in Australia until such time as a continuing public inquiry has been set up. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that the Government, in ramming legislation such as this through the Parliament, is not taking into consideration the view of the electors that changes the complexion of this Parliament and that is that the Senate should occupy a more important role in the process of government. If this Bill were to have been dealt with by the Senate elected to take office on 1 July, as it should be, there is no doubt at all that the Opposition would insist upon a public inquiry into the way in which the airline companies operate, given the government protection and the backing that they have. The justification for fare increases would then be based on the actual conditions relating to the industry. </PARA>

In that amendment he sought to have a Senate committee established to examine and inquire into the matters that were left unfinished by virtually putting the Holcroft inquiry to sleep. He sought to establish the machinery by which this Senate, to its satisfaction at least to some degree, could have a public inquiry examine these matters. But of course, we know what happened. Senator Chipp's amendment did not get the support of even the so-called Government rebels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition's amendment to clause 15 states that where a passenger operator-that is, TAA or Ansett-requests the Committee to conduct a review in accordance with this legislation in relation to a fare increase, a public inquiry should be established to determine whether that submission is relevant. Is that proposition unreasonable? I do not believe that it is. I think if this Government were performing the function for which it was elected, namely, to protect the public interest, the Senate, as the major House of review, would be agreeing to this proposition. But the meek men and women on the Government side sit in the chamber in silence or do their jobs eleswhere. They are not even prepared to debate the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> All we have is the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) saying that the Opposition's amendments are not acceptable as Mr Hunt has done in the other place. He is not saying whether there are some weaknesses in what we are proposing, and he is not denying that there is justice in what we are saying, namely, that the airlines should operate on exactly the same basis as does any other commercial enterprise in this country. If TAA operates on that basis why should Ansett not do so? There should be a public inquiry instead of the Minister being a rubber stamp to the submissions that are constantly put to the Government, to him and to his Department, for invariably high increases in air fares in Australia. Having said that, all I can do is move the amendment and place on record that this Government is not prepared to consider any reasonable proposition put forward by the Opposition. We might as well close the place down and allow the Executive Government to run this country in the form of almost a one-man dictatorship, which has become synonymous with the way in which the Fraser Administration operates.

That is the inquiry that will lay down the basic framework and which will carry out either a major review or a minor review into air fare increases. The Government believes that the subsidiary inquiries should be held in private. But the fact of the matter is that its determination and the reasons for the determination must be made public. The public will be concerned to know about details of the inquiries which will be held at regular intervals. Frequent reviews of this kind are of a more technical character and more suitable, in the Government's view, to be held in private than in public.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I invite my colleague, Senator Walsh, to put up whatever Senator Carrick said or did and compare it with that answer I just got from the Attorney-General, Senator Durack. If I appear very angry, it is because I am. I am not used to being treated with contempt because I asked a reasonable question. It was not a question from which I tried to score political points. It was a question that struck at the very root of this system of parliamentary democracy. On very few occasions since I have been a member of parliament, have I seen an amendment, moved by an opposition, accepted by a government. I speak of the times when the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party have been in power. There is a pathetic rule that if the governing party accepts a motion moved by the Opposition, it loses face.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Every higher school certificate student in Australia, who is learning politics, will be taught this rubbish of how the Westminster system works and how the Senate is a House of review. I will recapitulate what has just happened. The Attorney-General said that the amendment moved by Senator Gietzelt is not acceptable to the Government. If these amendments were not looked at specifically by the Cabinet, or a properly constituted committee of the Cabinet and if Senator Durack knew that and knew, on the advice of his departmental advisors who are sitting next to him now, that it was a decision made by the Minister in consultation with his Department only, the Attorney-General has lied to this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to know. I am entitled to know. It is not just a matter of providing an answer to this question. There is a whole fundamental point here. Were these amendments considered by the Cabinet or just by the Minister and his Department? We were told explicitly by the Minister that the amendments are not acceptable to the Government. I challenge Senator Walsh to trot out a piece of grosser arrogance than this. Senator Durack, the Attorney-General, said that I, a senator, am not entitled to know whether the Government rejected these amendments or whether the decision was made by the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) in consultation with his Department. God knows that over this airline matter there has been enough misleading of Parliament and the public. Government back benchers met until 2 a.m. one morning and were told that Sir Peter Abeles would not accept anything less than a 10 year agreement. Two days later Peter Abeles said that any less a period was never put to him. Either there was a mistake in the leaking process, the Minister lied or there is some other explanation. I have had enough of this kind of double talk. I can stand double talk, that is part of politics. But when the Attorney tells me that I am not entitled to know who said 'no' to these amendments, that is arrogance in its highest form. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wonder how genuine Senator Chipp is. In the past he has had a great deal of experience as a Minister of the Crown. I would be interested to learn on how many occasions in those glorious days when he was a Minister of the Crown he answered questions in the House of Representatives in a similar vein about whether a matter went to a committee of Cabinet or whether it went to the whole Cabinet. He knows very well the principles of Cabinet solidarity and how the system works. Let him not be so naive at this time and in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find that to be one of the most extraordinary statements an honourable senator could possibly make. I do not know whether Senator Watson is trying to be a smart-Alick, or what. Yes, I was a Minister. From time to time I had 10 portfolios and at no stage did I ever say, when rejecting an amendment, that the Government rejected the amendment if only I, in consultation with my Department, rejected the amendment. That is the answer to Senator Watson's question and that is what I want to know now. I will withdraw the refinement contained in my question about whether the amendment was rejected by Cabinet or by a committee of Cabinet. I will simplify the question. I again ask the Attorney: Were Senator Gietzelt's amendments and the ones moved in the lower House rejected only by the Minister in consultation with his Department, or were they referred to Cabinet or any part thereof?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Page 14, clause 15, sub-clause (11), after paragraph (a), insert the following new paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> '(aa) the need to ensure that the profit of Ansett and the Commission, before interest and tax, excluding extraordinary items, as a proportion of revenue, does not exceed 6 per cent, given a continuation of the present levels of interest and income taxation in Australia;'. </PARA>
<PARA>This clause deals with a major review of airline costs and fares. The original Bill states that the Independent Air Fares Committee shall have regard to-</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the need to ensure that air services are operated on an efficient and economic basis;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the need to ensure that air services are provided over trunk routes by 2 economically viable passenger operators;</PARA>
<PARA> (g) the need to ensure that air services that are provided over trunk routes are operated as far as possible on a competitive basis;</PARA>
<PARA>They are very fine words, and no one would disagree with them. But what we ask is whether, in determining those principles, the Bill can be carried into effect in the absence of a proper review of all the facts which were revealed in the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares and whether the committee that will review these matters will have the information before it to carry out a major review of costs and the air fares that will subsequently flow from it. The ratios and the comparisons which were made by the Committee indicate that the Committee felt that there were some deficiencies in this area. So when we talk about a major review, we should take into account the competitive nature which the legislation claims to seek to achieve and the efficiency it claims to seek to achieve. I just ask any member on the Government side how that can be done if we do not know what are the financial arrangements in respect of the private operator. That information is not required and has not been provided. This clause does deal with major reviews of air fares. So it seems unbelievable that the Government can take the view that there ought not to be a criterion-such as proposed in our amendment-or a form of words which establishes a principle upon which the review can be carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> I know what will happen to the amendment so I will not labour the point, other than to say that over the years the Senate has claimed, when it wanted to, that it is a place of review of legislation; that the Senate has a role distinctly different from that of the House of Representatives; that the Senate looks at legislation at a more leisurely pace; and that the Senate looks at legislation with a view to whether it carries out the proper functions and objectives of the government of the day. The Senate ought to be more prepared, therefore; I suggest, than the House of Representatives, to examine what is said by the Opposition. But the Government made its decision before it came into this chamber. If Government senators want the Senate to be a party House they should stop the hypocrisy and the cant-the same hypocrisy and cant they used in 1974 and 1975 when they maintained that the Senate was a place to review and to reject the legislation of the government of the day that enjoyed a majority of support in the Australian Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian National Airlines Repeal Bill is a much more important Bill because it seeks to change the status of Trans-Australia Airlines and the procedures under which it operated previously. It seeks to change it from a statutory authority to a public company. This is the first step by the Fraser Government to weaken or destroy the viability of this very important public enterprise. This public enterprise was established very early in the 1950s and was the pride and joy of the Menzies Administration. It is a public enterprise which has even been defended by the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Country Party (Mr Anthony) and many other members of the Parliament, including some honourable senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been a debate about this matter in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. The Opposition's view is publicly known. We are opposed to any suggestion that TAA should be weakened in any way or have its status as a statutory authority changed. We are satisfied with its application as a government-owned airline operating as it does, within the restrictions of the two-airline agreement and with certain impediments to the way in which it operates against its principal rival and competitor, Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. We are satisfied that the Government has not made out a case. This is one of the ad hoc decisions made by the Government in respect of Commonwealth functions. Nothing in the second reading speech in this place of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) or in the other place of the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) would justify the very dramatic change in the way in which this organisation will operate. It appears, superficially, to be an attractive proposition. Many people in the Australian community probably would be attracted to the ideas of participating in a public company operating by buying shares in this organisation, knowing as they do that it has the guarantee and the backing of the Australian Government. That, of course, is not the way in which it necessarily would operate. We have seen the example of the Caltex oil company's decision recently to float itself as an Australian public company. The greatest percentage of the shares in that operation were taken up by the big financial institutions in our country. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Opposition is entitled to fear the motivation of the Fraser Government and is entitled to be concerned about what the Australian Government has in mind. It is a matter of considerable regret and a reflection upon the way in which the Fraser Government operates that a Bill of this consequence has to be dealt with at this late hour of the session. We ought to be able to permit every honourable senator to speak in respect of whether there are pluses or negatives and costs or benefits in this important instrumentality that has been with us from the 1950s to the 1980s, and whether there should be any change in the status of the organisation. One could utilise half an hour to speak about this matter. It is fundamental to the way in which government enterprises should operate. If we were to adopt that course we would interfere with the program and with the rush of legislation and create inconvenience to a great number of honourable senators, who are obviously disregarded by this Government in its attempts to achieve its objectives by the process of exhaustion and elimination. The Government is putting honourable senators in a position where they are not able to exercise their proper rights of examination of legislation and in this case, their proper rights of looking at the ramifications of this piece of legislation. A great number of honourable members in the House of Representatives were able to debate this legislation. Honourable members were able, freely and honestly, to present their point of view. The fact is that we have not had the opportunity to do so in the Senate this afternoon. If we exercise our right to discuss this legislation at length what will happen to the other pieces of legislation? They will be pushed through by use of the gag. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a national disgrace that we should be put in a position that a Bill of such consequence cannot even be dealt with in the normal way of being left over for consideration by the Parliament that was elected in 1980. That Parliament will assume its responsibility in the Senate after 1 July. The Government well knows the reflection of the popular will which was determined at that election. More than half the Australian people did not want to see the Senate put in a position where it could not properly and adequately debate matters. I am about to sit down, not because the Opposition does not have any arguments or that it does not feel strongly enough about this Bill but because I wish to afford a brief opportunity for any other members of the Senate to put his point of view. We are totally opposed to the proposition. We reject it and we protest against the way in which the Government operates in this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the reasons just given by Senator Gietzelt my remarks will be brief, although one could spend considerable time debating the matter. The Australian Democrats will support the Bill as is and will not vote against it. Philosophically, we believe in private enterprise, but we believe that wherever possible private enterprise ought to be kept honest by competition. Therefore we support very strongly the concept of competition between Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Transport Industries, between the Commonwealth Bank and the private banks and between Medibank and the private health funds. In this way the private sector can be kept honest by public involvement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator knows that I am not given to that language. On the other hand I share the misgivings of Senator Gietzelt and the Australian Labor Party concerning a proposition to sell off TAA. We oppose that idea with every vigour we have, but that is not the proposition that is before us today. The proposition before us today is to restructure TAA as a public company. It is extraordinary and almost unbelievable that the Government has not told us how that will be done and who will have the 51 per cent, the 75 per cent or whatever per cent of shares. I find it almost unbelievable that we are asked to vote on a piece of legislation without having the other bits of the package from the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We know that there is a king-sized rift in the Cabinet. Mr Anthony has publicly breached Cabinet solidarity and almost every rule of the Westminster tradition by coming out publicly and giving his views, as Deputy Prime Minister and a member of the Cabinet. His views are opposed to the Cabinet and for such a sin Barry Simon lost his job. Apparently when one is Deputy Prime Minister one is immune to committing the same offence even on more serious grounds. The Australian Democrats support the restructuring of TAA so that it can be a more efficient competitor with Ansett and so that it can keep Ansett honest in a better and more efficient way. </PARA>
<PARA> We oppose any proposition which would allow more than 51 per cent of the shares being sold outside. In other words, we would want at least 51 per cent of the company maintained under government control. The Democrats would like to see the employees of TAA having the first option, under favourable conditions, for the remaining shares. I know that once shares are sold privately loopholes are left for commercial predators to come in and buy large parcels. This is a problem to which I have no answer. I do not know how we can encourage employees of TAA to buy shares in their own company, to protect them from predators and, at the same time, allow the employees of TAA to benefit by capital appreciation. </PARA>

If shares like that were issued on the open market they would be of less value than ordinary shares which would control voting rights. If I am mistaken in that belief I would like to be corrected. With those few remarks the Democrats support the Bill. We have misgivings that it is giving the Government some form of blank cheque. Those misgivings of ours are allayed because, even if this Bill is passed, after 30 June if the Government wants to get up to any nefarious conduct by amending legislation that amended legislation certainly will not pass the Senate unless there has been proper and full-scale debate. On that date the Government will lose control of the Senate and therefore will not be able to rubber stamp any legislation initiated in the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I wish to raise a matter of privilege under Standing Order 426. On Wednesday I asked you a question regarding privilege in relation to access to King's Hall for visitors. You gave me an assurance that a failure to communicate the presence of constituents who wished to see me at that time was an error and would not happen again. With reluctance, I raise a similar issue based on an occurrence this morning at about 11.30 a.m. A constitutent of mine, a Mr Rick Wright, who is in fact, one of the people who were involved earlier and is from the Atom Free Embassy-I wish to make that point-came to see me and asked at the lower King's Hall security barrier if that fact could be communicated to me. That Mr Wright was there and wanted to see me was indeed communicated to my staff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Monaghan, my principal private secretary, went to the King's Hall Senate attendants box, where I believe it is customary for all of us to receive our visitors, to try to find Mr Wright. He received no indication that Mr Wright was apparently being held in the lower area. Mr Wright informs me that while Mr Monaghan was still waiting for him he was told that he must leave and was actually physically removed from the precincts to outside the security barrier by the police. I am not overstressing this matter. I merely wish to have elucidation of it. It is one which involves the privilege of this place. It is quite important that we should be able to receive constituents in King's Hall, as we have always done. I believe that that is a cherished right and an important point. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say that at the time this happened other members of the public were in fact in King's Hall but, for some reason or other, Mr Wright was not permitted to be there. It was known that my staff were looking for him and I would have thought it reasonable that some effort be made to see that he communicated with me. It is a fact that when Mr Wright came to the barrier he was wearing a T shirt indicating that he belonged to the Atom Free Embassy. There are in this country many people who approve of nuclear power. There are many other people who do not approve of nuclear power. Mr Wright is one of their number and I am also. I hope that was not a factor in the way he was treated. I know Mr Wright. He is an extremely respectable person and to my knowledge he has not been associated with any kind of demonstration in this place. He has given me his assurance that he has not and I do not think that he is the sort of person who ever would be. He was certainly not concerned with the demonstrations earlier this week. It is wrong if some people are allowed to come upstairs to King's Hall and others are not. I wish to raise this matter for elucidation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to reinforce, as I believe other honourable senators can, what Senator Mason has said. I can cite other incidents which have involved different people. When I discovered that people who were seeking to see me were not able to contact me, in spite of the fact that I was in the House and was carrying my beeper around with me, I took the necessary steps. I made clear to those in charge that I was available and if anyone wished to see me the attendants should contact me and not take it upon themselves to refuse entry because, according to them, I was not available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was a sharp change today. When people sought to see me they were allowed to come up to the station in King's Hall. The staff there rang me and said that there were four visitors who wished to see me. That delegation was issued with passes and subsequently saw me. However, since 1 o'clock today the situation has changed again. Two other people who wished to see me found difficulty in so doing. It appears that the change has occurred because the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) has made some rather wild statements at the front of Parliament House to the effect that he proposes moving the people from the area concerned and has at his disposal means of doing so, one of which is to turn on the sprinklers. I do not know whether the attendants who are in charge of security have reacted to that and have now begun to adopt a personal attitude, based on that of the Minister, regarding these people who wish to see members of Parliament. Yesterday we tried to debate this matter. Perhaps I did not put my case clearly when the statement was brought down. We were not allowed to debate it except by way of personal explanation. Mr President, you can see the seriousness of the situation that has developed. </PARA>
<PARA> These people are seeking to see their members of parliament. Irrespective of what may have occurred, they are requesting to see their members and to discuss matters with them. I suggested to you, Mr President, when I spoke yesterday that the best way to deal with the matter with which the Parliament is confronted is to allow communication between members of parliament and the people concerned, to make that communication freely available and to encourage it. A number of members of parliament have been doing that. We have started to realise what is at the base of the problem which stirs these women. I would have thought that that would be the best way to deal with it. Yet, we and the people concerned are being frustrated in that communication. In my view that is very much a matter of privilege. </PARA>
<PARA> I am grateful that Senator Mason was able to pinpoint a particular person who was so treated at a specific time. Although that assemblage of tents is not within the precincts of the Parliament, it is at the front of the Parliament. What the Minister for the Capital Territory determines to do is a matter of concern to this Parliament and to the Presiding Officers. If there is any attempt to move those people, a situation similar to that which occurred in King's Hall will occur again. Surely no one here wants a repeat of that situation. I think that common sense ought to prevail and that those people ought to be allowed free communication with the Parliament and ought to be allowed to remain where they are until such time as the Parliament rises. If we do not do that, we will face next week-that is an important week in this Parliament because of the various legislation to be dealt with and because of the time factor-another confrontation, another issue which will disturb the program. I appeal to Ministers who have some control over the Minister for the Capital Territory--</PARA>

At the present time they are engaged in legitimate communications with their members of parliament and they should not be frustrated. Perhaps I have said more than I intended to say. To my mind it is a matter of privilege. If any attendant or security officer, even at the highest level, attempts to frustrate one of my constituents who seeks to see me in this place, I will take the matter further. I will move a substantive motion in this place and will refer the person concerned, no matter what position he occupies-he may be a police officer at a high level or any other person-to the Privileges Committee so that we can thrash out the whole matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to refer briefly to the Freedom of Information Bill. I will not be able to participate further in debate on this Bill because it has not come on in the Senate this week. As the Senate knows, I will be departing from Australia today. So far as this Bill is concerned, I wish to raise a matter of particular concern. I have expressed concern about this matter since this Bill came on for debate. There is in the continuing debate a further clause in the Freedom of Information Bill that I would have supported if I had been here in the chamber. Amendments Nos 39, 40, 43 and 44 seek to insert public interest clauses in the exemptions to the Bill. That those clauses would have gone in and would have limited the exemptions seemed to me to be highly desirable. I certainly would have voted for them. I would have voted for them also because it is my belief and my clear understanding that these amendments would have been adopted by the Government and were acceptable and were the subject of an agreement between Government senators and the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That was my clear understanding of the situation but that appears to be a disputed matter. I say dogmatically and without bringing proof before the Senate that it was my understanding, of course, that the Government has had some objection to public interest clauses in the past. It was certainly my further understanding that this was not the arrangement made with the Government for amendments. It was not until last Friday morning that I discovered that there was indeed continued objection, in principle, to this. Three of those amendments have been defeated and one is still to be voted on. I want to indicate that I would have supported that fourth amendment. I may well have not been prepared to vote for the third reading of the Bill because of the substantial loss which this does make. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise that it is not the understanding of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) that that is the situation. Therefore, there has been a breakdown in understanding among various honourable senators on this side of the chamber. I have accepted in good faith a package of amendments as I understood them. I also do not believe that in that way I was eccentric because I believed that my colleagues who, likewise, were negotiating with the Government were of the same view and that was part of the package deal of amendments. In our view, it is indeed an inadequate package. The Bill will be a flawed Bill when it passes through this chamber. Nonetheless, it would be a Bill, particularly with those amendments-I refer to the four amendments in dispute-which would have been quite adequate to start working for freedom of information in this country. In the next year or two, we could contemplate the success or otherwise of it and then this Parliament could make changes that may be necessary to strengthen it where it is found to be inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I indicate that I recognise the undertaking which the Attorney-General gave to this chamber after this misunderstanding was revealed last Friday. Indeed, he said he recognised the strong feelings which honourable senators had on this subject in relation to these particular clauses. He said he would take these matters back to Cabinet before the Bill goes into the other Hosue. I trust that that will be so and I trust that it will be reported back to us. I trust also that some consideration will be given, even in a limited form, to adopting the public interest clauses as some limit upon the extent to which agencies can make decisions because they are not helpful to them and where in fact an overriding public interest might be regarded as a factor to be considered before that objection is sustained. There are even more limited areas in which public interest could well be incorporated in those clauses. What I really wanted to say was that this is the attitude which I would adopt if I were here in this chamber. I do not imagine for one moment that it would have any effect on the course of events and the voting on the legislation. I think that a problem like this arises partly because of the chaotic conditions and the program with which we have to deal because so many things are happening at the end of the session. I hope that this will not occur in future years but that we will have a more orderly program so that people are not overcome by exhaustion or the flow of events which give rise to these complete misunderstandings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Gietzelt might want to take that up later. I know that Senator Gietzelt intended to speak on the local government tax sharing Bill. Provided Senator Gietzelt can do that in this debate, that should be acceptable. The Bill to which I am speaking is the Bill concerning revenue sharing and health grants to the States. These matters were the subject of a Premiers Conference early last month, out of which grew incidents which revealed the very ugly face of the Fraser Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Government had decided to apply a fiscal strangle to the States in 1981-82. He boasted of his toughness with the States but, following the Monday night meeting, a suggestion appeared in certain quarters of the media that actually the Government and the Prime Minister had not been as tough as they would like people to believe they had been, which apparently damaged the Prime Minister's macho self-image. He then instructed the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to give what has become known under this Government as a background briefing to selected representatives of the media. That background briefing evidently was not as effective as the Prime Minister hoped it would be. It did not build up his macho self-image to the degree that he wanted. So the Prime Minister himself next night decided to give a background briefing to other members of the media. The background briefing under this Government, of course, has become standard Prime Ministerial equipment for misleading the Press and the public in a fashion for which the Government is not accountable. </PARA>
<PARA> This time the security broke down and he was caught with his pants down, to borrow a phrase. Highly damaging interviews with both the Treasurer and the Prime Minister were recorded by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, among others. The response from the Prime Minister's chief Press Secretary, Mr David Barnett, in particular, but also others, was to storm the offices of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and to attempt to stand over the officers of the Australian Broadcasting Commission threatening, in one instance at least, that their careers would be finished if those interviews went to air. That revealed the real face of the Fraser Government in contrast to the phoney face of the Fraser Government which Senator Baume presented in a debate earlier today, mouthing pious platitudes about the need to maintain the independence of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. That is the phoney public face of the Fraser Government. The real face of the Fraser Government was shown by David Barnett and others on the afternoon of, I think, 6 May when they behaved like storm troopers, storming the ABC offices, bullying and, in one instance, threatening members of the ABC about censoring the news-that is what the exercise was about; it was an exercise in censoring the news, in Stalinism-and saying that if they went ahead and discharged their duty as journalists and as employees of the ABC and reported the news, their careers with the ABC would be finished. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;David Barnett was the leader of the pack. He was the chief storm trooper. That is the real face of the Fraser Government. Even more important than the sneaky and sordid media manipulation by the Prime Minister and his Press officer is that, as a consequence of the self-indulgence of the Prime Minister in giving that background briefing in which he told journalists that the State Premiers were mugs and could have got an extra $70m if they had not been such mugs, the Commonwealth will be in an untenable position in all future negotiations with the States. Never again will the Commonwealth be believed when it presents a financial offer to the States. The State Premiers and Treasurers inevitably will say: 'Do not give us that. Come on, what is your real offer? You do not really mean that, do you? We rememer what you did last time. You went tittle-tattling to the Press the next night and said that we were mugs to accept what you offered and that we could have got more.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not very dignified and it sets a dreadful precedent. As long as this Government remains in office, the Commonwealth will be in a untenable position in every financial negotiation with the States. Equally intriguing, I think, are the glimpses of the Prime Minister's personality which the incident provided for us. The first thing it revealed was his fundamental insecurity in the office that he holds. A Prime Minister who was secure and confident in that job would not feel any compulsion to boost his macho self-image every day by proving he was tougher than everybody else-a basic insecurity, of course, which is well merited by the circumstances in which he finds himself. The second was his appalling judgment. Those matters must worry even the most amoral members of his party, as will his subsequent capitulation when he offered an extra $16m as a form of hush money to the Premier of Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill fixes the amount of money for general purpose grants to the States and the Northern Territory for 1981-82. That amount is already fixed. The Bill provides that the ratio between that amount and the total Commonwealth taxation in 1980-81, which in fact is something over 99 per cent of total Commonwealth taxation, will determine grants for 1982-83 and beyond. The percentage or ratio which will establish the grants for all the States in any one year will be the ratio between Commonwealth payments in the next financial year and total Commonwealth taxation in this financial year. That ratio, in establishing the payment to a State in a particular financial year, will be applied to Commonwealth tax collections in the previous financial year. I know that sounds terribly complicated, but that is the way it is. The tax cuts after this year, because of those arrangements, will be to the extent of 20 per cent or thereabouts at State expense. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides that any surcharge or rebate subsequently allowed on Commonwealth taxation will not be allowed for in this calculation. We can certainly forget the latter, the rebate, but I note that this legislation provides an opportunity for the Commonwealth, should it choose to do so, to declare that Commonwealth tax rates are halved in a financial year and then impose a 100 per cent surcharge and raise the same amount of revenue. The catch would be that the States would get only half as much of the income tax component of the total taxation that they would otherwise have got. I am not suggesting that that is likely to happen. Even under this Government that would be an extreme case. Nevertheless, we have had tax surcharges imposed before by the Fraser Government. We are unlikely, to say the least, to get any tax rebates. Any tax surcharges imposed in the future will disadvantage the States to a greater extent than the Bill appears on the face of it to do. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is appropriate to give a brief survey of Commonwealth-State financial relations through most of the 1970s. In 1973 an Act was passed by the then Australian Labor Party Government which established a base level of payments to the States and provided for future adjustments by a formula which added on to the previous year's payment increases in wages which, I stress, are normally ahead of increases in the consumer price index. It added increases in wages not increases in the CPI. It added population changes, which invariably were increases upwards, and multiplied the product of that sum by 101.5 over 100. In other words, it increased it further by 1 1/2 per cent. The 1975 Act compensated for wage increases and population growth and increased the 1.5 per cent betterment factor to 3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1976 the present Government substituted for that arrangement legislation which provided a percentage of the current year's income tax to the States. In 1977 it modified that percentage and related it to the income tax received by the Commonwealth in the previous year. By 1977 even the more innumerate State Premiers had realised that that arrangement was less generous to them than the previous arrangement had been and they prevailed upon the Fraser Government to ensure that any State had the option of claiming its financial entitlement either under the 1977 Act or under the previous Act passed by the Labor Government in 1975. In other words, the net of the Labor Government legislation was put underneath all the States. In fact, in recent years, it was that net which determined the actual level of payments. </PARA>
<PARA> Those arrangements continued until the financial year 1979-80. With an election looming, the Government decided that the most politically expedient thing to do was to extend that level of payment for one further year, that is, until after the election, always, of course, with the intention of subsequently squeezing the States financially, which it has now done. The Government did that, I stress, in spite of an unequivocal promise given by the Minister for National Development and Energy, Senator Carrick-I am pleased to notice that he is in the chamber and I remind him yet again of the unequivocal promise he made-on 27 April 1976 that payments to the States in real terms would increase in the next three years by more than they had done in the three years of the Labor Government. I have a table which will show just how that promise was not kept. </PARA>
<PARA> That unequivocal guarantee from Senator Carrick in April 1976 casts some reflections upon the much less equivocal guarantees allegedly to be given at some time in the future by, as yet, unnamed Government Ministers concerning airlines policy and the two airlines agreement, guarantees which, to my very great surprise, Senator Rae naively accepted last night. Shortly I will seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which shows total Commonwealth payments to the States from 1972-73 to 1980-81, the final figure, of course, being an estimate both in current prices and constant prices and as a percentage of Commonwealth taxation. That table clearly shows that during the three years of Labor Government the amounts paid to the States, expressed both as a percentage of total Commonwealth taxation and in constant value dollars, increased very substantially. They then went on a declining trend in both instances-as a percentage of total Commonwealth taxation and in real terms under the Fraser Government-a trend which has continued until 1980-81 and which will intensify in the next financial year because the general purpose payments to the States are to be increased under this Bill by only 9 per cent. The rate of inflation-that is, according to increases in the CPI-for the next financial year is anticipated by almost everyone to be in the vicinity of 11 per cent and wage increases, which are more important to the States than increases in the consumer price index, have increased even more. </PARA>
<PARA> The arrangements under the 1975 Act have been described by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister, amongst others, as too generous. Frankly, I am inclined to agree with them but that does not exonerate Senator Carrick, Mr Fraser and all of those senior Ministers who, in 1975 and 1976 made irresponsible promises to increase payments to the States above the level prevailing in 1974 and 1975 which they now describe as being too generous. I repeat, anyone who accepts an unequivocal guarantee from a senior Minister of this Government has a penchant for taking a gamble. Anyone who accepts a non-equivocal guarantee to be given at some time in the future by some unnamed Minister is culpably naive. </PARA>
<PARA> Regarding the provisions for health services grants to the States, I shall not deal with that matter in detail because it will be dealt with at some subsequent stage by Senator Grimes. I shall make a few general observations. Firstly, these changes will not save Commonwealth revenue. In fact, the net cost to the Commonwealth as a result of these changes will increase by something like $340m. It will not be shown on the Budget Papers as that because the major additional cost incurred by the Commonwealth is, of course, the tax concession. It is more costly to the Commonwealth because it provides hidden subsidies for private health funds, private hospitals and fee for service medicine-primarily general practitioners and hospital and surgery consultations. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, in fact, a direct subsidy from the Commonwealth for all medical services covered by the insurance scheme of 30 per cent of the standard fee and a hidden indirect subsidy by way of a taxation concession equal to 32 per cent of the insurance premium. So, in fact, the Commonwealth is paying more than 50 per cent of all those doctors bills which will be covered by these proposed arrangements. This is not free enterprise medicine. This is medicine subsidised by more than 50 per cent from the public purse. Even more obnoxious, of course, is the fact that any citizen taxpayer who declines to join one of the so-called voluntary, private funds will be denied that Commonwealth subsidy, both the direct subsidy and also the taxation concession which is available for private insurance. In other words, what the arrangements do and what they are designed to do is to provide a captive market for the private health funds, to subsidise or guarantee the incomes of members of the Australian Medical Association and, of course, to subsidise and encourage the expansion of the private hospital system at a time when in most States we already have surplus aggregate hospital capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from all the grubby politics, this policy is based on the fiscal deterrent theory-that is, that if people actually have to pay for medical services they will not over-use them and if they do not have to pay for them they will over-use them. The theory, of course, is cancelled by the corollary that goes with it in the policy, that is, private insurance, because once a person is privately insured he does not pay the fee anyway. So there is a fundamental contradiction between the policy and the theory upon which it is based. Even overlooking that basic contradiction, the policy also ignores the fact that demand is determined, for really expensive medical services such as hospitalisation, surgery and sophisticated treatment, not by the patient but by the doctors.

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>As enunciated in its policies, the Government is committed to the protection of the Australian marine environment. The Government has pursued the implementation of this policy on both the national and international fronts by participating in consultations aimed at producing agreed measures for the prevention and control of marine pollution. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill which is now before you is to control marine pollution through dumping and incineration, by implementing the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, together with amendments to the convention introduced in 1978 and 1980. The need for a convention to control the dumping of wastes at sea was recognised in 1971 by the first meeting of the preparatory committee for the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. As a result of support expressed at this meeting the convention was finalised in 1972. It has been in force internationally since 1975, with some 45 countries now being a party to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The control of marine pollution through dumping and Australian ratification of the convention has been the subject of detailed discussions with the States and the Northern Territory in various forums, including the Australian Environment Council, the Solicitors-General committee, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and the Premiers Conference. These detailed discussions have paved the way for the Commonwealth Government to introduce this Bill to control and in some instances prevent, the transport of wastes to sea for the purposes of disposal. This Bill, which has been developed in the spirit of co-operative federalism, takes full account of international, national and State interests. The Bill, which repeals the beaches, Fishing Grounds and Sea Routes Protection Act 1932-1961 will enable Australia to formalise the existing voluntary arrangements dealing with dumping by the establishment of regulatory machinery which will:</PARA>
<PARA>Prohibit the dumping of wastes or other matter listed in annex I to the convention, which include organohalogen, mercury and cadmium compounds, plastics, hydrocarbons and high level radioactive waste;</PARA>
<PARA>Regulate through the prior issuing of a special permit the dumping of wastes or other matter listed in annex II to the convention, which includes bulky objects, wastes containing significant amounts of heavy metals and low-level radioactive material;</PARA>
<PARA>Regulate the dumping of all other wastes or matter through the prior issuing of a general permit;</PARA>
<PARA>Ensure formal consideration of all factors listed in annex III to the convention concerning criteria governing the issue of permits;</PARA>
<PARA>Ensure the condition of the sea for the purposes of the convention is properly monitored. </PARA>
<PARA>The regulatory machinery provided by this Bill will apply to Australian vessels, aircraft or platforms believed to be engaged in dumping and vessels and aircraft loading in Australia or in Australian waters matter which is to be dumped. In line with the 1978 amendment to the convention the Bill also applies to incineration at sea carried out by any vessels in Australian waters, by Australian platforms and by Australian vessels in any part of the sea. The Bill does not apply to the operational discharge of wastes from vessels, aircraft or platforms. This matter is covered by other international conventions many of which have been implemented in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> For the purposes of this Bill, Australian waters is defined to include the territorial sea of Australia and the external territories and any sea that is on the landward side of the territorial sea, other than any part of the sea that is within the limits of a State or the Northern Territory. This is to ensure that a legal vacuum does not occur for the control of dumping inside the territorial sea of Australia. The definition of Australian waters also includes an area of the sea on the seaward side of the territorial sea of Australia or the territorial sea of an external territory that is declared to be Australian waters by the regulations. This provision will allow the Government to move swiftly to extend the jurisdiction of the Bill to take account of developments in the International Control of Marine Pollution. Clause 9 of the Bill gives effect to the agreement reached at the June 1980 Premiers Conference. It makes provision for the States and the Northern Territory to control dumping in the coastal waters under their own legislation implementing the provisions of the dumping convention, if they so desire. Naturally it will be necessary to establish consultative arrangements between the Commonwealth, States and the Northern Territory to consider the environmental consequences of proposed dumping operations, wherever they might occur. </PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 13 and 14 set out the penalties for an offence for dumping, loading or incinerating of wastes or other matter otherwise than in accordance with a permit. As set out in clause 17 of the Bill, in the case where the Commonwealth has incurred expenses or other liabilities in repairing or remedying any condition resulting from dumping in contravention of the Bill, the person convicted of the offence is liable for expenses. </PARA>
<PARA> In keeping with Australia's participation in the development and implementation of international conventions the enactment of this Bill will enable Australia to accede to the dumping convention. The legislation, by opening the way for Australia to become party to the convention will formalise our own national arrangements to control marine pollution through dumping as agreed between the Commonwealth, States and Northern Territory as part of the off-shore settlement. In addition, Australia's international standing with regard to proposals by other countries to dispose of wastes by dumping at sea will be strengthened. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Government's decision, announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on 30 April 1981, that concurrently with the abolition of the Prices Justification Tribunal, a Petroleum Product Pricing Authority would be established for the maintenance of the Government's petroleum product pricing policy. The Petroleum Product Pricing Authority proposed by this Bill will take over from the PJT the specific responsibility for price surveillance of the petroleum products industry. The Authority will have substantially fewer staff than the PJT but will have powers similar to those that the PJT now has in relation to the prices of petroleum products. Surveillance of the prices of the industry will extend only to defined petroleum products and to services related to the production or supply of such products. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the creation of an office of Commissioner for Petroleum Products Pricing. The Commissioner can also hold simultaneously, if necessary, the office of full time member of the Temporary Assistance Authority. Provision is also made for the appointment of Associate Commissioners for the purposes of particular inquiries. The Minister's direction or approval will be required before an inquiry can be conducted by the Authority. Inquiries by the Authority will not necessarily be confined to the justification of particular prices. It will also be able to undertake inquiries of a more general nature relating to the prices of petroleum products or associated services. </PARA>
<PARA> The companies which will be required to notify the Authority of proposed price increases are those companies which are declared by the Minister by notice published in the Gazette. Where a proposed increase is to be subjected to an inquiry, the Authority will be able to withhold the increase or grant an interim increase pending the outcome of the inquiry. The Minister will have the power to give directions to the Authority on matters which should be given special consideration. Confidentiality of material submitted by companies will be adequately protected under the provisions of clauses 26 and 37 of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for appropriate surveillance of petroleum product prices, bearing in mind that these prices have been affected sharply in recent years by world-wide increases in crude oil prices. The legislation has been framed to ensure that the activities of the Authority have due regard to the interest of the industry and those of the community as a whole. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I make a brief statement in relation to the inquiry of the Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations into the Australian Dairy Corporation. In view of the time, I seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard. It is an approved statement of a bipartisan Committee. I will ensure that copies of it are available and distributed to honourable senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Two submissions to the inquiry, from the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation and the New South Wales Dairy Farmers Association, have been publicly released without the authorisation of the Committee. Apparently the submissions were released by the organisations themselves. Neither organisation sought the Committee's approval to release the submissions. As honourable senators will be aware, the publication of these documents is a prima facie breach of Standing Order 308. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee accepts the explanation of the organisations that they were unaware of the provisions of the Standing Order when they released their submissions and will take no action other than to draw the attention of the organisations to the existence of the Standing Order. </PARA>
<PARA> At a meeting on Wednesday last the Committee formally decided to authorise the public release of the submissions. This decision was taken in order to overcome the problem of the breach and to avoid any suggestion that the Committee was attempting to inhibit public debate on the inquiry or to prevent some interested parties' views, especially those critical of the Committee's proceedings, from being aired. </PARA>
<PARA> One effect of Standing Order 308 is to protect witnesses who wish their submissions to remain confidential to the Committee against their unauthorised release. The Standing Order also is in line with common Committee practice whereby submissions are not released until witnesses appear at a public hearing after which the submissions are incorporated in a Hansard transcript of the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> The two organisations concerned in this case were happy to release their submissions and therefore did not desire the protection afforded by Standing Order 308. So far as the practice of this Committee is concerned we have decided that in such cases, where the organisation providing a submission in happy for it to be released, and where further evidence is unlikely to be taken at a public hearing, the submission will be publicly released as soon as it is received, unless there are strong reasons for the contrary. For example, in the past, Senate committees have not released submissions because they appeared to be solely designed to use the cloak of parliamentary privilege in order to make defamatory statements. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to take the opportunity, Mr President, to comment on some other actions of the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation. The Committee noted reported comments made in Melbourne last week by the President of the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation, Mr J. F. Bennett. He is reported to have said that the ADFF had not been asked to make a submission on the inquiry into the Australian Dairy Corporation and its associated overseas companies until after the public hearings had finished and the first draft of the report had been written. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the facts of the matter are:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee advertised in the national Press in early March 1980 seeking submissions on its general terms of reference governing the oversight of statutory authorities within which the inquiry on the ADC is being conducted. The ADFF did not make a submission as a result of this advertisement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee commenced correspondence specifically with the ADFF in September 1980 to obtain preliminary background information on the ADC inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee formally invited a submission from the ADFF on 24 March 1981. Public hearings had not closed at that stage. The most recent public hearing was held on 20 May 1981. The Committee will hold further hearings if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The first draft of the report had not been commenced on 24 March 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The ADFF was well aware of the existence of the inquiry from its commencement on 20 November 1980. The Committee had been in constant contact with the ADC, which numbers among its members the President and Deputy President of the ADFF. On 7 December 1980 the Deputy Chairman of the ADFF was approached to give evidence on the inquiry and he appeared at a public hearing on 12 February 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The ADFF did not make any request to appear before the Committee, to make a submission to the Committee or to have an observer at the public hearings of the Committee until after the Committee's letter of 24 March 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>Senate adjourned at 4.1 p.m. </PARA>
