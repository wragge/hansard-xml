<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, it is with deep regret that I have to inform the Senate of the death on 30 March this year of the Honourable Sir Alexander Russell Downer, K.B.E. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death on 30 March 1981 of the Honourable Sir Alexander Russell Downer, Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, a member of the House of Representatives for the division of Angas from 1949 to 1964, a Minister of the Crown from 1958 to 1963 and Australian High Commissioner in London from 1964 to 1972; and that the Senate places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>Alexander Russell Downer was born in 1910, 10 years after the birth of the Commonwealth of Australia itself. His father, Sir John Downer, was one of the founders of this Commonwealth as well as being a Premier of South Australia. Alec Downer followed with conviction and dedication in the tradition of political life and service to the community. He was educated both in Australia and in England. He took the degrees of Master of Arts and Diploma of Economics and Political Science at Oxford University. He was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple in London in 1934 and was admitted to the South Australian Bar in 1935. In 1940 he enlisted as a gunner in the Australian Imperial Force. He went to Singapore on active service in 1941 and was reported missing. He spent some three and a half years as a prisoner of war at the Changi camp until the recapture of Singapore in 1945. It is greatly to the credit of Alec Downer, and a tribute to his character, that a major effect of his experience from those years was a strengthened belief in the value of closer international co-operation. </PARA>
<PARA> He entered this Parliament as member for the division of Angas in 1949 and was returned successfully in the next five elections. He served with distinction on a considerable number of parliamentary committees and was well known, well respected and greatly liked as a member of parliament. He had close friends on both sides of the House and there was widespread appreciation of his work both on the back bench and as a Minister. He became Minister for Immigration in 1958 and served in that portfolio until 1963. He worked devotedly and effectively as Minister for Immigration, travelling to the United Kingdom and Europe and also to the United States of America to discuss various issues concerning immigration. It will doubtless be recorded as a tribute to his work in that portfolio that the late Mr Arthur Calwell took the opportunity to say how pleased he was both with Alec Downer's appointment to it and with the way in which he handled it. Alec Downer resigned from this Parliament on 23 April 1964 in order to take up the position of Australia's High Commissioner in London. On the occasion of his resignation the late Sir Robert Menzies said of him:</PARA>
<PARA> He is an extraordinarily popular member of this House and he will take to London with him a great background of tradition. He is a man of high education, of wide information, of great courtesy and with an uncommon capacity for getting on with people and presenting his views . . . without forfeiting friendship. </PARA>
<PARA>Sir Robert went on to say how ideal were the qualifications and attributes of Alexander Downer for the post he was shortly to take up in London, and that proved to be right. </PARA>
<PARA> He was made a Knight Commander of the British Empire in 1965. His term of office in London was extended three times, and it was he who insisted that the third renewal must be the last. He was a great believer in the link between Australia and Great Britain. His period of office in London was a time during which considerable adjustments were made to some aspects of that link as the United Kingdom moved into the European Economic Community. He had his own views about that move and about its implications. Throughout this whole period he was a great ambassador for Australia. During his entire period of office in the United Kingdom he used his position and his private resources to further as much as he could the interests of Australia. He was, of course, a great lover of both Australia and England, but it was Australia in which he chose to live at the end of his period of office in London. He had had a fine career. Much was promised and much given. He was grateful for his life and for his service. </PARA>
<PARA> I first met Alec Downer some 38 years ago when I came to Changi Gaol. He was there as Sergeant Downer in charge of education. At Changi he had developed the job of keeping high the morale and the interests of those who were sick and those who were wounded by the vision he could create, by the information he could disseminate. I knew him over the journey of the 38 years. He was, as I have described, a person of quiet dignity and massive integrity, a very likable man, and very fortunate in his wife and his family. I have been proud to call him a friend. I think that all those on either side of politics who knew Alec would call him friend. They would have respected his views and his outlook, and he himself knew the meaning of friendship. This therefore is a time of particular sadness for his family. To his wife Mary-a magnificent woman, if I may say so, who gave him immense support and dedication, particularly in recent months during his long illness-and to his children Stella, Angela, Una and Alexander, we extend our deep sympathy at this time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition, I would like to associate the Opposition with the remarks made by Senator Carrick relating to the late Sir Alexander Downer. He was, by all accounts, a very decent man who was widely respected on both sides of polities. As Senator Carrick has indicated, Sir Alexander followed a long and distinguished career in public life and community service which undoubtedly put him in the category of being a very great and distinguished Australian. Although I did not know him personally, I think it is true to say that, from the observation of my colleagues, he was in politics a man capable of great generosity of spirit and flexibility of ideas. As he grew older he did not necessarily become more rigid in his ideas, as some of us tend to do, but remained very flexible to his approaches to issues as they developed. We share the sentiments expressed by the Leader of the Government in the Senate in a general sense, and join with the Government in extending our sympathy to his wife and family.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to associate the National Country Party with this condolence motion and offer our very sincere sympathy to the wife and family of Sir Alexander Downer. I did not have the good fortune to know Sir Alexander Downer personally, but he was widely and well known. There can be no shadow of doubt that he was well received and accepted in the community in which he moved. I am absolutely sure that Sir Alexander Downer was a distinguished Australian who served his country fully in peace and war. As the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) noted, Sir Alexander Downer had a distinguished academic career at school and university. Indeed, he knew the privations of three and a half years as a prisoner of war in Changi. Sir Alexander mirrored the concern and the capacity of his father in a long and distinguished political career. When that career came to a close he continued to represent this country very favourably indeed as Australian High Commissioner in London. He served his country well. He died in his home and beloved city of Adelaide. To Sir Alexander's widow and family, on behalf of the NCP I offer our very sincere sympathy.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Australian Democrats I join in this condolence motion concerning Sir Alexander Downer. I knew him. I served in the Parliament with him. There are very few people-the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator John Carrick, is one-who have suffered being a prisoner of war. Those of us who have not had that experience will never be able to know the effect that has on a man. Only those who suffered will ever know. Notwithstanding that, I found Alec Downer a most generous man-generous of spirit and generous nature. That is to his extra credit. I also know his widow and, like Senator Carrick, have an unbounded admiration for her. The Australian Democrats send her and the family our sympathy.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to be associated with the motion of condolence in connection with the death of Sir Alexander Downer. I want also to pay tribute to his life and service to his State and to his country. I think I speak this afternoon in the name of my parliamentary colleagues on this side of the chamber. Mr President, in particular I speak on your behalf as your position does not allow you to take part in speeches in this way. Sir, as you were, I think, his neighbour in recent years, you came to know him very well. Along with others I served in this Parliament with Sir Alexander Downer when he was the member for Angas. Indeed, Sir Alexander was the first member for Angas following its re-establishment in 1948.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I recall with appreciation my association with Sir Alec, as a colleague of the same party and as a parliamentary colleague and, of course, as a fellow South Australian. I also knew him in his capacity as Minister for Immigration in times, we will recall, of somewhat unusual difficulty. He administered the Department of Immigration extremely well and to the lasting benefit not only of this country but also of the people whose lives his Department affected. Later I was to have an involvement in the area of immigration and my association took on a special value when Sir Alec became the Australian High Commissioner in London. So it was from those positions that one was able to observe and to benefit from his quite remarkable talent, his singular forward-thinking and his political ability, together with his very strong national outlook. As he acknowledged, he was an interesting blend of the conservative and the radical. In meetings that we in politics have, meetings on public platforms and in conversation, and meetings in his homes both in South Australia and in England, I had personal and public experiences which I remember today with very great appreciation. </PARA>
<PARA> Alec Downer was a man who was richly endowed. His family had been in South Australia since 1838. His was an endowment rich in family tradition and inheritence. He bore a distinguished name and a whole host of distinguished characteristics. He was a man of very wide culture. Australia has benefited from all these things. His own father, Sir John Downer, was a member of the first Senate in 1901 and, indeed, was one of the writers of the Australian Constitution. Later, as years passed, Sir Alec was a member of this Parliament and was part of a parliamentary committee that undertook a major review of the Constitution, which review, as he so often reminded us, has not received very much attention since then. </PARA>
<PARA> His quite extraordinary life touched the lives of many other people. It touched the lives, as the Leader of the Government in the Senate has said, of his comrades in the prisoner-of-war camps. It touched the lives of colleagues and friends in the various Commonwealth societies to which he was so devoted and in which he served. It touched the lives of leaders of British life while Sir Alec was Australian High Commissioner in London. It touch the lives of staff members, Commonwealth drivers and others whom we know and who will be remembering him today. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Alec Downer always wanted to make a significant contribution to the public life and to the political life of this country. So, we are grateful today that the years, his experience and opportunity enabled him to do just that. This afternoon we extend our regards and our sympathy to Mary-Lady Downer-their son and their three daughters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to be associated with the condolence motion before the Senate relating to the late Sir Alexander Downer. Sir Alexander entered this Parliament in 1949 as the member for Angas just three years after I was elected to represent Tasmania in 1946. So, I can claim that we were contemporaries in the early post-war brigade. On every occasion that I made contact with him I found him to be an exceptionally kindly and gentlemanly person. We often reminisced on our common experiences as prisoners of war. Sir Alexander spoke of his experiences in Changi and I spoke of mine in Stalag Luft III. We often spoke particularly of the number of dinners that we went without. We had many more dinner times than dinners. That was one of our standing jokes. Senator Carrick, too, would well have been able to join in these conversations about the way we had to scavenge for food. It was a very great and testing experience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sir Alexander had tasted the bitters and the sweets of life and had scaled the heights and tested the depths. These experiences, I am cetain, were reflected in the mature way that he approached both his parliamentary life and his diplomatic life as Australian High Commissioner in London. In war and peace, Sir Alexander served his country, his State and the people of Australia with great ability, sincerity and dignity. To his wife, Mary, and his family I join other honourable senators in offering my very sincere sympathy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, relates to some recent discussion regarding the Government Information Unit and the use of that Unit. By way of preface I draw the Minister's attention to statements made by Government spokesmen in 1976 that the Government's new media information unit was not like the previous Government's Australian Government Liaison Service. I refer to the statement made in 1976 to the effect that the difference between the two bodies is that the new body will not have a journalistic component and it will not telex information to radio, television and the print media, as did its predecessor. I ask the Minister: Is it not a fact that the Government Information Unit has a journalistic component and that almost all its senior employees are journalists? Does the Government Information Unit telex information directly to the media? Does it not in fact use more sophisticated means of transmitting government information such as audio tapes? Further, does this mean that, on the Government's own standards established in 1976, the Government Information Unit is in fact a propaganda unit as the AGLS was so described?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last part of the question asked whether the Government Information Unit is a propaganda unit. The answer is emphatically no. In 1976 when this Government came to office-indeed, Senator Button mentioned the comparison yesterday-I think it was true that the previous Whitlam Government had for every Minister a Press officer and staff, and indeed it had public relations units in the various States. Some five or six of our 26 or 27 Ministers have Press officers. So we have some 20 Press officers fewer. I do not have a Press officer and I am a senior Minister. The fact of the matter is that there has been a very great reduction in the size of the public relations units. The Government Information Unit does have a government information officer in each State.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Government Information Unit is designed to assist Ministers in providing information to the public about public services, benefits and programs. This is consistent with the Government's responsibility to inform potential clients of its activities. In the Government's view this is a proper and necessary service to taxpayers. In fact, government has a duty to inform the public of the decisions and actions of government. there is a vast difference between a huge propaganda machine which the Whitlam Government was and the Wran Government is and what is a--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I am terribly grateful for the help. Nothing could emphasise the contrast more than the interjections. The Government Information Unit is also structured to keep the Government informed of developing issues at State level, which is a perfectly appropriate initiative in a federal system. There has been a modest provision of resources to carry out these activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the specific situation, yes, the Unit does have persons with journalistic training. There is a telex in the Sydney office of the Government Information Unit. I have no doubt that over the years the Unit has moved toward more sophisticated machinery to carry out its work. The fact is that these people are doing a bona fide job in a modest way, on modest expenditure. There is no competition at all compared with the huge machines of the past and particularly the size of the propaganda machine of the Wran Government or a government similar to it with massive expenditure of public money. By contrast, this Unit is a very modest undertaking.</PARA>

She asked a question about the contributions by this Government to the local government sector and the extent to which they have increased. I am able to advise the honourable senator that in the last Whitlam Budget local government received just under $80m from the Commonwealth and that in the following year the Fraser Government first introduced a fixed share of personal income tax collections for local government. That year local government received 1.52 per cent of personal income tax collections, which amounted to $140m. This in fact was almost double the previous year's budgetary subvention. In 1979-80, in keeping with an election promise, we increased that percentage of personal income tax collections from 1.52 per cent to 1.75 per cent, which increased funding from $140m to $221m. Of course in the 1980-81 financial year we took the local government share to 2 per cent of all personal income tax collections. In this financial year local government will receive directly from the Commonwealth some $300m. I think the point made by the honourable senator is very clearly understood, that local government has been in receipt of large and increasing amounts from us on a fixed proposition. The Federal Government provides local government in each State with much greater capacity than it has ever had before.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is it not a fact that recent shorter working-hour sweetheart agreements between some industries and the unions have shown that tariff protection has enabled these industries to be profitable, notwithstanding their inefficiency, as demonstrated by their ability now to absorb a reduction of 12.5 per cent in working hours or an increase of 21 per cent in the cost of their labour?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is a simple and well acknowledged economic fact that if industry is not competitive then jobs will be lost, and increases in the costs of industry, from whatever cause, are likely to cause loss of employment opportunities. I would have thought that what the honourable senator put in his question is self-evident and true, namely, that if a company is able to enter into sweetheart deals with a trade union which ensure considerable improvements in the condition of those workers without any change in productivity, that is an indication that there are profit margins in that company which might belie the need for protection which the company might be publicly claiming that it needs through the tariff system.</PARA></TALK.START>

As to the Ministry, it has been the practice since the Fraser Government came to office in late 1975 for all Ministers to disclose by way of confidential document their pecuniary interests to the Prime Minister. It is a well-accepted universal practice for a Minister, when a discussion is taking place in Cabinet on a particular matter, to indicate to Cabinet any pecuniary interest that he or his family may have. This is done and is accepted as being done. In future, of course, there will be a need for all members of parliament, whether they are Ministers or back benchers, when taking part in a debate to disclose before the debate whether they have an interest in the matter in hand.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator has allied his question with a question asked a few minutes ago by Senator Lewis. It contains assertions which are consistent with the assertions put by way of explanation in the earlier question. The question is, however, based on a premise which is now out of date, namely, that ICI will not be proceeding with its development plans. It is my understanding that it is in fact proceeding with those plans; hence the conditions which apparently applied yesterday do not apply today. I understand that a statement has been made by the company-certainly, the Government welcomes that-refuting Press reports that the company had reached agreement on a shorter working week or was willing to do so and indicating also that ICI is strongly opposed to the reduction of working hours because of the effect that this would have on the company's investment plans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I indicated in my earlier answer, there is a whole series of things which can give rise to increased costs to a company or to loss of its income. It might regard the loss of tariff protection as being critical. It might also regard increased labour costs, which shorter working hours certainly will promote, as being something which will make further expansion of its activities uneconomic. But in any event, in the light of the present position, the Government does not propose at this stage to refer the chemical industry to the Industries Assistance Commission. I think the honourable senator would be aware that the matter was considered by the Government some time ago.

Is the Bass Strait oil field by far the most important resource development in this country? Of the Government take from this oil, last year did $2,114m go to the Commonwealth Government and only $132m to the Victorian Government, a radically different distribution from any other resource development in the country? Will the Grants Commission in its consideration ignore the direct benefits of tariffs, bounties and Federal Government building projects on the grounds that these are decided by the Federal Government on national interest criteria and have nothing whatever to do with State government revenue, except in the indirect sense that they may increase the capacity of States to raise revenues through measures such as payroll tax?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question Senator Hamer raised is both interesting and very detailed. I will attempt to tackle it. Firstly, as to the initial discussion by the Premiers, the agreement with the States expires after the current period and, therefore there is a need to look towards what formula for distribution there shall be for the future. So no doubt there will be a discussion at the April meeting as well as later as to the nature of the future formula to be used. The States have met and made some suggestions. The Commonwealth Grants Commission, which was formed in the 1930s and is a very distinguished body, has been asked to undertake a massive task. That task is to review the relativities of all the States. The principle under which the Grants Commission had worked over the years was to try to find what kind of a revenue supplement would be necessary in order for a particular State to provide services equivalent to Victoria. Victoria was a bench-mark and to a lesser extent so was New South Wales. I cannot tell whether the Commission will continue with that bench-mark as other States have now flourished, particularly Queensland and Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

My understanding is that it is unlikely to be available for the June conference or for the conference of the Premiers. In any case, once it becomes available it will be a document of such comprehensive detail that it will need to be put under study. I cannot speak for the Grants Commissioners but they would, I think, take into account all sources of revenue available to a State including indirect taxes, freight charges and so on. But I do not want to comment on that matter because they will be bringing down their own report. Senator Hamer cited the revenue from the Bass Strait oil fields and compared the revenue the Commonwealth gets-incidentally it spends that revenue on the whole of the nation-with an amount that Victoria gets.

But to sum up, the Grants Commission will bring down its report within the months ahead. It will be a very significant document indeed which will require very great study. The Premiers will discuss their revenue sharing arrangements for the future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, land rights for Aboriginal people living in the Northern Territory were secured with the passage of an Act of this Parliament. If anyone asserts that support for a particular candidate for a seat in a Territory House could threaten land rights such a person would be playing upon people's fears in an unnecessary, cynical and cruel way. Aboriginal land rights were established by an Act passed in 1976 by the Fraser Government. These rights have not been threatened. In fact, the Fraser Government has continued to support and endorse them. They are supported today by the Liberal and National Country parties. If anyone asserts otherwise, I think they are on very shaky ground.

Is it the case that Australian gun control laws, whilst certainly much tighter than those of the United States, are by no means uniform around the country? In particular, is it the case that in respect of shotguns and rifles, if not hand guns, only two States, Western Australia and South Australia, require both the registration of guns and the licensing of owners and that at the other extreme two States, Tasmania and Queensland, make no attempt to register guns and place no restrictions, except by age, on those who own them? Does he concur with the conclusion of Professor Richard Harding, writing in the Bulletin of 3 March and also in his book Firearms and Violence in Australian Life published just last month, that the consequence of the disparate licensing and registration requirements is that it is impossible to ascertain how many guns of what sort are owned by how many Australian citizens?

It is, however, not a subject which has arisen during the period in which I have been a member of that Standing Committee. I will give consideration to whether it is a subject that should be taken up by the Standing Committee. I am not aware of whether it has even been taken up by it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am familiar with the report to which the honourable senator referred in his question, although I have not read it. I am afraid I have read only some comments on it. The report is primarily concerned with brain failure amongst the elderly, and of course that is only one aspect of aged care with which the Commonwealth is involved. I do not think there is much doubt that many of the confused elderly need institutional care, or care which goes beyond that which can be provided in their own homes. However, for that section of the population, in common with the rest of the population, there is a growing sense in the community and in government and private agencies that, as much as possible, people should have the opportunity to remain in a normal domestic situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> About 100,000 people are in institutional care around Australia, and my advice is that about 57,000 of those do have some degree of brain failure. Some of them will need institutional care, and it may be that a number of them could return to a domestic environment. A series of programs around Australia receiving Commonwealth support assist voluntary organisations and State governments to provide services for people who are at home. These services have significantly expanded over recent years. I am not in a position to give the honourable senator a precise figure as to the cost of those domiciliary services as against the cost of the services provided through institutions. It is argued that domiciliary services are a more economical way of providing services for the aged, but to date I have not seen what I would regard as any really hard evidence as to just where the cost advantage lies. All the information I have received has tended to concentrate on what seemed to be a social advantage in providing domiciliary rather than institutional care.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator raises a matter which I regard as being of some complexity. I assure him that the report put out by the Social Welfare Research Centre funded by the Commonwealth is one which is receiving attention. Indeed, the whole area of care for the aged is receiving attention both from government, private organisations and the Parliament. At the moment there is an inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure into the general area of care for the aged. This Committee may pick up this particular area of inquiry. May I assure the Senate that we will look at this whole area with very great care.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question which is directed to the Minister for National Development and Energy concerns the future of uranium mining in Australia. Has the Minister noted several recent Press reports from various parts of the world stating that the spot price of yellowcake or uranium oxide has fallen over the last two years from $43 to $25 per lb, that it is predicted that the price will fall as low as $20, that the world market is grossly oversupplied with this commodity and that this state of major oversupply can be expected to continue perhaps for some decades? Is the Minister aware that last month Number One ore body at Jabiluka which Pancontinental Mining Ltd proposes to mine for uranium was a metre under water and that these flood waters cleared only slowly through the East Alligator River, which passes through the Kakadu National Park, due to daily tidal backup in the river? In view of the state of the world uranium market and the environmental risks to the Kakadu National Park of contaminated water from underground mining will the Government take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that mining at Jabiluka does not proceed? If mining does proceed will Pancontinental be required to provide adequate bunding to keep back flood waters? Will the Government ensure that sufficient sums of money be deposited by the company in advance to ensure that in the event of its ceasing production or encountering financial difficulties funds are available for environmental rehabilitation of the mine areas?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen a variety of reports regarding the variation in prices of yellowcake and uranium generally. What has happened has been the result of both waves of optimism and waves of pessimism. Perhaps neither of these reactions is right. Certainly, I doubt that the wave of pessimism at this moment will be justified by future events.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that in the energy crisis due to the oil shortage there has been a stand-off; nations have been slow to look towards alternative fuels, slow to make coal contracts and slower to move towards nuclear power generation. France is the exception because it will generate some 50 per cent of its electric power by 1985. It is my judgment, I believe supported by others in the community, that in the years and decades ahead the world outside will not be able to find its alternative energy in coal and gas; there will be a significant increase in the demand for uranium and enriched uranium and that in fact there will be markets for Australia in the decades ahead. That is a judgment that can be made only by individuals. It may well be that changes will take place.</PARA>
<PARA> It is certain that western Europe would want to go strongly towards the use of uranium. The shipping, logistics and the infrastructure of coal are so enormous as to make it almost prohibitive. The environmental damage including radioactivity increases, resulting from the huge increases of coal production, must be borne in mind. The pollution from coal will be such that this in itself will constitute very severe health problems.</PARA>
<PARA> Having said that I am well aware that the conjunction of the Alligator Rivers constitutes a flood plain. Indeed, the whole of the escarpment leading down from Mount Brockman has created alluvial leaching which has provided the uranium deposits. I am equally aware that over the millennia the waters have run over those deposits; that the Aboriginal people, animals, bird life and fish life have fed from those areas without harm.</PARA>
<PARA> I am also aware that the provisions under the law for the development of mining are such that each of the rivers and their run-off will be monitored daily by the Supervising Scientist and that there will be the strictest safeguards against contamination in the waters. Those safeguards will be insisted upon. Therefore, it is our aim to ensure that there will be no contamination of the beautiful and unique Kakadu National Park. Those sanctions apply to Pancontinental Mining Ltd in its development of Jabiluka and to all uranium mining. We will insist on the highest standards. The penalties are strong against any company that attempts in any way, wittingly or unwittingly, to breach these arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; On 25 March, in a question without notice, Senator Martin referred to comments reportedly made by the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, during his recent visit to Saudi Arabia on Australian attitudes and policy towards the Middle East and asked whether, in the light of these comments, the Government was considering a change in its policy towards Israel, particularly in relation to issues which arise at the United Nations. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following information. In his response to the Saudi Arabian Minister of Commerce, Mr Anthony welcomed the opportunity provided by his visit to forge stronger trade links between Australia and Saudi Arabia and regarded it as a valuable opportunity to exchange political views as well. It was important that each country have an appreciation of the other's political views.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Anthony said he appreciated both the importance to the whole world of finding a solution to the Middle East problem and Saudi Arabia's particular concern about Jerusalem and Palestinians. He believed there was now a greater awareness in Australia of Middle East problems, and hoped Saudi Arabia would continue to keep Australia informed about its attitudes and policies towards the various issues involved. Mr Anthony said he understood how important it was to Saudi Arabia to have the obstacles to peace and progress in the region removed, and looked forward to further, private discussions on political issues, in order to add Australia's weight to efforts to solve this painful problem. The Government's position on the Middle East dispute remains that it believes a comprehensive settlement should be based on United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, which calls for withdrawal from occupied territories and which guarantees the right of all states in the area to live in peace within secure and recognised boundaries, and on recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland alongside Israel.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 March 1981 Senator Sibraa asked me a question concerning the proposed South African Springbok rugby tour of New Zealand and the possibility of a boycott of the 1982 Commonwealth Games as a result of that. He asked specifically what action the Government intended to take and whether it was possible that the invitation to New Zealand to attend the Commonwealth Games might be withdrawn in order to save them. My colleague, the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, has provided the following information. The Government is well aware of the potential effect of the proposed Springbok tour of New Zealand on the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane and is keeping the matter under close review. The Government is determined to ensure the success of the Games and will do all in its power to encourage all Commonwealth countries to participate in Brisbane. It hopes, of course, that the proposed tour will not take place and that steps to have New Zealand's invitation withdrawn will not need to be taken.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In replying to a question without notice from Senator Tate on 26 March I said that I had been advised that the imported material known as KTCP did not contain dioxin. That was my understanding of the conversation that I had with Dr Hall of the Australian National University. I indicated that none of the facts which I presented in my answer to Senator Tate's question had been confirmed. I have now received advice which requires me to modify my earlier answer. Since dioxin can appear at the stage of production represented by KTCP, an intermediate material in the manufacture of 2,4,5-T, it is likely that the dioxin traces normally present in 2,4,5-T would have been present in the product imported.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the last few weeks, and indeed months, the Senate both at Question Time and in debate has discussed a number of issues related to the so-called resources boom. In fact it was only a fortnight ago that Senator Carrick, I think, paid us the supreme and somewhat patronising compliment when he said that the discussion of a resources boom was healthy. If it was unhealthy I think we need not be here any more because that situation would be rather dangerous for us. It is healthy and it is in that context that we want to proceed with this matter of public importance and discuss the questions arising from the resources boom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course we believe that one of the first things to do is to proceed from a basis of reality rather than fantasy. The fantasies have been in the minds of the Ministers such as Senator Carrick, who from time to time gets carried away, but who at other times deals with the problem with the utmost reality. There have also been fantasies in the minds of people such as the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch), when from time to time he has estimated the size of the resources boom for media purposes. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The figure varies depending on his mood of expansiveness, but we could take that figure today for the purposes of discussion. The factors which will bear on and determine the real figures are perhaps not capable of projection by Government Ministers with the same degree of confidence as has been shown in the past. Some of the factors which will determine the size of the real figures involved in the resources boom will depend on considerations such as the fact that some projects are mutually exclusive. For example, if one goes ahead it is likely that a competing one will not. Secondly, many projects are unlikely to eventuate until well after Sir Phillip Lynch's timetable because, for example, of long delays between approval and construction. Thirdly, with United States of America having a depressed economy at the moment and with Japan having a slower rate of growth, international growth rates do not look particularly promising. Fourthly, there will be as a limiting factor, one believes, an inability of the States to provide infrastructure and, notably, electricity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In looking at how big the boom will really be we should look at a variety of views on this subject and try to reach some rational assessment-a health assessment, if I can use the Minister's terminology-of it. The Australian Industries Development Association, for example, stated that Mr Lynch's Department has 'considerably overstated the degree and pace of the impending boom'. In answer to the Minister's interjection of a minute ago, I say that the two factors-degree and pace-are very important in looking at the matter in a given period. Certainly, it is the view of the AIDC that the Minister has overstated the degree and pace of the impending boom. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's own interdepartmental committee on economic strategy has commented on the forecasts of Mr Lynch's Department of Industry and Commerce as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a plausible assumption might be that investment in mining would grow at about three-quarters of the rate implied by current departmental estimates. </PARA>
<PARA>That committee is setting growth a little lower than, a little differently from, the overblown Mr Lynch. The other factor which I think is important is that caution should be exercised in estimating the scale of a boom, not in any sense out of carping or simply to expose the Government's exaggerations but for very real reasons. That is to say, caution is desperately important in planning, so that we can derive as much as possible in terms of employment and benefits to local manufacturing. Secondly, it is important in terms of the provision of infrastructure and planning. This will amount to as much as 18 per cent of the total investment projected in terms of the resources boom. Present tentative estimates are that public investment infrastructure for resource developments will amount to $2,500m between 1980 and 1985 alone. Once again, the Government is shown to be operating in an ad hoc manner with only a vague notion of long term planning in respect of infrastructure expenditure. We only place these notes of caution on record. We do not in any sense try to detract from the enormous significance and size of a resources boom. We just utter some words of caution in respect of some of the claims which have been made and point to some of the factors which may inhibit those most exaggerated claims. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the benefits to this country of a resource boom will be very considerable. First of all, there will be benefits in terms of income, provided there is an adequate distribution of income in this country. There will be benefits in terms of improved living standards. There will be benefits in terms of employment, although once again we argue that these are vastly over-estimated. The number of jobs that will be created from the mineral boom by the mid-1980s on what in our view are the best estimates, is about 60,000, according to the paper from the Department of Industry and Commerce. I am speaking of direct employment. That estimate has to be compared with the current unemployment figure of 420,000, according to Commonwealth Employment Service statistics, and an expected work force growth to the end of 1985 of 575,000. So some over-emphasis has been given to the benefits in terms of direct job creation. Such over-emphasis has been given during past election campaigns, for example, when the resources boom has been mooted as the answer to all the Liberal Party's prayers. It has been used to get it off the hook in relation to the sorts of things which it had undertaken to deal with. Perhaps we can now look at the matter more soberly. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is fair to say that a large number of jobs will be created indirectly, but in our view that number is unlikely to exceed 150,000 and they will not be maximised under the policies of the present Government. I wish to explain why we believe that job maximisation, if I can call it that, will not occur under the policies of the present Government. The first factor is the lack of planning, which has been quite apparent. There has been a lack of planning and relationship between various arms of government policy. For example, there is an article in one of today's newspapers-I do not have it directly in front of me-about the undersupply of geophysicists in Australia. The undersupply is estimated to be something like 1,500, yet the resources boom has been foreshadowed for a significant period. Such a failure may be ascribed to the universities or the advanced education system. It is also the result of the failure of the Government to recognise, for example, the relationship between resource development and education policy, as well as the relationship between manpower policies generally and resource development. </PARA>
<PARA> We say that job maximisation will not occur, secondly, because of the excessive foreign ownership and control of resources in Australia. Profits will go overseas. There will be a leakage of funds, as it is called, on the purchase of equipment overseas. Thirdly, this Government is prone to use a credit squeeze to counteract the flood of foreign investment money. That course will dry up funds for business and put marginal firms out of business. Fourthly, there is a shortage of skilled tradesmen in Australia, which again relates very much to education and manpower policies-the sorts of things with which the Williams Committee was to deal and in respect of which little action had been taken. Fifthly, the continued appreciation of the exchange rate will affect the ability of Australian firms to compete. Sixthly, there is an inadequate investment in social infrastructure in Australia in such towns as Gladstone to which we have already referred in discussing the resources boom. Such investment would again be a very important source of job generation, quite apart from the important component of community development and equalisation of the benefits of resource developments. The balance of payments situation will, of course, be improved but the sad thing is that much of the infrastructure for the boom will be inherited. Many problems are associated with such a boom. I have stated some of the benefits, with qualifications, as we see them. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the many problems associated with resource booms are structural adjustment pressures. Again, there will be pressures for the exchange rate to appreciate, for the dollar to be worth more, making imports cheaper and also making it more difficult for Australian manufacturers to export. The Australian manufacturing industry sector is the largest provider of employment in this country. The competitive position of that sector will be undermined. The sad possibility is that those sectors of Australian industry which are least profitable will go to the wall. We cannot draw an exact parallel with the situation with which Great Britain is faced at present, but the pound is exceptionally strong as a result of North Sea oil exploration and that has had a disastrous effect on British exports. The response of the Thatcher Government to that situation has been to restrict the rest of the economy while the exchange rate of the pound has been allowed to shoot up. We fear and give warning that through lack of sensible and flexible economic management this country could get into the same situation. There is a concern to see that the economy get proper stimulation at the appropriate time. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish a little later to touch briefly on the question of foreign investment. In the meantime let me say that one of the potential problems is the fact that the Government has encouraged and allowed competitive bidding for projects between the States. There is no national strategy in Australia in relation to the resources boom. I wish to give some examples of that as it is related to the level of export prices. The Federal Government, in our view, must ensure that Australia's interests are protected. One can take the example of the Utah Development Co. which is a foreign company. In 1978 Utah undercut New South Wales producers who were negotiating for contracts with Japan. Last year Utah signed an 8-year contract for coal from Norwich Park at prices which were too low. It is conservatively estimated that it will cost us $250m a year in lost revenue. That is a loss to the whole of the Australian people, which should not be tolerated by a national government which purports to have any form of national strategy on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> In connection with the area of potential problems again I just mention the matter of a resource tax. We in the Opposition believe that there should be a resource rental tax. There should be a review of the over-generous concessions given to the mining industry by the present Government-for example, the exemption from tax of gold mining and gold sales; the application of the investment allowance to the North West Shelf and the accelerated depreciation allowance for mining assets over five years. Another potential problem is the implication for the capital market, including the effect on other sectors of the economy, of drawing away investment into the mining industry. Lastly, another potential problem is the heightened demand for skilled labour. </PARA>
<PARA> I will dwell on that matter for just a minute. At the moment there is a lot of talk about the importance and the shortage of skilled labour in Australia. Because the Government is in such a state the whole country seems mesmerised about that matter. The demand for skilled labour will have a tremendous effect on the level of wages in this country. There is no apparent indication at all from this Government of how it will deal with that problem. Apprenticeship intakes collapsed during the first four years of the Fraser Government. The shortages in skilled labour markets could generate wage pressures which could spread to the rest of the economy and generate enormous inflation. That is a possibility which everybody knows about. There is not the slightest response by way of a planned suggestion from this Government as to how it proposes to deal with that issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn, in the brief time available to me, to two issues: Firstly, the creaming off of money by State taxes and, secondly, the dangers of uncontrolled foreign investment. The national Government of this country should be the principal beneficiary of resources development and not the governments of Queensland, Western Australia or any other State. The national Government of Australia should get the benefit of resources development. The conditions of the Winchester South lease in Queensland, the rail charges and so on, provide that State with its own taxes which rake off millions of dollars. A resource rent tax imposed at the national level would be fairer and would ensure that the whole of this country and all of its people benefit without sectional interests prevailing because of accidents of geography and geology. The difference between a mining company and other companies is that the nation awards a national asset to a mining company to develop a resource. It does not give a manufacturing industry a national asset to develop. Its profitability depends on the initiative of the company concerned and upon the development of resources by the company, not the granting of resources as is done with a mining company. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the second matter of foreign investment. Only Canada exceeds Australia in having foreigners dominating the national economy. I am not being xenophobic about this. I am not saying that we do not need foreign capital in Australia; I am saying that the conditions under which we get it and the terms we lay down are craven and spineless. I refer to such things as infrastructure development, the technology which companies bring with them and no demands being made by the national Government of this country on matters of infrastructure development and technology transfer. Alcoa of Australia Ltd has announced that it will build a caravan park and some houses for the workers at Portland in Victoria and all that is regarded as a great exception. People are saying what a wonderful company Alcoa is because it is going to put a few million dollars into providing houses for workers and a caravan park. That has not happened elsewhere in Australia and it will never happen unless the Government does something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Other countries do not find the same craven disabilities as the Fraser Government finds on the requirement of technology transfer and participation in infrastructure development for the mining industry. Foreign companies now control 55 per cent of our mining industry and 36 per cent of Australia's manufacturing industry. They control 48 per cent of the service sector. It is estimated that transnational corporations have control over 40 per cent to 50 per cent of the Australian corporate sector in its entirety. In some strategic sectors foreign companies control almost 100 per cent. The trend of foreign interest in buying existing Australian enterprises is growing rapidly. Successful Australian companies have been sold off. Foreign investors do not have to start from scratch in Australia. They take over existing enterprises and promptly start remitting profits overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Foreign Investment Review Board has a pathetic record. Since 1976 when it was established, to the credit of the Fraser Government, the Board has rejected only 45 out of 5,000 proposals which have come before it. More than 3,800 of these proposals were for takeovers of existing Australian companies. The Department of Trade and Resources, in an internal memorandum, warned of speculative capital inflow into Australia and said that this could have an important influence on the balance of payments. The inflow would be based on expectation of an appreciation of the exchange rate of Australian currency. The Australian dollar has already appreciated by 6 per cent in 12 months. So there is an urgent need for a coherent policy to control capital inflow at the moment and an urgent need to control it in the long term in the interests of technology transfer, infrastructure development and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The leakage of funds overseas from Australia to import capital equipment for mining ventures is important. Thirty per cent of the projected sums to be spent in the mineral resources boom will be spent overseas and not in Australia. Fifty per cent of the money for aluminium developments in the Hunter Valley will be spent overseas and not in Australia. Fifty per cent of the North West Shelf moneys, $2,000m of the $4,000m, will be spent overseas and not in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The subject we are discussing is important. I welcome its being debated. We are dealing with the prospective resources boom in Australia and the motion before us reflects upon ownership, employment and revenue. The resources boom in Australia comes about for two reasons. Firstly, it is because of the unhappy circumstance of a world that is energy hungry. Fortunately for Australia it is, in most of its resources, energy rich. Secondly, and most importantly the resources boom comes about because Australia, in terms of its inflation and its general economic picture, is in a very favourable trading situation compared with the rest of the world. Our inflation rate is very significantly below that of our trading partners. Perhaps I can rely on help from two sources to describe the present situation. The first source is a comment by Mr Ross Gittins, the economics editor of the Sydney Morning Herald who, in an article appearing in the National Times of 15 February this year, stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The economy is expanding quite strongly, with real incomes growing, consumer spending buoyant, and business investment booming. Unemployment is on the up and up and there are signs that unemployment is starting to drop a fraction. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Mr Gittins said. In case that is regarded as partisan, I shall quote what the Minister for Industrial Development and Minister for Decentralisation in the Wran Labor Government, Mr Day, said in his Department's most recent publication entitled: 'Development Projects in New South Wales-Australia'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Despite continuing problems on the world economic scene, there is cause for an optimistic view of the future for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to quote, support and not deny, as does the Federal Labor Party, the findings of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia can look forward to a brighter 1981 than most major industrialised countries in the West, according to the . . . OECD. </PARA>
<PARA>The statements I have quoted come from two experienced persons. The resources boom has occurred because of a world outside that is hungry. We have a responsibility to develop our resources to meet that hunger so that living standards in the world outside will not fall and so that there will not be political instability. In developing these resources our primary objective is the uplifting of the living standards of the people of Australia consistent with the true conservation of our resources for the generations ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> I will continue to show-this has been diagnosed-that a most exciting time is ahead of us. The New South Wales Labor Government will act as a text en route to refute just about everything Senator Button has said in his description of fantasy. Every claim that this Government has made concerning future investments, participation and employment is multiplied very considerably by the claims of the Wran Government. That, I think, ought to be kept in perspective. I will deal with this aspect now and will turn to more important things later. Senator Button's original thesis was that the Government had talked in fantasies about the projected investment of $33 billion in Australia. He said that such investment would not come to pass. The booklet, over the signature of Mr Day, states:</PARA>
<PARA> The total value of investment projects reported in this booklet--</PARA>
<PARA>The booklet relates to New South Wales-</PARA>
<PARA>is in excess of $23,000m. </PARA>
<PARA>That figure is for New South Wales alone and is on parallel with investment of about $70 billion for Australia. The New South Wales Government publication does not mention the figure of 60,000 jobs in Australia to which Senator Button referred but states:</PARA>
<PARA> Employment opportunities expected to be created in relation to projects in the committed and final feasibility stages, where such information is available, total approximately 50,000 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>That figure relates to New South Wales projects which are committed and in the final feasibility stage. Against a cautious figure of 60,000 jobs in Australia, Mr Day's publication continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Most of the employment opportunities reported are expected to occur between 1981 and 1985. </PARA>
<PARA>It then said:</PARA>
<PARA> These data relate to direct employment only and do not include the increased indirect employment likely to be generated in supplier industries, etc. </PARA>
<PARA>If one relates the ordinary multiplier for Australia to the figure of 50,000 jobs the projection, instead of a cautionary 60,000, is for about 170,000 jobs. The booklet, referring to major projects, then states:</PARA>
<PARA> In addition at least 22,000 jobs are represented by major projects which are in preliminary study or possible stages. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement not only destroys what Senator Button has said but also paints a picture which is stronger by far in every one of its categories than what has been put forward by this Government. I suggest that the Government has put forward modest figures. I stress that I am reading from a publication of the New South Wales Government which is produced over the Minister's signature. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now take each situation as it comes. First of all, the matter of public importance relates to ownership. The Fraser Government and not the Labor Government which preceded it set up the Foreign Investment Review Board. The Labor Government did nothing in that regard at all. The Fraser Government said that particular guidelines should be set for certain projects. It said that for uranium, the aim should be an Australian investment of 75 per cent and that for other developments there should be a majority Australian equity. These guidelines were frontier work in Australia. We were laying down the principle that Australians should have the major equity in the development of Australia. We have proceeded along that course. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the investment in Australia by ordinary Australians. Australia's reinvestment of its savings has been second only to that of Japan in past years. The great insurance companies, such as the Australian Mutual Provident Society and the Mutual Life and Citizens' Assurance Ltd are putting the premiums paid by their policy owners into development. The whole of their Australian equity is going into Australian development. A large percentage of the shareholdings in the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd are owned by superannuation funds and provident funds. The 5 million or 6 million shareholders in BHP, CSR Ltd and the other great companies of Australia can be demonstrated to be actively engaged in the development of Australia. I do not include fixed and multiple trusts that also create development in Australia. We are setting down ownership provisions that are quite clear. People should not be frightened of them. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make some remarks about foreign capital coming into Australia. The United States of America was built out of foreign capital. Capital from Britain, France and Germany literally invaded the country in the past decades. The people of America said that they would be taken over by foreign capital. That is nonsense. Any strong government with a national sense of responsibility can ensure that the capital and know-how works for the people as it did for America. America became great because it searched the world not only for money but also for top technology. Along with foreign investment comes high technology. What nonsense-in fact, what gall-it is for Senator Button to say that we have done nothing about insisting upon arrangements for technology. Has he read of our most recent decision concerning National Semiconductor Incorporated and our insistence that if the company is to come to Australia it has to bring with it the highest technology and to share it with Australians? Yet, out of his mouth come gross errors. Of course along with the capital of the world comes absolutely high technology. When that capital comes great platforms will be built in Bass Strait and in the North West Shelf. The first platform in the North West Shelf will contain more steel than the Sydney Harbour Bridge. That steel cannot be taken away. It cannot be repatriated to the country from which the capital came. </PARA>
<PARA> The oil wells in Bass Strait are part of Australia. The aluminium smelters, the know-how and the technology are part of Australia. We will grow stronger as we take in these people and this technology. As we get higher technology a fundamental thing occurs. The more new plant, equipment and technology that is brought in the stronger will be our basic manufacturing industry. That manufacturing industry has to develop to service and to supply the needs of the projects. I think it was Senator Button who said that there would be an outflow. Let me quote again the New South Wales Government. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is apparent from these figures that there will be a high degree of local participation in supplying materials, plant and services to construct those types of development projects. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the $23 billion-worth. Let us keep that figure in mind, because that is what we are talking about. Mr Day's report went on:</PARA>
<PARA> Although the percentage of local and overseas content will vary for individual projects, it is likely that between 70 and 80 per cent of the total capital cost of projects planned in New South Wales will be spent locally. </PARA>
<PARA>There the responsible Minister in a government with the facts in front of it-not a dissident and embittered Opposition-is saying that we have $23 billion-worth of investment and that 70 per cent to 80 per cent of it will be spent locally. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Once projects begin production, further multiplier effects can be expected to be generated within the State and national economies from these planned developments. </PARA>
<PARA>The picture, as it now emerges, is of foreign capital coming in under the strictest of guidelines-with Australian management, Australian equity and majority Australian partnership-and bringing with it the highest of skills and technology and new opportunities for jobs for our young. As this document demonstrates, 70 per cent to 80 per cent of that capital will be spent in Australia. If we have to bring from abroad some new plant or equipment, what is wrong with that if it creates so many more jobs in Australia? The picture for Australia with regard to ownership is an exciting one of great Australian companies-the BHPs, the CSRs and the AMPs-growing greater in their skills and management, reaching out into the development of Australian resources and bringing great opportunities for Australia. So much for ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to employment. Mr Day, the New South Wales Minister, says that 50,000 jobs will be directly created in the next four years in New South Wales alone, which means that 150,000 to 170,000 jobs will be created in Australia. Senator Button said that we were exaggerating when we were talking of 60,000 jobs. But Mr Day says that there will be many more than that because the indirect benefits and the multiplier effect will be so great. Where is this question of employment now? Where does the Labor Party's argument stand as a result of a government of its own kidney assessing the situation? When I became Minister for Education I found the technical and further education side of education run down and in a demoralised state, and with the pattern set for a complete scarcity of skilled tradesmen and technicians in Australia. It was the Fraser Government which lifted up technical and further education, gave it equality with universities and colleges, increased its spending massively and gave it a chance to expand its skills. Of course, there is a lead time. It was the Whitlam Government which in fact drove investment away from Australia-drove the rigs away from Australia-and forced people not to go into geology, into mining or into building and architecture. There has been a period in which recovery necessarily had to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the benefit to Australians. First of all, I must stress that we have in life a major job to reach out to the world at large and to help it wherever we can with energy, whether it be short of coal, gas or uranium. If other countries cannot produce metal by smelting alumina because they are energy hungry, it is our job to provide them with the base metals so that they can maintain their living standards. In doing so we have a fundamental responsibility to Australians to see that the resources in the ground are not squandered, that there is proper conservation, that the environment is maintained, but that the true value of the resources, as they are developed, goes to the Australian people not only in jobs and skills but also in higher education, in a greater ability to provide health and social services and in better roads, houses and bridges. In other words, a tonne of bauxite at Weipa or Gove is as nothing, except in its conservation value, until it is taken out and processed, through alumina, into the metal itself and therefore, becomes of true value to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an instructive exercise to look at the number of people directly and indirectly employed and the number of local government charges and State taxes and charges that are paid along the way. We find that in any dollar of revenue to such companies, between 70c and 90c goes to the creation of jobs or to taxes or charges throughout Australia. It is, of course, the responsibility of government to ensure that excess profits are not shipped out of Australia. The excess profits that are being made by the Esso-BHP partnership in Bass Strait are being ploughed back into coal and shale developments in Australia as well as into the development of new oil wells. It is important to understand that the profits of today are the jobs of tomorrow. It is important that we understand something that the socialists will never understand-that unless there is a healthy profit which can be reinvested we cannot develop new industries and, therefore, we cannot provide more jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> It was suggested by Senator Button that we are not planning infrastructure development. He cited Gladstone and said there was no such planning there. I sat with the Gladstone people both in Gladstone and in Sydney and heard from each of the developers and entrepreneurs that they are building proper, fine, high quality and adequate houses with proper environments which they will sell at a moderate cost to their employees. So the development of that housing infrastructure will be of benefit to such people. Of course, mistakes are made. Of course, sometimes excess profits go off-shore and we need to amend our tax laws. I am not saying that everything is right. What I am saying is that with proper management, provided we can keep our inflation low and provided we orchestrate so that we do the right range of right things, we can help people overseas and we can build the kind of Australia which, industrially, in a defence context, in schools and in opportunities for our people, will be unique in the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me assure Senator Carrick that Senator Button has read the material relevant to the National Semiconductor Corporation project and that he has come to the same conclusion as academics, as most businessmen and as anyone who knows anything about high technology; that is, the Government's statement can be summed up as windy rhetoric designed to seduce the ignorant. As Senator Carrick has chosen to mention the increase in the rate of growth in the gross domestic product, which it looks as though we will record in this financial year and the quite significant increase in the absolute level of employment which has taken place in the last 18 months, he ought to be reminded of the reasons that has happened. The improved economic growth of the last year or so is in fact a product of the Fraser Government's repudiation of its own economic policies. The Fraser Government allowed the money supply to overrun substantially-to overrun by 3 per cent or 4 per cent in the last couple of years-its stated growth targets. Consumer spending has increased appreciably because wages have increased by 14 per cent in the last 12 months; and government spending, despite all the windy rhetoric to the contrary, in real terms is up 3 per cent this financial year on what it was in the previous year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In all of these areas those policy changes have contributed the major part to the economic growth which has been recorded and in every case they comprise a repudiation of the long-standing policies of the Government. To the degree that the economy is improving, it is improving not because of the Government's stated policies but because in fact the Government has repudiated them. For how long that will continue, of course, remains a matter for conjection. It is also worth noting that the growth of which Senator Carrick boasts has taken place in a period of rising inflation, something which, according to the high tory dogma of the Government, could not happen. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand why Senator Carrick chose to quote so extensively from the material of another government on the likely magnitude of the so-called resources boom. He did that because if he had chosen to look at the material produced by his own Government what would have emerged would have been a picture of confusion and discord. Even on such fundamental matters as the level of committed and final feasibility investment we have divergences of almost a factor of two. According to Mr Lynch, $33 billion is involved in that category. According to Mr Anthony it is $19 billion. They, of course, had different objectives when presenting those figures. Mr Lynch, being a veteran of Stumpy Gully, has a penchant for and, on occasions perhaps, even a vested interest in inflating expectations. Mr Anthony, on the other hand, was anxious to soothe the misgivings of his agricultural constituency-that is, those farmers who realise that a large expansion in the export sector, regardless of the source of that expansion, will generate pressures for revaluation of the Australian dollar and lower prices for agricultural products. Mr Anthony said that this was nothing to be worried about because the rate of appreciation of the dollar would not exceed 1 per cent per annum for the next 10 years. Some of the farmers who listened to him no doubt were expected to believe that that meant a reduction of 10 per cent in farm incomes would happen. Of course, it meant no such thing. </PARA>
<PARA> Agricultural export prices, in the main, are determined by export parity, whether the product actually is sold abroad or at home. A 10 per cent reduction in gross income or return for the product is, of course, equal to a 25 per cent reduction in net farm income because over the long term net farm income runs at about 40 per cent of gross farm income or the value of production. Reduce the value of sales by 10 per cent and the net income is reduced by 25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> On the matter of ownership, to which the motion refers, the Government and its tory predecessors have adopted policies of dissipating domestic capital, the most recent and spectacular example of which was the 61 promises pulled out of the hat. Promises either to forgo revenue or to increase expenditure were pulled out of the hat on the eve of the last election. These promises involved projects so diverse as a $2m motor racing track for Canberra-that was made in the vain hope of saving Mr Haslem's seat-or a $500m railway for somewhere else which had no hope of ever paying its way. It firstly dissipates domestic capital in that way and then allows eccentric and authoritarian State governments secretly to hand over resources to companies which are not only foreign but also are owned by foreign governments. </PARA>
<PARA> We see such self-professed opponents of public ownership as the Premiers of Western Australia and Queensland gleefully handing over mineral deposits to consortiums of which the British Petroleum company is a member. Most recently, of course, there were the Winchester South and prior to that the North West Shelf projects in which BP again has a major equity. BP, ironically, is 46 per cent owned by the government of the United Kingdom. Sir Charles Court, at the same time as he was asserting that no investment authority established by an Australian government would be allowed to contribute equity or to participate in mining development projects in Western Australia, was welcoming a consortium which included BP which not only is foreign but also is owned by a foreign government. The attitude of these two eccentric premiers is that Australian government ownership or participation in resource development projects is forbidden but that foreign government ownership is welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA> One could speculate on whether, under the regime of one Ian Smith who was formerly admired by both of these premiers, that policy would amount to economic treason which, incidentally, was a crime in Rhodesia under the Smith regime. It was a regime greatly admired at that time by Mr Bjelke-Petersen and Sir Charles Court, although I should imagine that, given the uncertainty about the Commonwealth Games in Brisbane next year, Mr Bjelke-Petersen would be less eager to express publicly his admiration for the Smith regime than he was a few years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to interest rates. It has recently become apparent from a wide variety of sources that the prevailing interest rate for overdrafts above $100,000 is 16.5 per cent. This is without precedent. In no previous credit squeeze have interest rates approached that level. It is not entirely due-indeed at this stage not very much of it at all is due-to the resources boom. The interest rate problem has been exacerbated by previous governmental manipulation of the money market to achieve political goals which were laid down by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), a task in which it was assisted by a disgracefully compliant Reserve Bank and now, of course, by the reapplication of crude monetarist dollar dogma. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has got the country's money market into such a mess now, before the resources boom has even properly got under way, that interest rates have risen to unprecedented levels. The mind boggles at the prospects of what will happen in the future unless the Government can improve to a very substantial extent on its past record in this area. But the main point I wish to talk about is the reference in the motion moved by Senator Button to ensuring that the revenue associated with resource development is adequately shared by the Australian people. High tory dogma, and possibly the naked pecuniary interest of the National Country Party, has locked the Government into a ridiculous position, a position of unequivocal rejection of a resources rent tax. A resources rent tax is supported by such luminaries as John Stone, the Secretary to the Treasury, who is normally regarded as a high tory dogmatist himself. If John Stone is too progressive for the Government, where does that place the Government. He was supported implicitly only yesterday by a Japanese steel magnate, Mr Tanabe, who was reported in the Canberra Times yesterday, amongst other newspapers. Mr Stone was supported by and reported in the Melbourne Age of 30 March by Dr Susan Bambrick, once suspected by many people of being a mouth-piece for the mining interests. The article in the Age states:</PARA>
<PARA> An adviser to the Federal Government has predicted a special resources tax on foreign mining companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Susan Bambrick said at the weekend that such a tax appeared inevitable and necessary because Australia did not have adequate control over certain aspects of the industry, such as foreign ownership and Tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA>Every academic economist in the country who is not actually a prisoner of corporate interests advocates a resources rent tax. Of course, a resources rent tax has long been advocated by the Australian Labor Party. A resources rent tax is supported by every numerate person who has ever taken the trouble to think about it. In the Government parties-I exclude from this consideration the bagmen in the Government parties-there are, among those who do not support it, the innumerates, for whom presumably there is no hope, and those who have not thought about the matter. For the benefit of those in the latter category I will explain why they should think about it and why they should support it. The Government's existing policy is doubly vulnerable. Firstly, absolute tax levels in some instances are demonstrably too low-I will say more about that later if I have time-and secondly, it applies the wrong type of tax to resource projects, whether they are Commonwealth or State taxes. All those who mine resources pay royalties to governments. Royalties are related to the quantity extracted. </PARA>
<PARA> A royalty is a tax on production and a resources rent tax is a tax on profit. The essential difference is that one taxes production and the other taxes profit. Quite independently, at the level of taxation which is applied, a resources rent tax is more efficient. The reason it is more efficient in economists' jargon is that under a resources rent tax by definition there is no tax on marginal production, and again that is regardless of the absolute level of taxation. But to put it in terms which are more readily understood I will cite an actual example. In round figures Australian crude oil is sold to refineres at $30 a barrel. Again in round figures, of that $30 about $8 is distributed to the producers and $22 goes in taxes to governments, overwhelmingly to the Federal Government. The average cost of producing that oil which is sold for $30 is something less than $2 but the price for oil from some individual fields is significantly higher and for all fields it will get higher as they approach the end of their production life. When the cost of producing from any of those fields rises above the $8 that is currently received by the producers production will cease. Oil producers are not philanthropists. There is no reason to expect that they will be. While they receive only $8 they will not produce oil that costs them more than $8 to extract. We will then be in the ridiculous situation in which oil which has a market value of $30 a barrel and a production cost of $9 a barrel will be left in Bass Strait, or wherever it happens to be lodged, because of this foolish taxation policy which the Government is applying. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few seconds remaining to me in this debate let me cite as another scandalous inadequacy of the Government's present policy, the situation at the Fortescue field from which under present Government policy Esso-BHP will pick up windfall gains in excess of $1 billion. There is an argument which can never be satisfactorily resolved about whether it is new or old oil. If we had a resources rent tax the argument about whether it is new or old oil would be completely irrelevant. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The resources boom current in Australia is due not only to the favourable natural resources that our country possesses but also to the extremely sound economic policies that are being pursued by the Fraser Government at this time. The framework in which inflation is actually coming down provides an environment in which sound investment decisions can be made. I emphasise the words 'sound investment decisions'. In addition, we have relatively stable exchange rates. These features are not common to other parts of the world which have natural resources. I think we must examine the reasons for the resources boom in the context of a deliberate and cultivated Government policy that is directed to maximising the economic welfare of Australia to the great benefit of Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the features of the resources development boom is that it is also taking place outside major metropolitan areas. It is taking place outside the traditional resources States of New South Wales and Victoria, the States which have benefited from most of the booms in the past. As the population and support industries have been centred largely in New South Wales and Victoria it does come as something of a shock to those States to find that there is now a degree of voluntary immigration to the resources rich States of Queensland and Western Australia. I think it appropriate that the Government reassess some of the financial arrangements. In the past New South Wales and Victoria have been regarded as standard States but as the increased revenue derived from the boom flows into the Treasury coffers of Western Australia and Queensland these arrangements may need to be re-examined. There are developments at Groote Eylandt, Gove, the North West Shelf and Weipa. As a consequence of the development of these sites and the movement of large numbers of people to these previously desolate areas there has been a tremendous improvement in communications and facilities. For strategic reasons I think this improvement in communications in what previously were non-populated areas is important for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition, which has proposed for discussion this matter of public importance, fails to recognise some of the Government's achievements in managing resource development. Let me refer to some of the safeguards which this Government has developed, such as the Foreign Investment Review Board guidelines, for example. I think all honourable senators are aware, ever since I became a member of this place, that I have been very conscious about the need for Australian equity in foreign operations in Australia not necessarily only in resource companies but also in companies which provide everyday foodstuffs to Australians. This Government does have a sound policy, as enunciated in the Foreign Investment Review Board guidelines, in that there must be at least 50 per cent Australian equity in any project involving investment expenditure exceeding $5m-other than in the uranium industry in which an Australian equity of 75 per cent is required. In respect of exploration companies, as Senator Carrick mentioned yesterday, these guidelines do not apply. But as soon as development starts, in other words when the field has been proved, these investment guidelines come into play. The Government does realise that in some circumstances it is not always possible to get the vast amount of money from financial institutions around Australia that is required to develop our resources and where the Government is satisfied that an investment project cannot attract 50 per cent Australian equity and provided it will substantially contribute to the economic stability of Australia, it may proceed. The main point in relation to foreign investment is that over time the Australian equity will increase. I think this is an important point. I think Australia is indeed a lucky country. </PARA>
<PARA> The boom, as I mentioned, is with us. We do not have to wait for two or three years. For example, in 1979-80 the number of foreign investment proposals submitted to the Government increased by 40 per cent and expenditure in approved natural resource development proposals rose from $716m in 1978-79 to $2,380m in 1979-80. This gives some indication that the boom is with us now and that Australia is benefiting very much from this interest in investment in Australia. But our Government is not interested in investment at any cost; we are concerned in such matters as environment, foreign ownership, pricing policies and taxation. It is true that the private sector will tend to benefit most from this investment boom. For example, surveys carried out on 14 January 1981 by the Department of Industry and Commerce list 306 projects which were at the committed or final feasibility stages. These projects totalled $33 billion. This figure is double that which appeared in a similar schedule submitted by that Department in October 1979. So it is the increasing trend of Australian investment in overseas corporations which are investing in Australia which is significant. In the black coal industry, for example, current foreign ownership is 40.3 per cent, and it is expected to fall to 35 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me take one example-I will use coal again-to show the significance and importance of what the investment boom is meaning to Australia. Federal and State governments do benefit very significantly from this revenue. For example, average mine workers in New South Wales earn about $400 a week as a result of coal exports from New South Wales. Most of this is spent in the local community in which the various miners live. State and Federal Treasuries benefit by about $9 per tonne from coal exported, or nearly 30 per cent of total export income. On top of this, a wide variety of charges are imposed by local and State authorities, including rail freights and loader hire facilities. So there is a heavy cost burden on these miners. In fact, it has been reported that seven of the 13 coal exporting companies actually incurred losses. There is a myth that all these companies are exploiting Australia and are making huge profits. We have to look not only at some of the losses incurred, say by the coal miners, but also at some of the modest profits by the large miners in relation to their invested capital. </PARA>
<PARA> A question was raised about royalties and resource rent taxes. I think we have to look at these two things together. We must be very careful in advocating high royalty rates that we do not actually drive out the more marginal type of operation. One of the problems experienced by Jamaica was that it set too high a royalty rate and the companies basically went elsewhere. I believe this is one of the problems being faced by my State of Tasmania at this time. The Government is not quite as sensitive in this area as I believe it could be and, as a result, certain feasibility studies that should be under way are not going on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I meant the State Government. I think it is significant that there are projects that could proceed if we had a more realistic royalty-type basis. But there are problems with fixing royalty rates too high because different grades of ore or material are extracted. A uniform royalty rate essentially must be low; otherwise, more marginal operations are driven away and, I submit, these are probably the ones that we would like to try to develop because essentially they are in the more decentralised areas. We only have to look at Canada's experience where a combination of high royalty rates and resource rental taxes resulted in an almost complete exodus of many of the mining companies from that country. I submit that we must learn from the experience and wisdom of other countries.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we were to impose a resource rent tax as suggested by my colleague Senator Walsh, essentially that tax would have to go on to profits. Most of those who advocate resource rental tax refer to cash flows. Senator Walsh's analysis fails to recognise payments such as interest, royalties and the like which flow out. Had Senator Walsh examined this idea a little more closely he would apply his philosophy on resource rental tax not to profits but to cash flows as such. What he fails to recognise is that we cannot have this sort of tax imposed on an operation that is already heavily taxed by way of company taxes, sales tax, payroll taxes and so on. The other factor that the advocates of resource rental taxes fail to recognise is that these profits are not earned uniformly. We all know that prices are subject to major fluctuations in metal prices around the world and, because of this, mining companies have to build up adequate reserves in Australia. I submit that a lot of these profits are very modest by world standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we in Australia have to do is to make sure that foreign companies that operate here pay tax on a realistic Australian base. If we get that right we need not worry about resource rental taxes. Evidence given to the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, which was looking into this question, showed that some of these foreign companies are probably not paying the income tax that they should be paying. Whilst many of my colleagues on the Opposition benches deplore the profits that are earned by Alcoa of Australia Ltd, that company does not concern me. The companies that concern me are those which produce in Australia and sell to their operators overseas at cost, and possibly do not pay a true amount of tax. What are we doing about it? Our Federal Treasurer is updating section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which deals with transfer pricing. Under the new provision I believe that ultimately many of these foreign companies will be paying very much more tax in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Foreign investment in Australia is contributing very substantially to our foreign exchanges. In fact, 74 respondents to an Australian Mining Industry Council survey-a very large coverage in the mining area-reported overseas earnings from Australian sources of $3,800m. The export sales represent 67 per cent of total sales and represent a tremendous increment to Australian revenue. Interest and dividends remitted equal 8 per cent of total sales. So these companies involved in the mining industry, I submit, are contributing a significant part in the overall economic development of Australia. They are conscious of environmental matters and our Government is conscious of environmental matters. Look at our intervention in relation to Fraser Island. I submit that overall our country is going to be very much better off, the standard of living for the bulk of our people will improve and equality will be achieved through a system of reimbursement grants from the richer States to the poorer States. By that method the benefits of the resources boom will be distributed evenly right throughout the whole of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise with pleasure to support the matter of public importance raised by Senator John Button. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>the failure of the national government to ensure that the Australian people adequately share in the ownership, employment and revenue associated with resource development. </PARA>
<PARA>I give my support in the knowledge that the Australian Labor Party is not supporting some extreme stand. It does not call for anything more than the proper, clear sighted national advantage to be secured by such a management of this resources boom that business enterprises can operate profitably within Australia, but in a way which respects our economic sovereignty and does not imperil the rights of Australian people to share in the wealth and the employment that one hopes will be generated as these resource projects get under way. In the response of the Minister nothing to allay the concern of the Labor Party emerged. No strategy has been outlined whereby the national Government has indicated that it sees a need to co-ordinate this major resources development. There is no strategy for even some sort of supervisory or co-ordinating role, let alone direction or management concerning the time and pace of the development being undertaken by the national Government. We have nothing that would indicate that there is anything more going on in Australia than a very confused, competitive scramble between State and Territory governments to secure major investments, in many instances using foreign capital and technology. The Federal Government has a sort of craven attitude-if not craven, one of gratitude-toward all that is happening and a hope that the benefits will trickle through to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party believes that the investment, employment and revenue sharing policies of the national Government are not adequate to ensure that these benefits really do accrue to all Australians wherever they might live. Senator Watson in his speech, which as usual was marked by clarity and integrity of thought, mentioned that there has been a move in Australia away from the old base of the south-east to the new resources rich States of Queensland and Western Australia-a move of wealth and consequent political power. What the honourable senator did not advert to and what the Minister and the Government refuse to advert to are the consequences of this. It is recognised by all Australians with any fair-minded ability to read newspapers that the premiers of those States and perhaps the ethos of those States are fundamentally opposed to national cohesion. A disintegrating influence is going on in which I believe those State economies are purposely being integrated more and more into the designs of multinational capital and overseas markets without a concern for the Australian nation as a whole. I do not believe one has to be ideologically pure nor does one have to be involved in some sort of jingoistic nationalism to make that sort of comment. I must say though that when one sees the golden fleece the symbol, par excellence, of Australia being overtaken by the Caltex star one has a symbolic representation of what is at the root of the concern of the Labor Party in raising the matter of public importance. </PARA>
<PARA> I will very briefly look at the areas of concern. To start with, I will deal with investment. Of course, the tremendous marshalling of capital necessary to ensure these projects develop on the huge scale required will demand a degree of foreign participation. Only in that way can we obtain the technology required and, indeed, the very access to overseas markets which is involved, for example, with the highly integrated aluminium industry. The Labor Party remains unconvinced that the Australian people through their corporations or public institutions are being given a fair enough share in these developments in supplement to foreign investment capital and overseas borrowings. We can see the situation. President Marcos of the Philippines described the situation back in December 1980. As reported in a newspaper article at that time, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Japan and the others' are beginning to control Australia's natural resources, . . . </PARA>
<PARA> 'I don't care what excuses you give, the truth is that very soon you will lose control.'</PARA>
<PARA>That was a statement by President Marcos of the Philippines. Normally it would not give me any pleasure to quote from the President of such a regime. This is a perception of the Australian situation shared I believe, by many Australians; we are being overtaken by foreign capital. It seems to the Labor Party that certain simple steps need to be taken to ensure that the constant purchasing of Australian resource developments projects by overseas corporations with the consequent remitting of capital overseas should be lessened or modified. </PARA>
<PARA> I am speaking somewhat in the dark. I am doing so because, of course, the national Government has refused for three or four years to collect the necessary statistics to enable the Australian people to speak with any precision as to the penetration by foreign corporations into the Australian business, trading and commercial scene. It will be recalled that the special section set up in the Bureau of Statistics to monitor the penetration by overseas corporations of the Australian commercial and trading scene was disbanded some four years ago by the Treasurer (Mr Howard). One of the first tasks which the Labor Party will undertake when elected to government in 1983 to get a proper understanding of this area will be the re-instatement of the statistics section. </PARA>
<PARA> The work of the important Foreign Investment Review Board has already been commented on quite adequately by both Senators Button and Walsh. I wish to put something positive forward because I think this is as much the purpose of an Opposition as it is to point out the defects of government policy. We believe it is very important that ordinary Australian householders be given an opportunity to participate in the resources development projects taking place. It is not good enough that already well established major Australian enterprises such as CSR Ltd and the Broken Hill Proprietory Co. Ltd take their place in this particular development; it is not good enough even that the pension funds or the insurance companies, as was pointed out by Senator Carrick, marshal the moneys contributed by ordinary Australians to those funds. What is needed is some sort of unit trust whereby ordinary Australian householders can contribute their hundreds of dollars to a true investment in Australia's resource projects so that more money would be returned to them than they would get by merely holding their savings, for example, in ordinary banking accounts. Some sort of project, perhaps a resource development fund, needs to be developed. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought of the term 'Resource Australia' as a title whereby funds can be mobilised from small investors. This is not only so that Australian equity can be increased in the various resource projects under way but also to overcome what I believe to be very real political problems facing the country in that more and more Australians are becoming convinced that the economic destiny of our country and therefore to some extent our political destiny is being taken out of our hands with decisions being made by corporations whose interests are not necessarily identical with those of every Australian. The idea is that funds would be mobilised to enable the directors of the fund to purchase equity in these great resource extraction and processing projects. There would be no public subsidy of the fund and the only element of government financial support would be a loan guarantee on borrowings by the fund during its establishment period. As part of the Foreign Investment Review Board's program of vetting applications by foreign corporations to take part in resource development in Australia it may be that some 10 per cent of every such resource project ought to be offered to such a Resource Australia development fund. In that way the ordinary Australian householder could find some participation in these projects. </PARA>
<PARA> That is only one matter of concern to the Australian Labor Party. The other matters mentioned by Senator Button in the debate deal with the inadequate response of the Government to the employment problems generated by the resources boom. We have heard nothing from the Government which gives any guarantee that the skilled labour required by these projects will in fact be forthcoming from the presently unemployed, underemployed or unskilled sections of the Australian labour force. One would not want a situation to develop, as it appears it might well do, whereby the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) becomes the Commonwealth employment service for the resource project developments we are contemplating. One does not want a situation where Australians living in cities find they have declining standards of living and employment opportunities while other Australians working on these resource projects enjoy not only employment but also employment at a very high wage structure creating a situation of divisions within our society. I believe that the gap between the employed haves working on these projects and receiving site allowances, extra overtime and penalty rates and so on, and the unemployed have nots will create serious tensions within our society. It does not seem that that problem has been addressed yet by the Government. Indeed one finds very little evidence that any consideration at all has been given to other ordinary manufacturing industries such as the metal fabrication industries, engineering industries, even industries within the Public Service where at the moment draftsmen are leaving in droves to go to resource projects. There seems to be no consideration or national strategy by the Government to ensure the continuation of employment opportunities in other areas throughout the Australian economy, given the bidding up of wages by the firms involved in the resources boom. </PARA>
<PARA> We also mention in our matter of public importance-I can mention it only in passing, although I must re-emphasise it-that we do not believe that the revenue raising by the Federal Government for the national Treasury so as to disburse the benefits of the resources boom to all Australians has been undertaken with sufficient vigour. Senator Watson contrasted the resources rent tax with the gathering of royalties. He thought that each may have a deleterious effect on investment decisions, particularly in marginal projects. But, of course, the fact is that royalties are particularly clumsy and likely to prevent the sort of investment decisions that Senator Watson speaks of, because they are geared to tonnages and production, whereas the whole merit of a resources rent tax-a merit recognised by the Department of the Treasury, by more and more corporations and certainly by every editorial comment that I have been able to read in the last few months-is that it only applies to profits actually gained. In other words, it is geared to high profitability, which undoubtedly occurs in some situations. If the national Government does not obtain for all Australian people a sufficient taxation return from the development of these projects, then not only will State governments move in-as Queensland has by imposing special rail freight charges and obtaining special funds from developers, as it has from the Winchester South consortium over the last few weeks-but also unions will move in order to obtain very high wages for their workers on these projects. I believe that the national Government, by failing through taxation to secure this wealth for the Australian people, is exacerbating the divisions, tensions and forces of disintegration which politically, I believe, are problems which need to be confronted and faced with a national strategy if we are to get for all Australians the full benefits of the impending resources boom. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I believe that the projected resources boom will provide a fascinating future for this country, as all booms have in the past, as long as we are able to take full advantage of it. There is no doubt that the reason why people are investing in this country is the free enterprise political climate that is provided here, our economic strategy and the fact that inflation is lower here than it is in countries that are and could be our competitors in resource development. I can recall the wool boom shortly after World War II and the meat boom in the early 1970s. I cannot recall the rest of Australia not receiving some advantage from increased overseas income resulting from those booms. The whole nation benefited from them, but once those industries suffered a decline the people who felt the effects were those associated with those industries and not the rest of the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today honourable senators can go into the sheep areas and the beef cattle areas of Australia and find evidence of the many small businesses that have closed up. The declining population in these areas has an effect on the remaining businesses. Therefore, I always believe that the benefits that accrue from resource developments should be put back into the areas from which they came, so that these areas are able to diversify when a slump occurs. This does not happen on most occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> Because I am a federalist-not a centralist-I believe that the people of the States should get most of the benefits through money being ploughed back into development areas. I am not even satisfied with what happens in Queensland. A lot of the money that is gained from resource developments through special rail freight rates does not go back into the areas from which it comes. Most of it ends up in the south-east corner of the State, where the bulk of the population is. I believe that if that money was ploughed back through assistance to alternative industries, and improved communications, particularly roads, and other facilities then there would be some sense in this policy that we all subscribe to-the policy of decentralisation. At the moment we are not achieving anything. We have a great opportunity with the resources boom to achieve decentralisation of the Australian population. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to some of the points made by other speakers. All the Australian Labor Party speakers referred to a resources rent tax. I agree that a resources rent tax has a part to play in our economy if, as Senator Walsh said, we could get rid of all the other taxes. I would go along with it too provided that a proportion of it was returned to the States concerned after the Commonwealth, acting as collector on behalf of the States, got its share. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we have the problem of who will decide what true profits are. We do not have so much difficulty determining the profits of companies supplying the Australian market but there is difficulty with a company supplying the overseas market especially if it is dealing through a parent company in another country, in which case no world price for the product can be truly calculated. Therefore, I think we have to have other safeguards to make sure that these companies contribute a fair share to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> We could institute export controls. Indeed I believe they are absolutely necessary for the development of the aluminium industry. It is impossible for the Taxation Office to assess the price of material being sold by companies to their overseas interests. It does not have the ability to pin the companies down. If we apply export controls we can always say to these companies that unless they explain the position and give us the facts then we will not give them an export licence. Such controls have worked in industries where they have been applied. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not opposed to overseas companies investing in Australia when Australia is not able to supply the equity. Millions of dollars are involved in these projects. I agree with Senator Tate that we should encourage as much Australian investment as possible. But if we just do not have the money, I am not that much against overseas investment so long as we get our fair share of the profits and so long as it is controlled. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said in this place previously that I regard a nation as being similar to a family. Its standard of living is determined by the breadwinner. As far as this nation is concerned the breadwinner has been the export industries. While we have had export industries and export income coming into this country the standard of living has been high. When we have problems in selling our exports-we have experienced those problems at times-we have difficulties within this country. What we have to do is to ensure that the total amount of the family's income, whether there is one breadwinner or two, is distributed in such a way that everyone benefits. I believe that we should be giving our export industries a lot more encouragement than they are receiving at present. The discouragement is there. Encouragement has always been given to those industries which we set up to produce manufactured goods in particular. Quite a lot of publicity has been given in the last week or so to protected industries which have been given all the help in the world but which cannot compete overseas. They are creating situations which in the long run will be detrimental to the export industries which have to compete on world markets and which have to have a cost structure which enables them to make a profit. </PARA>
<PARA> Another angle which I wish to take up is the employment position in these industries. Many people say that they are not high employment generating industries but we usually find that although there may be only a few thousand miners in these mining towns, treble that number of people are required to service them. Then, of course, manufactured equipment is required for the infrastructure. That is not produced locally; it has to be produced elsewhere. That enables the whole of Australia to participate. Also, many of the employees at these mining centres have gone there for a purpose; that is, to make a lot of money in a short time in order to be able to get the requirements of life that they may not have been otherwise able to have for years to come. That money is not spent locally. The new cars, washing machines and other equipment which the employees would not otherwise have had for a few years is not produced locally at the mining site. They are produced in the manufacturing States of South Australia, Victoria and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the commencement of my speech, we have to ensure that wherever mining developments take place, in remoter areas in particular, we transfer at least some of the benefits of the export income earned back into development in those areas. It would be quite interesting to see what would happen, for instance, if we had a mining venture on an Aboriginal land rights site. We know that the Labor Party's attitude to that would be that the Aboriginals should get the money. I believe the other Australians who live in the Northern Territory and the remote areas of Western Australia and Queensland should also receive benefits from mining ventures. I do not think there was anything in the remarks made by members of the Opposition to indicate that they are against the resources boom. They seem to be going along with it. They are a little concerned about what might happen. I can give the assurance that, the way I see it, this Government will ensure that the Australian people are adequately protected. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not intend to oppose the Australian Tourist Commission Amendment Bill. However, we wish to take the opportunity of discussing some of the Government's deficiencies in the area of tourism. No one, least of all a member of a rational party such as the Australian Labor Party, would argue against the need to increase the number of commissioners from nine to 10 or the need to increase the number of Territory resentatives from two to three. However, we would be looking to the Government to redress the imbalance that exists in the Australian Tourist Commission insofar as there are nine male commissioners and one female commissioner. This does not reflect adequately the number of females in the tourist industry, nor does it represent properly community participation in tourism. As long as that state of affairs exists tourism will be the poorer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come directly to the economics of tourism. The most recent and comprehensive report has been put out by the Bureau of Industry Economics. I refer to the fourth research report of that organisation entitled 'The Economic Signficance of Tourism in Australia in 1979'. There is very little doubt that tourism impacts dramatically on our economy. In 1973-74, for example, tourism contributed 2.6 per cent of gross domestic product. It employed 2.4 per cent of the work force and accounted for 3.2 per cent of indirect tax revenue. Those figures have been provided by the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch). They show that tourism is on a level comparable with the motor manufacturing industry and is just behind the mining industry. Whilst we have many debates and many concerns are expressed in the Parliament about the manufacturing industry, the motor industry and the mining industry, I believe as a parliament and as a nation we have failed to appreciate that tourism is a very significant industry in our country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau predicts further that by 1985 overseas tourist spending in Australia will rise from the present level of 20 per cent to 40 per cent of total tourist spending. That is the amount contributed by overseas visitors to our country. By 1985, it also predicts, the percentage of people employed in the tourist industry will increase from 2.4 per cent to about 8 per cent of the work force and the industry will create about 60,000 new jobs. Therefore, its contribution to gross domestic product will rise by 80 per cent to about 4.5 per cent of our GDP. When we recognise the decline of the work force in rural Australia, the decline of our work force in manufacturing and the relative decline of the public sector, which this Government has brought about by attempting to reduce public sector employment, we see the tourist industry as one of the few possible growth areas. Consequently, of course, governments and parliaments ought to be concerning themselves with the tourist industry. </PARA>
<PARA> A great deal of informed and uninformed debate has taken place about the possible tourist boom. One thing that is certain is that tourism is a prime growth industry and as such Australia-if it is doing its job-ought to be capitalising on that expansion. The fact is, however, that we are quite clearly and dramatically missing the boat. The amount that is now spent in a year in international tourist areas by the millions of international travellers on tourist-related industries is reported to be the staggering figure of $325,000m. That is some six times the annual value of Australia's gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that we are not grasping the tremendous opportunities tourism offers from the point of view of GDP and employment. The sad fact is that despite that tremendous sum being spent internationally, Australia currently extracts much less than one per cent of all international tourist expenditure. In fact only about 0.3 per cent, a very tiny proportion of the tourist dollar, comes to Australia. The Opposition deplores this. It is an area in which the Opposition believes the Government is wholly deficient. Even in the Pacific area where I would have thought that Australia would be the leader, our share of tourism is dropping. In 1970 our share of tourism in this market was 4.7 per cent. By 1978 it had dropped to 3.8 per cent, showing just how rapidly we were losing out to other Asian-Pacific countries which are much more aware of tourism and which do much more to promote tourism as an industry than we do. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of our failure to exploit the tourist potential of the Pacific area a great many off-shore venues for conventions, seminars, workshops and other events have become a great deal more attractive than Australia. Local tour operators, convention venue entrepreneurs, tourism support industries and the airlines face a great loss of business because of this. For example, we can compare what is offered in those venues with the position in Australia. Leaving from Sydney, a holiday for seven nights with all travel and accommodation expenses paid cost less than $360 in Fiji and less than $300 in New Zealand. But five nights' holiday all-in costs about $400 in Hobart and more than $700 in Darwin. That is about 30 per cent higher than, for example, what it costs to holiday in Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last Budget the Fraser Government set aside for tourism something less than $20m. It is interesting to note that this Fraser Government gets back $10m of that $20m every 12 months in gateway tax; that is, the $10 tax per head the Government collects from people leaving Australia. So the net contribution to tourism was a measly $10m. I mentioned previously that this industry contributes as much as the motor industry. When I look at the hundreds of millions of dollars expended in promoting that industry I wonder why this Government is failing to promote tourism as an industry. It claims it wants growth. Therefore, it has to be prepared to spend and to give a great deal more attention to tourism if it wants to see that growth. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that the argument is quite reasonable that without manufacturing industries we would not have as many people in work, we would not have as many people wanting holidays and perhaps tourism would suffer. But I think there is a great imbalance between the $10m that is allocated for tourism and the hundreds of millions of dollars expended in many manufacturing industries. In no way do I want it to be construed that I am criticising the assistance given to our manufacturing industries. I am saying that this Government is neglecting to foster an important industry. It lacks the imagination and the foresight necessary to capitalise on this growing industry. It fails to recognise the potential of the industry and the fact that this is, of course, an industry which can give great pleasure to our community. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Government's passive position is not helping to recognise the growth potential of that industry. The whole leisure industry is crying out for the type of leadership that I am referring to and which an entrepreneurial government could give. This Government, which claims to be concerned about private enterprise, is neglecting to take on board the very innovative steps taken by the Labor Government in the years 1972 to 1975. The Bill we are now debating is part of a new-found interest-it might be said by some-by the Fraser Government in the tourist business. But it might well be a case of too little too late. I ask the Government what it did in the tourism area in the years 1975 to 1978. It might be said by some that it was on holidays. If it was on holidays it was doing much better than many other people-the 400,000 people out of work-who could not even afford a holiday. </PARA>
<PARA> We constantly hear in this place the Minister for National Development and Energy, Senator Carrick, referring to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries and reports. But according to figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development growth in tourism in Australia fell last year. The increase in the number of overseas visitors to our country was 15.9 per cent compared with a growth rate of 25.9 per cent in the previous year. Revenue growth from those tourists also fell. In 1969 the figure was 27 per cent compared with 19 per cent last year. In the same OECD report there is a note of optimism that, as the world economy improves, interest in travel will pick up and so we will see a stronger growth rate in the tourist industry generally. That is in line with predictions previously quoted from the Bureau of Industry Economics report that by 1985 overseas tourist spending in Australia could rise from the present 20 per cent to 40 per cent of the total tourist expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> Will we be geared up for this upsurge of interest in not just travel but the whole spectrum of the leisure industry? In 1972, under the Whitlam Government, the people of Australia saw the advent of the first Federal ministry for tourism and recreation under the direction of the late Frank Stewart and, with it, the recognition that there was a vital role for government to play in this industry. In that time the role of the Australian Tourist Commission was expanded and with it went a brief to step up the promotion of Australia abroad and on the domestic market through the program 'Australia-Land of things to see and do'. By 1975 some $2.34m had been provided in grants and loans for the development of man-made attractions such as Sovereign Hill, Old Sydney Town, Lachlan Vintage Village and Port Arthur. </PARA>
<PARA> To the purist, these man-made attractions might seem gauche and almost artificial but they are essential ingredients in any overall tourist strategy. Our heritage, the colonial frontier people that we were, is encapsulated in places such as Sovereign Hill and Old Sydney Town. These places give Australians of today as well as overseas visitors a dioramic view of our past. Of course it is preferable to visit these man-made attractions in conjunction with seeing the real thing. Nowhere is that more evident than in the city of Parramatta. In Parramatta some of Australia's real antiquity exists. Within a radius of half a mile of the city proper there exists a cottage that was built by John Macarthur in 1791. It is the oldest house in Australia. Surely these are matters of great tourist attraction. </PARA>
<PARA> I now return to the man-made tourist facilities. We may all rave about the grandeur and beauty of Australia's natural attractions, but the fact is that very few international tourists seek them out. I suspect, therefore, that the cost of domestic air fares, despite the protestations of the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) to the contrary, is the prime reason people are neglecting our far-flung natural attractions. I am supported in my claim that places such as Ayers Rock and the Great Barrier Reef are neglected by overseas visitors by a Qantas Airways Ltd survey conducted of foreign tourists in 1973. This survey revealed, quite disappointingly, that Ayers Rock was visited by a mere 2 per cent and the Great Barrier Reef by only 4 per cent of such visitors. Surely one does not have to stress the wonderful attraction of the Great Barrier Reef. Yet the fact is that we are not able, because of the lack of government promotion and encouragement, to attract the interest of overseas visitors to these very important areas of our Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst it is true to say that the situation may have improved since 1973, it is still evident that most foreign tourists spend their time and money in the capital cities, with Sydney being the most visited. I do not blame them for that. Sydney is a beautiful city. It is one of the most important cities in the world. It is no wonder, therefore, that overseas visitors go there in droves. After all, Sydney has Kings Cross which, in itself, is an important attraction. </PARA>
<PARA> Who would deny the employment opportunities created by these man-made operations and the regional job opportunities for people in country areas where employment is at its worst? Also to be considered is the accommodation which springs up around these attractions and with it even more employment opportunities. Tourism and leisure activities filter right through the economic system. The report of the Bureau of Industry Economics concludes by stating:</PARA>
<PARA> Tourism is already of considerable significance to the Australian economy with direct or indirect effects on almost every industry. </PARA>
<PARA>It has been stated that tourism or leisure, or the two together, make a contribution to all 109 industry groups in Australia. Therefore any Australian government that ignores tourism does so at its peril. Given the evidence of all the economic indicators which show the value of tourism to the national economy, there is an overwhelming argument for the reinstatement of the Department of Tourism and Recreation. Certainly after 1983 when the Australian Labor Party is back in office it will be looking to do just that. By that time the leisure industry will have grown to such proportions that it will not be able to be ignored and, undoubtedly, the struggle of the trade union movement for a 35-hour week will have won a great deal more support in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me list some of the reasons why I believe nothing less than a fully operational Federal department is capable of effectively harnessing the existing potentials of the leisure industry. Quite naturally my top priority is employment. In an area of our lives which affects so many other industries a Federal government has a unique opportunity to stimulate the economy and create employment simply by investing in man-made attractions and other types of tourist facilities. Leisure is a very labour-intensive area. The BIE report points out that areas such as restaurants, hotels and clubs are very labour-intensive. I point out to anyone who is interested that the reason New South Wales has the lowest unemployment rate in Australia is, to a great extent, the leisure industry which has been built up. Presently there are 33,000 permanent employees in registered clubs in New South Wales and there are some 100,000 more temporary jobs. It is very unlikely that anybody will ever create a machine that will make beds or serve meals. The beauty of the leisure industry is that it is totally labour-intensive. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am on the subject of labour and the leisure industry, I mention the oft-quoted lament that penalty rates inhibit the industry. I will give one example to refute that assertion. A report produced by Roger Kirby, who was then manager of Travelodge Australia Ltd, pointed out that it is a total furphy to suggest that penalty rates are holding back the accommodation industry in Australia. It is wrong. No less a person than Professor Brian Johns, the Director of the BIE, has stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The report showed that the prices of tourist services in Australia are not significantly higher than in other developed countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Again I quote from a Press release issued by the Minister last year when he was in Tokyo. He cited figures from a world survey conducted by the Economic Research Department of the Union Bank of Switzerland which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Our tourist industry can compete favourably with other alternative tourist destinations around the world . . . The general level of prices in Sydney was ranked lower than those in 33 of the 45 cities surveyed. </PARA>
<PARA>The important and most significant part of what I have been saying is that we can provide such competitive prices in the framework of a high living standard. There is absolutely no reason, except a lack of understanding and concern by the Fraser Government, why Australia cannot become a prime country in the whole tourist industry. There is absolutely no reason why Australian workers ought to lower their living standards to attract the tourist dollar. Consequently, there is no reason why any steps should be taken to abandon penalty rates. They were hard won. They are part of our heritage. They will not be lost. Let me conclude by saying that I love our sunburnt country and so would the rest of the world if only the Government would help visitors come and see it. To that extent the Opposition supports the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Gietzelt for giving me some time to speak before the sitting is suspended at 6 p.m. I compliment him on his speech. It was a very thoughtful contribution. The Australian Democrats disagree with him very vigorously in one area. I refer to the question of penalty rates in the leisure or hotel and accommodation industries. In the view of the Australian Democrats penalty rates are, in some cases, crippling the small operator in hotels and restaurants. I will say a bit more about that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats, along with the Australian Labor Party, support the Australian Tourist Commission Amendment Bill. I feel impelled to speak to it as I had the great honour when I was the Minister-in-Charge of Tourist Activities in 1967 to establish the Australian Tourist Commission. This fairly simple Bill allows for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory to be represented on the Commission on a rotational basis. We agree with that. After paying the Commission a compliment for doing in general terms a very good job, I may have to be critical. I have the Commission's report for the year 1979-80. The results on the board are quite impressive. For example, in 1978-79 visitors from New Zealand increased by 37.1 per cent, from continental Europe by 36.7 per cent, from the United Kingdom and Ireland by 28.5 per cent, from Japan by 22 per cent, from North America by 20 per cent and from South East Asia by 15.8 per cent. The figures are impressive. I compliment the Commission and I compliment the Government for supporting it. However, it does not mean to say that we could not do better. Tourism, as Senator Gietzelt said, contributes 2.6 per cent of our gross domestic product and is a significant earner of foreign exchange. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a very strong point about which the Government, advised by the academics in Treasury, seems to be quite myopic. I refer to the matter of refusing to grant a depreciation allowance on hotel buildings. If we really want to attract tourists we must have a first class tourist commission and first class promotional ventures overseas. What is the point of doing that and attracting people from North America and the wealthy parts of Europe if we do not have the proper standard and quantity of hotel accommodation? This is the first lesson to learn in promoting tourism. I am informed that today it costs between $90,000 and $100,000 a room to build a new hotel. The figures are massive. I am not talking about de luxe accommodation; I am talking about first class accommodation which costs $100,000 a room. Assuming that once the hotel is erected there is a 70 per cent occupancy rate, which is a reasonable assumption, and that the owner has borrowed the money to build at a 16 per cent interest rate, the room will cost the owner the staggering sum of $62 a day in interest payments alone before he has to pay wages, direct expenses and overheads. That indicates the massive cost today of building hotel accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Government, Sir Phillip Lynch has said: 'We have given the hotel industry a building allowance, and that helps tourism'. I dispute that and so does every person who is trying to build a new hotel in this country. The building allowance is only 2 1/2 per cent. If a hotel costs $1m to build, the building allowance is worth only $25,000 as a deduction from profits. Whoever heard of a hotel earning any profit at all in the first three or four years of its establishment? The building allowance to assist developers and builders is almost hopeless. The Democrats believe very strongly that the hotel building ought to be regarded as an integral part of the plant which is earning assessable income and therefore that depreciation on the building should be allowed at 10 per cent to 15 per cent per annum. The loss to the Treasury would be minimal because few hotels are being built at the moment. In any case, the building industry could be stimulated by this action. </PARA>
<PARA> After complimenting the Commission, let me now be critical of it. When I had the honour, as Minister, of establishing the Commission I said: 'Please, do not let the bureaucracy take over and spend this precious money the Government gives you in developing offices and high bureaucracies in Australia and around the world'. Unfortunately, I believe that has been allowed to occur. The Commission now employs 76 people on its staff-a rather surprising 45 people in the head office in Melbourne, two in Sydney, five in Los Angeles, six in New York, five in Frankfurt, five in London, four in Auckland, and four in Tokyo. It has offices in eight places throughout the world. One way of promoting tourism is to print shiny brochures and pretty booklets and post them to certain people overseas, to advertise in overseas newspapers, and so on. That does attract a certain market, but other countries have discovered that the only real way to attract tourists is to bring to their countries the wholesale operators from the various markets. Let us bring them here and give them a wonderful time, give them an opportunity to understand the fantastic tourist sights that Queensland, Tasmania and the other States have. Let them see the incredible things that Australia has to offer. Let the wholesale travel agents who market thousands of seats on planes to retail travel agents absorb the unique warmth and beauty that Australia has. </PARA>
<PARA> Other countries which have been successful in promoting tourism have used that technique. They have used an essential part of their budgets in that way and not in the production of shiny brochures. Let us imagine the hard-bitten wholesale or even retail travel agent on the West Coast of the United States. Every day in the post must come dozens of shiny brochures and advertising material from every country in the world, trying to attract the West Coast American tourist. How different it would be if in his mail he received an invitation to come to Austalia for a period of ten days, all expenses paid, to sample personally the standard of hotel and motel accommodation we have, the wonders of the world we can exhibit in Australia but, more particularly, to have a personal tour of Australia conducted by officers of the Australian Tourist Commission. I am sure that the various Australian State governments would provide ample assistance to the Australian Tourist Commission for such a promotion. For example, many years ago when I had a small opportunity to involve myself in this area, we said to the Queensland Government Tourist Bureau: 'We are bringing 24 travel agents to Australia. Will you help?' Of course, they jumped at the chance, and they showed the travel agents the things Queensland had to offer-Cairns, the Great Barrier Reef, the Gold Coast, and so on. I believe that the money now being spent by the Tourist Commission, instead of being spent on personnel or large shiny offices, would be better spent on personalising Australia in the way I have mentioned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Australian Tourist Commission Amendment Bill, which is a simple Bill which neither the Australian Labor Party nor the Australian Democrats oppose. It proposes to add to the numbers on the Australian Tourist Commission, giving representation on the Commission on a rotational basis to both the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was discussing some aspects of tourism in which I have a particular interest, particularly as I was the Minister who, in 1967, brought down the original piece of legislation setting up the Australian Tourist Commission. I was praising the Commission for its success in many areas, particularly for increasing the number of tourists coming from overseas to Australia in the last few years. But then I was critical of the method of operation that it adopts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I was the responsible Minister I laid down guidelines that it would be better promotional activity to bring wholesale travel agents to Australia at the cost of the Commission to show them the magnificent tourist attractions that we have to show to the world market and that we should make that visit of those wholesale travel agents a warm and personal matter. I was putting the view that money is far better spent on that sort of personal treatment, in explaining and showing first-hand to the people who actually sell the travel, than on advertising in journals or on putting out shiny brochures, because the kinds of people who sell travel receive on their desks every day of their lives reams of paper from every country of the world advertising tourist wares. I suppose anything can be dollied up to look interesting in shiny and coloured brochures, but to show something in the flesh to a wholesale travel agent, with all expenses paid and with helpful and personal guidance, in my experience is the best way to sell tourism. I was expressing some disappointment that the Commission's bureaucracy had now grown to 76 fully paid people. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and I am glad that it has. Notwithstanding that, eight very costly offices are maintained throughout the world by the Commission. However, I commend the Commission for doing a fine job. I was also being critical of the Government, which does not seem to realise that if the Commission does a fantastic job and brings tourists to Australia, that flow of tourists, which is a significant earner of foreign exchange, will very soon dry up unless we have the kinds of hotels to cope with the demands of those tourists. One of the views of the Treasury which has never ceased to astonish me-it may be because most people in the heirarchy of the Treasury have never been outside Canberra or worked in the hurly-burly of business life-is that we can turn the flow of tourists on and off like a tap. Therefore, the approach of the Treasury to a Cabinet Minister who is putting forward a proposition for more funds to attract more tourists always seem to be: No, we must not subsidise the fun or the holidays of foreigners. That is a very short-sighted attitude, particularly when economists' dreams of a mineral boom will not solve all our balance of payment problems. The view of academics in the Treasury is that any time we want more tourists we can just pump a bit of money into the publicity machines and the tourist flow will begin again. That is rubbish, because it takes years to build up the good will and the atmosphere in which a country is talked about as a tourist attraction by potential foreign tourists. To think that we can just turn the flow of tourists on and off like a tap, I think, is folly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we want the kinds of hotels which can properly accommodate foreign tourists, we have to encourage people to build them. At the moment the depreciation of buildings is not an allowable deduction for tax purposes, so there is virtually no encouragement to people to build new hotels. To build a hotel now costs about $100,000 per room. If 16 per cent interest is paid on the money borrowed, and assuming a 70 per cent occupancy rate, the cost per room per day is $62 before even one dollar is paid in wages, direct expenses or overheads. The hotel owner has to recoup that amount from the person who stays in the hotel room before he can go any further. For that reason the Democrats very strongly advocate a depreciation allowance of between 10 per cent and 15 per cent on hotel buildings. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, may I comment on the almost catastrophic muddle concerning both internal and external air fares in Australia. I know that it is not an easy problem and I do not want to make cheap political capital by criticising the Government and saying that the problem can be solved easily. But it is beyond my comprehension why the Government, quite properly and wisely, appointed the Holcroft committee to advise it on air fares and, before the commitee's inquiries were complete, dismissed it and then arbitrarily brought down its own findings. We will have more to say about that later in the evening when the Government's reaction to the Holcroft report is being debated in the Senate. Suffice it to say that the Government, without allowing a committee to look into it, has now said: 'We are going to sell Trans-Australia Airlines'. </PARA>
<PARA> On the program PM tonight Senator Rae could not enlighten me-he normally does-as to whom the Govenment will sell TAA and for how much. How many of the shares are to be sold? Will there be a 51 per cent public interest or a 49 per cent public interest? Is Qantas Airways Ltd to be brought into the deal? It seems to me to be a statement entirely appropriate to be made by a government on April Fools' Day. </PARA>
<PARA> Any discussion on tourism would be incomplete without talking about airline policy, but I will not infringe the guidelines of this debate on the Australian Tourist Commission, particularly as the airline policy will be discussed later this evening. I just say that surely consideration should be given to allowing Sir Freddie Laker or someone similar to open up a cut-price air service between London and Australia and between Europe and Australia. We know that Sir Freddie's skytrain service to New York has revolutionised the fare structure of transatlantic travel. Only two months ago both Laker and British Caledonian Airways said they wanted to slash up to 50 per cent off the existing London to Australia fares. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us contemplate for a moment the impact on tourism to Australia from Europe if the air fares were cut by 50 per cent. It would open up a whole new market for tourists to Australia. I hope that vigorous State Premiers, those Premiers who are fortunate enough to be the premier politicians in States with an abundance of tourist attractions-one thinks in a flash of Tasmania, Queensland and other States-can be more aggressive in putting their viewpoints to the Federal Government by saying: 'Is a monopoly or a duopoly to Qantas such a sacred cow that hundreds of thousands of tourists are to be denied access to Australia and to our States to spend their money?' British Caledonian has offered a one-way ticket from London to Perth for only $360. Yet we have a free enterprise government in the form of the Liberal-National Party Government saying: 'No, we will not let you do that. We will preserve at all costs the rights of a nationalised publicly owned airline, Qantas. We do not care about you Australians who want to go from Perth to London for $360. It is more important to preserve the sacred cow'. We have to bear in mind that each passenger costs the airline $250 for fuel alone, so the margins are extremely small. Some say they are disastrously small. But if we believe in a free enterprise system, which the Australian Democrats do, why not let the operators take their chances in the market? For many years Qantas and British Airways have had a cosy monopoly on the London-Australia route. Perhaps it is time they received some form of kick in the pants by being forced to compete on the open market. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats congratulate the Commission on a job well done. We ask the eminent people on the Commission-Captain Ritchie, the Chairman and a very distinguished Australian, and his seven colleagues-to watch the growth of bureaucracy and to give consideration to spending the money, as the Democrats suggest, in the more personalised way of attracting tourists to Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is interesting that, at a time when the Senate has been almost struggling for the lack of business which has been put its way by the Government from the House of Representatives, the Senate has an opportunity to debate a Bill which is totally uncontroversial. Without exception, those who have spoken and those who have taken an interest in the subject have not objected to the substance of the Australian Tourist Commission Amendment Bill. Therefore, I join with those who say: 'Let us take the opportunity provided by this Bill being before the Parliament and before the Senate to talk about some of the wider issues in relation to tourism instead of limiting the debate to the subject of the Bill which is so obviously incontrovertibly uncontroversial. I suppose one could say that the subject matter starts from the fact that the purpose of the Bill is to amend the provisions in relation to the membership and constitution of the Australian Tourist Commission. As nobody wishes to debate that matter and as the reasons for the amendment were set out in detail in the second reading speech of the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) I simply say that I support those concepts and I support the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I proceed now to discuss one or two of the matters which have been raised in the debate, and in particular by Senator Chipp. I well remember two things in relation to Senator Chipp. First of all, I remember that he was, as he has already indicated, the Minister in charge of tourism when it was a relatively embryonic Commonwealth activity back in the latter part of the 1960s when the Australian Tourist Commission was established. I acknowledge his continuing interest. In fact, I well remember that when the Liberal and National Country Party policy on tourism was being established in 1975-it has been followed ever since-one of its very strong supporters was Senator Chipp who was then a member of the shadow Ministry. That policy has continued and has developed in a way which is important to Australia and to the tourist industry in particular. So I approach the suggestions made by Senator Chipp in the light of that background. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we should have regard to the comments made by somebody who has taken a long-standing interest in the problem of an evergrowing bureaucracy instead of spending money on finding ways to make a buck. The Government's intervention in the tourist industry is related to endeavouring to ensure that one of the major growth areas of economic activity in the world is able to be participated in fully by Australians from an employment point of view, from an overseas exchange earnings point of view, a self-satisfaction point of view, a national prestige point of view and from the point of view of a huge variety of matters which come within and are encompassed by the term 'tourism'. </PARA>
<PARA> At times I feel a little concerned that perhaps the criticism made by Senator Chipp about the bureaucracy developing within the Australian Tourist Commission could be an accurate criticism. In contrast to that, I say that in this country we have a need to get some facts. Senator Chipp talked about Treasury's paranoia in relation to the tourist industry and the depreciation allowance. I shall come back to the depreciation allowance, but let me talk firstly about Treasury's paranoia. It took some statistics and some expert economic examination to be able to identify the fact that the tourist industry is worth more to Australia than the motor vehicle industry. It required some of the work which is being done by the boffins and by the bureaucracy to which Senator Chipp referred for that sort of recommendation to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> The most dramatic breakthrough in relation to the tourist industry was in the 1979 Commonwealth Budget. At a time when expenditure on various large areas of activity was being cut there was a recognition, as a result of the work of Professor Johns and others, that tourism was an industry of real significance to this nation. There was a recognition in real terms that the industry needed considerable assistance, encouragement and development. </PARA>
<PARA> In straight money terms, the amount of money provided in relation to tourism by the Commonwealth Government was doubled. But that is not the important point; the important point is that-let us not say it is a matter for credit for anybody in particular-for the first time ever a Commonwealth government said: 'We are interested in tourism because it is a major, important national industry which can change the nature of employment opportunities and the nature of economic activity in Australia, and it can be good for the nation in many ways'. I thought that 1979 was a very significant year in relation to tourism and the Australian Tourist Commission. Many honourable senators might recognise that I have not been renowned as the greatest lover of the growth of bureaucracies, statutory authorities and other organisations to fulfil functions when there is no system of checks and balances. </PARA>

It had to go through the necessary reconsideration of what is and what is not essential. It is fulfilling many important purposes at the moment in that it is starting to do some of the necessary research, definition and statistical preparation and compilation of programs. I would not wish to be taken as arguing for a massive increase in the composition of the Commission, nor would I wish to be taken as arguing against the proposition which Senator Chipp put, which I urge honourable senators and the Government to think about; that is, if you want to con somebody into believing that you have something to sell, bring it out and show it to them.

I make the point that one can criticise the undue development of many bureaucracies in Australia, but I think the Australian Tourist Commission is, at least at the moment-maybe it needs review next year; most of them need review every year-fulfilling a very useful function in that it is trying to develop a very underdeveloped area in which one of the greatest problems was the lack of information. The most important task of the Commission, apart from just selling Australia overseas, is providing us with some of the information in relation to Australian tourism which has not been available over the years. The results have been dramatic. Australia is now starting to catch up from where it was losing out. We were having a percentage decline in our share of the Pacific tourist activity. We were having a percentage decline in the growth in the number of overseas visitors to this nation. As a result of a variety of measures and the activities of the Commission we have now seen one of the most dramatic growths that we have witnessed in any area of activity in this nation. In the last three years tourism has grown more than any other industry. I cannot think of nor have I heard of another industry that has grown so much.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator RAE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chipp makes the point that the growth in the tax avoidance industry is about equal. I had thought that growth in tax avoidance was probably of longer standing than growth in the tourist industry. The tourist industry depends upon a degree of tax avoidance inasmuch as many tourists are encouraged to travel to attend a convention or like activities because the taxpayer contributes through taxation deduction provisions relating to such travel. I do not want to go on to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The general recognition of the importance of the tourist industry is one of the dramatic features of this industry over the past few years. I acknowledge that one of the early battlers for the industry was Senator Chipp. But I do not think his criticism of the current situation is entirely fair. I think the industry has developed. The present Government did a great deal in 1979 to take it a stage further but the fact is that the industry has got itself together in a way which has meant that we have seen a huge and dramatic growth. The worst feature that is affecting the tourist industry is the aspect which affects my State of Tasmania. It will affect the whole of the Australian tourist industry if we are not careful. People did not go in droves to Tasmania this past summer. The reason they did not go was not that they did not wish to go but they were too frightened because industrial disturbances meant that the return voyage by air or by sea was uncertain. We had tremendous turmoil within the airline industry in particular. In Tasmania over the past summer cancellations in various areas reached 40 per cent to 60 per cent. There was a huge number of cancellations. That was a fairly dramatic situation. There is no justification for Australians sitting back, relaxing and saying: 'It will not happen to us as a nation and we do not really have to worry about Tasmania'. We should worry about the Tasmanian tourist industry. It is extremely important to that State. We also should worry about the Australian tourist industry and provide a reasonable degree of certainty that the people who visit us will not find themselves stranded, virtually hijacked, by industrial disputes when they arrive here. While not disagreeing with most of what Senator Chipp said, let me add that factor as a rather important consideration in any discussion about the tourist industry. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator RAE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. I pose this question: Is it not better sometimes to take one step at a time? The first and most important step, if we want to have a debate on an effective domestic airline policy, is to look at structures and to get them organised so that we then have options. To me the first step that has been taken in restructuring TAA as a public company is a tremendously important step before we start to get on to the rest of the debate. I have views as to the direction to follow and many others also may have views. But at least by using the public company structure for this statutory authority we can say: 'All right, let us now start to see where the public debate goes as to what is the operating advantage to the whole of the Commonwealth by taking it one step or another toward deregulation'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to the sacred cow to which reference was made-that is, Qantas Airways Ltd-let me put in a word in defence of Qantas. Whilst I would like to see increasing deregulation in relation to international airlines, I do not recall that during the period Senator Chipp was involved in tourism as a Minister he was able to solve the problem. I am not sure that anyone in Australia will individually solve, by unilateral action within Australia, the problem of the international airlines. I think the position of Qantas as Australia's flag carrier has to be looked at from the point of view of what are the prevailing international air transport agreements and conditions and what we can do to change its position steadily. Again, without differing greatly on the objects that Senator Chipp was talking about-that is, it would be highly desirable to give Australians the opportunity to travel cheaply overseas and to give overseas people the opportunity to come to Australia as cheaply as possible-let us also bear in mind that it is essential that we have in Australia a regular, scheduled, reliable and safe airline service that is well run. I think for the time being we perhaps have to bear with Qantas more than we have to bear with some of the things over which we have greater control such as the domestic airline situation. It does not mean we should not, at the international level, be saying: 'Let us push for change'. But before we rush into it, let us have regard to retaining the opportunity to have dependable, regular transport to and from this country for the benefit of both the tourist industry and our total economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad we have had an opportunity to talk very briefly about tourisim. I hope the Senate might consider it is a good idea to talk about tourism a little more. It is one of the growing industries which is becoming more and more important in Australia. I can only be encouraged by the fact that it seems to be receiving a little more attention now than it did in past years. The fears that Senator Chipp expressed about the Treasury attitude to what perhaps was regarded as a frivolous industry are no longer prevailing. Tourism is regarded as a major industry in this nation which can be a major contributor to providing, in particular, opportunities for employment. I just throw out without debate the suggestion that until such time as the problem of penalty rates in the tourist industry is overcome we will not have major development in the industry in the way that I think would be possible were we able to overcome this problem. I support the Bill. </PARA>

We would like to make a company structure come within the general conditions and provisions of the companies Act' and then leave it flexible as to whether it ought to be structured in one way or another? I hope that the Minister's answer will be that the matter is now, subject for discussion, debate and input as to how it ought to be structured. One of the things that I hope will happen is that the people who believe participation by employees is important in Australia will have their chance to say at this time: 'Let the employees have a cut of the cake. Give a lead'. I would hope that those who would say that Trans-Australia Airlines ought to be 100 per cent owned by the Government will have their opportunity to say why they believe that is so. I would hope that those who would say that whatever happens to it it should not be totally controlled or open to control by any of the existing major transport operators or by any foreign takeover will have their opportunity to make their input.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Harradine says, why not Qantas? Indeed, why not Qantas? This is the magnitude of the problem we are discussing here tonight. I asked the question: Did the Minister have any further information on how that sale would proceed? Would it be 51 per cent interest retained by the Government and 49 per cent sold to other people? That would be one situation because then the Government would maintain a controlling interest and we would have a two-airline policy essentially as we have it today. I also asked whether it would be the other way round-49 per cent retained by the Government and 51 per cent going to ordinary shareholders, employees or whoever? I further asked whether it meant that 100 per cent would be sold, put on the open market, which would then mean that TAA as we know it now would be at the mercy of predators of the like of the gentleman who sat in this Gallery 10 minutes ago and who was escorted around Parliament House tonight by four Liberal Ministers. Has the word got out already that TAA is up for grabs? I would think these are not matters of detail. These are matters of fundamental principle.

The two questions are totally separable. One is related to efficiency and opportunity and the other is related to how best we then apply the opportunities which have been created. For anyone to suggest that the two have to be melded together and that it is inappropriate for the Government to have announced the first without announcing the detail of the second is to indicate that the idea of participatory democracy in this country is dead. I like to think of this as an example, which may have come about deliberately and which may not have come about deliberately, of how people, having seen the announcement of the first step to be taken-a step which can only be the first instance of simple restructuring as a public company instead of a statutory authority, and then having the Government own 100 per cent of the shares-have an opportunity to participate in the discussion as to what might happen thereafter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the light of your ruling, Mr Temporary Chairman, I find it rather hard to do what I would like to do, which is to reply to one or two of the interjections. I wonder whether we could endeavour to have a debate on this matter at the earliest opportunity. Within the limits of your ruling, I suggest that in relation to the Australian Tourist Commission it is important that we have two or more airlines operating in Australia. It is important that our domestic airlines be efficient. It is important to give some thought to whether the airline operator structures are effective for the purpose. One aspect I would have thought of as important was whether the employees, the people engaged in the operations, feel involved and are participating in the general development of the nation. Presumably the airline industry will have the opportunity to develop along with the rest of the nation. I would like to think that the employees of one at least of our airlines have the most direct opportunity to participate in the purchase of shares in the airline.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are many plans, including one put by Mr Louis Kelso of the United States, which have provided means by which employees can obtain a shareholding in a company without having to provide capital directly out of their own savings but rather by taking out loans to be repaid out of future dividends. This is a complicated system which I will not go into because it may not be relevant to the debate. There are ample opportunities for being able to achieve the objective to which I refer which will make more efficient the provision of an airline system in Australia and which will make more effective the opportunities for development of the Australian tourist industry. Mr Temporary Chairman, I guess I cannot go much further. </PARA>

<PARA> That the amendments made by the House of Representatives be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 18 in the Schedule of the Bill fixes maximum amounts payable in respect of costs certificates granted pursuant to the Bill. During the second reading debate on the Bill on 3 December 1980 a question was raised by Senator Evans as to the effect of these limits in the case of retrials. The Government has examined this question further and has come to the view that in the case of retrial special considerations apply. For example, when a trial cannot be completed because of the death of a judge it is not appropriate that the amount available pursuant to a cost certificate granted in respect of that trial should be subject to normal limits. Similar considerations apply when an appellant court considers a new trial in criminal proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the amendments made in the other place is to remove the limits on the amounts payable for cost certificates granted in respect of aborted or discontinued proceedings and in respect of new trials in criminal proceedings. These amendments are based upon the provisions of the New South Wales legislation. The costing in relation to this measure was based on the New South Wales experience. Although all other States do not have the particular provisions that are now proposed in these amendments, nevertheless in the Government's view it is appropriate that our legislation should approximate the New South Wales situation. I trust that the amendments which have been made in another place and which are now proposed in this chamber are agreed to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Federal Proceedings (Costs) Bill 1980, which has been returned to the Senate, concerns the payment of costs in certain Federal Court cases where those costs are incurred as a result of circumstances beyond the control of any individual litigant. The basic limits which the Schedule to the Bill sets on the costs thus payable are as follows: For the High Court of Australia, $5,000; the Federal Court, $3,000; the Family Court, $2,000; the Supreme Court of a Territory, $3,000, and any other court of a Territory, $1,000. The effect of the amendments which come before us tonight is, as the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) says, to remove those prescribed maximum limits in two circumstances. The first circumstance is where a retrial is ordered following a successful appeal in a criminal matter and the second is where the proceedings in question are rendered abortive by reason of the death or illness of the judge. Costs incurred up to the time that the trial is so disrupted must be reincurred. Those costs can, of course, be quite significant in a particular case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition welcomes and supports this amendment which, as the Attorney-General says, goes a long way towards picking up some points made by us when the Bill was first before the chamber last December. It gives us a small measure of satisfaction to know that some of the criticisms and suggestions that we make in this place from time to time are taken seriously and that some of them at least result in amendments being brought forward. It does not happen often enough to make the so-called legislative process in this Parliament other than a charade most of the time, but it is a pleasant surprise when it does. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are a couple of questions that I raise for the Attorney's attention and to which the Opposition would appreciate answers. The first question is: In the case of a retrial why is the amendment limited to criminal cases only? From time to time there can be an order for retrial in a civil case and, although this is likely to be rarer than in the criminal context, a civil trial, thus reordered, can be a pretty expensive business too. The other question is: Why is there any ceiling at all in respect of the costs of other sorts of hearings covered by this Bill-namely, the appeals-when those costs are incurred, again through no fault of the individual litigant in question?</PARA>
<PARA> This matter was raised by the Law Council of Australia in its letter of 28 January to the Attorney, subsequently made public, and to the effect that the appellant court costs are very high and that the figures which I have mentioned and which are set out in the Schedule to the Bill may be unrealistically low, not just for the classes of cases that are covered in this amendment but for all classes of cases. Secondly, I refer to the extent to which there is some control over the costs that can thus be paid out through the requirement that they be taxed; that is to say, vetted. That arguably would seem to be a sufficient limitation to ensure that public moneys were not unnecessarily squandered. This question was raised in the original debate very specifically, if not by me in this place certainly by Mr Bowen in the other place, and it is a question that was not very satisfactorily answered. Perhaps the Attorney can take this opportunity tonight to indicate why ceilings have been set at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining matter that the Opposition wishes to mention at this time is the continued absence from the explicit terms of this Bill of a provision to enable the recovery of costs where new proceedings are ordered in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. No doubt the Attorney will recall that this was another matter raised by me in this place last December and was one to which the Attorney said he would give further consideration. Having had four months to consider that question and to contemplate the injustices that might be rort to an individual litigant where he goes down on a point of law on appeal and a new proceeding is ordered in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, can he indicate why he has brought forward no amendment to cover that contingency?</PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that I and the Opposition welcome at least the limited flexibility and sensitivity which has been shown by the Government on this occasion. I am sorry if the Attorney-General thinks my praise for this legislative initiative is still rather less fulsome, but being the gentleman he undoubtedly is, no doubt he will acknowledge that that kind of praise is better than no praise at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am thankful for even the faintest praise from Senator Evans. I have been in politics long enough not to live on any form of praise, faint or otherwise; one tries to do things as best one can in all the difficult circumstances of ones life. I think the matters raised by Senator Evans are substantial ones. If we lived in a world in which we did not have to worry about the costs involved and the liabilities that governments are assuming, I think I would not have much difficulty in agreeing that it would be desirable that these matters be covered in legislation of this kind. As I have said previously, the Government took decisions in regard to this measure which is, I think, a valuable extension of the rights which litigants have in State courts and which have not been available to them in Federal courts. In cases of aborted trials or where new trials have been ordered in criminal cases, the costs will be met out of the public purse and will not be an additional cost for the litigant in circumstances where he was not responsible for the cost being incurred; for example, because the judge died or a rehearing was ordered through no fault of the litigant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In deciding to apply these provisions which are, as I have said, available in State and Federal courts, the Commonwealth was concerned, first of all, with what the cost of the measure would be. After looking at the various costs incurred in the State area, we estimated the cost on the basis of the New South Wales legislation and the costs that have been incurred in that State. Of course we are not sure whether these costs will be mirrored in the Federal courts but we thought that that was a fair method of comparison. The further consideration which the Government gave to the Bill after the Senate debate indicated that it was more restrictive than the New South Wales legislation. These amendments have been designed to bring it up to the standard of the New South Wales legislation. I think it covers the most important situations. Admittedly it does not cover, as Senator Evans says, the costs incurred by a retrial in civil proceedings, and of course civil proceedings are ordered from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> However, as we know, in civil proceedings costs are awarded on the basis of the outcome, or costs follow the event as lawyers say. Although there would be additional costs as a result of a retrial, total costs likely to be incurred in proceedings are difficult to estimate and litigants who embark upon civil proceedings must take these matters into account. That is one of the chances that they take when embarking on civil litigation. I do not think anything like the sort of injustice that may arise in the case of a retrial in civil proceedings would arise in criminal proceedings where the accused, unless he obtains legal aid, is obliged to meet the costs. In the cases that we envisage here he would be liable for the costs twice over. That is the explanation of that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe all States have ceilings on costs in appeal cases. Certainly New South Wales has them. Therefore, if we were to embark upon a scheme of this kind without ceilings we may incur expenditure which is in excess of the estimated expenditure. We have provided in the Bill for the ceilings to be changed by regulation. If they prove to be too low, too restrictive, then the means are clearly available for us to change them. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is concerned, there is no ready comparison with the New South Wales situation. As I pointed out earlier, a section of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act enables a litigant in that Tribunal, who is liable to pay only his own costs and not those of the other side, and who is suffering hardship, to apply to the Attorney-General for a certificate. Certainly, it will be possible to accommodate the hardship cases in the AAT under that provision. I say again that we would like to see how the legislation works in practice. If people suffer hardships or injustices in the course of the experience we have with this legislation, naturally we will be prepared to look at it again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take the opportunity of congratulating the Treasurer (Mr Howard) on his statement to the House of Representatives explaining in detail the Government's reasons for not proceeding with a broad-based indirect tax. This statement has afforded the Parliament the opportunity of debating tax issues of our day. I doubt whether such a debate could bring about a general consensus within this Parliament. It is true that we all seek a degree of tax reform but the direction in which that tax reform is to go, I believe, is a point of major difference. For example, some years ago our Government rightly eliminated gift and death duties but I believe that in so doing it has created a gap within our tax system which can be filled only by some form of capital gains tax. I believe that this gap remains fairly significant in the context of formulating measures to counter tax avoidance. I think it is true, however, that to derive any credible amount of revenue from any sort of capital gains tax the rates would have to be pitched fairly high. I think this is one of the main reasons why successive governments have not proceeded on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our tax code nowadays is not only cumbersome but is also very bulky in content. It represents many years of attempts by governments not only to widen the scope of the receipts that come within the ambit of income tax but also to cover up loopholes which have been discovered by astute tax evaders and avoiders and their advisers. It is unfortunate that the tax avoidance and tax evasion industries-I distinguished between the two-have become quite rampant. There is a general feeling in the community that people on very high incomes are now being placed in a situation in which, because of the advice that can be offered to them by astute taxation accountants, the amount of tax they pay is really an option which is open to them, rather than being a certain amount according to the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most disconcerting features of the tax avoidance and tax evasion industries nowadays is the degree to which some people will go to evade or to avoid tax. For this reason last year we introduced severe penalties under the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act-$50,000 and up to five years gaol-for tax evaders and their advisers who prevent the collection of lawfully payable tax. The Senate may recall such abhorrent schemes as the bottom of the harbour type schemes under which books were literally destroyed. The Government has been very active in attempting to cover up many of the loopholes. For example, since 1977 John Howard has introduced nine Bills which cover something like 24 legislative measures to counter tax avoidance. In addition he has had amendments made to the Sales Tax Acts to cover loopholes which also have been discovered by these so-called taxation accountants. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is true. This is not the end of the matter. John Howard intends to go even further. I believe that shortly legislation will be introduced into this chamber to deal with certain problems of transfer pricing. I understand that John Howard intends to amend section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act to deal with transfer pricing. I think the community can appreciate the problem of transfer pricing. It can be used very readily by international companies that operate in Australia. They take out at cost certain raw materials in proportion to their share of equity capital. They are then taken to a tax haven where they are introduced into a new company at a very much higher cost. I think we are all familiar with the problems incurred by the Icelandic Government. It is believed that there was a discrepancy of approximately $47m over a number of years between the price paid for material being taken out of Australia and the price paid upon entry to Iceland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Not only is the Government to amend section 136 to deal with transfer pricing but also there is to be a complete rewriting of section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act to cover the overall catch-all situation whereby schemes which are designed to avoid tax shall be rendered null and void in the view of the Commissioners. I think we all look forward to the early introduction into the Parliament of legislation to that effect. Not only is the Government to amend section 136 and section 260 but it will also legislate following the profits made by the Bell group of companies through its using the technique of buying into the Elder Smith company through a shelf company, lending that shelf company money and then selling the shelf company. Of course, the shares would not be sold within 12 months and even the company may not be sold within 12 months because, after all, it is a shelf company. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point that Senator Messner rightly makes-he has beaten me to it-is that there is a strong view within the Australian Taxation Office that section 26A should catch this practice. After all, I think the intentions are clear. It was not the first such occasion. Intentions are often manifested by subsequent actions. There has been a repetition of this sort of technique. It think there have been something like four such actions. The Senate will be interested to learn that on the last occasion a profit of something like $16m was made. It is in the interests of the Commonwealth to catch up on this sort of activity. I can foresee changes to section 26A, and possibly to section 25, to clear any possible shadow of doubt there may be about the activities of these sorts of operators who try to exploit loopholes and to deny ordinary citizens-ordinary wage earners-an opportunity of securing reasonable relief from the fairly high marginal tax rates that they are paying at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must admit that I am a little disappointed that the Government has not seen fit to give itself the opportunity of embarking on a program of tax reform by the introduction of a broad-based indirect tax. I am not referring to a value added tax; I am not referring to a retail turnover tax. I think there could have been an opportunity for the Government to improve the whole taxation system by extending this tax to cover certain service areas. After all, Australia places a fairly high reliance on the collection of personal income tax. Such heavy reliance is not good in bringing about an environment which would provide people with an incentive to earn. I think that is important as we have a growing economy in Australia. We must try to create an environment in which the small investors of Australia will be prepared to invest in the resources of this country. For example, the present system of double taxation of dividends does not encourage any investor, let alone the small investor, to put his money into some of these projects and companies which are operating in Australia and which are seeking money so that funds can remain in Australia for the great benefit of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> We must, in our income tax system, encourage people to save. Unfortunately for this current generation, with its emphasis on hire purchase and the consumer orientated society, we have got away from the idea of thrift and the values and moralities that thrift tends to generate in the community. I suggest that rather than moving initially on this issue of trying to eliminate double taxation of dividends-I would like to see that come about a little further along the road-as a first step we try to encourage the small man. We should encourage the small man by exempting from income tax the first $2,000 of dividend and interest income. </PARA>
<PARA> Just think what such a measure would do to solve some of the heartache and heartburn of the pensioners of Australia. Those are the people who suddenly discover that by investing astutely or by getting a little higher interest rate as a result of what is going on at the moment they have come into a category where their pension is suddenly cut back. They are advised that because of their extra $100 income their pension will suddenly go down. Even worse still are the poor people who suddenly discover they are no longer entitled to fringe benefits. Sometimes the fringe benefits are worth far more to pensioners than the possible reduction in pension. Not only would such an exemption help the pensioners but also it would encourage the young. It would encourage all people in the community to invest in Australia. More importantly, it would encourage a degree of thrift and less reliance on this syndrome of spending up today because tomorrow will look after itself. If we could encourage this idea of personal thrift, et cetera, I believe our country would be certainly very much more stable than it is at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> By forgoing an opportunity of moving into a form of indirect tax I believe we have forgone an opportunity of saving the family situation in Australia. I have talked about the small person who wants to save, but the person with a young family finds it increasingly difficult to balance his budget nowadays. I think there is now room for an increase in the spouse allowance. We have talked about taxing the family unit, but I think it would be better to increase the spouse rebate from $800 to at least $1,200 and, at the same time, to do something about family allowances. In Australia we want Australian families to be encouraged to raise their own families. We have to recognise that we have responsibilities in the wider world because of refugees. We have to take our share of people. We should realise what is happening in some centres of England where 20 per cent or even 30 per cent of new births are of coloured people. </PARA>
<PARA> Inevitably this situation will arise in Australia because of the greater migration of people from the East and elsewhere. While the traditional settlers of Australia are tending to limit their families, some of these newer people are tending to have larger families. If we wish to retain our Australian character for a longer period I believe we also have to take into consideration the provision of an appropriate allowance to Australian families so that the mother can be at home to assist where possible in raising the children. I recognise that in many circumstances the wife has to go to work. Taxing the family as a unit does not recognise the situation that many family groups are outside the traditional marriage state. There is a very heavy bias against the single parent family. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me come back to the aspect I was discussing. Australia does very well in the field of taxation when compared with the rest of the world. Do not let my recent statements counter the recognition of that fact. If we look at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development figures in respect of 1978, the latest year for which figures are available, we find that total tax at all levels by governments as a percentage of gross domestic product in the 22 OECD countries that were under examination averaged something like 35.8 per cent. This is the percentage of total taxes to GDP. In Australia the figure was only 28.8 per cent. In fact, as we have been reminded, only four countries have a lower overall tax burden than Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Government was also instrumental in reducing the impact of tax quite severely. It reduced from seven steps to three the progressive rate in tax scales. I notice that my colleague, Senator Flo Bjelke-Petersen, is not in the chamber. I think she would advocate a reduction to one step. If we had a flat tax of 20 per cent that would fail to recognise two very important principles of taxation. They are principles of equity. In fact, there has to be a horizontal equity and a vertical equity. The horizontal principle recognises that people on the same amount of income pay the same amount of tax. We know that in Australia that does not apply. We also have to recognise that people on a higher income have a greater ability to pay tax. Therefore, we must also have a vertical equity. I believe this factor was lost sight of in the recent campaign in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, I think we must acknowledge that Australia raises 43.7 per cent of its tax through personal income tax. In this we can be compared with the OECD average of 38.5 per cent. Australia's heavy reliance on personal income tax can be further seen when we examine figures for the last 20 years. We have come to rely very heavily on this personal direct tax. In 1959-60 personal and company taxes accounted for 54 per cent of Commonwealth taxation revenue. Personal taxation revenue was then 35.6 per cent. Estimated figures for 1980-81 show almost 60 per cent for personal and company taxes and 35.6 per cent for personal income tax. Had it not been for the crude oil levy, which has risen fairly sharply in recent years to yield an estimated 10.6 per cent of total Commonwealth revenues at this point in time, those figures would have been very much higher. I realise that the community is not anxious to have introduced new taxes. In fact, its reluctance is fairly evident when one speaks to the ordinary wage earner or businessman. He says that the Government should make sure that other elements of taxation are cut out before it starts introducing new taxes. History has shown that it is very easy to introduce a new tax but it is very hard to take away an old one. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly would like to see a committee of this Parliament investigate avenues of taxation reform on a non-party basis. I realise that obtaining a consensus will be very difficult, but I think the information that could be provided could give a few pearls of wisdom and somehow we may be able to unscramble the very difficult and thick Income Tax Assessment Act which we have at present. The Income Tax Assessment Act is becoming so technical in many areas that only the most astute of tax accountants are able to understand it. I think that is bad. We should seek simplicity as well as equity in our Act. An Act that is understood easily by people is very much respected. These are the directions we should be aiming for in the future. I commend John Howard's initiative in presenting this paper to the Parliament and allowing us the opportunity to discuss such matters in an endeavour to bring about a taxation reform to the greater benefit of the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; As I am not on the list of speakers for this debate and as honourable senators are well aware of the attitude I have adopted over a long period on the question of reforms in taxation and also support of the family, I do not intend to keep the Senate very long. Many of the points raised by Senator Watson get very much to the bone of the matter. I wish, in the very short time that I have set myself, to refer to the part of the statement of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) which compares the tax payable by single-income families with the tax payable by two-income families. As an example, the Treasurer pointed out that on an income of $10,000 the single-income family pays $1,107 in tax and the dual-income family pays $614-a difference of $493. On an income of $20,000, the single-income family pays $4,693 in tax and the dual-income family pays $3,814. The single-income family pays $879 more tax than the dual-income family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that all families have been seen off. As Senator Watson has pointed out, the proportion of tax paid by pay-as-you-earn taxpayers-the individuals-to the total revenue has increased over the year and the proportion paid by companies has decreased. I simply mention that I believe it is time that the Government honoured its promise given some days before the last election to do something in support of the family. I will now quote from the latest bulletin of the Australian Industries Development Association of March 1981, which dealt very briefly with assistance to families. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Until the 1975 (Hayden) Budget, taxpayers were permitted to claim a concessional deduction from their income in respect of children. This enabled a higher effective rebate to higher income earners. In the Hayden Budget these deductions were converted to rebates, and within a year (in May 1976) the Government achieved a social reform by making the payments for children allowances directly to women and removing the assistance from the tax or rebate system entirely. </PARA>
<PARA> In one sense, there is an artificial growth in this component of Government expenditure-some part of the outlays were previously disguised as a tax rebate or concessional deduction. But at least the nominal rates of payment have remained fixed over the last five years, and the underlying population of children and student dependants has remained relatively fixed or has even slightly declined. This is a rarity within the social welfare field where, through the 1970s, all the other categories have grown rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA> The family allowance scheme is the subject of substantial political discussion. There are strong pressures to go further in this direction arising from the erosion in the value of these family allowances, and from the pressures on single earner households. Peculiarities of the Australian taxation system impose a substantial burden on single income households or those which have not yet found the way of splitting incomes. In addition there are pressures because the rates of payments have not been increased for such a long period. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Industries Development Association has also joined in the demand that the Government take some action. It is all very well to say that these matters should be determined in a budgetary context. That would be okay if families were caught with higher prices only once a year, but even the Government's decision in respect of the bond rate interest will presumably have an effect on mortgage payments for home owners. On 15 October 1980, days before the Federal election, Mr Fraser made a promise, in Launceston, Tasmania, about supporting the families. News of that promise was spread throughout the length and breadth of Australia. It was made in the context of debate on the Government's oil pricing policies. An article appearing in the Australian of 16 October was headed 'Fraser pledges to give back petrol price rises as rebates or family allowances: OPEC increases will fund tax cuts: Prime Minister says priority to return money to the people'. It read:</PARA>
<PARA> In a dramatic bid to counter the vote-winning Labor pledge of cheap petrol the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, last night promised to return revenue from increased petrol prices next year to the public in the shape of tax cuts or higher family allowances. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer's statement obviously precludes at this point any tax cuts. The Government should immediately honour its promise. As I understood it, that promise, boiled down, was that increases in the crude oil levy from 1 January 1981 would be returned in the fashion mentioned. Those increases will return to the Government, on the Treasurer's own figures, $170m this half year. That figure means that from 1 January 1981 the Government would have been able to increase family allowances by about 38 per cent. The money is flowing in the back door. It should be flowing now out the front door in accordance with those promises. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, the Senate is perfectly well aware of my position. I have spoken upon this matter many times. I have discussed the matter with the Government and urged it to do something about it immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Budget it can then turn its attentions to the other proposals for income splitting and increasing the spouse rebate. However, one thing is certain, and I think it is generally agreed by all honourable senators on both sides of the Parliament. Something needs to be done urgently in support of the family, and I commend that action to the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is significant that no remarks have been made about the various taxation issues that the Labor Party raised in other places, particularly before the last election. However, one or two matters that were mentioned tonight I think are important, and certainly Senator Watson and Senator Harradine have referred to them. The first relates to the anti-avoidance provisions the Government has introduced in recent times, and it is significant to note that those issues have received a lot of attention in the media. Indeed, from time to time the various abuses of the system have been drawn to the Government's attention by the media as well as by members of the Government parties and, I believe, by members of the Opposition. I certainly do not claim that members of the Opposition have no interest in pursuing the tax avoidance question.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is one aspect of the statement, and I believe it to be a very important one. It was an issue in the last election, and I think Senator Grimes's party drew particular attention to the matter. The Government can rightly claim credit for having taken action when the matters were brought to its attention. In respect of the anti-avoidance provisions, Senator Watson raised numerous matters, and I might refer to one or two of them. In particular, I recall the action taken back in 1978 in regard to the Curran case. At that stage of the game a very virulent form of tax avoidance was being undertaken in the community, costing literally hundreds of millions of dollars. The Government had support from all sides of the Parliament in taking action on what was a significant issue. The action involved a degree of retrospectivity, which was a very significant breakthrough at that time. Obviously, it is in the interests of the taxpayer generally to ensure that those people who are paying tax through the pay-as-you-earn system receive the greatest amount of credit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One other matter mentioned-certainly it was made clear by Senator Watson in his remarks-was the question of whether there ought to be a change to a greater emphasis on indirect taxation in our system. Senator Watson sought to make the point that in this country indirect taxes produce a lower proportion of total revenues to the Commonwealth Government than do direct forms of taxation. It is well known that in some countries-I instance France and, for that matter, the United States-there is a very high reliance on indirect taxation. In the United Kingdom the rate of value-added tax is as high as 15 per cent. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator MacGibbon" NAMEID="YH4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is 15 per cent on all goods and services sold in the community. In France the rate is somewhat different but, on the average, it is of the order of 10 per cent to 12 per cent. However, a more complex system is employed in that country. Nevertheless, the fact remains that in those countries there is less reliance on personal income tax and far heavier reliance on indirect taxes in the form of value-added taxes in particular. Countries such as the United States have more complex arrangements involving the States at the local level, particularly with regard to retail turnover tax arrangements, and again I think Senator Watson mentioned that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Limiting the effect of indirect taxation increases upon the inflation rate is probably one of the most significant problems our economy will face in the next few years, and that has been referred to by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in his statement and from time to time by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and other Ministers. In recent months there has been a very significant change in the inflation picture in this country compared with that for the rest of the world. It seems that at present the United Kingdom and the United States have rapidly declining rates of inflation. That must not be met with an increasing rate of inflation in this country if we are to maintain the growth in our economy that is starting to show up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had no intention of speaking in the debate on this statement, nor will I detain the Senate for very long, but I must speak in view of Senator Messner's words, which I believe were most unfortunate. I point out that Senator Messner was not the Minister who introduced this statement. He was not in the chamber when the statement was read, and one could claim equally that he had no interest in the subject because of that. He implied quite clearly tonight that because there were no speakers from the Labor side of the House we were not interested. There were no speakers from this side because Senator Walsh, our spokesman in this House on these matters, spoke when the statement was put down. A speakers' list was arranged tonight between the Whips. Senator Harradine asked both sides whether he could make a contribution and both sides agreed that he could. Therefore, Senator Messner's remarks were quite uncalled for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask Senator Messner to take back to his colleague Mr Howard the thoughts given tonight in this chamber by Senator Watson. Firstly, he said that Australia is not a highly taxed country. In fact only four countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development are taxed less than Australia. Secondly, he advocated increases in the family allowance to support families with children because parenthood quite frequently causes economic strife in families in this country, particularly low income families and families on benefits and pensions. Thirdly, he advocated other increases in expenditure such as an increase in the spouse allowance. I suggest that if the Treasurer considers whether we are such a highly taxed country, as Senator Messner and his colleagues have been trying to tell us for the last five years, and whether he can at the same time advocate increased government expenditure without doing something about those taxes, he may find himself in somewhat of a dilemma in view of the rhetoric that he has used in the last five years. I entered this debate merely to point out that the reason there were no Opposition speakers tonight on this matter was an arrangement with the Government to suit the Government's legislative program. Remarks such as those which Senator Messner made, when he knew he was on the air and thought he could score a few cheap points, are quite unworthy of him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 March last week I spoke for two minutes in support of the Government with regard to the B52 agreement, the provisions of which are that the United States Air Force will be allowed to stage a certain number of aircraft through Darwin for surveillance purposes over the Indian Ocean. I said that I welcomed that agreement. I outlined what it provided. I felt it necessary to do that in some detail because I realised, after listening to the contributions of Opposition speakers to the debate, that either they had not read the agreement or they failed to comprehend what was in it. I was talking about sub-paragraph (V) and sub-paragraph (VI) when the debate was interrupted. Sub-paragraph (V) provides:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Irrespective of financial arrangements agreed between the two Governments, RAAF Base Darwin shall remain an Australian facility under Australian control.</PARA>
<PARA>Sub-paragraph (VI) provides:</PARA>
<PARA> No circumstances arising from this Agreement shall affect the title of the Government of Australia to the relevant land, or the pre-existing authority of the Government of Australia in the use of RAAF Base Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a very important point in the agreement because I see the alliance with the United States as a partnership between Australia and the United States. I do not see it in terms of dominant and subservient roles. I see it as a partnership between two free and equal partners. As I hold that belief, it becomes very important to me that we retain Australian sovereignty over those bases. That is why we should pay for the developments. I think it most unwise to follow the Opposition's suggestion that the Americans pay for the base facilities that they use in this country. They are Australian property and it is very much in our interests to maintain our sovereignty, particularly in a commercial way. </PARA>
<PARA> When the verbiage is stripped away from the Opposition's case, we find that it is making two central points of criticism about the agreement. The first point the Opposition makes is that either Australia or Darwin has become a nuclear target overnight by virtue of the agreement. Its second point of concern is that the United States Air Force will load the B52 aircraft with ordnance, presumably nuclear ordnance, when they go through Darwin. I find both these points unacceptable. Let me deal, first of all, with the point that Darwin has suddenly become a nuclear target. The previous speaker, Senator Mason from the Australian Democrats, made much of this point. The charges he made were quite untrue. I quote verbatim from his speech. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>It was very much a burning question in Darwin last week; everybody was talking about it. </PARA>
<PARA>Madam Acting Deputy President, you and I were in Darwin at the same time as Senator Mason, as were Senator Townley and Senator Jessop from this side of the chamber. Senator Mason's statement is nonsensical and blatantly untrue. In all the time I spent in Darwin during that week no one raised the matter with me, let alone commented on it. I think it quite unjustifiable for Senator Mason to fabricate sheer political propaganda in the way he did in his speech last week. The truth is that Darwin is no more at risk today, after the agreement has been signed, than it was before. Now that we have signed this agreement to allow B52s to stage through Darwin, there is no greater liability of an attack on Australia than there was previously under the commitments we had under the ANZUS pact. Let us be perfectly clear about this. We have a liability of attack by virtue of the ANZUS agreement. Inevitably responsibilities are involved in that treaty commitment, and they are responsibilities that we as Australians are prepared to honour because the advantages we gain from the commitment far outweigh the risks. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we gain from the ANZUS treaty with the United States? We gain in three broad categories of value to Australia. First of all, we gain the great value of deterrence that the treaty provides. The fact that Australia is bound to the United States in a mutual defence treaty means that other people who might have aggressive intentions towards this country have to take that treaty into account and will be deterred to some degree by its existence. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The effect of that deterrent cannot be measured in mere words, Senator Grimes. The second great advantage that the ANZUS treaty provides for Australia is the transfer of intelligence information. Australia is a small country with limited resources, but by being a partner to the ANZUS agreement we gain a great deal of intelligence information from United States sources that would not normally be available to us. The third value to us of the ANZUS treaty is technical information with regard to armaments and weapons systems. Again this information would not be available to us through our own resources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unquestionably the Australian public have supported the ANZUS treaty since its inception. There has never been any significant Australian opposition to that treaty, I am proud to say. Yet the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats have set out to destroy the treaty by the air of mistrust that they have shown towards this agreement. They have consistently doubted the integrity of the American position with respect to this agreement. I think the Press reports at the weekend, in which the United States Government was reported to be saying publicly that it found the position of the Labor Party and of the Australian Democrats unacceptable, are witness to the danger to the alliance of their position. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that all alliances have risks. In 1939 we were allied with Britain and were at risk from Germany as a consequence. Only a few years later, in 1942, a very real risk was imposed on this country when Darwin was bombed and the Japanese were involved with us because of our alliance with Britain and the United States. But that was a risk that we were prepared to bear without rancour. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if we had no alliances, we would still be at risk. We would be at risk as an isolated and relatively undefended country. There is no respite from being at risk. Life involves risks. I believe the risks accruing to this country as a consequence of the ANZUS treaty are acceptable risks for the people of Australia who have shown that acceptance by supporting us consistently through the ballot box. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us deal with the question of Darwin being at risk. Without exception, all the Opposition speakers lack an understanding of modern armaments and weapons systems. Senator Mason's geography as well as his knowledge of weapons systems, seem to be woefully inadequate. He told us that the Royal Australian Air Force base at Learmonth was on the North West Shelf. We must be operating flying boats off it and not B52s. He repeatedly asked the questions: Why was Darwin selected? Why were the good people of Darwin placed at risk of instant assassination by nuclear bombs and rockets falling out of the sky? Why did the Australian Government select Darwin over Learmonth on the North West Shelf for the staging of the B52 bombers? Really, if Senator Mason knew anything about the B52s he would know that Darwin is the only airport in the northern part of Australia which can accept the B52s. It is the only one with taxiways wide enough to accept them with their outriggers. It is as simple as that and there is nothing more complex to it. </PARA>

No other would.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second interesting problem raised by the Opposition relates to the ordnance load carried by the aircraft. There are two points of importance. The first one is that the agreement forbids the Americans, except in certain conditions which are clearly outlined in the agreement, to carry any ordnance at all. The Government and I are prepared to accept that the United States will honour this agreement. It is very much a part of the Opposition's argument that the American word on this is repudiated, but I have said enough on that point already. The second important point is that it is just not common practice in the air forces of the Western world to carry ordnance on training flights except when there is a bombing exercise or something like that involved, particularly in relation to the operation of the B52s out of Darwin. If an aircraft carries a bomb load, its fuel load is reduced. The pay load of the aircraft is a finite factor. If they are loaded with weapons they can take less fuel. For an aircraft which is operating out of Darwin on a surveillance operation in the Indian Ocean, when one is clawing for the limits of range, even with air refuelling, it just is not a practical move to load those aircraft with ordnance. There are secondary factors involved, too. Nuclear weapons, or even conventional ordnance, are expensive. One does not subject them unnecessarily to the degradation of being winched into bomb bays and flown around with the possibility of accidental damage. They are an asset, and they are kept in air conditioned bomb shelters and bomb dumps so that they are kept in good shape. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point in this absurd argument is what the devil would one use the bombs for in aircraft staging out of Darwin? As somebody in the Press stated, what will the Americans do? Will they bomb whales or Russian submarines? It is just no strike target for them. If the B52s are to be used in a bombing role they will operate against Russian strategic targets on the mainland. All the strategic air command bases are in North America, Europe or in the northern part of the Pacific. That makes sense because all the strategic targets which they are interested in are in the Northern Hemisphere. One would not dispatch aircraft from Darwin to strike targets in the Urals or anywhere else on mainland Russia. It is just not common sense. </PARA>

The Opposition's position is part of the continuing saga of mistrust and criticism of the United States which so characterises the socialist parties, the Labor Party and the Democrats in this chamber. Honourable senators should look at the history of this country from 1969 onwards and at the North-West Cape agreement. What has happened to every alliance and every treaty which we have had with the United States? They are prepared to trust the Russian word but they are not prepared to trust the Americans at all. Look at the legendary attacks of Dr Cairns and Mr Uren in 1973. They are a matter of record in the Hansard of the House of Representatives. There was attack after attack on our ally. To the present time the practical support for the alliance has never come from the Labor Party or from the Democrats. Let me deal with the purpose of the agreement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, not for that reason. They are staging there for the tasks which are designated-for sea surveillance and for crew training. Let us look at sea surveillance first of all. That is primarily an intelligence gathering operation. Two points emerge from this. The first point is to demonstrate a military presence in the region and, secondly, to get the intelligence to know what the Russians are up to. Russia intruded into the region of the Indian Ocean.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The B52 has a very long range and it is a very good platform for surveillance purposes. It may well need to be modified from its bombing role, but that is technically quite feasible. It is quite feasible to install the equipment either in the fuselage or on the wing stations in pod installations to provide what we want. The virtues of this aircraft are, firstly, that it has a very long range and, secondly, that it has relatively unlimited space in it. A whole range of stores and crews can be placed in its fuselage because it is so large. The larger an aircraft is the volume increases in proportion to the cube of the length. There is plenty of electrical power. There are all the requirements for long range surveillance, long range space and power in the aircraft. The three common methods of surveillance-I am presuming here; I do not know what these aircraft have-are electromagnetic, electro-optical and optical facilities. The electromagnetic facilities of radar and elint-electronic intelligence gathering-can be fitted. The electro-optical, the infra-red sensors and the photographic optical sensors are all possible fits for this aircraft. I refuse to comment or to speculate further on what these aircraft might have in them, but I assert that they have the potential to provide a complete surveillance capacity for the task which they are declared to follow. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great defence experts on the Labor side of the House is Senator Evans and he kept asking the question, in the form of interjection, as to why the B52s. I will tell him why the B52s. It is simply because it is all the United States has that is spare for this capacity. The United States operates P3s as long-range maritime patrol aircraft. If Senator Evans could read the papers he would see in the popular Press from time to time pictures of the airport at Diego Garcia with P3s on the runway. The United States Navy, as the operating authority for P3s, is short of them. It will be years before they come up to the operational strength which the United States Navy wants. The United States has the B52s of which they have a relative-I stress the word 'relative'-surplus, so they are tasked for this job. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point which was raised in the agreement was that they will be used for navigational training. That is a most important requirement because air crews must fly to maintain their proficiency. Another important point is that the United States Air Force has negligible operational experience in the Indian Ocean. It is not a theatre in which it has had much experience because it has had no bases in the region. It is important to know the meteorological conditions and the geography and to develop a familiarity with the region operationally. That is an entirely justifiable purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I turn to the most important point of all and that is the Russian superiority in numbers-not in technology but in numbers of conventional arms and of nuclear capacity. That capacity must be matched by the Western world. We cannot leave a vacuum there. It is not for the obvious reason that we might become involved in an armed conflict. It is for the directly contrary reason. If we do not provide a presence in the Indian Ocean we will allow the Russians to threaten, to exercise pressure on and in fact to blackmail the nations in the region both politically and economically, that is, to conquer without open conflict. Then we will lose our liberty and our freedom. That is the real significance of what the supporters of the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats are doing. They are putting at risk the ultimate freedoms of Australia by refusing to support this agreement. For ideological reasons and for cheap meretricious political point scoring they are denying the support that they should be giving to this alliance. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to take this opportunity to advise honourable senators of Government decisions on a number of matters on domestic air transport, including the Government's initial response to the Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares. The Government commissioned this inquiry into domestic air fares early in 1980 and the inquiry reported on 16 February 1981. The report was tabled in the Parliament shortly thereafter. The inquiry's report is an extensive one and contributes a great deal of valuable work towards expanding the knowledge of airline costs and revenues. However, the inquiry recognised a considerable amount of detailed work would still be necessary to derive and verify the most appropriate fare setting formula based on current costs. The report at page 277 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Verification . . . various matters associated with determining an air fare pricing policy, derived by way of a formula, will be an exacting task for the regulatory authority. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will be arranging further substantial discussions with the airlines immediately so this task can be completed by July 1981. In undertaking this task, the Government will, as necessary, draw upon independent advice. At this stage, the Government has accepted the following principles contained in the inquiry's recommendations: First, we will adopt a cost based, nationally consistent approach by use of an air fare formula comprising a flagfall and a distance rate for the national jet network. We endorse the inquiry's view on the approach to be taken to discount fares. The Government supports as wide a range of discount fares as possible without increasing the burden on the full fare paying passenger. Discounts for the aged and provision of tour basing fares are to be considered further with the airlines. The Government is concerned that special innovative discounts which are negotiated by the airlines on the basis of their commercial viability must stand the test of public scrutiny. The Government decided that an independent tribunal should be established with powers to hear and make decisions upon proposals for changes to air fares. The powers, structure and scope of the tribunal are under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> As I stated earlier, the report is extensive and further investigation is necessary because, although the broad principles contained in the recommendations are acceptable to the Government, the cost allocation methodology requires detailed analysis. I am concerned also that further consideration must be given to the question of the pricing of the F27 services of Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans-Australia Airlines. In addition, the reports recommendations advocating the adoption of a profit target must be more fully examined. The Government has also decided in principle to establish TAA as a public company. The Government has under consideration the nature and structure of such a company. Such an arrangement should enable TAA to compete more effectively in a more commercial environment. </PARA>
<PARA> In March, the Government deferred consideration of tariff increases sought by the airlines until it completed its initial review of the inquiry's recommendations. It has now been decided to approve increases in fares using a new formula which meets the thrust of the inquiry's recommendations. The Government was concerned that the delay in this tariff approval is costing the airlines about $1.2m per week. To delay approval of this increase further in an attempt to achieve greater refinements is inappropriate as the lost revenue would ultimately lead to higher fares in order to recoup that revenue. Already the delay has meant that the level of justified increase is now at 8.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The level of the economy fare increase has been offset by variations in other fare types. Overall, an 8.9 per cent increase in revenue for the airlines was justified and this will be achieved by, firstly, an increase in the first class differential to 1.45 times the economy fares. After allowing for some diversion from first to economy class travel this adjustment will achieve a reduction in economy fares. Secondly, the increase will be achieved by a withdrawal of the 20 per cent APEX fare-the advance purchase excursion fare-the first class night coach, first class tertiary discount fares and off peak fares and a reduction in the level of discounts for APEX fares from 40 per cent to 35 per cent and standby fares from 30 per cent to 25 per cent. The adjustments to discount fares will achieve a reduction in economy fares of 1.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I must emphasise that these variations in fares are entirely consistent with the inquiry's recommendations. They enable the level of increase in the economy jet fares to be kept to an average of 7.4 per cent. The new economy jet formula is to be $40 plus 6.848c per kilometre with a second distance rate of 5.821c per kilometre for travel over 2,200 kilometres between Perth and Melbourne or Sydney and Darwin and Adelaide or Brisbane. Recognising the major increases in fares that this formula would bring on routes operated by Ansett and TAA between Melbourne and Tasmania and that alternative land-based modes are not available, the Government has set fares on these routes at 90 per cent of the formula and, in accordance with the approach recommended by the inquiry, the loss in revenue will be met by the Government. This subsidy is expected to cost $5m per annum at the new fare levels. </PARA>
<PARA> The following are a few examples of the impact the new fare formula will have:</PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Fares on F27 routes will rise by the average increase which is being achieved through an increase in the flagfall component only. The flagfall will be $30.30 with a distance rate of 9.860c per kilometre. If the previous practice of relating F27 fares to the economy jet formula had been applied the F27 formula would have been $40 flagfall plus 8.560c per kilometre. </PARA>
<PARA> I should emphasise that the inquiry's report was based on 1979-80 costs. If we take January 1980 as a convenient mid-point of that period, the airline costs have risen by almost 30 per cent since that time. The major factors in these increases are of course wage rises and higher fuel prices. When that level of cost increase is taken into account, the fact that we have been able to lower fares at all on long distance routes is a major achievement. However as I have already indicated, further refinement of the formula will be undertaken as soon as possible. Therefore the decisions I have announced in respect of the inquiry's recommendations follow the Government's initial review. Considerable further work is being pursued and the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) will advise parliament further once that task is completed. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the eyes of the Opposition, this statement of the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) is one of the most disgusting statements on transport ever presented to the national Parliament. It dramatically alters the two-airline agreement. In 42 small words-or 42 pieces of silver-we have sold out a public enterprise to a new breed of millionaires as part of a pay back for the support that that group of millionaires has given in recent times to the Liberal and National Country parties. We have succumbed to the pressure of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd and in the adoption of this statement, in the processes of the legislation ultimately, we will have destroyed one of the finest public instrumentalities that this country has seen operating in the post-war years. It will be the birth of a one-airline agreement. Clearly, 'Do as you want as long as you give us good Press' is the principle by which the Fraser Administration operates the assets of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Fraser Administration has no mandate for the sale of Trans-Australia Airlines. It has no mandate to float it as a public company and, in fact, this statement repudiates an election promise made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and by the Minister for Transport before and during the 1980 general election that TAA would not be sold. As I say, in 42 small words this statement, without any explanation, without any excuse, without any reason, simply states the bald facts-that TAA is to be auctioned off as a public enterprise. This is the latest piece of capitulation to Ansett Transport Industries by a government which refused to help Sir Reginald Ansett, the founder of the original company, when he was fighting off the raiders on the stock exchange a year or so ago and by a government which now takes the next extraordinary step of agreeing to the submission by that organisation to the recent Holcroft inquiry. Let it be clearly understood by the Australian people that it will not be a publicly-owned enterprise, a public company, as suggested in this statement, but the big corporations that will be buying up either the majority or minority shareholding of the publicly-formed TAA company. It will be another example of how the big corporations exert their influence upon the actions of this Government. It will be a further example of the way in which these backroom deals are arranged to suit the corporations which are rapidly buying out all of the smaller companies or even major companies in our country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a preposterous statement because nowhere does it justify the rejection of the Holcroft inquiry's recommendations and nowhere does it satisfy the Opposition that the decision to change the financial structure of TAA will result in any savings as far as the travelling public is concerned. Nowhere in the statement is there any justification of the Government's belief that by taking this dramatic step of altering the functions of our public instrumentality this will affect the fare structure of TAA or the services provided by it in the whole of the post-war years. </PARA>
<PARA> This decision will be fought by the Opposition and, I would hope, by the Australian community, until such time as the instrumentality known as TAA is returned to public ownership. Changing the form of ownership of TAA cannot in any way improve the service. It cannot in any way put into effect the so-called philosophy of the Fraser Government that competition is an essential part of the way in which our airlines should operate. Whilst it is conceded that there are some financial disabilities from which TAA suffers in comparison with Ansett, that is precisely because Ansett has always enjoyed a superiority in its relationships with the airline industry. TAA has always been in a position subordinate to Ansett as a direct result of the policies pursued by the conservative governments over the last couple of decades. </PARA>
<PARA> Let it be remembered that invariably the airline agreements have been entered into in the dying days of conservative administrations just as they were, for example, in 1972 and again in 1979 and 1980 when matters affecting the airlines were decided by a government facing the electors for re-election. That prevented in 1972 any consideration by a new government of minimising the effect of policy decisions that had been made by a government that clearly was going to be defeated at the polls. The sale of TAA to private enterprise will transfer ownership of a valuable public transport asset to wealthy investors and stock exchange manipulators and speculators. We have seen so much evidence of this in recent times. One finds it inconceivable that any government worth its salt, any government calling itself an Australian government representing the interests of Australia, would put forward such a proposition, in such a document, and in such a cursory and superficial fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the other factors included in the statement. The statement completely demolishes the recommendations made by the Holcroft report in respect of the fare formula. Despite the substance of the membership of the Holcroft committee, the stature of the people involved in that inquiry who sat and considered the submissions of those involved in the airline industry, the recommendations and conclusions of those people were just put aside without any explanation. Indeed, the whole of this statement completely ignores the recommendations of the Holcroft inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the statement in more detail-Madam Acting Deputy President, you will appreciate that I am acting under some constraints in this debate insofar as I am required to complete my remarks in 15 minutes-we find a number of irregularities in it. It says that the Government will be arranging substantial discussions with the airlines. It has already had those discussions with Ansett and it is now proposing to change the structure so far as TAA is concerned. The Government then says it will draw upon independent advice. Who are to be the independent advisers? The Government has had such advisers and rejected their advice. </PARA>
<PARA> In the statement the Government says that it will adopt a cost-based nationally consistent approach for the air fare formula. One can only say that the Government has had the opportunity of considering those matters in respect of the Holcroft inquiry and has completly dismissed them. In fact, the Government has almost substantially taken on board the Ansett Airlines of Australia submission to the Holcroft inquiry and ignored the comments made by the inquiry in respect of the Ansett submission. Of course, the Government has made some suggestions about changing the fares but one is entitled to ask why is it that the Department of Transport said only four weeks ago that air fares in Australia would rise by 7.9 per cent and why just four weeks later this has been amended to a rise of 8.9 per cent. This is a difference amounting to a 1.1 per cent increase in exactly four weeks. If that were to be translated in general consumer price index terms it would mean an increase of 13 per cent on an annual basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also discussed a first class differential. Nothing in the statement indicates how that conclusion was reached. On page 3 of the statement the Government speaks of the establishment of an independent tribunal, at a time when it has freely canvassed that independent tribunals such as the Prices Justification Tribunal and the Trade Practices Commission are also due for the axe, to be disbanded as part of the razor gang's operations. What sort of independent tribunal will be established with powers to hear and make decisions on proposals for changes to air fares? This represents a pandering to free trade fanatics, to that group of economists who believe that all the problems will be solved if we sell off our public enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate of one of the grievous mistakes made by conservative governments in the immediate post-war years when Commonwealth Oil Refineries was sold off. It would have been a very valuable asset to this country if it had been operated as a public instrumentality in these latter years. Look at what the Government has done to airline charges for passenger movements throughout Australia. Tasmania is to be subsidised at last. When members of the Labor Party in August last year went to Tasmania to meet with representatives of the Tasmanian Government to try to overcome the disadvantages to air travellers because of the isolation of Tasmania and decided to take on board the recommendation of the Tasmanian Government for some subsidisation of air fares we were accused by Mr Malcolm Fraser and by his lackeys among the Tasmanian representatives in the national Parliament of pandering to the electorate and of being interested only in getting votes. What has this Government done? In fact, it has done what it so often does; that is, take on board a Labor Party initiative and then claim it as a significant concession-in this case for the air travellers of Tasmania. We have one small step for Western Australia-taking into consideration the criticism mounting in the Government benches about the Holcroft inquiry and the discontent that exists there-and we have had one great leapfrog for Tasmania. That is good news for Tasmania. It puts into effect one of the initiatives the Labor Party suggested when recognising the disadvantages of Tasmanian people in travelling to the mainland. </PARA>
<PARA> In no way can we say that the report is satisfactory. In fact, it is a monstrous report that seeks to change the basis of airline travel which has operated to the advantage and satisfaction of air travellers for a considerable number of years. It is another example of the cynicism of the Fraser Government that in just a short few months since the last election when it made a definite statement to the electorate to the effect that there would be no interference with the operation of Trans-Australia Airlines that it has come out now to take steps to change that very important instrumentality. It is another example of the cynicism of the Fraser Government when three Ministers have resigned from the Fraser administration and there have been three by-elections within three months of the Federal election. These facts indicate the way in which the Government treats its responsibilites to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> I give an assurance on behalf of the Opposition, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, and I hope on behalf of the Australian community, that we will resist to the utmost the changes proposed by the Government. We will use every resource at our disposal to fight the decision of the Fraser administration to dispose of the very wonderful instrumentality known as TAA. We will fight to the limit any attempt to interfere with the other Government airline, Qantas Airways Ltd. We throw down that challenge to the Government and state that we will not rest until such time as TAA again becomes a public instrumentality wholly owned by the Australian people. We warn those corporations which want to get their dirty, greasy fingers on TAA that they will suffer as a result of their pressures that will change the structure of TAA as a public instrumentality. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very interested while listening to Senator Gietzelt's remarks. First of all he complained about constraints of time. Indeed, in this debate by agreement we have limited ourselves to 15 minutes each. I have no argument with that. Having made that complaint Senator Gietzelt spent at least half of his speech talking about the Government's proposal to sell Trans-Australia Airlines. Nowhere in the Minister's statement did I see anything in regard to selling TAA. The report stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has also decided in principle to establish TAA as a public company. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a far cry from selling TAA. I would not myself be a party to selling TAA though admittedly some of my colleagues would be and have said so in this chamber in times past. Currently, that is not the Government's intention. Unfortunately, Senator Gietzelt's statement will undoubtedly be taken up by the fourth estate in banner headlines tomorrow stating 'Government intending to sell TAA'. I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that Qantas Airways Ltd is a public company registered in Queensland. The mere fact that the Government owns 100 per cent of the shares does not appear to enter into the argument. As I said, it is not the Government's intention to sell the airline. Sir Robert Law-Smith, the Chairman of the Australian National Airlines Commission has welcomed the change in status of TAA to that of a public company. The Government can quite rightly maintain a 100 per cent shareholding in it. Will it do so? I do not know. The Government can. Certainly it is not going to sell the airline. I would have no objection myself to the Government's selling some shares to the staff, if possible, with the Government maintaining a majority interest. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="C67">Senator COLLARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly I can give Senator Gietzelt a guarantee. I will do all I can to see that TAA remains in Government hands at least with a very big majority holding because I fear the things the honourable senator fears. I think that if we completely sold TAA it would not be too long before a duopoly became a monopoly to the detriment of the travelling public of Australia. The Government has not said in this statement that it is going to sell the airline but that it will look at the options. Admittedly, amongst these options would have to be one of selling the airline completely. But in past statements the Government has not even entertained that idea. I admit that there has been some criticism from Government ranks. I have been on record previously as saying that because of the unique Australian situation with the disparity of population dispersed throughout the country that we need this sort of airline system and that we need government input to provide air services for all of Australia. So even though the honourable senator was worried about the constraints of time he did waste a lot of effort because it is certainly not the Government's intention at this time to hand over TAA to private ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Gietzelt also mentioned that the Government was setting up a tribunal. Nowhere in the Holcroft report did it say that this should happen. As I read through all the recommendations I see one constant theme about a regulatory authority. The Holcroft report was rather critical of the role that had been played by the Department of Transport as it saw fit to pass judgment on proposed fare increases. In that criticism the report recognised that Transport Australia probably operated under some difficulty and recommended a regulatory authority, a body apart from Transport Australia or departmental offices. The Holcroft report frequently refers in its recommendations to the regulatory authority. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose once again the headlines will banner wrongly that the Government intends to sell TAA. The proposal could mean a departure from the norm as far as air fares go. Australia has gone along with most of the other airlines which are signatories to International Air Transport Association agreements in that Australia has a basic formula by which air fares are worked out. A flagfall consists of so many components and a distance component consists of other charges. The Holcroft report has gone into that matter thoroughly and has justified all that has been done, but it has departed from the norm. The Government has seen fit to take that matter up. I am a little concerned because, whereas until today the formula gave us an idea where we stood as far as the other airlines of the world are concerned, we will now be a pacesetter and we will not be able to draw that comparison quite as easily. As I have said the Holcroft report has made this recommendation, with justification. I will instance one or two examples. </PARA>
<PARA> It has always been normal procedure for the cost of fuel to be added to the distance component. The Holcroft report quite rightly points out that a certain amount of fuel is used for taxi-ing, takeoff and climb-out and so it considers that that portion should come off the distance component and be added to the flagfall component. It has always been the procedure that the cost of flight attendants, as against flight crews, be considered in the flagfall component. That has never made much sense to me. The report quite rightly states that that should be considered in the distance component. Flight crew costs have always been considered part of the distance component and the Holcroft report has indicated that the flight crew spend part of their time on the ground when they prepare their flight plan, check their aircraft, start up, taxi out and climb-out so those components should also be split up. As I have said it is a departure from what has been the accepted norm around the world, but there was a good reason for making these changes. They mean that we will depart from the norm. I cannot imagine that Australia will be a pacesetter. I do not see world airlines falling over themselves to follow us in this matter. It will be a little harder to draw comparisons with the efficiency of our airlines. We are now able to compare the core fare or the standard economy fare of our airlines with overseas airlines to see how we shape up. It has not been the best method of comparison, but it has been one whereby lay people, who travel around the world, have been able to see how we shape up. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation is a departure from the norm and Australia, with this new formula, will be a world leader. Because of the new formula we have had the predictable results. I have said previously in this chamber that long-haul passengers have been disadvantaged and the Independant Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares picked up that fact. Since then the Government, quite rightly, has recognised this fact and has increased the flagfall component more than the distance component, with the result that the long-haul fares have gone up at a slower rate than short-haul fares. Basically in one fell swoop we have probably righted the wrong. We have seen a small reduction in the long-haul fares-I will not quote examples because the paper is before honourable senators-and a fare increase on some of the short hauls. Of course, this is not without its problems because if we increase short-haul fares to any great extent we will turn many passengers to bus and rail transport. </PARA>
<PARA> I have only one argument with that. It is generally recognised, throughout the airline network, that about 60 per cent of the people who travel by air are Mr and Mrs Smith who are on ordinary holidays or visiting relatives, and only 40 per cent are business or government passengers who do not worry too much about the fare. If we see a decline in the number of those passengers, the bottom line that the airlines look at in their financial returns will be altered, with the result that air fares overall would have to go up again. So we have a problem. We cannot go too much further than we have done currently, otherwise we will lose some of our short-haul passengers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish it were as simple as that, but it is not.

I will wait until Senator Mulvihill is out of the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another recommendation that the Holcroft report made is that whereas we have had three basic fares to now-the economy fare, the first class fare and the standard fare which is for F27s-we should settle on one basic core fare and let the companies make their own arrangements about commercial discounts. I think everybody welcomes the situation where we have one core fare and other discounts are made using commercial judgment. Until now, discounts almost ran riot, and full-fare-paying passengers basically paid for the discounts. I do not think anybody saw any injustice in that. The Holcroft report pointed that situation out and said that there should be commercial discounts but not at the expense of full-fare-paying passengers. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again if we have too many discount fares we could run into a problem. When discounts in the United States ran riot there were so many fares that nobody really knew what the fares were. A person would ring to make a booking. He asked the cheapest fare and stated what route he wanted to use. At times it would take half an hour to an hour to get the proper fare formula. Finally the reservations were getting so far behind that the airlines had to employ more staff, their base costs went up and the whole thing started to become counter-productive. At one stage the American airlines withdrew from discounting. I think the Australian airlines at that stage had more discount fares than the American airlines did. I think we are one of the few countries in the world which have student discount fares, just to name one example. </PARA>
<PARA> The Holcroft report recognised the situation in Tasmania and the Government has picked up that point. I understand that the $5m subsidy which the Government has announced is a once only subsidy so that this time the increase to Tasmania will be 90 per cent of the overall increase. This recognises the fact which the Holcroft report picked up, that Tasmania does have a particular difficulty. Sometimes we shy away from subsidies, but we would all like to have them in our back yard for a particular project. But there is a general recognition in the Holcroft report that people in Tasmania do not have an alternative. They cannot hop on a bus or a train to get to the mainland. I just make the observation that the Holcroft inquiry picked up that point. </PARA>
<PARA> The Holcroft inquiry, as I recall, said that the F27 routes were substantially cross-subsidised and that on its examination the flagfall was less than half what it should be. Of course, taken to its conclusion, that means that the flagfall on the F27 runs ultimately will be twice what it is now. It is unfortunate that in many instances the F27 routes involve long distances. I am thinking of Western Queensland, where many people are left with no alternatives to flying, where weather conditions are quite often such that they cannot travel by road. If the air fare for the F27 route is to be doubled it will create problems. To compound the problem, apart from the HS748 aircraft, which is about the same size as the F27 but does not operate commercially in Australia, the Bandeirante Nomad and Metro types of aircraft, there is not really an alternative to the F27 which is immediately available. The nearest that I can ascertain from my investigations is either the de Havilland Dash 8 or the Saab Fairchild, which will not be available until 1985-86. I just flag the problem which is arising in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to provide air transport for all Australians, and particularly for those in remote areas-indeed, they have an entitlement-we are faced with a dilemma in that there is to be a fairly hefty fare increase and no suitable alternative aircraft is available. As I have said, there are smaller aircraft which can do the job reasonably well, but the Dash 8 or Saab Fairchild will be better propositions when they become available. I support the Government's initiatives in what it has done and the recommendations it has taken up from the Holcroft report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats also view with grave concern the statement on airline policy by the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt). We believe that fundamental decisions have been made without the proper information. We regard this statement as thoroughly inadequate, which is all that could be expected in view of the Government's decision to truncate the Holcroft inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Holcroft inquiry would not mean much to many Australians, but to Western Australians and Tasmanians I would have thought that it was very significant. Let me go very briefly into its history. Early in 1980 several Western Australian Liberal senators became quite worried about the activities of the Fair Air Fare Campaign in Western Australia in relation to cross-subsidisation. They very properly and courageously went to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and stated: 'We believe that Western Australians are paying something like $20m to subsidise the air fares of eastern passengers. Let us have an inquiry'. In response to that request the Government appointed Mr Warwick Holcroft, Dr Harold F. Bell, O.B.E. and Professor Warren Hogan to the Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares. After the election was over-after the Government had won-when there was no need for a political inquiry, the Government, quite extraordinarily, said to these three distinguished Australians: 'Your work is over. Instead of finishing the inquiry properly by mid-1981 you will finish it by January 1981'. In other words, it truncated the inquiry to such an extent that it could not possibly conclude its work. </PARA>
<PARA> Why did the Government truncate the work of this inquiry before it could report properly? I think some of the clues are given in the report. These are very disturbing. We must remember that this report could shortly form a basis for information of this Senate when it is asked to ratify a new two-airline agreement which will tie up civil aviation in this country for 10 years. I now give notice that the Australian Democrats will be voting against ratification of that agreement if the Government tries to rush the legislation through this Senate before 30 June. I have authority from Senator Button to say that Labor Party senators will also be voting against ratification unless and until a Senate select committee takes up and completes the work that the Holcroft committee was prevented from doing. Tonight I challenge the six West Australian Liberal senators-Senator Thomas, Senator Withers, Senator Martyr, Senator Sim, the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney)-to stand up now, after they have won the election, and to vote in favour of a Senate select committee to complete the work of the Holcroft inquiry into domestic air fares. There is time for it to be done. Similarly, I challenge Liberal Tasmanian senators to do the same. </PARA>
<PARA> Although Tasmanians have been handed something in this statement in that they will pay only 90 per cent of the formula, how does Senator Watson know that 90 per cent is a fair figure? How does he know that 75 per cent of the formula would not be fairer? He does not know. He could not know. The Government could not know because it did not give the Holcroft committee time to complete its inquiry. I ask Liberal West Australian and Tasmanian senators to agree to a Senate select committee to complete the work of the Holcroft committee. I do not think that is an unreasonable request. The results of this very bad decision emerge again and again in the Minister's statement. On the very first page the Minister states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Inquiry recognised a considerable amount of detailed work would still be necessary to derive and verify the most appropriate fare-setting formula based on current costs. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister has the effrontery to put that sentence in his statement. Yet he was the one who disbanded the Holcroft committee prematurely. Let us look at some of the remarks of the Holcroft committee. They are at least apt to cause great concern among people who, like the members of the Senate, are to be asked to endorse the new 10-year two-airline agreement. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The contribution from Ansett however proved far from spontaneous and the delay in settling the basis of agreement to supply information hampered the Inquiry's operations.</PARA>
<PARA>It then went on to make detailed criticism of Ansett Airlines of Australia. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It seemed to the Inquiry that Ansett was failing to recognise that the Inquiry was established by the Government as an independent public one with the express aim of clarifying in the public arena certain matters impinging upon air fares. </PARA>
<PARA>The committee made devastating remarks about the Department of Transport. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> These delays in the supply of data were more than matched by the failure of the Department of Transport to make a written submission to the Inquiry until 10 December 1980, some two weeks after the Inquiry had been informed by the Minister for Transport that it was required to report by 31 January 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>It then commented on the two-airline policy. This is the whole basis upon which this Senate is to be asked to ratify a new two-airline agreement for 10 years. Yet the Holcroft inquiry specifically stated this about the two-airline policy:</PARA>
<PARA> Yet the evidence today--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, in relation to the two-airline policy-</PARA>
<PARA>is strongly against this belief in economies of scale and decreasing unit costs of providing a service. Thus the main presumption underlying the inauguration of the Two-Airlines Policy is not now applicable if it ever was. </PARA>

Why did the Government abort the inquiry if, as it now admits, a 'considerable amount of detailed work' was still necessary for it to be able to draw rational conclusions about its main term of reference, namely, how to set domestic air fares.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the second page of the statement the Government says that it will 'draw upon independent advice' in its future inquiries into air fare determinations. The Government had independent advice-the Holcroft committee-but it sacked the committee which was giving it independent advice. The question still remains, and I ask any Government senator to tell the Senate the answer: Why did the Government sack the Holcroft committee before it was time for it to report? On page 2 of the statement we see that the Government will be arranging 'further substantial discussions with the airlines' on air fares. I ask: Which airlines? There are more than two airlines in Australia. East-West Airlines Ltd is one. If the Government means to stick blindly to the two-airline policy why does it not say: 'Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett' instead of 'the airlines'? There is something significant in that statement which is delightfully vague. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement says that the fare structure will be completed by July 1981. One should tie that statement in with what Holcroft says on page 277 of his report. He says that it will be completed by July 1981 because the financial year of Ansett and TAA begins on 1 July each year. From that statement I judge that the Government will have the discussions with the airlines on fares, will make its decision and will ram the two-airline policy through both Houses of this Parliament well before the Senate rises at the end of May this year. I ask all honourable senators to be conscious of that timing schedule. It is highly significant. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 3 of the statement the Government says that an 'independent tribunal' will be established with power over changes in air fares. We welcome that. We give it a cautious welcome, however, because we note that 'the powers, structure and scope of the tribunal' are still under consideration. Is this not a strange way in which to establish a national civil aviation airlines policy for the next 10 years? One would have thought that those things would have already been contemplated, discussed and announced in one hit instead of coming to the Senate in bits and pieces in an incoherent form. I agree with the Minister when he says that the cost allocation methodology of the Holcroft committee is something to be looked at. I do not accept the figures as they are given because, to use a famous expression, they seem rubbery. But was not that another reason why the Holcroft committee should have been allowed to complete its report? Again the question arises: Why did the Government guillotine the work on this most valuable inquiry? But the central point of the statement, as I understand it, is this:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided in principle to establish TAA as a public company.</PARA>
<PARA>I admire Senator Collard for his views on civil aviation. He said it will be over his dead body, or words to that effect, that the Government sells off a majority shareholding in TAA. But why did not the Minister say that? The Minister already has raised this monster that TAA will be sold off. I do not draw conclusions from the fact that one of the great private enterprise predators in this country, a distinguished West Australian by the name of Mr Holmes a'Court, was in Parliament tonight dining with three Ministers and two prominent Liberal back benchers. I am not drawing any sinister conclusions from that meeting. I am saying that if the Government is going to structure TAA as a public company and make a majority of its shareholding available to the public or for private purposes, it is wide open for predators such as Mr Holmes a'Court to purchase TAA. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Rae went to some trouble to assure me that this is only the first step in structuring. I accept that. But what about the confusion upon confusion that a statement such as this will throw into the civil aviation industry? It would have been a very simple matter to add to the statement that the Government will be structuring TAA as a public company-we commend that-'but it will not be sold off to private enterprise'. Senator Collard was prepared to say that. This is an area that leads to very great concern. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will provide legislative authority for the entry into force of comprehensive double taxation agreements with Malaysia and Sweden. The agreements, which were signed on 20 August 1980 and 14 January 1981 respectively, deal with all substantial forms of income flowing between Australia and the other two countries. Neither of the agreements can enter into force until all necessary constitutional processes are completed both by Australia and the other country. For Australia, this Bill will, when assented to, complete the processes required of us. </PARA>
<PARA> Double taxation agreements have two principal functions-the elimination of international double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion. The former involves the apportionment, by one means or another, of the relevant taxation revenue between the contracting countries. There are various ways of doing this. For example, some income is taxed only in the country of residence while other income is taxed only in the country where it has its source. The country of source may agree to limit its tax on some items of income and, where it is agreed that both countries may tax particular income, the country of residence of the taxpayer agrees to allow relief against its tax in recognition of the payment of tax to the other country. Such taxation revenue as is forgone by one country or the other has to be seen in the light of the favourable impact that these agreements have on trade and investment flows, and on the improvement of more general relationships between countries. And it is often overlooked that, where a country in which income originates agrees to reduce its rate of tax on income, the taxpayer's country of residence will also be levying tax on the income with credit for the reduced tax of the country of origin. </PARA>
<PARA> Each of the new agreements accords in essential respects with the position that Australian governments have taken over the years in relation to double taxation agreements. Both of the new comprehensive agreements provide for the country of source to limit its withholding tax on dividends. Under both agreements, Australia is to reduce its withholding tax on dividends flowing to the other country from 30 per cent to 15 per cent of the amount of the dividends. In converse circumstances, Sweden will reduce its rate of dividend withholding tax from 30 per cent to 15 per cent while Malaysia, which does not at present impose a tax on dividends paid to residents of Australia in addition to the Malaysian tax on company profits out of which the dividends are paid, agrees that if it should subsequently impose a tax on dividends it will be limited to 15 per cent in the case of dividends paid to Australian residents. Both agreements specify a limit on each country's tax on interest and royalties paid to residents of the other. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Malaysian agreement the general limit is to be 15 per cent for both interest and royalties. This is the rate at which, under Malaysian law, withholding tax is payable on interest and royalties paid to non-residents. However, as an incentive measure, Malaysia will exempt from tax interest on approved loans or long term loans, and 'approved industrial royalties', as defined in the relevant Malaysian incentives legislation, paid from Malaysia to Australian residents. Australia's withholding tax rate on interest is 10 per cent and will not, therefore, be affected by these arrangements. We do not have a withholding rate for royalties paid overseas. These are taxed on the ordinary assessment basis. The limit on the tax on royalties will affect Australian tax on royalties paid to Malaysia only where our tax on the ordinary assessment basis on the profit element in the royalties would have been greater than 15 per cent of the gross royalties. </PARA>
<PARA> If nothing were done to avoid the situation, the action of Malaysia in providing an 'incentive' exemption from its tax on certain interest and royalties would simply result in Australia not having to give credit for Malaysian tax against its tax on the relevant interest and royalties. In other words, Australia would pick up the tax forgone by Malaysia, thus nullifying the incentive. To avoid that result, Australia, as a 'tax sparing' measure, is to tax Australian recipients of the relevant interest and royalties, and allow credit against its tax, as if Malaysian tax of 10 per cent of the interest or royalties had been paid. These special arrangements are appropriate in an agreement with a developing country, such as Malaysia, in a sector of the world in which Australia has vital interests of more than one kind. </PARA>
<PARA> The rules under the Swedish agreement are more conventional. The tax of the country of source is to be limited to 10 per cent for both interest and royalties. This will not affect Australia's tax on interest flowing to Sweden nor, since Sweden does not tax interest paid to non-residents unless the interest is classified as business income, will it affect Sweden's tax on interest flowing to Australia. However, were Sweden to tax such income in the future the limit of 10 per cent would apply. As in Australia, royalties are taxed in Sweden on an assessment basis, so that the limit on the tax on royalties under the agreement will only affect Australian tax on royalties paid to Sweden, or Sweden's tax on royalties paid to Australia, where tax on the ordinary assessment basis on the profit element in the royalties would have been greater than the agreed limit. Both agreements contain measures for the formal relief of double taxation of income that may be taxed by both countries. The country of residence of the taxpayer is obliged to provide the necessary relief. So far as Australian residents are concerned, income in respect of which a limit is imposed by the agreements on the tax of the country of source-dividends, interest and royalties-will be taxed here with credit being allowed for the tax of the country of source, apart from dividends received from abroad by Australian companies, which are effectively tax-free here. Other income that is taxed in full in the country of source will be exempt from our tax. </PARA>
<PARA> A memorandum containing more detailed explanations of technical aspects of the Bill and of the agreements is being made available to honourable senators. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959 to give effect, with respect to the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, to the Government's policy on voluntary early retirement, and management-initiated redeployment and retirement. The Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act 1979, referred to as the CE(RR) Act, which was proclaimed to come into operation on 6 February 1981, makes provision with respect to the redeployment and retirement of Commonwealth employees, including those of prescribed Commonwealth authorities. It is open to any Commonwealth authority, such as the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, to seek to become a prescribed Commonwealth authority for the purposes of that Act. This would bring the authority within the scope of the redeployment provisions of the Act, and the provisions for management-initiated retirement and for voluntary retirement by officers who have attained the age of 55 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Banking Corporation does not wish to avail itself of this option. This is in the light of its role as an integral part of the competitive banking and finance industry. It is considered that the Corporation already has, within its existing staffing policies and practices, effective internal redeployment arrangements that are consistent with the spirit of the redeployment provisions of the CE(RR) Act. In fact, the Commonwealth banks have always been conscious of the need to ensure, to the greatest extent that is practicable, that they operate in such a manner as to make efficient and economical use of their staff resources and, since their inception, have practised redeployment of staff in the interests of providing efficient service to their customers. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, in the light of the sensitive and confidential nature of banking business, it is felt important by the Corporation that the Commonwealth banks maintain an image of independence in the eyes of their customers, including those with international affiliations. However, the Corporation, with the support of the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association, sought the Government's agreement to introduce voluntary early retirement from age 55 years for male officers of the Corporation by appropriate amendments to the Commonwealth Banks Act. Female officers in the Corporation already have this right. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, after consideration, the Government decided to introduce amendments to the Commonwealth Banks Act to provide for age 55 retirement for all Corporation staff on the basis that, as appropriate, the Act also be amended to bring it into line with relevant provisions of the CE(RR) Act. This Bill implements that decision. The nature of the proposed amendments has been discussed with the Commonwealth Banking Corporation and the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association and both parties fully accept the approach taken. The opportunity is also being taken with this Bill to amend section 24 of the Commonwealth Banks Act relating to disclosure of interests by board members and to effect certain other minor amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> I now outline the main provisions of the Bill. Clause 6 will amend section 102 of the principal Act to provide for a minimum retiring age of 55 years and a maximum retiring age of 65 years for all officers of the Corporation. Currently the minimum and maximum retiring ages are 60 and 65 years respectively for male officers, and 55 and 60 years respectively for female officers. The amendment will remove the present differences between retiring ages for male and female officers and bring the provisions of the Commonwealth Banks Act into line with the provisions of the CE(RR) Act with respect to voluntary early age retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Sub-section 102 (2) of the principal Act provides that, where a male officer continues in the Corporation's service after the age of 60 years, the officer may at any time before attaining the age of 65 years be retired by the Corporation from the service. The corresponding ages for female officers are 55 and 60 years respectively. Clause 6 will replace existing sub-section 102 (2) with a new provision that will apply to an officer who has reached the minimum retiring age of 55 years. Under the new provision, the Corporation will cease to have the right to retire an officer simply because he has reached the minimum retiring age. Apart from retaining the standard provision for retirement on health grounds, the new sub-section 102 (2) will provide for the redeployment of an officer who is, for any other reason, no longer performing the duties of his position in such a manner as to permit the Corporation to make efficient and economical use of his services. This is somewhat broader than the corresponding provision in clause 9 applicable to officers under age 55 that I will explain later. The Corporation considers that this broader provision is desirable in the commercial environment in which it operates as it will enable the Corporation to redeploy or retire an officer who has attained the age of 55 years and who is no longer carrying out his duties in such a way as to enable the Corporation to use his services efficiently and economically. Where, in such a case, it is not reasonable or practicable to redeploy the officer, the Corporation may retire him from the service. The provision is in accord with the broad objectives of the CE (RR) Act and it is fully acceptable to the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 9 will effect a restatement of sub-section 106 (1) of the principal Act which, broadly speaking, currently provides that, if an officer appears to the Corporation to be inefficient or incompetent or unfit to discharge his duties, the Corporation may retire him from the Corporation service or redeploy him within the service. The main effect of clause 9 will be to apply the revised sub-section 106 (1) only to officers under the age of 55 years and to require the Corporation to explore all the options for redeployment and the like before action is taken to retire an officer from the Corporation service. This is in keeping with the intentions of the CE (RR) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 12 will amend sub-section 108 (1) of the principal Act to provide for rights of appeal against action taken by the Corporation to redeploy or retire an officer under revised sub-section 102 (2) or to retire an excess officer under sub-section 103 (2). The existing rights of appeal under revised section 106 and sub-section 107 (1) will be preserved. Hitherto, an officer has not had a right to appeal against action taken to retire him after reaching the minimum retiring age or as an excess officer. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 13 provides that the present Disciplinary Appeal Board will continue in existence under the name Tenure and Disciplinary Appeal Board. In addition to the powers of the existing Appeal Board, the reconstituted Board will have the power to hear appeals against action taken under the Corporation's new powers to redeploy or retire officers. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 14 will provide for a new section 110A to be inserted in the Commonwealth Banks Act to authorise the making of regulations to provide for the payment, in such circumstances as are prescribed, of a benefit to an officer who is retired from the service under proposed paragraph 102 (2) (b) or sub-section 103 (2) of the Act. In the case of an officer between the ages of 55 and 60 years, who is retired under sub-section 102 (2) (b), that is, on other than health grounds, it is intended to provide in the regulations for the payment of a lump sum benefit corresponding to the benefit payable to an officer retired from the Australian Public Service under the relevant provision of the CE (RR) Act.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; This morning in Question Time I asked a question of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) who is represented in this place by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Peter Baume. I think the matter I raised this morning should be a matter of grave concern not only to me as an Aborigine but also to the Senate and the nation of Australia as it concerned the matter of elections to the Senate. I had the opportunity of visiting the Northern Territory and campaigning for the Country Liberal Party candidate, Mrs Rosie Kunoth-Monks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the course of travelling around a number of the Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory I tried to tell the people that it was important that an Aboriginal person represent the seat of Macdonnell in the Northern Territory. The electorate was represented by an Aborigine named Neville Perkins prior to his resignation to take up a post with a section of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. During the course of travelling around and talking to people at Papunya I was informed that Mr Gough Whitlam, a former Prime Minister of this nation, was on that community as well. I found that he had been in consultation with a number of people. While travelling around communities such as Papunya, Jap Creek, Haasts Bluff, Santa Teresa and Hermannsburg I learned, to my dismay, that the former Prime Minister was telling the Aboriginal people, through an interpreter, that he was the person who gave land rights to the people in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, you and I know that although land rights legislation was introduced during the term of the Whitlam Government it did not come to fruition during that term. Land rights legislation was introduced into this Parliament and carried with the consent of all sides during the term of the Fraser Government. I, as an Aborigine very concerned with land rights for Aboriginal people throughout this nation, supported the legislation that was proposed by the Fraser Government and which was carried by the Parliament and later enacted. I am concerned that the former Prime Minister of this country went into those Aboriginal communities and, through an interpreter, told the Aboriginal people that he was the Prime Minister responsible for giving land rights to the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He did not introduce that legislation. The Fraser Government introduced the legislation which was carried and which was implemented in the Northern Territory. I was the Chairman of the Joint Select Committee on Aboriginal Land Rights in the Northern Territory. The Committee brought in a report that was unanimous among all parties-Liberal Party, National Country Party and Labor Party. The facts are there for all to see. The former Prime Minister went into the Northern Territory during the by-election for the seat of Macdonnell and told the Aboriginal people that he was the Prime Minister that gave land rights to the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. He said also that if Aboriginal people in the Macdonnell electorate voted for Rosie Kunoth-Monks, the candidate for the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory, the Northern Territory Government would take away their land rights. Land rights for the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory were introduced by this Federal Parliament. There is no way in the world that the Northern Territory Government could take away those land rights from the Northern Territory Aboriginal people. Mr Gough Whitlam told an absolute untruth. He deceived the Aboriginal people in the Macdonnell electorate in the Northern Territory. He deceived them when, through an Aboriginal interpreter, he said to the people in that electorate that if they elected a very competent, decent and worthwhile Aboriginal person they would lose their land rights. She could represent the electorate of Macdonnell in the Northern Territory far better than any non-Aboriginal person.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is worth noting that a former member for the Macdonnell electorate said that that electorate, which has a 90 per cent Aboriginal constituency, should be represented by an Aboriginal. The Australian Labor Party which claims to be the champion of the Aboriginal people put up a non-Aboriginal candidate. That candidate got 60 per cent of the vote in that electorate because a former Prime Minister of this nation, Mr Gough Whitlam, told an absolute untruth. He said that if Rosie Kunoth-Monks were elected the Northern Territory Government would take away the land rights of the people of that electorate. Mr President, both you and I know that this is not possible because the land rights legislation in the Northern Territory was introduced in and carried by this Parliament. It is an enactment of the Federal Parliament of this nation, not an enactment of the Northern Territory Government. The Northern Territory Government does not have the power to revoke land rights legislation that was introduced in this Federal Parliament and supported by all parties. It is an absolute indictment of the Labor Party that it should use Aboriginal people in this shocking way to try to deceive our very--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, they are not worth answering. They do not know the kinds of things I know about. It is a shocking indictment of a former Prime Minister of this country that he could go into an electorate and tell the Aboriginal people that he was the man who gave land rights to the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. That is an absolute untruth. It was the Liberal National Country parties which gave land rights to the people in the Northern Territory. It was the Fraser Government which introduced that legislation and made sure that Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory had rights to their land. For someone to go into those electorates and say to the Aboriginal people, through Aboriginal interpreters, that if a Country Liberal Party candidate were elected, the Country Liberal Party Government of the Northern Territory would take away land rights from the Aboriginal people is a shocking indictment of the Labor Party and its tactics in using Aboriginal people for its own political gain. I find it absolutely abhorrent, and I cannot find words to describe my feelings and those of the Aboriginal people about those who would stoop to such low tactics to win a by-election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Rosie Kunoth-Monks, the person proposed by the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory, is a very fine lady with tremendous capabilities. I am sure that she would have represented not only the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory but all the people of the Northern Territory, because that is the calibre of the woman. She is a great lady, a lady for whom I have the greatest affection and respect. I am sure that the people of Alice Springs would have the same respect and admiration for that lady, who has endeavoured throughout her life to promote the Aboriginal people and to promote in the Northern Territory the togetherness of all people. Surely we should all be about promoting the togetherness of people, whether in the Northern Territory, Queensland or any other State of the Commonwealth, and that is what this lady is all about. A former Prime Minister of this country went into those areas and convinced the people that he was the man who gave land rights to the Aboriginal people. He was not the person who gave land rights to the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory, it was the Fraser Government which did that. He told an absolute untruth. I believe we should condemn what was perpetrated against the people, and the Aboriginal people particularly, in the electorate of Macdonnell in the Northern Territory. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Australian Capital Territory)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(11.14)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to correct the record following the remarks made by Senator Bonner about the development of land rights in the Northern Territory. I simply place on record the fact that before 1972 there were no land rights for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory or in any other part of Australia. When the Whitlam Labor Government was elected to office in 1972, it immediately set about fulfilling its election promise of providing land rights for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. In order to do this, it set up a commission to inquire into the appropriate machinery and legislation for this purpose under Mr Justice Woodward. After the Woodward Commission reported, the Labor Government accepted the recommendations of that report and drafted legislation to give land rights to Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That legislation came into this Parliament. It passed through the House of Representatives. On 11 November 1975, it was scheduled for discussion in this Senate. I will not waste the time of honourable senators this evening by rehearsing the reasons why the Aboriginal land rights legislation was not proceeded with on 11 November 1975 in this Senate. Suffice it to say, it was no doing of any Australian Labor Party representative in this place that land rights were not given to Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory in November 1975. The reasons were quite different and the causes are to be found on the other side of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I make some comments also about the relevance of the attitude of the Northern Territory Government regarding land rights in the Northern Territory because, after all, the election to which Senator Bonner has drawn our attention tonight was in fact a by-election in the seat of Macdonnell for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I think it is quite pertinent to ask: What is the attitude of the current Northern Territory Government to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act? Only yesterday in this place, I tabled a document which was a submission by the Northern Territory Government in the name of Mr Paul Everingham, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory Government, which set out very clearly and unambiguously the attitude of that Government to the Federal Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. I will not go over what I said yesterday, as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) will be very well aware of what I said. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government of the Northern Territory, under the leadership of Mr Paul Everingham, is quite hostile to the land rights legislation which Senator Bonner was attempting to defend tonight. It recommended that no further land rights be granted and that no further claims be heard. It was extremely critical of the decisions taken by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner, Mr Justice Toohey. I simply place these matters on the record. I am really only adverting to my action yesterday in tabling that submission because it will be available to all honourable senators to read. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Government initiated the work which culminated in land rights for the Northern Territory and the reason Labor legislation was not passed was as a result of the actions of Liberal-National Country Party senators in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Including Senator Bonner. I believe it was quite proper for anybody campaigning in the Macdonnell by-election, and certainly for somebody who is so intimately aware of the development of land rights legislation in this country as Mr Gough Whitlam, to point to the dangers presented by Everingham's Government to the land rights legislation in the Northern Territory. I place all of those matters on the record because they are, unlike the remarks of Senator Bonner, matters of fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will conclude by stating an opinion, Mr President. It is my opinion that the campaigning of former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam in the Macdonnell by-election was crucial to the outcome. The reason, in my opinion is that Aboriginal people throughout Australia and Aboriginal people in the Macdonnell area of central Australia recognise and acknowledge the achievements of former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam for Aboriginal people over a vast range of matters. Is it not apparent that former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam clearly had the confidence and gratitude of Aboriginal people and that they were prepared to vote for the party of which he is still so notable a member? Is it not an irony that Senator Bonner brought into the Senate, in such a hostile and critical way, the fact that former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam campaigned in the Macdonnell by-election, whereas many people would say that his making himself available to campaign in that by-election for quite a lengthy period is simply further confirmation of that man's total commitment to the Aboriginal cause?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had intended to make some comments on Senator Bonner's speech but they have been completely covered by the shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Ryan. I want to make one point. If anybody doubts what Senator Ryan said, the records are there for all to see in the Hansard and in the Acts of parliament presented during the years of the Whitlam Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to speak for a few minutes on a problem which has occurred, to me anyway, in that it is very difficult for me to obtain balanced reporting from one of the trouble spots in the world. I refer to El Salvador. Tonight I attended a meeting of the parliamentary group of Amnesty International at which concern was expressed about the lack of balanced reporting of what is happening in that country. I had sent to me by the New South Wales and Queensland branches of Amnesty International a copy of the March report. It arrived on my desk in the Parliament today. It is terribly important, I think, that honourable senators be aware of the contents of this document regarding El Salvador. </PARA>
<PARA> It would appear to me and, I presume, to the majority of people throughout Australia and the free-thinking world that the people of El Salvador are no better off under President Duarte than they were under the junta which operated in that country until December of last year. I say that in the knowledge of the contents of this report because people who were arrested prior to President Duarte's taking office are being executed following his election. The March edition of the Amnesty International newsletter states:</PARA>
<PARA> The human rights situation in El Salvador has deteriorated sharply in recent months. Amnesty International is seriously concerned and fears a further increase in summary execution, torture and abduction by government forces as civil conflict continues between guerrillas and the government. Of some 8,000 Salvadorians estimated to have been killed during the past year, many are known to have been the victims of extrajudicial execution by the armed forces. Peasants and young people appear to be particular targets. Sources in the country say that nearly 3,300 peasants were among those killed for political reasons in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite government claims that those killed by its forces are guerrillas and guerrilla sympathisers, many victims of torture and death at the hands of the security forces were not generally shown to have any direct involvement in armed guerrilla activity. </PARA>
<PARA> International attention was captured by the killing on 3 December 1980 of three nuns and a woman missionary, all United States nationals, reported to have been abducted by security forces the previous day. However, in the week after those killings, from 6 to 12 December, according to sources in El Salvador, 144 people were killed, 66 of them by uniformed members of the security forces. </PARA>
<PARA> On 17 December 1980, members of the National Guard raided the town of Cojutepeque in the department of San Salvador and killed eight leaders of the Central Campesina Salvadorena (Salvadorian Peasants Organization) who were meeting to discuss plans for participation in the government's agrarian reform program. There have been similar attacks in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> There is evidence that young people are singled out because of their youth. On 10 January 1981, troops took 22 teenagers from Mejicanos; all where later found dead, with marks showing that they had been tortured. An army spokesman said they died of bullet wounds in a confrontation with troops; but a doctor who examined 17 of the bodies said they had all been shot after dying. Five of the young women were unidentifiable because their faces had been erased. </PARA>
<PARA> AI has received reports that Salvadorian paramilitary squads regularly cross the border into Honduras to attack Salvadorian refugee camps. Inside El Salvador, church sources report that refugees have been taken from camps and killed. On 31 December 1980 soldiers from San Carlos garrison searched the Domus Mariae refugee centre in Mejicanos and took away Marcial Cruz, aged 18. He was later seen at the garrison, and on 9 January was found dead. </PARA>
<PARA> Red Cross clinics have been attacked: on 12 January, troops broke into a clinic in Chalatenango. They killed wounded people being treated there and abducted five young women aged from 14 to 22. On the same day, three men, members of the Baptist Church, were seized by security forces in San Salvador as they delivered provisions to the Red Cross. The whereabouts of all the people abducted in these two incidents are unknown. </PARA>
<PARA> Killings and 'disappearances' of foreign journalists, including journalist John Sullivan, United States citizen, who was abducted on 28 December, have been widely reported in the international media; but Salvadorian journalists have also been victims of the armed forces. On 15 January 1981, nine staff members of the newspaper El Independiente, including journalists Vida Cuadra and Francisco Ramirez Avila, were taken from the newspaper's offices by troops. The authorities deny that they are in detention. (On 25 January, the newspaper closed down and its director Jorge Pinto took refuge in the Mexican Embassy.)</PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Roman Catholic Church and others helping refugees and victims of the civil fighting have been hampered in their work by the security forces. The Archbishopric of San Salvador reported in mid-December that it had been forced to close its legal aid office (Socorro Juridico) because it had been raided 17 times in the previous week by the National Police. Even government offices have been subject to army raids. On 9 January, the publications department of the Education Ministry was raided by troops while it was printing leaflets with instructions for refugees; eight staff members, including the director of the department, were seized. Their whereabouts are unknown. Members of the El Salvador Human Rights Commission who witnessed the seizures have denied army allegations that subversive literature was found on the premises. </PARA>
<PARA> On 25 January, a leading member of the El Salvador Human Rights Commission, Victor Medrano, aged 29, was abducted from his home by plainclothes members of the National Police. Although he has been seen in the barracks of the National Police in San Salvador, authorities deny that he is in detention and there is very serious concern for his safety. Two other members of the same commission have been killed since the beginning of October last year. One was Maria Magdalena Enriquez, its press secretary who was found dead in a shallow grave about 20 miles from the capital. She was abducted on 3 October 1980 while shopping and appears to have been killed the day after her abduction. Witnesses confirmed that two of the heavily armed men who detained Sra. Enriquez were uniformed members of the National Police. Representatives of the Junta (that headed the government of El Salvador until December 1980) however denied that police carried out the detention and stated that the government 'was not implicated' in the matter. The other member of the commission killed was Ramon Valladares Perez, who was shot dead on 26 October while driving a car in the capital. The El Salvador Human Rights Commission is an independent human rights monitoring group that provides both assistance to victims of human rights abuse and publicises their cases. The Commission's offices have been destroyed by bombings three times last year in the presence of the permanent police guard on the premises. The Commission had reportedly been accused by the president of El Salvador, Ing. Jose Napoleon Duarte, of being 'anti-patriotic' a few days before the abduction of Victor Medrano. The offices of the Commission were again surrounded by troops on 18 January and the Commission has seen itself forced to close down. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> People have been killed because of their association, or presumed association with peasant, labour or religious organisations, or with political parties or other organisations which do not actively support the present government. Although these killings took place against a background of conflict between government forces and guerrilla organisations, evidence reaching AI shows that many civilians not involved in guerrilla activity are being tortured and killed by the security forces. Most of the deaths have occurred after people were seized at their homes or places of work. </PARA>
<PARA> During 1980 the government of El Salvador repeatedly claimed that independent 'anti-communist' assassination squads beyond government control were responsible for these abductions and murders. However, evidence collated by AI from hundreds of individual cases proves the responsibility of the regular security forces for serious violations of human rights. By attributing detentions, torture and killings to groups beyond government control, the government of El Salvador seems to have sought a means of evading accountability for the extra-legal measures carried out by its own security forces. </PARA>
<PARA> AI fears that the current wave of extrajudicial killings and 'disappearances' will continue to escalate as the Salvadorian security forces use the cover of civil warfare to carry out large-scale killings of young people, peasants and others not shown to be involved in guerrilla activities. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise this matter with the Parliament tonight on the adjournment debate because I am a member of the excecutive committee of the Parliamentary group of Amnesty International. It has expressed its concern through its international organisation, as I am sure will all members of this organisation who are bipartisan in their political approach to human rights, and members of the Senate and of the other place. We are vitally concerned at massacres which appear to be occurring on a regular basis in El Salvador. We are concerned that perhaps the Government is not doing as much as it should be doing. With the recent ratification by Australia of the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it appears to me to be an opportune time for the Australian Government to express its concern in a public way so that the Government of El Salvador knows of the concern of the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the adjournment debate there was a continuation of a matter raised this morning by Senator Bonner during Question Time. During the question which he asked this morning a number of allegations were raised, and they were amplified tonight. One of the problems I have is that some of the matters are very difficult to test. We know some matters to be fact. We know that Mr Neville Perkins is no longer the member for Macdonnell and that he has come to work in Canberra for the Aboriginal Development Commission in a senior position. We know that a by-election was held for the seat of Macdonnell and that Mr Bell had a very handsome victory in that by-election. We know that Mr Whitlam was at Papunya. Senator Bonner tells us Mr Whitlam was there at the same time as he was there during the election campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problem is that, on the information available to me, I cannot test, confirm, deny or in any other way work through the matter of what was or was not said by any person through an interpreter. In view of that, I do not wish to go over the ground which has been raised. I think the question of the development of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act is a matter of history. It is there for everyone to see. The real issue is whether statements were made about what the consequences might be of voting for one candidate or another, and what are the views of the Northern Territory Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the only matter in issue concerns the fact that any former Prime Minister is a person of very great authority in the community and a person of a particular kind of standing. The position and standing of any former Prime Minister imposes on that person a trust, particularly when moving among people such as the Aboriginal members of the community who would look to that person in a very special way. I think any former Prime Minister, taking part in a campaign in those circumstances, would have an obligation on him to ensure that any contribution he makes is impeccably correct in fact-that it is correct in every detail. I think that is the matter which could be at issue, but, as I said, I cannot test the facts and I do not think it is proper for me to comment further. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-Senator Coleman raised a matter which is of concern to her and, I think, to many people-El Salvador. She mentioned the concern of Amnesty International. Perhaps I could say, in brief response, that there are clearly two important aspects to the situation in El Salvador and urgent and effective action must be taken in regard to both of them to remove the threat that El Salvador now offers to peace and stability in the American sphere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> El Salvador has become an issue in East-West relations and there is now clear evidence of external support for left wing guerilla movements operating in El Salvador. The United States has a genuine and long-acknowledged interest in the region, and the Australian Government considers that the United States is entirely right in seeking to cut off a source of disturbance and revolution in Latin America. At the same time, however-I think this is the point which was made by Senator Coleman-many people are properly concerned about human rights violations in that country. The Australian Government shares this concern and has made its views known at this year's meeting in Geneva of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, the Government recognises the need to support economic and social reform in El Salvador as an essential step towards solving the human rights problems. During a meeting attended by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Street, in Washington on 5 March, the Vice-President of the United States of America, Mr Bush, made it clear to the Minister that the United States shares that view. Senator Coleman raised a number of matters of detail in her speech this evening. I undertake to refer them to the Minister. If there is a response further to the general comments I have made on behalf of the Minister I will see that it is given to Senator Coleman. </PARA>
