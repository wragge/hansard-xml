<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate, in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned at proposed future hydro-electric developments in South West Tasmania. As this area is on the Register of the National Estate it is therefore of national concern and your petitioners humbly call upon the Senate to conduct a Senate Inquiry into South West Tasmania. A Federal Inquiry has been recommended by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly call upon the Federal Parliament not to allocate funds or allow funds to be raised for development of roads or dams in the South West of Tasmania but rather to provide such funds as would enable the preservation of this area. This is a national issue and therefore Tasmanians should not be made to bear any financial burden resulting from its preservation.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. That the decision by the Federal Government to introduce fees at the Repatriation General Hospital, Greenslopes, was made without prior consultation with medical staff at that hospital and implemented at short notice.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. That fee introduction will place the hospital in the untenable position of having to compete with the State's free hospital system.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. That this competition will result in a substantial loss of specialist medical personnel and community non-entitled patients, both of whom are complementary and vital to maintaining the standards of excellence that this hospital has achieved.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. That the consequence of such losses will be a deterioration in health care standards to veterans in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA>Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, call upon the Government through the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to declare a moratorium on the introduction of fees at the Repatriation General Hospital, Greenslopes, until the full ramifications of this decision are studied more closely and the patients and staff are allowed adequate time to prepare for any financial changes.</PARA>

<TITLE>Tertiary Education Funding</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that the introduction of tuition fees for post-graduate and second degree students will:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) severely limit access to such levels of study. The ability of a student to pay tuition fees will be the main criteria for entry to such courses. The restricted availability of Commonwealth post-graduate scholarships and the difficulty of finding part-time work in employment related areas further restricts the ability of post-graduate students to pay tuition fees.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) result in higher attrition rates in post-graduate and second degree studies. Recent surveys have indicated that up to 50% of students would be unable to continue their studies if tuition fees at the level of $1,000 per year were introduced. Inability to continue study is both a personal tragedy and a waste of the community's resources.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) limit Australia's capacity to cope with technological, economic and social change. Many degree students who will have to pay tuition fees undertake further study to upgrade their qualifications to cope with changes in their area of employment. Many are forced to undertake retraining in areas outside their current employment because of declining job opportunities in such areas due to economic change. Further study for many students will bring no financial benefit but simply allow them to extend their contribution in the course of their work. For example thousands of teachers have undertaken further study to gain expertise in such areas as migrant education, remedial literacy and numeracy teaching, curriculum development and so on.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) further restrict access to such study for women students. As a result of the abolition of tuition fees the proportion of women students in tertiary education has increased significantly. Mature age women students have benefited by the opportunity denied them when they left school.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) seriously undermine Australia's research effort. Approximately 22% of Australian research takes place in tertiary institutions. The bulk of Australia's basic research is undertaken in universities. The introduction of tuition fees threatens Australia's capacity to cope with major structural change in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senate will reject the introduction of tuition fees.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. That we wish to express our strongest opposition to any deregulation of trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. That if trading hours are deregulated in the Australian Capital Territory the present restrictions on trading hours in other parts of Australia may be lifted.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Past performances have proven that longer trading hours do not lead to increased sales. However, they do increase costs, because shops have to be staffed for longer periods. To cover these increased costs, retailers are forced to increase prices and reduce staff levels. This means that longer trading hours increase both prices and unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. There is no real consumer demand for longer trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>

Can the Minister inform the Senate whether it is correct that, of all the countries which have now introduced viewdata systems, Australia is the first in which the system will be provided by private enterprise and not by the common telecommunications carrier of the nation concerned? Is it not a fact that Australia will be the first country in which the technical equipment will be provided by one or two sources and the information to be displayed on the system will be provided by the same sources? In other words, is it not a fact that in all other countries there is separation of the equipment itself from the sources of information? As the Minister has said in his statement that the decision was made to help Telecom with its cash flow problems, can he give the Senate the total projected cost to Telecom of viewdata and at the same time the annual capital investment figure by Telecom?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am informed that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is aware of the article, which I have read as well. The information supplied by the Minister in answer to the question is as follows: The allegations in the article are false. The same arrangements apply to travel to Norfolk Island either directly or via Lord Howe Island as apply to flights direct to New Zealand and, in fact, to all international departures. Scheduled services to Norfolk Island by East-West Airlines Ltd ex Sydney and Norfolk Island Air Services ex Brisbane are cleared before departure in the usual way. The East-West departures are physically cleared at the domestic terminal, not the international terminal, but the procedures are the same. Probably there are some charter flights from various airports and these are not cleared prior to Norfolk Island. When they put down on Lord Howe Island, they are then subject to airport clearances which in all respects are similar to those which they otherwise would have been subject to on leaving the mainland.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I have indicated to the Senate on an earlier occasion that, as a matter of normal practice, areas of policy are continually under review within my Department. I put the Children's Services Program under review jointly between my Department and the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat. I asked Mr Spender, a member of this Parliament, to assist the officers in the process of that review. As a result, a document which has been somewhat lavishly termed the 'Spender report' came into existence. In fact, it was an internal departmental working document. It was not my intention to release it to the public. It is a document which does no more than form a basis for my giving policy matters consideration. The matters which are contained within the Spender recommendations from the Department and the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat are matters which I am proposing to put before the Government for its consideration. I do not believe that the release of that internal document would in any way assist the area of concern that the honourable senator has mentioned. As far as the extraordinarily wide circulation is concerned, that is a matter which is no doubt far better known to the honourable senator than to me. My understanding is that the document has had a reasonably restricted circulation; but, if it has become wider than I am aware of, that would not be all that unusual, unfortunately.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Attorney-General, concerns a claim by a lobster fisherman from Western Australia against the Deputy Crown Solicitor in Perth in December 1979 for damage to lobster pots by a Royal Australian Navy vessel during naval exercises off the Lancelin naval gunfire support barge in 1979. It has been pointed out to me that the claim, which was for a few hundred dollars, has been refused, but not before nearly two years had elapsed. I ask the Attorney-General: Firstly, is it a fact that a time lapse of nearly two years did occur before this claim was refused? Secondly, if so, does the Attorney-General not think that the Department was tardy in dealing with this claim? Thirdly, as the amount involved in this claim is of little importance to the Crown but of great concern to the fisherman, and noting the disparity of interpretation that appears to exist between the Department of Defence and the Attorney-General's Department, will he sympathetically reconsider this claim? Fourthly, whether or not he agrees to this request, will he consult with the Minister for Defence so that the rules can be clearly conveyed to the fisherman?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that the facts relating to the matter raised by Senator Thomas are as follows: The Executive Officer of the Western Australian branch of the Australian Fishing Industry Council made a claim on behalf of the fisherman mentioned by Senator Thomas to the naval officer commanding the Western Australian area. On 25 September 1979 the Deputy Crown Solicitor replied to the Executive Officer acknowledging receipt of the claim. That reply referred to the wide publicity that had been given to the gunnery exercise and to the prohibition of fishing in the area. It appeared that other fishermen had moved their equipment from the area but this fisherman had not done so. Further correspondence from the Council raised the question of whether there had been some undertaking in 1977 by naval officers to pay compensation or to permit equipment to remain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Deputy Crown Solicitor had no information on these matters and it was necessary to consult with the Royal Australian Navy and ultimately with the Department of Defence in Canberra. The matter has not yet been resolved. However, in September of this year the Deputy Crown Solicitor in Perth did write denying liability. That is the situation as it stands. Apparently there was some delay in correspondence passing between the Deputy Crown Solicitor and the Department of Defence in relation to the information that was being sought. That is the background to the matter. Senator Thomas asks me whether I will look at the matter again and consult with the Department of Defence. I will do so.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I have answered a number of similar questions on this matter. Perhaps I should state again that, in the case of goods sold by wholesale, sales tax is payable in respect of the selling price at the point of the last wholesale sale. This price generally reflects all costs incurred in getting the goods to the point of wholesale sale. To the extent that it reflects a component to cover freight, sales tax is payable on freight. The freight position is not peculiar to country traders but applies equally to all wholesalers who incur freight in getting goods to the point of wholesale sale. It is not uncommon for tax on the freight component to be eliminated for country traders by arranging for the wholesale sale to occur, for example, in a capital city where the goods are manufactured. Sales tax is imposed at the wholesale stage and is not payable on the retailer's mark-up or freight incurred after the wholesale sale.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the request relating to the Commissioner sending someone to see that the matter is dealt with properly, I am advised that the Commissioner's officers undertake regular audits of registered sales tax payers, including those in remote areas, to ensure that the provisions of the sales tax law are being properly applied. If Senator Collard has any instances in mind that he would like to have referred to the Treasurer, I will see that that is done. If there is any doubt in the minds of wholesalers as to how this matter should be dealt with, perhaps some clarification could be given if we could have more specific information on it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport certainly is aware of the fact that East-West Airlines has withdrawn its services in respect of the proposed no frills service from Canberra to Sydney. He has expressed disappointment that East-West has deferred the introduction of that service under clause 10 of the 1972 airlines agreement, which is currently still in force. I think there are a few matters which he has not publicly commented on up till now but which I would like to make clear. His approval for the East-West line to operate its service did not carry with it any guarantee that that company would enjoy a monopoly in respect of that service. Indeed, the prospect of Ansett and TAA applying to offer an equivalent service, particularly having regard to the provisions of the Independent Air Fares Committee Act which allow operators to match fares, was canvassed with East-West on a number of occasions before the approval was actually given. In this regard the Minister noted that both TAA and Ansett have had licences to operate F27s between Sydney and Canberra for quite a number of years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As regards Senator Reid's question about the number of cancelled flights by Ansett and TAA, I have no information on that matter at this moment but I will undertake to obtain that information for the honourable senator. The Minister's approval of Ansett's F27 services to operate on the same fares and conditions as those of East-West is consistent with the principles recently adopted in the Independent Air Fares Committee legislation and is entirely consistent with previous and past practice. East-West was well aware that Ansett and TAA were allowed to offer competitive fares in respect of Bizjet's specialised services across Bass Strait. East-West's deferment, however, is a matter for its commercial decision. East-West can-and the Minister hopes it will-commence these services at any time. The opportunity to compete is there but the Minister cannot guarantee East-West or anyone else any monopoly no frills service on this route. That is due, I believe, to the current situation and to the provisions of the present airlines agreement.</PARA>

The fact of the matter at Rundle is simply that the Rundle project started out between two co-partnerships, one of which involved the Esso company and the other was the Australian co-partnership. They set about their exploratory mining ventures and drilling and also the testing of their retorts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When they did their drilling, at a given point of time they found that the material that lay between the shale strata was such that it was unstable and would not form a mining wall, that the angle of the mining wall would be such that they would not be able to recover as much of the shale as they had previously thought and as they had previously informed the public and that, therefore, there would be more left in the ground. They found that the material itself was so unstable when dry and in the air that it could not form a fill-in and would have to be disposed of elsewhere. Therefore, they found that there would have to be a complete reconsideration of the costing and the mining techniques and a complete re-evaluation by mining engineers. At the same time, they struck difficulties in the testing of the various kinds of retorts in America.</PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that, when I discovered this, I and the Treasurer called upon the partners first of all to determine whether they did have differences of opinion.

The stabilising of crude oil prices in the world, with a decline in the real price of crude oil, has set back synthetics.

Those negotiations have been proceeding for a considerable time and, hopefully, in view of the fact that the negotiators have signed an agreement in principle, are at a very advanced stage. Will the Minister use his good offices to expedite finalisation of these negotiations so that construction by the companies can commence and, therefore, create an anticipated peak of 2,200 new jobs in construction work at these two sites, thus offsetting the effect of the Tennant Creek Peko dismissals and the possibility of losing these single men from the Northern Territory work force?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the announcement last week that the smelter in Tennant Creek would close. Like Senator Kilgariff, I regret the loss of jobs suffered by 230 employees which that closure will bring about but would make the point that the decision to close was made on economic grounds alone. That was made clear in the Press release. It does not really relate to negotiations with the Land Council or to matters which affect the Aboriginal lands rights Act. The honourable senator has referred to two negotiations which are proceeding. Negotiations are under way between the Northern Land Council and Pancontinental in respect of the proposed Jabiluka mine, and between the Council and Denison Mines in respect of Koongarra. These negotiations involve complex and sensitive issues and agreement is not likely to be reached before some time has passed. The processes that are laid down for such negotiation cannot be compromised or avoided. I can give no guarantee as to when the necessary approvals will be made available to permit construction to commence at either Koongarra or Jabiluka. Of course, the Government hopes that the necessary agreements can be reached as soon as possible so that development at both sites can proceed. Clearly, it would welcome a situation in which those who had been retrenched at Tennant Creek could find employment at sites in the uranium province, but no guarantee can be given that jobs will be available at Jabiluka or Koongarra which will give immediate relief to those who have been retrenched as a result of the closure of the smelter and the Gecko Mine. The honourable senator asks me to use my good offices in trying to advance the negotiations. I point out that there is a problem in that I am required to approve any agreement that is finally reached. A conflict could arise if I were to try to be at the one time both a participant in the negotiating process and the person who has to approve any agreement that is reached.</PARA></TALK.START>

We also said that the individual percentage and nature of product would be determined case by case. We stated further that obviously, when one sets out to liquefy coal or to produce oil from shale one does not know the nature of the precise product until all the work has been done. So the principle would be there but the actual precise arrangements would be dealt with on a case by case basis. Also, the countries have been told quite clearly-it would be clearly understood-that the Australian indigenous oil petroleum market would have to be supplied ahead of any other market.

In view of the detailed and valuable information which the telescope has been providing to Australian and overseas scientists during the past 20 years, and the importance of encouraging more extensive research into, and use of, solar energy within our communities, will the Government reconsider its decision to close the telescope? Secondly, what approaches have been made by the Government in an effort to secure the funds necessary to prevent the closure?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The decision to mothball the radio heliograph from the end of 1984 was made by the executive of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and not by the Government. It is the responsibility of the executive of the CSIRO to allocate resources within the Organisation. The executive considered that the injection of substantial funds to enable the radio heliograph's continued operation could not be justified. In this event it is facing up to a decision in order that CSIRO's programs are terminated at some stage so that new initiatives of higher priority can be started. No approach has been made by the Government or by CSIRO to secure additional funds in order to prevent the closure of the radio heliograph. The radio heliograph is used for basic astronomical research. It collects information on physical processing which occurs in the sun. But this research is not related to the harnessing of energy from the sun.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not familiar with the particular circumstances of the Launceston family day care scheme, but I would certainly be concerned at any suggestion that it would close. Family day care schemes are a particularly successful way of providing long day care. They are also a particularly cost effective way of doing so. I will certainly see that the position in respect of the Launceston scheme is followed up by my Department forthwith. I will find out from it what the particular problem is. Whilst there may be a general policy to restrict the size of family day care schemes to about 100 children, there are certainly a number of schemes operating with numbers of children in excess of that figure. So it is not imposed, as I understand it, on an absolute basis. In any event, I will need to seek further information to respond fully to Senator Hearn's question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the question of funding, recently I made a statement in respect of family day care schemes indicating that my Department is examining the cost structures of these schemes and the fees currently charged in common with the other areas of the Children's Services Program. That automatically seems to give rise to a concern that that will mean that things will be more difficult, rather than easier, for parents. I have made the point before in the Senate chamber that one of the reasons why I wish to examine the financing aspects of the Children's Services Program is that some of the services which receive substantial capital and recurrent funding provide services which it seems to me are not available to those whom we would most wish to see assisted, namely, those who are least able to purchase those services.</PARA>
<PARA> I am anxious to see that the priorities established by my predecessor-priority of access for those with particular social needs and priority of economic assistance to those with economic need-are successfully pursued. I appreciate that family day care schemes have had no adjustment to the rate of subsidy for some years. However, I know that some are operating very effectively within the limits of available subsidies and that others have written to me and told me that they are having greater difficulties. When I have had a full report from my Department, which has this matter in hand, I will be taking it before the Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, relates to the increases in family allowances that are to become effective in January. It seems to me that sections 101 and 102 (1) of the Social Services Act 1947 embody a delay in establishing a commencement date for family allowances to parents so that many parents are denied entitlement to the family allowance until several weeks, sometimes even a full month, after the birth of the child. I ask the Minister: Is it possible to amend the Act so that under normal circumstances when a claim for the family allowance is lodged promptly after the child's birth, the family allowance entitlement is made retrospective to the date of birth of the child rather than as it is at the moment?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point raised by the honourable senator arises from the fact that family allowances, in common with many of the benefits paid by my Department, are paid in arrears. Like the old age pension, they are also paid on the basis of the first pay-day on which entitlement has arisen. The family allowance commences to accrue from the commencement of the endowment period following the birth of the child. This has been the provision for many years and the family allowance has never been paid from the date of birth. There can, of course, in those circumstances be some delay before the family allowance begins to accrue. On the other hand, when the child turns 16 years or is no longer a student child, the endowment continues in respect of the full endowment period during which the child turns 16 years. In other words there is a loss on the swings and a gain on the roundabouts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second part of the honourable senator's question is whether it is possible to amend the particular Act to change the position. Having listened with some amazement to the question Senator Haines repeated several times, one cannot amend any Act unless it is sent back again and again and again. If that happens there is a lot of difficulty. The fact is, yes, we can amend this or any other piece of legislation if both Houses of Parliament are prepared to co-operate in that endeavour. Whether the Government will bring forward such an amendment will depend on the matter being examined. I will ensure that it is examined in the lead-up to next year's Budget along with the many other suggestions which will be made between now and then.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport has noted on many occasions the various calls for further independent inquiries into the general aviation industry, which Senator Bjelke-Petersen refers to. However, he points out that quite a number of reviews and inquiries into the industry have been carried out since 1978. In fact I think there have been at least six into the various sectors of the aviation industry, these being: The Senate Select Committee on Passenger Fares and Services to and from Tasmania; the Review of Australia's International Civil Aviation Policy; the Domestic Air Transport Policy Review; the general aviation study; the Holcroft Committee of Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares; and the Price Waterhouse study.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Additionally, the Government is already committed to a further four studies, these being: A review of aspects of Australia's international policy; a cost allocation review of Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans Australia Airlines by the independent air fares committee; a consultant's investigation into the practicalities of selling all or part of the equity of TAA; and an independent inquiry to investigate the desirability of deregulation as a long term policy objective for the domestic aviation industry. Under the circumstances I think it is safe to say that the industry has been subject to and is still facing a multitude of inquiries. There is little, if anything, that can be thought of or said in relation to these matters which has not already been the subject of one or other of those inquiries. As the Government has decided that its thrust in policy is to reduce the extent of government involvement in what is now normal commercial aviation in the industry, a study such as that outlined by the question would not seem to be appropriate at this stage.</PARA>

<PARA>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL 1981</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will give legislative effect to 27 recommendations of the comprehensive report of the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act. A number of recommendations of the Joint Select Committee were similar to those made to me by the Family Law Council. But, in addition, the Bill will also implement certain other recommendations of the Family Law Council. The Bill proposes the most extensive amendment of the Family Law Act since its initial enactment. </PARA>
<PARA> Broadly, the Bill extends the jurisdiction under the Act in relation to property and custody proceedings. It provides that proceedings under the Family Law Act are to be held in open court and, although the absolute prohibition on the publication of details is removed, it prevents publication of details that would identify individuals involved in proceedings. The Bill establishes an Appeal Division of the Family Court of Australia. It enables courts exercising jurisdiction under the Act to attach a power of arrest to injunctions in certain circumstances. It will remove the requirement for the parties or their legal representatives to attend the Family Court in undefended divorce applications and enable the wishes of children of all ages to be taken into account, as appropriate. Certain provisions concerning the removal of children from Australia that were contained in the Migration Act have been revised and will be relocated in the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Select Committee recommended that the Commonwealth should legislate to the full extent of its constitutional power with respect to children and property of parties to a marriage. I agree with this view. The present position where, in certain circumstances, proceedings are necessary in both the Family Court and State supreme courts causes great emotional and financial stress. The Commonwealth should, as far as possible, alleviate difficulties and problems caused to people by aspects of the Federal division of powers in the area of family law. If the Commonwealth by competent legislative action can help mitigate animosity and reduce financial hardship it should do so. For instance, why should it not be open to an uncle or grandmother to bring custody proceedings in the Family Court if he or she considers it beneficial to a child? After all, it is the well-being of the child that is the paramount consideration. Further, why should not all children who have been treated as part of the family be dealt with by a single specialist court in a single proceeding?</PARA>
<PARA> At present, proceedings under the Family Law Act can be brought only in relation to natural or adopted children of both parties to a marriage. The Joint Select Committee considered this category too restrictive and recommended that it be extended to cover stepchildren and even foster children. The Bill does this. It also extends the Act to cover children born to married women by means of medical procedures, such as artificial insemination, where the husband is not the biological father but has consented to the medical procedure, or the law otherwise deems the child to be the child of the husband. In addition, the Bill provides that a third party may bring custody, guardianship, access or maintenance proceedings in relation to a child of a marriage against a party to a marriage. It will be seen, therefore, that the Bill reduces the number of situations that require resort to two different courts and legal systems. </PARA>
<PARA> In proceedings between parties to a marriage concerning property, the Bill gives effect to the recommendation of the Joint Select Committee. At present property proceedings can only be brought in relation to concurrent, pending or completed proceedings for dissolution or annulment of marriage between the parties. The Bill will enable proceedings to be brought by parties to a marriage in relation to the property of the parties or either of them where the proceedings arise out of the marital relationship. This proposed amendment will be of advantage to many persons faced with marital breakdown who wish to secure a settlement of property rights before the period of 12 months separation required for divorce proceedings has expired. I would point out that in a case where proceedings for a property settlement are brought prior to the institution of dissolution proceedings, the court will have power to adjourn the property proceedings to enable the parties to consider the likely effect of the proceedings on their marriage or on any children of their marriage. </PARA>
<PARA> Also in relation to the jurisdiction of the Family Court, the Bill implements the recommendation of the Joint Select Committee that the Family Court in the Australian Capital Territory should be invested with as broad as possible jurisdiction in family law matters. There has been for some time a call for the Family Court to be open to the public. The majority report of the Joint Select Committee and the Family Law Council has so recommended. The Bill enables proceedings to be heard in open court but empowers a court to exclude persons from proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Bill relaxes the present total prohibition on publication of details of proceedings under the Act, it provides severe penalties for publication of any account of proceedings or a part of proceedings that identifies a party to the proceedings, a person related to or associated with a party to the proceedings, or a witness in the proceedings. I appreciate that there are strong views held by many that the Family Court should continue to be a closed court and there should be no relaxation of the existing absolute prohibition on the publication of details of proceedings under the Act. The new provisions, in my opinion, strike a fair balance between the conflicting, but equally valid, needs for public scrutiny of courts and for personal privacy in this delicate area of domestic relationships. I also intend to keep under close examination the operation of the amendments proposed to be made under the Bill in relation to these two matters. </PARA>
<PARA> As mentioned, the Bill establishes an Appeal Division of the Family Court. A Full Court is to be constituted by a majority of judges from the Appeal Division. This structure gives effect to the present practice of the Chief Judge of the Family Court which, in effect, adopts the recommendation of the Joint Select Committee. The Chief Judge now selects a panel of 11 judges for appeal work and a Full Court consists of at least two of these judges. The other judges sit on at least one Full Court sitting each year. In accordance with other recommendations of the Joint Select Committee, the Bill also renders the Chief Judge responsible for the orderly and expeditious discharge of the business of the Court, thus vesting her with statutory power in respect of the administration and arrangement of the business of the Court that she already carries out in practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will enable undefended divorce applications to be dealt with without the necessity for either of the parties or their legal representatives to attend before the Court. In addition to the savings of expense to the parties mentioned by the Joint Select Committee, I anticipate that there will be significant savings of court time. This will not, of course, diminish in any way the Court's need to be satisfied, on the evidence, that the ground for granting a divorce has been established and that there is no reasonable likelihood that cohabitation will be resumed. As recommended by the Joint Select Committee, the Bill also enables joint applications for divorce to be made. I agree with the Committee that where the parties have mutually agreed to a divorce and the requisite ground has been established the making of a joint application would reduce the costs to the parties and would encourage negotiation and conciliation. </PARA>
<PARA> Another significant recommendation of the Joint Select Committee which is implemented by the Bill is that there is to be a discretion given to the Court to attach a power of arrest to an injunction granted for the personal protection of a party to or a child of a marriage or to exclude a person from certain premises. The Court can so attach a power of arrest where it is satisfied that bodily harm has been caused to a party or to a child of the marriage by the person against whom the injunction is directed and that person is likely to cause bodily harm to a party to or a child of a marriage. Under the proposed new section, once a power of arrest order has been made, a Commonwealth or State police officer may, if he believes on reasonable grounds that the person against whom the injunction was granted has, since the order was made, breached the injunction, arrest that person without warrant. A person so arrested must be brought before a court within 24 hours of his arrest or, if a Sunday or public holiday commences within the 24-hour period, 48 hours after his arrest. A power of arrest attached to an injunction will cease to have effect six months after the date specified in the order or on such earlier date as is specified by the Court when making the order. I believe that this amendment will significantly increase the protection available to wives and children who are faced with domestic violence. I am confident that it will assist the police in dealing with this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I now propose to deal with those provisions in the Bill which relate specifically to the welfare of children. Both the Joint Select Committee and the Family Law Council have recommended that the requirement that a court give effect to the wishes of a child of 14 years or more in custody proceedings should be replaced by a provision enabling the wishes of children of all ages to be taken into account to the extent appropriate. The Bill gives effect to these recommendations. This should alleviate the pressure that has sometimes been placed on children of 14 years or more in custody proceedings because of the present provision. The Bill also enables children to avail themselves of the counselling facilities of the Family Court and to initiate custody proceedings as proposed by the Committee and supported by the Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill revises and relocates in the Family Law Act the provisions of Part III of the Migration Act that provide offences in relation to removal from Australia of children in respect of whom custody or access orders have been made or sought. This measure was recommended by the Interdepartmental Committee on Prevention of Removal of Children from Australia by One Parent, which considered that the inclusion of the provisions in the Family Law Act would more easily bring to the notice of the public and the legal profession the prohibitions that exist. In addition, penalties for these offences are increased. In relation to abduction of children, the Bill provides that, where a child has been removed from a person legally entitled to the care and control of the child, a court may order that the person wrongly removing the child make reparation to the Commonwealth, a Commonwealth authority or to any other person in respect of the loss suffered or expense incurred by the Commonwealth, an authority or any other person in restoring a child to the person entitled to care and control. This will apply, for example, where the Commonwealth, pursuant to a scheme that has been operating for some two years now, has provided financial assistance to a person in respect of action or proceedings that person has had to undertake overseas to seek restoration of a child in these circumstances. The Joint Select Committee recommended that the Act be amended to include such a provision. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to proceedings under the Act involving the welfare of a child, both the Joint Select Committee and the Family Law Council have recommended that the Act should make a clear distinction between, on the one hand, a conference with a court counsellor or welfare officer, the purpose of which is to attempt to resolve the differences existing between the parties to the proceedings and, on the other, a conference with a court counsellor or welfare officer, the purpose of which is to enable the court counsellor or welfare officer to furnish a report to the court to assist the court in its determination of the matter. The former type of conference should be absolutely confidential, whereas the latter will not be confidential. The report produced as a result of the latter type of conference will be received in evidence in the proceedings and accordingly may be the subject of cross-examination. The Bill makes the necessary amendments to the Act to establish this important distinction. The Joint Select Committee also recommended that the Court should be able to invite the intervention of child welfare officers responsible for the administration of relevant State or Territory laws in appropriate proceedings relating to the welfare of a child. The Bill does this. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to those provisions in the Bill relating to financial proceedings under the Act. To assist the courts in dealing with difficulties posed in a case where one party to the marriage will become entitled to superannuation benefits in the relatively near future but there is otherwise little property available for distribution between the parties, the Joint Select Committee recommended that the Act be amended to give the court a discretion to adjourn the proceedings to enable a final order to be made in such proceedings when the superannuation benefits are received. The Bill makes such an amendment to the Act. To ensure the effectiveness of this amendment it has also been necessary to provide in the Bill that where one of the parties to property settlement proceedings dies before a final order has been made in the proceedings, then those proceedings may be continued by or against the legal personal representative of the deceased party. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the Joint Select Committee and the Family Law Council have recommended that the grounds on which a property settlement order made under the Act can be varied or set aside should be extended. However the Joint Select Committee recommended that such variations be possible in a wider range of circumstances than those recommended by the Family Law Council. Given the policy of the Act that the financial relationships between the parties to the marriage should be determined finally in one proceeding as far as practicable, I have accepted the Family Law Council's recommendation for a narrower range of circumstances in which a property order can be varied. An amendment has also been included to provide that proceedings for having existing property interests declared and put into effect be exempt from the requirement to bring property proceedings within 12 months of the divorce. Such proceedings are, of course, normally available to any persons under the ordinary property law, and it seemed illogical to deprive people of this usual remedy merely because they do not avail themselves of it within 12 months of a divorce. This can, of course, be distinguished from proceedings for property settlement that seek alterations to existing property interests, to which the 12 month requirement will continue to apply. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill makes some amendments recommended by the Joint Select Committee to the provisions concerning the matters to be taken into account in maintenance proceedings, in order to ensure:</PARA>
<PARA> That the eligibility of the parties to receive overseas as well as Australian pensions and the like is relevant; and</PARA>
<PARA> that the financial circumstances of any cohabitation of either party-not just the applicant-are considered. </PARA>
<PARA>I have also accepted and included in the Bill recommendations by the Family Law Council to the effect that orders with respect to the maintenance of a party to or a child of a marriage should cease to have effect upon the death of a person liable to make payments under the order, and to the effect that provisions in maintenance agreements registered or approved under the Act, for the payment of periodic maintenance should cease to operate on the death of the person liable to make such payments, unless the agreement specifically provides to the contrary. I have also accepted a Family Law Council recommendation that there should be a provision in the Act similar to the provision in the repealed Matrimonial Causes Act which permitted the court to inquire into and make orders in relation to property subject to a marriage settlement for the benefit of the parties to a marriage. </PARA>
<PARA> A further significant amendment made by the Bill is that the rule-making power under the Family Law Act should be vested in the judges of the Family Court and of State Family Courts. This will bring the Family Court into line with other superior courts in this respect. The Bill also provides for a Rules Advisory Committee to provide advice to the judges in their rule-making capacity. Both of the amendments implement recommendations of the Joint Select Committee and of the Family Law Council. The recommendations of the Joint Select Committee in relation to the provision for offers for settlement in certain proceedings under the Act and in relation to the factors that a court should take into account in making an order for costs under the Act are also implemented by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes the amendments that are considered necessary to enable Australia to accede to The Hague Convention on the Recognition of Divorces and Legal Separation and to enable the implementation in this country of the provisions of The Hague Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions Relating to Maintenance Obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity has also been taken to include amendments to the provision dealing with the recognition and enforcement in Australia of an overseas custody order, to alleviate problems that have arisen from time to time where such an order has conflicted with an Australian order relating to the same child. The effect of the amendments is to enable the Court to either cancel the registration of the overseas order or discharge the Australian order depending on whether or not there has been a change in the circumstances of the child since the making of the overseas order, or whether or not the welfare of the child is likely to be adversely affected by the continuation of the overseas order. The Court may also cancel the registration of an overseas order if all persons having rights under the order agree to its cancellation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill makes some minor technical amendments relating to the Family Law Council, particularly, for example to enable the remuneration and allowances of members of the Council to be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal, rather than by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also a number of amendments to be made by the Bill which are of a drafting or technical nature. In this connection, I should mention that the opportunity has been taken to rewrite those provisions in the Act which invest courts with both original and appellate jurisdiction under the Act in a form now considered more appropriate by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. The amendments permitting joint applications for dissolution of marriage and enabling third parties to bring custody and like proceedings have both made necessary a number of consequential amendments to the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will appreciate the breadth of the matters covered in the Bill. Family law is a very personal matter and senators will have individual views. It is for this reason that Government senators will have a free vote on the Bill. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>MAINTENANCE ORDERS (COMMONWEALTH OFFICERS) AMENDMENT BILL 1981</PARA>
<PARA> Before I come to deal with the amendments proposed in the Bill, honourable senators may find it useful if I explain the background to the Maintenance Orders (Commonwealth Officers) Act 1966. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has made statutory provision for maintenance payments for children, wives and, latterly, husbands, where a need for maintenance exists. That provision was contained in the repealed Matrimonial Causes Act and is now contained in the Family Law Act. But the Commonwealth, of course, does not possess unfettered powers to legislate for the payment of maintenance in all situations. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, there is an area of maintenance jurisdiction which falls outside the subjects on which the Commonwealth may now legislate and therefore remains to be governed by State legislation. That area concerns maintenance for certain ex-nuptial children and, potentially, maintenance for parties to de facto relationships. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation of divided responsibility, with Commonwealth law governing some cases and State law governing others, will probably continue until an appropriate reference of powers by the States to the Commonwealth is made. Until that time, the difficulties occasioned by divided responsibility will remain to be solved. One of those practical difficulties concerns the enforcement of a maintenance order made under State law against a Commonwealth employee. </PARA>
<PARA> To overcome this difficulty, the Maintenance Orders (Commonwealth Officers) Act 1966 allows an attachment of earnings or garnishment order made under a State law, to enforce a State maintenance order against a Commonwealth employee, to be directed to the Commonwealth, or a Commonwealth authority, as the relevant employer in a manner similar to that in which it could be directed to a private employer in the State. The Act also deals with the action to be taken where priorities are required to be accorded between two State orders or between a State order and an order under Commonwealth legislation made in respect of the one Commonwealth employee. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Maintenance Orders (Commonwealth Officers) Act 1966-to which I shall refer, for convenience, as the principal Act-set out in the Bill before the Senate fall into a small number of discrete categories: One category is consequential upon Northern Territory self-government and the remaining two upon the Family Law Act. The amendments are technical in nature.</PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the first category of amendments-those consequential upon Northern Territory self-government. At present, it is possible that State garnishment orders may be directed to the Northern Territory and its authorities, by virtue of the principal Act. This is because the definitions of 'the Commonwealth' and 'Commonwealth authority' in the Act include, respectively, the Administration of a Territory and a Territory authority. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation does not accord with the arrangements for Northern Territory self-government under which matters such as this, because of the Territory's law and justice function and its regulation of its own employees, are properly matters for Territory law. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the definitions I have mentioned are to be amended to make it clear that 'the Commonwealth' does not include the Northern Territory and a 'Commonwealth authority' does not include a Northern Territory authority. Orders made by virtue of the principal Act will then no longer be able to be directed to the Northern Territory or its authorities and it will be for the Northern Territory to make its own law on the subject. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the amendments to the principal Act necessitated by the Family Law Act. At present, the principal Act enables moneys to be attached under a State garnishment order notwithstanding that those moneys may be protected from attachment by another law. That other law is, on this point, effectively disregarded. </PARA>
<PARA> However, this does not accord with paragraph 106 (2)(a) of the Family Law Act 1975 which enables regulations to be made providing for the attachment of moneys to be paid, inter alia, by the Commonwealth, but not moneys protected from attachment by another law. In other words, under the principal Act, moneys may be attached by garnishment which would not be able to be attached under the Family Law Act and Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will change the approach of the principal Act so that it is the same as that of the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill replaces a provision referring to the repealed Matrimonial Causes Act with one referring to the Family Law Act. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL 1981</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to repeal Part III-Emigration of Certain Children-of the Migration Act 1958-the Act-in order that its provisions may be revised and relocated to the Family Law Act 1975. Part III of the Act at present provides for offences and penalties in respect of the removal and carriage from Australia of children in contravention of custody or access orders that have been made or are being sought. It is considered that the existence of the equivalent provisions in the family law legislation would be more generally known to the public and the legal profession. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains a minor consequential amendment to section 66 of the Act relating to the institution of prosecutions. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bills be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>DOMICILE BILL 1981</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, which is based upon a model Domicile Bill agreed upon in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, makes four important changes to the common law of domicile. Those four changes are: (a) abolition of the rule of dependent domicile of married women; (b) abolition of the rule of revival of domicile of origin; (c) the age of capacity to have an independent domicile is fixed at 18 years; and (d) new rules are provided for determining the domicile of certain children. Similar legislation has been passed in the Northern Territory and all States, other than Western Australia, where it has been introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> A person's domicile is, broadly speaking, the place where the law regards him as having his permanent home. A number of matters affecting personal capacity, such as capacity to marry and to make a will, are determined according to the law of the place in which a person is domiciled. The question where a person is domiciled is now determined according to a number of complex common law rules. At birth, a person acquires his father's domicile, if his parents are married, or his mother's domicile, if his parents are not married. Other rules relate to change of domicile, for example, where a person moves from one jurisdiction to another. </PARA>
<PARA> The common law rules do not take account of modern social attitudes relating to the rights of parties to a marriage or the custody of children. Nor do they adequately reflect the increased mobility of individuals, particulardy in a federation such as Australia. The Standing Committee of Attorneys-General has for some years had under consideration proposals to reform some of these common law rules to more adequately reflect modern requirements. With a view to implementing reform on a uniform basis throughout Australia, the Standing Committee prepared a model Bill. The substantive provisions of the domicile Bill give effect to that model Bill. The successful implementation of this important project is an example of the valuable contribution the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General is able to make to law reform in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the four major changes the Bill makes to the common law rules. First, clause 6 abolishes the common law rule that a married woman has the same domicile as her husband. At common law, a woman acquires, upon marriage, the domicile of her husband and thereupon has no capacity to have an independent domicile. A wife continues to have the domicile of her husband throughout the duration of a marriage, even if the spouses permanently separate and the husband acquires a domicile, for example, in a foreign country with which the wife has no connection. It is clearly no longer appropriate that a wife's domicile should automatically be the same as that of her husband. Accordingly, the common law rule is abolished and a married woman will have an independent capacity to acquire a domicile of her own. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, clause 7 abolishes a technical common law rule known as the rule of revival of the domicile of origin. Related to this provision is the provision in clause 10 concerning intention for acquisition of a domicile of choice. Clause 10 provides that the intention a person must have in order to acquire a domicile of choice in a country is the intention to make his home indefinitely in that country. This provision overcomes some problems that have arisen at common law in establishing the acquisition of a new domicile of choice. 'Country' is defined in clause 4 to include any State, province or territory that is part of a country. </PARA>
<PARA> Special problems in relation to domicile can arise in a country such as Australia which comprises a number of States and Territories. A person may come to Australia with the intention permanently to settle here but because he works, say, in the construction industry and regularly moves between States he may be domiciled in Australia for the purposes of Commonwealth law but not have sufficient connection with any particular State to acquire a domicile of choice in any State for the purposes of State law. The result is that, for some purposes, he may retain his domicile of origin, even though he has no intention of returning to the country of his birth. Clause 11 of the Bill deals with this situation by providing that a person who is domiciled in a union, but is not domiciled in any particular part of that union, is to be domiciled in that part of the union with which he has for the time being the closest connection. </PARA>
<PARA> The third major change made by the Bill relates to the age at which a person is capable of having an independent domicile. Clause 8 provides that a person is capable of having an independent domicile if he has attained the age of 18 years or he is or has at any time been married. This change reflects modern developments relating to the age of majority. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, the Bill makes a number of changes relating to domicile of certain children. Under the common law rules relating to domicile, a child born in wedlock acquires the domicile of his father while an illegitimate child has the domicile of the mother. It is not appropriate that a child should automatically have the domicile of one parent if the parents are separated and the child is in fact permanently living with the other parent. The Bill provides that in such a situation the child has the domicile of the parent with whom he has his principal home. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains provisions for determining the domicile of an adopted child. If, upon his adoption, he has two adoptive parents, his domicile is that which he would have had if he had been a child born in wedlock to those parents. If, upon his adoption, he has only one adoptive parent, his domicile is the domicile of that parent or, if that parent dies, the domicile that parent had at the date of death. Where an adoption order is rescinded the court may provide for the domicile of the child. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes made by the Commonwealth Bill will apply for the purposes of the laws of the Commonwealth, the Australian Capital Territory, the Jervis Bay Territory and any external territories to which the Act is extended by regulation. The enactment by the Commonwealth, the Australian States and the Northern Territory of the model domicile legislation prepared by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General will bring about, on a uniform basis, important reforms in a complex and technical area of the law. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>DOMICILE (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1981</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is consequential upon the changes to be made by the Domicile Bill. Sub-sections 5 (4) of the Marriage Act 1961 and sub-section 4 (3) of the Family Law Act 1975 deal, for the purposes of those Acts, with certain matters which are now to be covered by the Domicile Bill. Enactment of the Domicile Bill will make these other provisions unnecessary. Accordingly, the Bill provides for the omission of these provisions when the Domicile Bill comes into operation. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of this Bill is to introduce into the Customs Act 1901 new provisions for the valuation of imported goods for Customs duty purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> These new provisions are designed to give effect to the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). </PARA>
<PARA> The Government decided in May 1980 to adopt this Agreement on a Free-on-board basis (f.o.b.) so as to exclude the costs of overseas freight and insurance from the Customs value. </PARA>
<PARA> This decision took into account the views of State Governments, industry associations and other interested groups within the Community. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's present system of Customs valuation is based upon the Brussels Definition of Value (B.D.V.). This compares each actual transaction with an ideal transaction establishing an entirely open market value in an arms length situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The major difference between the GATT valuation and the BDV valuation is that the GATT valuation is a positive valuation system using the actual prices and charges for imported goods. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now take a few moments to describe the methods by which a Customs value will be arrived at under the terms of the provisions in Clause 8 of the Bill. Amendments were made in the other place to add precision to these proposed valuation methods following comments on the Bill by interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA> For the purposes of the Customs Tariff Act 1966, the value of imported goods is identified by section 156 as the Customs value of the goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 157 sets out the 6 methods, that are to be applied in sequence, for arriving at the Customs value. </PARA>
<PARA> I expect that the first of these methods will be the method most commonly used. This involves the ascertainment of the transaction value of the goods which is determined in accordance with section 159. </PARA>
<PARA> The starting point for this method will be the f.o.b. price of goods when sold in a relevant transaction prior to their arrival in Australia. The terms 'price' and 'relevant transaction' are defined in section 154. Before it forms the basis for the assessment of the transaction value, the price may be adjusted, if necessary, in accordance with sub-section 154 (2). Further adjustments may also be necessary under section 159. </PARA>
<PARA> The second and third methods are based on the transaction values of goods which are, respectively, identical or similar to the goods to be valued. Section 155 provides the basis for identifying identical or similar goods. Section 160 sets out the adjustments that may, if necessary, be made to the values of the identical or similar goods for the purposes of valuing the relevant imported goods. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth method is based on the deductive value of the goods ascertained in accordance with section 161. This method takes as its starting point the price of the imported goods, or of identical or similar goods, when sold in Australia. Deductions are then made, as necessary, to take account of elements reflected in the price because of the transportation of the goods to Australia and their marketing in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth method requires the assessment of the computed value of the goods which is to be calculated in accordance with section 161A. This method is based on the costs of production of the goods, adjusted to take account of the costs and profits that usually would have been reflected in sales of those goods when sold f.o.b. for export to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If all of the methods I have referred to fail to establish a value for Customs purposes sub-section 157 (8) will allow the Comptroller-General to determine the value. In making such a determination the Comptroller-General will be limited by the provisions of sub-section 157 (9). </PARA>
<PARA> Section 158 explains the circumstances in which a method of valuation cannot be used. Importantly, a method cannot be used if there is a lack of sufficient reliable information for its use. The first method cannot be used in certain cases, particularly where the relationship between the parties to the transaction influenced the price of the goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 161C confers a right on the owners of imported goods to be informed of the basis on which their goods were valued. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, section 161D provides that the Comptroller-General may review any valuation made by a Customs Officer and confirm, vary or replace that valuation with another valuation. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable Senators, the adoption of the GATT valuation will bring Australia into line with the valuation system practised by other major trading partners such as the USA, Japan and the EEC. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government expects that it will not have widespread consequences for levels of tariff protection now provided to Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Reference to the Industries Assistance Commission will however be considered during the first year after introduction of the system if any significant variations in customs duty appear to adversly affect Australian industry or importers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission has already been asked to include in all future reports recommendations as to the appropriate levels of assistance under the new system. </PARA>
<PARA> The new system is also expected to make Customs valuation more predictable for importers. It has the support of most main organisations involved in the importation of goods as well as organisations representing local manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendments contained in this Bill are of a formal nature. In particular Clauses 6 and 7 propose amendments to section 151 of the Customs Act to delete redundant provisions following the elimination of British preferential tariff margins in the Customs Tariff Act 1966. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to make a number of changes to the Judges' Pensions Act 1968. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill makes three basic changes. First, Judges who are required to retire upon reaching a compulsory retiring age before serving the 10-year qualifying period will be entitled to pro rata pensions after 6 years' service. Secondly, pensions in respect of children of deceased Judges, currently based wholly or in part on fixed annual amounts determined in 1968, are to become a percentage of pension that would have been payable to the deceased Judge. Thirdly, pensions now based on Australian Industrial Court and Federal Court of Bankruptcy salaries are to be based on Federal Court of Australia salaries. </PARA>
<PARA> Before describing in detail the provisions of the Bill, I wish to say something about the nature of the pension scheme for Judges under the Judge's Pensions Act. This pension scheme is a non-contributory scheme, in the sense that a Judge is not required to make a contribution from his salary towards the cost of the pension. A non-contributory pension scheme is unusual in public employment. The usual standard in public employment is for a superannuation scheme, to which the beneficiaries make a contribution during their working lifetime. Non-contributory schemes are, however, by no means unusual in the private sector in the case of the most senior employees. But even the contributory schemes in the public sector are financed to a substantial extent from public funds. No superannuation scheme in Commonwealth public employment is financed entirely out of the contributions made by employees. Where a pension scheme is financed in whole or in part by the employer, this should be seen as a part of the total remuneration package for the employment in question. </PARA>
<PARA> The salary and pension benefits enjoyed by Judges should be assessed from two points of view, one of principle and the other pragmatic. The independence of the judiciary from the parties to litigation is absolutely fundamental. It is of the utmost importance that a Judge should not, by reason of financial inducement or financial pressure, be thought to be in a position where he may be influenced by a particular party to litigation, whether it be government or a private body or individual. It is therefore necessary to assure to the Judges that degree of financial security which will, in practical terms, put them beyond reach either of inducement or of pressure. </PARA>
<PARA> In a federation such as ours, the judiciary, and particularly the High Court, play an even more important role. As interpreters of the Constitution, they rule on the validity of legislation enacted by the parliaments of this country. They maintain the distribution of powers between the Commonwealth Government and the State Governments effected by the Constitution itself. This Senate has itself insisted upon the principle that the Judges should receive no more than the Parliament provides. It is a necessary corollary of this principle that the Parliament should be sufficiently generous in its provision for Judges to ensure them practical independence. Any suggestion that a Judge, on retirement, may be dependent upon the favour of the Executive Government, whether through the payment of ex gratia amounts or by being provided with part-time employment, would run counter to their independence. No Judge should feel himself to be under any financial compulsion when he retires to accept an offer of part-time employment by the Executive Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there are the pragmatic reasons for a substantial remuneration for Judges. It is proper that Judges should be selected from those who have reached positions of eminence in the legal profession, whether at the Bar, as solicitors or in academic or other pursuits. There are very few persons appointed as Judges who do not accept a very substantial drop in income in taking the appointment. Of course, the offer of appointment as a Judge is regarded as a matter of some honour, and the inducement to accept an appointment is by no means entirely financial. Nevertheless, financial considerations are important and it is essential that sufficient remuneration be offered to attract the best available people. </PARA>
<PARA> If the total judicial remuneration is inadequate, then it may be difficult to attract lawyers of ability until they have amassed enough capital to ensure a degree of financial independence for themselves and their families. This may mean that they would not be prepared to accept appointment until late in their professional lives. Again, it is desirable that we should be able to attract people in the prime of their professional careers. It is also socially desirable that judicial appointments should include a number of younger people. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of attracting to the Bench people in their 40's-and many judicial appointments are now made at that age-the security of spouse and children will weigh heavily with those appointed. It is therefore proper that any pension scheme should make adequate provision for spouses and for children. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, we cannot view the pensions paid to federal Judges in isolation from what is done by the States for State Judges. Unless the Commonwealth is able to offer benefits of substantially the same order as those offered by the States, it will not attract its fair share of able lawyers to its courts. A comparison of provisions for State Judges shows that the proposals in the existing pension scheme, varied by those contained in this Bill, are generally comparable with the State provisions except in respect of children. I table, and seek leave to incorporate in Hansard, a paper showing the provision made by the States for judicial pensions. The position of children under the existing Judges' Pensions Act has been shown to be inadequate by the unfortunate death of Mr Justice Opas. As a consequence of the appointment of Judges at a much younger age, it is necessary to ensure that adequate provision be made for their children in the event of their death. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, I propose to give some thought to the question whether there should be a change in the basis of the Judges' pensions scheme by making pension rights depend in part upon a contribution being made by the Judges from their salaries. Any change so made would, of course, have to be made in such a way as to preserve existing entitlements. The history of the legislation providing for pensions for Commonwealth Judges shows that there has been a progressive increase in the benefits available, so that the time may come when any additional increase in benefits should be contingent upon an appropriate contribution by those who would share in those benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the detailed provisions of the present Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Judges' Pensions Act now stands, a Judge must be at least 60 years of age and must have served as a Judge for not less than 10 years to qualify for a pension on retirement. These limitations do not apply where a Judge retires on the ground of permanent disability. Where a Judge dies in office, the pension entitlements of his spouse and children do not depend upon his age or length of service at death. </PARA>
<PARA> These provisions were enacted at a time when Judges held life appointments. As a result of the 1977 Constitutional Alterations relating to the retirement of Judges, a compulsory retiring age now applies to new federal judicial appointments. In the case of the High Court, the Constitution itself fixes the retiring age at 70. It also fixes that age for Judges of other federal courts, unless the Parliament provides for a lesser age of retirement. The Parliament has fixed 65 years as the retiring age for Judges of the Family Court of Australia. The retiring age for Presidential Members of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is 65. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of these provisions is that, unless he retires on the ground of permanent disability, a Judge who is appointed with less than 10 years to serve before reaching retiring age applicable to the court to which he is appointed is unable to qualify for a pension. What is now proposed by the present Bill is that a Judge who is appointed at an age when he is unable to serve the full 10 years will be entitled to a pro rata pension on reaching the compulsory retiring age, provided that he has served for at least 6 years as a Judge. It is not proposed that a Judge should be able to retire before he reaches the mandatory retiring age, unless it is on the ground of permanent disability, and receive such a pension. </PARA>
<PARA> Not to make this kind of provision may inhibit the appointment of Judges of mature years and of considerable experience simply because they would be unable to reach the required length of service to qualify for a pension. On the other hand, a reasonable length of service should be required before the right to a pension accrues. The Bill seeks to achieve an appropriate balance by providing for a pro rata pension on reaching maximum retiring age where a Judge has served at least 6 years. The effect of the Bill would be that a Judge who has served for not less than 6 years on reaching retiring age would be entitled to six-tenths the full pension, that is, six-tenths of 60% of salary. The rate of pension would progressively increase for each additional year of completed service to a maximum of 60% of salary where the Judge retired after having completed 10 years of service on reaching the specified retiring age. Three States, New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia provide for pro rata pensions where a Judge reaches the specified retiring age applicable to the relevant State court after having served for at least 5 years. In Victoria, the retiring age is 72, and there is therfore more latitude for the appointment of Judges who may be able to serve 10 years before reaching that age. In Tasmania, a Judge is entitled to full pension, which is 50% of current judicial salary, on reaching the maximum retiring age of 70 years, irrespective of length of service. In Tasmania, however, the Judges' pensions scheme is a contributory scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect of the Bill provides increased benefits for children of deceased Judges. The pensions now payable under the Act in respect of children of deceased Judges are based wholly or in part on fixed annual amounts. The amounts were set in 1968 and have not been increased. By way of example, the pension payable in respect of a child who is not an orphan is only $208 per annum. Moreover, fixed annual amounts are not considered an appropriate basis for pension entitlement. Accordingly, the Bill provides for pensions to be payable in respect of children of a deceased Judge based on the pension that would have been payable to the Judge had he retired on the ground of permanent disability on the date of his death. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of former Judges and dependants of former Judges are now in receipt of pensions based on the salaries payable to Judges of the Australian Industrial Court. The transfer of the jurisdiction of that Court to the Federal Court of Australia has, for all practical purposes, been completed and the plain fact is that the Australian Industrial Court no longer has any real business. Parliament has already provided for the Court to be abolished when there are no Judges of the Court holding office. It is not appropriate that pensions should continue to be based on salaries payable to Judges of a Court that is now virtually obsolete. The Remuneration Tribunal has recognised that in the lower salaries fixed for this Court. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for pensions based on the salaries payable to Judges of the Australian Industrial Court to be based on the salaries payable to Judges of the Federal Court of Australia. This will also have the effect of restoring, for pension purposes, the relativity that existed until 1977 between Judges of the Australian Industrial Court and Presidential Members of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision is similarly made for pensions based on salaries payable to Judges of the Federal Court of Bankruptcy to be based on the salaries payable to Judges of the Federal Court of Australia which has taken over the bankruptcy jurisdiction previously exercised by the Federal Court of Bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also updates references to certain former Papua New Guinea Judges for whose pensions the Commonwealth is responsible and makes provision for applications to be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of certain decisions of the Attorney-General under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the requests be not pressed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has considered the requests of this chamber some little time ago to the House of Representatives in relation to the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) 1981. On 14 October the Treasurer (Mr Howard) dealt in the House of Representatives with the reasons why the Government is not prepared to accede to the requests. I do not propose to canvass these issues again, much less again and again and again, and again apparently. In short, the Government's attitude has been summed up by the Treasurer on a number of occasions in the course of public and parliamentary debate on this matter. The Government's view, as expressed by the Treasurer, is that these measures are an integral part of the Budget and that the revenue to be yielded is a significant part of the Budget not only for this year but also for future years. If the requests were met, the full year's cost of that decision would be $235m and the cost for this financial year would be of the order of $100m. I cannot believe that the Senate would not be deeply impressed by the effect of those figures on the integrity of the Budget. The removal from this year's Budget of revenue of $100m and in future years of revenue of the order of $235m is an extremely substantial matter. It is for those reasons that the Government has taken the view it has, or expressed in the message that we have now received from the House of Representatives. Accordingly, I have moved that the requests be not pressed. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government takes a further view in relation to this matter and it is a view which I notice is shared by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and that is that it is not constitutionally proper for the Senate-in fact, there is not strictly speaking a power for the Senate-to press a request beyond the one that has already been made. We are now in a position in which the Senate has made its requests, having exercised the undoubted power that it has and the requests have been, undoubtedly, considered by the Government, considered by the House of Representatives, rejected, and sent back to this chamber. The view taken by the Government, on my advice as Attorney-General, is that the powers of the Senate to make any further requests are now exhausted. It may be true that there are precedents. In the past the House of Representatives has reacted to such requests. On a number of occasions in the past when that has happened the House of Representatives, in dealing with the requests, has challenged the power of the Senate and has dealt with them without prejudice to its stated view that the Senate has not the power to press a request. </PARA>
<PARA> When one analyses the constitutional situation, I think it becomes very clear as to why the Senate has not got the power to make a request on more than one occasion-in other words, to press the request or, in the colourful language of Senator Haines, to do so again and again and again. </PARA>

As I have said, the House of Representatives has on a number of occasions over the years actually challenged the power of the Senate. I think the position has become very important in this discussion because of the attitude which has been expressed by the Australian Democrats to the question of the rejection of money Bills and Supply.

This matter is more than one of academic interest, although it is of academic interest as well. There has been some suggestion that this question really is only of academic interest and therefore we ought not to be bothered about it. I mention that because it has been a view that has been expressed. This question is much more than one of academic interest for several reasons but, in particular, because of the attitude of the Democrats, who have made such a great feature of it, a big feature of it. They even signed statutory declarations about it. I will come to that in a minute.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I think we ought to ask them to do it here formally in front of us because there seems to be a good deal of doubt amongst them as to what they have really been saying about this question. Senator Mason actually read into Hansard what was in the statutory declarations. As I have not sighted the documents, I cannot vouchsafe their contents. I think we all might be interested in them if they were made available to us. I can only go on what Senator Mason has said about them when he read the contents into Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This question is also of enormous importance constitutionally in that a rejection or failure to pass a money Bill, or any Bill, is the first step towards puting in train the provisions of section 57 of the Constitution, the deadlock provisions which may ultimately lead to a double dissolution. Therefore, this is by no means an academic subject. When the Senate rejects or fails to pass a measure it is looking down the barrel at the provisions of section 57 of the Constitution. I hope that the Democrats have given full consideration to the logical consequences that in the end may result from the course upon which they have embarked. I doubt whether they have. In debating this matter I think it is important for the Senate to fully understand that what it is doing, if it presses its requests, is rejecting this measure. That is my view, the view of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and the view of a great many people of even greater distinction than either of us. I will begin with the views of Quick and Garran, the authors of the first Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth. This is a work of enormous authority because the authors themselves were fathers of the Constitution. Sir Robert Garran was the Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth for many years and a lawyer of the greatest possible distinction. Page 671 of Quick and Garran's current edition states--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the current print of the book. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There does, however, seem to be a substantial constitutional difference between the power of suggestion and the power of amendment, as regards the responsibility of the two Houses. </PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, in the case of a bill which the Senate may not amend, the House of Representatives alone is responsible for the form of the measure; the Senate cannot strike out or alter a word of it, but can only suggest that the House of Representatives should do so. If that House declines to make the suggested amendment, the Senate is face to face with the responsibility of either passing the bill as it stands or rejecting it as it stands. It cannot shelve that responsibility by insisting on its suggestion, because there is nothing on which to insist. A House which can make an amendment can insist on the amendment which it has made; but a House which can only 'request' the other House to make amendments cannot insist on anything. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the opinion of Quick and Garran. I will now refer to another opinion given in March 1943 by Sir Robert Garran, then still the Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth; Mr Knowles, who became Solicitor-General; Sir Kenneth Bailey who was Solicitor-General for many years; and a Mr Castieau, who was then Parliamentary Draftsman. The statement read:</PARA>
<PARA> In our opinion the Constitution in denying the right of amendment and in conferring the rights of request intended a substantial difference. In this we respectfully agree with the views expressed by Sir Harrison Moore, Sir Isaac Isaacs, and Sir John Latham. We think it clear that the Constitution did not intend to stultify itself by giving back in one clause what it had taken away in another. The essence of the difference between request and amendment is that in the case of a request the right of decision as to the form of the Bill rests solely with the House of Representatives. To press a request is to insist upon it which is a contradiction in terms and also in our opinion unconstitutional. </PARA>
<PARA>Sir John Latham was mentioned in that quotation as indeed was Sir Isaac Isaacs. Both of them were Chief Justices of the High Court. I will quote from a passage of Sir John Latham who was then Attorney-General of the Commonwealth and, as I said, later became a Chief Justice of the High Court. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate should recognise that the only practical way in which effect may be given to the words of the section which draw a distinction between making a request at any stage of a Bill, and amending a Bill, is by taking the view that a request can be made known only once, and that, having made it, the Senate has exercised all the rights and privileges allowed by the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA>That appears on page 5249 of Hansard of 30 November, 1933. I think those authorities can be supplemented by others. Mr Hayden, the Leader of the Opposition in another place, when dealing with this question referred to the view of Professor Richardson as he then was, now of course the Commonwealth Ombudsman. In the debate last week Mr Hayden said:</PARA>
<PARA> The facts are, . . . that the Senate has the right, constitutionally, to make its request on a particular money Bill once and once only. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, I assume that on a constitutional question of such importance the Leader of the Opposition would not have made such a statement without the advice, consultation and endorsement of the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Evans. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator. The reasons why I wish to move the motion I have are clear. I hope it will be supported particularly by the Opposition. Certainly, we welcomed the recognition given by the Leader of the Opposition on this matter and the fact that pressing the request, indeed voting against my motion, would be unconstitutional. I cannot see how in the light of that Labor senator's can, in all conscience, vote for a motion to press requests which their own leader has said they cannot do. It would be a very cynical action on their part. It is certainly the hope of the Government and me that Opposition senators will follow the very firm view expressed by their Leader in another place and will support the motion that I have moved. I will now turn to some of the statements made by the Democrats in relation to this matter because it seems to be clear from what they have said that they intend to press a request. Senator Haines repeated, in dramatic words, the statement in Question Time today. Of course, I find this passing strange in the light of the statements made by the Acting Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Mason) in this place on 26 August. As an interjector Senator Tate said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> You can reject it when it comes back here. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Mason replied. </PARA>
<PARA> We are facing that one. We are not dodging that one. True to our word, if the Government takes the reprehensible step of rejecting that request the Australian Democrats will not oppose the passage of that Budget legislation through the Senate. That is definite. It is a considered decision. That is the way it is going to go. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Mason continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Listen to this, senators, it is my bottom line. Those on the Labor side in particular should listen to this. </PARA>
<PARA>This is what Senator Mason said. I only ask honourable senators to follow his words. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Undersirable though the sales tax increases are, damaging though their impact might be, the consequences of the Senate meddling in or unilaterally rewriting a Budget seem to us too horrifying to contemplate. </PARA>
<PARA>I could not agree more. Today we are asking Senator Mason and the Opposition to support the motion for the reasons I have given. Now we are asking Senator Mason and the Australian Democrats to make good the statements that their Acting Leader made in this place as recently as 26 August. I ask the Democrats to ponder also on the much vaunted statutory declaration they have signed. Senator Mason read into Hansard the terms of that statutory declaration stating that each of the Democrats had signed it. As we all know a statutory declaration is not just a bit of paper. A statutory declaration is a solemn document. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . would not use their voting numbers in such a way as to cause the blocking of-</PARA>
<PARA>Supply or-it continues:</PARA>
<PARA> money bills in a manner which would prevent the majority party in the House of Representatives from governing. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer (Mr Howard) has already indicated what the sums involved in the meeting of this request would be. But, of course, by rejecting or failing to pass this measure, a lot more money than that is involved. The total sum involved in rejecting these measures, which is what the honourable senator would do if he pressed this request, in the current year is $132m and in the full year it would be $330m. If a government is deprived of those amounts of money, I cannot see how anybody could not sensibly say that it is being prevented from governing because it would mean that the choices that would have to be made-</PARA>

Would they allow the deficit to balloon out and add to interest rates by such irresponsible action? I would like to hear what the Democrats intend to do. It is clear, as I have said, that if they do not support this motion they will be in breach of that undertaking and that declaration they gave.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats purport-I understand that this is their view and perhaps they will tell us whether it is a fact or whether it has changed-that the Senate has three months in which to hold up this measure. I have been scratching my head about where this period of three months comes from. I can only think that it is in relation to section 57 of the Constitution; the deadlock provision. That is the only place where I can see that the period of three months has any relevance. I do not know whether the Democrats really understand that. </PARA>
<PARA> They have said that they are going to pass the measure after three months. Why after three months; I do not understand why it could not be after six months, two months or two days, unless it is something that they have in the back of their minds about not wanting to create a situation in which the Government could call a double dissolution? I do not know. That is the only explanation I can find. If that is the explanation then they sadly misunderstand the situation. If the Senate now, by pressing this request, takes it, as the Government does, as a rejection or failure to pass the Bills, then the initiative rests with the Government. After any period the Government may reintroduce the Bills. It may wait for three months and reintroduce them in pursuance of its powers. It may send them back in a form which attracts the operation of section 57, or it may not. There is absolutely no way in which a Bill can be left in the air after it has been rejected by the Senate. These Bills will go back to the House of Representatives and disappear into limbo. If the Democrats return the Bills for three months or more, then the Government will probably reintroduce them in similar terms. These Bills will not reactivate themselves in three months. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Senate presses this request, the government does not intend to enter into this game of ping-pong, which seems to be the wish of Senator Haines; namely, that we send requests back. The Government and the House of Representatives have made it quite clear that it will not accept the request. The Government will accept this pressing of a request as a rejection or failure to pass the measures and it will not send the Bills back here week after week, or whatever it is that Senator Haines has in mind. If it is Senator Mason's view that in three month's time the Senate will pass the Bills, all right, we will wait for three months and then pass similar Bills through the House of Representatives and the Senate can deal with them then. There seems to be utter confusion in the minds of the Democrats as to what on earth they are about. What are they about? I just hope that they will let us know and make it clear what they will be about. As I said, this Government will not play Senator Haines's game of ping-pong. We are not taking this thing backward and forward over any period. The Senate is now facing the issue fairly and squarely. I hope that the motion I have moved will succeed, but if it does not and if the Senate seeks to press this request, then, as I have said, the Government will regard that, as I think it has every constitutional right to do, as a rejection or failure to pass the measures. I hope that the Senate will accede to my motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Labor Party will, of course, oppose the Government motion that the requests not be passed. We would have preferred to have rejected this package of Bills and the other packages which accompanied them at the second reading stage, but the Australian Democrats were not willing to support us in that. If the Bills reach the third reading stage we will vote against them at that stage. We would welcome support from the Democrats in that, although it seems unlikely we would get it. However, from the comments made by Senator Durack it appears that the Government's intention is to take the defeat of his motion as a rejection of the legislation by the Senate and that the Government will then let the Bills lapse, possibly reintroducing them at a later stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In other words, the Government is laying the preconditions or the foundations for a double dissolution. We not only welcome such a double dissolution on this legislation but also we challenge the Government to proceed along those lines. We would be delighted to have a double dissolution election at the beginning of next year. Let us make that perfectly clear to the nervous Nellies on the other side and the nervous Nellies who sit, for the time being, behind Prime Minister Fraser in the House of Representatives. We oppose the Government's motion because, although to a limited extent only, it salvages something from our original position on these sales tax Bills; that is, that they should all have been defeated. We oppose the government motion for the same reason as we opposed the Bills in toto; because they are inflationary and on June figures they will add 1.1 per cent to the consumer price index. They are unjust and completely unnecessary. We are opposed to them for all those reasons. We are also opposed to them for macroeconomic reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> It becomes increasingly apparent-I have absolutely no doubt that this will be confirmed when the national accounts for the June quarter come out-that the economy, having gone through what was for the Fraser Government a period of high growth in 1980 and in the beginning of 1981, became stagnant about the middle of this calendar year and indeed, economic growth could even be negative at this stage. It is almost unbelievable that, in a period when the unemployment rate was 5 1/2 per cent and rising, that any government since the 1930s could have brought in a Budget to produce a domestic surplus of $1,500m. If that figure is adjusted to take account of the fact that there is an additional pay period this financial year, the effective domestic surplus would be about $1,900m. It is almost unbelievable that, with a stagnant economy and an unemployment rate of 5 1/2 per cent and rising, any government in the 1980s, or even in the 1950s, could have brought in such a Budget. The Bills are inflationary, unjust and unnecessary and they will add to and deepen the recession which is already beginning to be felt. Malcolm Fraser's all-time record interest rates have begun to have their effect on the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Some other facts need to be restated about these Bills and the attitude towards them which the Australian Labor Party has consistently held since it was announced by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) in the House of Representatives the week after the Budget was brought down. These Bills are not, for the most obvious of reasons, Supply Bills. They seek to raise money. Supply or Appropriation Bills seek to spend it. The survival of a government is not dependent upon the passage of the requests which are before us now or indeed the Bills in toto. If these requests were accepted by the House of Representatives, the only effect would be that the domestic surplus budgeted for at $1,500m would be reduced to $1,400m. </PARA>
<PARA> A rough analogy, subject to one caveat which I will state later, exists between the Senate rejecting these Bills in part or in toto and the Senate of 1974 rejecting the Medibank levy legislation. In both cases, the Senate sought or seeks to reduce the amount of money which a government sought to raise and the amount of taxation which a government sought to impose. It is highly significant that nobody inside or outside of the Liberal Party has described the Senate's rejection of the 1974 Medibank levy legislation as a denial of Supply or as something which threatened the survival of a government. The analogy breaks down in one respect. The 1974 Medibank levy legislation fulfilled an explicit promise of the then Labor government upon which it had fought and won the 1974 double dissolution election. These Bills and all of the 1981 sales tax measures do precisely the opposite. They seek to break a series of explicit promises given by various people on behalf of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it was on 20 November last that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) said that there would be no movement to a broadly based consumption tax unless it was accompanied by massive reductions in income tax. Far from being accompanied by massive reductions in income tax, we now know that this deepening and broadening of the indirect tax base has been accompanied not by a reduction in personal income tax but by a massive 22 per cent increase on the personal income tax to be paid by pay-as-you-earn taxpayers. Income tax, which is already at record levels, is to be increased by 22 per cent for wage and salary earners at the same time as the Government seeks to raise on a full year basis an additional $900m through a widening and a deepening of the indirect tax base. The essential difference between what the Senate of 1974 did and what the Senate of 1981 seeks to do is that the Senate of 1974 stopped an elected government from fulfilling its explicit electoral promises. In the Senate of 1981, the Labor Party is seeking to stop the Fraser Government from breaking its explicit electoral promises. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of taxation, it ought also be noted that the Fraser Government is preparing to introduce next calendar year-it may be during the next financial year-phoney tax cuts. The Government is preparing to change the income tax laws in a way which it will describe as having cut taxes. In fact, due to what the Prime Minister repeatedly called at one time the secret tax of inflation, something that was utterly reprehensible according to the present Prime Minister in 1975, at the forecast rate of money income increases-if the same rates are carried on to next year-there will be a real increase in income tax of $1,500m this year. At present rates, without adjusting the tax schedule, real income tax collections, after allowing for inflation and for the fact that next year's dollar will be worth less than this year's dollar, will increase by $1,500m a year. Any so-called tax cut of less than $1,500m introduced in the next financial year will, in fact, be a disguised tax increase. It is very important to know that and to stress it because there is no doubt that the Prime Minister is preparing for phoney tax cuts and legislation, which he will call tax cuts legislation, which he thinks will rescue him, in the first instance, from the Peacock challenge within the Liberal Party and, secondly, from the wrath of the electorate in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be much better, of course, if the wrath of the electorate were shown long before 1983. We would be delighted to allow the electorate to pass judgment on these Bills, the other Sales Tax Bills and on the record level of income taxes which are already being imposed by the Fraser Government and which will increase by another 22 per cent for wage and salary earners. We would be delighted to allow the electorate to pass judgment in a double dissolution election next February on those matters and on the Fraser Government's stewardship of all matters over the long term. After the Government has taken the rejection of its requests which are currently before the Senate as a failure to pass or a rejection of the Bills, we challenge the Government immediately to bring back the Bills in the autumn session of the Parliament next year. Provided that the Australian Democrats do not go to water, we will throw them out again. We would be delighted to have an election. </PARA>
<PARA> I will make just one final point. It is being claimed by the Government still and repeated by some gullible journalists that the economy is basically in good shape. Let us examine the facts behind that assertion. On the Government's own forecasts, the inflation rate for the year ending June 1982 will be 11.9 per cent. On the Government's estimates, the consumer price index will increase by 11.9 per cent between June 1981 and June 1982. The Government has forecast a 3 per cent growth in real non-farm gross domestic product. It is now perfectly clear that it will not get anything like that level. The Government has forecast that there will be a slight increase in unemployment over the year. Because of the economic stagnation which will be intensified by these Bills, the increase in unemployment will be much greater than the Government originally expected. In 1975 we were told that the economy was in complete disarray, in ruins, because of inflation, unemployment and the allegedly low economic growth. In 1975 inflation was 13 per cent and falling. At the end of this financial year it will be 12 per cent and rising. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Mason. I will be only a couple of minutes. I want to finish this point because it is very important. According to Mr Fraser and the Liberal Party, at the end of 1975 the economy was in ruins. It was in such a condition that any step which could have removed the government of the day was justified. Let me go through the four major indices of economic performance. In 1975 inflation was 17 per cent and falling. At the end of this financial year it will be 12 per cent and rising. At the end of 1975 unemployment was 4.2 per cent and stagnant. It is now 5.8 per cent and rising. Economic growth throughout the calendar year 1976, although temporarily stalled by the strike in the Senate in October and November 1975, was in fact 4.2 per cent, a higher growth rate than any which has since been achieved. Economic growth under the framework established by the last Budget of the Labor Government was 4.2 per cent. Economic growth this year is forecast to be 3 per cent. It is now quite apparent that, in fact, it will be significantly less than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fourth index is interest rates. Interest rates were 10 or 10 1/2 per cent. People can get different figures depending on whether they want to take bank overdraft rates, government paper or building society loans. In all of those areas interest rates are at least 3 per cent higher than they were in 1975. This record of dismal failure after nearly six years of Fraser Government, when all the major economic indices are considerably worse than they were in 1975 and the trend is in the wrong direction, we are told represents the economic success of the Fraser Government. If that represents success, may God protect us from failure because this Government obviously cannot. The mess it has made of the economy will be significantly exacerbated by these sales tax Bills in general and even to a perceptible degree by the requests which the Government seeks not to press in the motion moved by Senator Durack. </PARA>
<PARA> We will oppose that motion. I hope the Government has the courage to do what Senator Durack forecast it would do, that is, to take that as a failure to pass. I hope it then has the courage to reintroduce the Bills in the autumn session next year. I hope the Democrats still have the nerve to go at least part of the way with us in opposing these Bills. Not only would we welcome the double dissolution which could conceivably ensue from that set of events but also we challenge the Government to call one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will oppose the motion that these requests be not pressed. I thank the Australian Labor Party for its support in this matter. People say that this is a Democrats initiative. Of course it is not just a Democrats initiative. There is no way in which five senators could do any such thing. It is a combined effort by the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats to prevent the institution in this country of an unfair and unjust law which has never obtained in this country, a point of principle which is wicked and evil and which is designed to oppress the poor and the middle class people of this country to the benefit of the rich. This is really what the Government is on about. Let us not lose sight of that in all this concern about constitutional problems and matters such as that. That is really what this argument is about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point the argument is about is that the Government is doing something which, demonstrably, the people of Australia do not want. The people of Australia have said to the Government plainly and over and over again that they do not want it. They will continue to say that and they want to continue to say that. The Government, of course, does not want to hear it. It wants this matter swept under the carpet. It wants to slink away and leave the murder concealed behind it. There is no way in which any responsible senators can allow the Government to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> All the huffing and puffing of Senator Durack-he made a fairly good effort at huffing and puffing-will not blow the house down. I was going to deal with his first point, but I think Senator Walsh has already mentioned it. However, I think it is worth mentioning again. Where will the money come from-this enormous $100m in contrast with the $1.5 billion surplus for which the Government is budgeting this year? Of course the loss of money would not bring down the Government. Of course it would not affect the Government's financial policies one iota if, indeed, it did not go ahead with these ridiculous sales taxes on children's shoes, school clothing, building materials and the means of information. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know where the Government got this idea in the first place although there have been leaks, of course, that there were strong objections to it within the Liberal Party of Australia, even in quite high places. I am pleased to hear that. Now, of course, it is a matter for those Liberal Party senators and members of parliament not to go to water but to recognise what the electorate wants and, even more important, what is right and proper, instead of slinking away and toeing the line as though it were some sort of game between two gangs of 8-year-olds in a school yard, rather than doing what is right and proper for the Australian people. Then I think we might get some good government in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> For the very first time we would get the situation in which this House of Parliament would be seen as a House of Parliament which has rights under the Constitution and which has them because those who founded the Constitution knew that there was a need for a second chamber for that purpose-to place a curb on the excesses of the Executive. The Liberal and National Country Party senators feel bound, somehow, to do absolutely what the Executive says. I suggest that that diminishes them greatly as people and as senators. I suggest that our friends on the other side of the chamber ought to examine their consciences very carefully. Indeed, I am hoping to see those Bills back quite soon. I would like to see the Bills back within a week or two with those requests acceded to. I am fairly confident that as the Government is exposed to more and more pressure from the community on this matter it will see good sense in it. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, I was most interested in some of the things that Senator Durack said or hinted at during his speech. Possibly the Government might just let these Bills lie, they might not come back in three month's or six month's. I would be very interested to hear a further view from the Attorney-General on this matter at some later stage. Perhaps the Government sees this as its way out. It knows it has terribly unpopular legislation on its hands. It does not know what to do with it; it does not know how to get out of its dilemma. Maybe the way to get out of its dilemma is simply, as it has done with many other dilemmas in the past, to do nothing. If it does that and the sales taxes on necessities are not applied to the Australian people, that will be to the advantage of everybody concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I must express my concern at the views put in the other place and here that the Senate has no constitutional right to return the requests. The Australian Democrats see this as a quite preposterous assertion. It is an assertion made from the point of view of the House of Representatives and the Executive. It is an attempt by the Executive to gather a gaggle of lawyers around it who will say that the House of Representatives is the only one that has rights. They are trying to read words into the Constitution which, in fact, are not there. That is what is happening. The statements made by Quick and Garran and by others are statements by people on the meaning of section 53 of the Constitution which have no basis whatsoever on any single word or phrase in that section of the Constitution, or anywhere else in the Constitution. </PARA>

Before I get on to that I would like just to make the point that all of us here are supposed to be senators. We are here in this place with certain duties to perform. I would have thought one of them was to uphold reasonably the constitutional rights of this House and what it has to do on behalf of the Australian community, not to attack them, not to be in leauge with another place which wants to destroy the powers of this place. That is why I suggested to Senator Durack by way of interjection that perhaps he is in the wrong House. Maybe he should go and sit somewhere else if he wants to take that kind of line.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YJ7">Senator MASON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will tell the honourable senator a story which he will appreciate. It is supposed to be a story of some authority about two previous United States Presidents. It is about a question that Jefferson once asked Washington in relation to why the United States Senate, the second House, existed in the first place. This may well be apocryphal; it does not sound like very good manners. Washington said: 'Why do you pour your coffee into the saucer?' The reply that is said to have been made was: 'Why, to cool it, of course'. Washington's reply to Jefferson is then said to have been: 'That is why we have a second House, the Senate-so that legislation can be poured into it to cool it'. That is what section 53 of the Constitution is about. It has been said that the whole spirit of that section is compromised. It is worth quoting into the record the relevant provision of the Constitution-paragraph 4 of section 53-because nobody else has done so. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate may at any stage return to the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting, by message, the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. And the House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit, make any of such omissions or amendments, with or without modifications. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the House of Representatives over a period has repeatedly questioned the right of the Senate to press the same requests but it has received and considered repeated requests from the Senate on 11 occasions in the past. It is rather ridiculous for us to be told here and now that somehow the Fraser Government has a special mandate over the past. Although something has happened 11 times in this House through the decades, and it has been sanctified by that degree of precedent, somehow the Fraser Government has a special mandate to throw all of that away and it no longer applies. A distinguished lawyer, the Attorney-General, in effect has said to me that such precedent is then of no value, no importance. Where would our legal system be if that kind of nonsense were pressed? On six of the eleven occasions the House has passed a 'without prejudice' resolution, protesting that its consideration of the repeated request did not imply acceptance of the Senate's right to press its request in that way. On two of the remaining five occasions the House made the requested amendments without protest. Odgers, in Australian Senate Practice-a book which is read and regarded highly in this place-says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that practice warrants the conclusion that the right to repeat a request has, at the very least, been established by usage. </PARA>
<PARA>Constitutional lawyers continue to differ on the strict legal position, as the Attorney-General has said. Quick and Garran argue that the House of Representatives remains responsible for the wording of the Bill. We cannot see any inhibition of that by what we are doing. We are simply asking the House of Representatives to give it mature consideration, which it has not done yet. Certainly there is no evidence of it. Eventually it will have the full responsibility, the Democrats hope and believe, of re-writing that Bill so the sales tax on necessities is not there. We do not want to do it; we want the House of Representatives to do it. </PARA>
<PARA> The interpretation of the words 'at any stage' in the particular section of the Constitution are rather interesting. I think it is of some importance that in 1898 the Melbourne Federal Convention, which was drafting the Constitution, rejected a motion to substitute the word 'once' for the words 'at any stage' in that section of the Constitution. It was proposed that the Senate may once return to the House of Representatives any proposed law. That was refused and instead the words that the Senate may 'at any stage' return them were insisted upon. When it comes to the views of the people who put together the Constitution there can be no doubt whatsoever about those views. What they thought and felt is a matter of record. I think that shows up for what it really is, this shameful attempt by the House of Representatives to destroy the right of the Senate, under section 53, to cool legislation, to be able to say: 'Look, you people haven't thought about this; we want the public to communicate with you and to give their views'. Because in the past the Government has been used to gagging and guillotining legislation through and making it a fait accompli before the public knows about it, it now does not like the new ball game where the public has the opportunity to consider these things. That, of course, is what democracy is about. Senate Standing Order 252 (3) provides:</PARA>
<PARA> Requests to the House of Representatives may be made . . . On consideration of any Message from the House of Representatives in reference to such a Bill . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Standing Order 256 provides:</PARA>
<PARA> If the Bill is returned to the Senate by the House of Representatives with any request not agreed to, or agreed to with modifications, any of the following motions may be moved: That the request be pressed. That the request be not pressed. </PARA>
<PARA>Admittedly these provisions govern the Senate's internal procedures but they do not impose any obligations on the House of Representatives. Numerous pronouncements support the view-they go back as far as 1902-that the Senate is well within its rights to press the request and that there is very little difference for this purpose between an amendment and a request to amend. These pronouncements include the views of Mr Justice, formerly Senator, O'Connor in 1902 and the Right Honourable W. M. Hughes in the House of Representatives. The position remains in dispute between the two Houses, as foreshadowed by Sir John Forrest in the Convention debates. In relation to clause 53, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . is the best compromise we can get between those who wish the two Houses to have equal powers and those who wish the House of Representatives to be paramount in regard to financial legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to complete Senator Durack's quotation. He left out a rather important piece of the opinion tabled in the House of Representatives in 1943 by Garran, Knowles, Bailey and Castieau on the whole point of whether requests should not be pressed constitutionally. They said:</PARA>
<PARA> The question is not one of strict law, on which the Courts will pronounce. </PARA>
<PARA>There are two levels in this debate-firstly, the sales tax Bills themselves, which are important enough, and, secondly, the rights and powers of the Senate not to bring down governments-we renounce that-but to keep complex matters like this in debate long enough for the public to comment on them. The Government is plainly running scared on that last point in regard to the imposition of the sales tax on the necessities of life. It wants the matter taken out of public consideration but it is not our intention that that be done. It is our intention that it remain under consideration. That also is the intention of the Australian Constitution, plainly stated in section 53. Of course it is also the desire of the Australian people that it be kept under consideration. As for the Government waving its fingers and saying 'double dissolution', I suggest that that is a matter on which it is not being honest. That is something which the passage of time will reveal. But I would suggest that meanwhile the Government, in view of all the things that political parties look at-their electoral prospects and other things-might be well advised to look again at whether or not it will remove and never bring in these iniquitous, evil and unpopular sales taxes on the necessities of life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walsh made a perfectly honest speech. The Australian Labor Party now honestly wants to get into government and will do anything to get into government. It will abandon the principles in the constitutional convention and elsewhere that it has expounded and abandon the stand on which it has castigated people on this side of the chamber for years. I would suggest that that is an abandonment of principle when it sees what it feels is an advantage just over the horizon. I will not go further with that matter. I have covered that in the speech that I made on the Budget. Everyone can read what the Labor Party said in the past and what it is now saying. It has now adopted the view that little bits of money Bills can be abandoned and those bits that it does not like can be snipped off or removed. It does not matter what that does to the Government's economic program. If the Labor Party is satisfied that that does not upset the Government's Budget, that is all that matters. It does not matter whether the Government thinks it needs the money for particular purposes, as it certainly has declared time and again here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me not advance into that area because it is at least clear that the Labor Party wants to beat down these Bills. It is the Australian Democrats who are in the greater trouble. They have maintained solid principles in the past and now they want to return these Bills, I think risking again that they may be found to have failed to have passed these Bills and therefore find themselves fighting an election at some stage on that position. </PARA>
<PARA> Returning to the Attorney-General's argument, let me say this: I do not accept that there is no power in the Senate to press its requests. As I took him down, he said that 'pressing the request is a contradiction in terms'. I do not agree with that either. To my mind it is possible for a chamber to press on fairly effectively, fairly lengthily, trying to raise public opinion, trying to stir up opinion against a government. That is quite different from a rejection of a Bill. Of couse, it may be said that this is quite different and in fact it is possible to press, to be quite firm, to repeat one's objections and not to pass a Bill at that particular time. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as the right to press these requests is concerned, I will not repeat the matters which are set out from ages 406 to 410 in Odgers's Australian Senate Practice. I refer the Committee to the strong statements which were made at the early stage of the debate, when the Senate first pressed for a request, and the remarks-I do not know whether this was quoted-by Senator Sir Josiah Symon, K.C., an eminent South Australian constitutionalist, who argued:</PARA>
<PARA> That the words 'at any stage' are equivalent to 'at any step', which means 'at any step in the progress of the consideration of a measure, and such a step is taken when a Committee reports progress, when consideration in Committee is resumed, when the Committee's report is brought up for adoption, and when a Message is sent to the other Chamber. </PARA>
<PARA>I would think that that also can mean that when the Bill comes back in due course to this chamber it is possible, likewise, to take it to mean at that stage of the progress of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> References to various constitutional views which are held are to be found on both sides of the question. There is a House of Representatives view and there is a Senate view. Naturally, the House of Representatives and generally the governments of this country would very much like to feel that there was no possibility of Senates constantly pressing for changes and causing them embarrassment. It does not follow from that that the Senate should come to a conclusion that it does not have that power. It is worth bearing in mind that there are Standing Orders-they are set out in Odgers book, and they are known to us-which provide the way in which we deal with and can press requests. Standing Order 256 indicates the various things that we may do. It indicates that the request may be pressed, that it may be not pressed, and so on. These things are contained in the Senate Standing Orders. In the last five or six years-until recently-we on this side of the chamber have had a majority in both chambers. In this chamber, if it were the will of the majority then, we could have removed or amended those Standing Orders. I am not aware of any attempt being made whatsoever during that period to alter the Standing Orders. I am pretty sure that if such an attempt had occurred I would have been somewhat critical of it. The Standing Orders of the Senate remain as they have been and I think we should pay some attention to them. It may well be that this matter will never be litigated. It may be that the High Court of Australia may never come to any conclusion. It may not intervene. But I think that we in this chamber are obliged to form opinions as to what is the correct interpretation. I refer to the late Right Honourable W. M. Hughes who, of course, was an Attorney-General of this country. In addressing the House of Representatives when the Senate first pressed its request in 1902, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I firmly believe that the Senate is acting quite within its rights. </PARA>
<PARA>Dealing with contention that the Senate had the power to make but one request, Mr Hughes said:</PARA>
<PARA> If any man had dared to stand up and tell the smaller States that the Senate had only such a power, the Constitution would never have been accepted. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that we should bear in mind that that was the view held at that time when it was first done, and it has been done 10 times since then. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, I do not believe that this chamber should press its request. I believe that the Government has considered and re-considered the request which we have made. Many of us have made our representations to the Government. I have been critical in this chamber of a number of the sales tax provisions, but the Government has decided that that is the way in which it wants to expand its tax base. It is a decision that it has made, one that it must stand by. If it does not propose to change, I suggest that it is not incumbent upon us, or desirable, that the Senate should now risk the possibility of creating a failure to pass, risk the possibility of an unnecessary election in this country by pressing such a request. </PARA>
<PARA> I will vote for the motion. Mind you, I did not hear its precise language. I came in a little too late, and I have not noted that a copy has been distributed to honourable senators, but that is the way in which we conduct our business these days; it is really extraordinary. We have not a copy on our tables, but on my understanding of the motion I believe that we should not press our requests and therefore I will vote in that way. However, it will not be for the reasons that the Attorney-General has given to us today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, on the contrary. I am reported to have said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister is reminding me increasingly of the junior wart, George Washington-unable to tell a lie, incapable of any immorality, squeaky clean. </PARA>
<PARA>May I make it clear to the Senate that, although I have not hesitated on occasion to be rude both to Senator Baume and to various American presidents, I did not in fact refer to either on this occasion as being a 'wart'. I simply stuttered over the word 'George'. Be that as it may, I think it is of some relevance to what I am about to say, because it does deal with matters of political morality and immorality. I do want to have something to say about questions of constitutional law and principle and to political principle, the kind of questions that were called very much in aid by Senator Durack in supporting the motion. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset I want to deal with the canard, for such it is, that there is some kind of unity ticket in this Parliament between Senator Durack on the one hand and Bill Hayden, the Leader of the Opposition, insofar as both are committed to the proposition that the Senate has no power to press a request on more than the initial occasion. It is true, of course, that Bill Hayden did say in the House of Representatives that the Senate has the right constitutionally to make its request on a particular money Bill 'once and once only'. But that ought to be read in the context of the remarks which immediately followed that statement. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> That is the opinion of Garran, Sir Harrison Moore, Sir Isaac Isaacs and Sir John Latham. They are unequivocal in their declaration. To go beyond that, it is their separate view but consistent in all cases, that the Senate is no longer proceeding with a message to the House of Representatives but is virtually demanding an amendment to the legislation and, therefore, is taking steps which are prohibited by section 53 of the Constitution. In those circumstances, the Senate's action has to be interpreted as a rejection of a money Bill. Having sent the message to this House once and its being rejected and sent back to the Senate, if the Senate proceeds with it again the matter then moves into the purview of section 57 of the Constitution-failure to pass.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me very clear that all that the Leader of the Opposition is there saying is that the Senate cannot claim to make a request with impunity on more than one occasion; that there are sanctions which follow from doing that, namely, the sanction of immediately setting in train the 'failure to pass' mechanism which may result in a double dissolution. It is not that the Senate cannot do it or that it would be the subject, if it could ever come to court, of a court order directing it not to exercise this particular power to press a request. It is rather that, if the Senate does press such a request, sanctions will be attached to it. I believe that is the way in which Mr Hayden's remarks have to be understood. That is very different indeed, of course, from the proposition that was put today by Senator Durack. </PARA>
<PARA> I personally believe it to be strongly arguable that the Senate does have the power to press a request. Strange as it may seem, perhaps, for me to be saying anything at all which could nourish the pretensions to power of this chamber, as a matter of strict law probably it is the case, on balance, that the Senate does have the power. Certainly, the language of section 53 seems on its face, for a start, to be clear enough when it says that the Senate 'may at any stage' press a request-language which, of course, has been the foundation for the 11 occasions in this century on which requests have been pressed. In respect of some of these at least, the House of Representatives has responded without any protest at all, and in respect of many of which it must also be said that the Labor Party has been party to the Senate majorities involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply make the point that strong reasons would be needed to overcome the fairly clear language that does emerge on the face of section 53 about the power to make a request being available at any stage. Perhaps the strongest reason which is advanced to overcome that reading is that it would produce, on the face of it, no appreciable difference between a power on the one hand to make a request and a power on the other to make an amendment to a Bill which-if that were so-would render nugatory the distinction that the Constitution seems anxious to make. But to that extent I believe that it is difficult to argue that the delegates to the Constitutional Convention were other than only too well aware that they were making a distinction that was semantic rather than real. They did, after all, reject in Melbourne at the 1898 Convention a motion to substitute the word 'once' for the expression 'at any stage', and there is ample evidence from the transcript of that Convention that the delegates knew they were making an essential linguistic distinction that might be construed by subsequent generations as not having much force and effect. So much, indeed, was let out of the bag by Sir John Forrest, when he said that section 53:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . is the best compromise we can get between those who wish the two Houses to have equal powers and those who wish the House of Representatives to be paramount in regard to financial legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>So far from being pillars of complete political virtue, our founding fathers were, of course, just as prone to the political arts of compromise and linguistic disguise as any of their successors. It is really that kind of exercise that confronts us in the language of section 53. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be a strong reason for construing the power to make a request as being a limited one, one that could not be used on more than one occasion, if it was clear that no sanctions followed from the exercise of such a power, if the Senate could go on making requests without any particular responsibility or prospect of penalty attaching to it for choosing this particular course. If that was a possible reading, from the whole context of the Constitution, as to how section 53 should be interpreted, I believe that there would be grounds for saying very strongly that there is no such power to press a request. Of course, it is clear-I believe I can say by universal consent of the legal commentators and writers on the subject-that there are such sanctions and that a continually pressed request involving the obstruction of the passage of a Bill must be treated 'as a failure to pass' such as will give rise to the potential operation of section 57, and that potentially will set in train the double dissolution mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I believe that, although there are certainly arguments on both sides, and the matter is arguable both ways, there is ample justification for the Senate on this occasion, provided there are other reasons in principle to justify its so doing, to continue on the course that was set when the matter was last debated. </PARA>
<PARA> The only real technical question that remains unresolved is as to when the time begins to run. Does it run from the time of the original request, made in this instance on 23 September, or rather only from the occasion-presumably today, a month later, 20 October-when the request is repeated. Or may indeed it be some future occasion when our intentions perhaps are made a little clearer-at least so far as my colleagues on my left, the Australian Democrats, are concerned. There may be a future occasion on which it becomes clear that we really will press a request to fruition and are not just involved in the kind of gamesmanship and grandstanding that, I say with respect, my Australian Democrat colleagues seem to be engaged in during this exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> The question is: Do we get, in effect, a kind of free go in regard to making a request to the House of Representatives before time starts to run, before the section 57 three months potential double dissolution clock begins to tick into operation? On that question, again legal opinion is divided. I do not think there is much utility in canvassing here and now the question of when time does commence to run. I know it is of some interest to the Democrats because they have become--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My view, for what it is worth, is probably that time does begin to run from the first request and not the second one. I cannot see any particular justification constitutionally in principle for giving us a free go. I think if we engage in the business of making a request we are just as much obstructing the passage of Government business as we are by passing an amendment and for that reason we ought to be prepared to bear the consequences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But I go on to make the point that all these legal issues of which the Government-Senator Durack particularly-makes so much today can in fact be tested if the Government genuinely believes that the Senate is acting in a misconceived fashion in responding as it does on this legal question and making, as it does, these claims of power. It is the case that the High Court cannot step in at this stage of the business and make an analysis of the extent of our powers or practice and precedent. Against that, it equally is the case that the High Court can resolve these matters if the preconditions for a section 57 double dissolution are argued to be satisfied, if three months does pass between the successive presentations of these Bills. If the Government summons up courage in early January, February, March or whatever and puts the Bills back to us in their original form, circumstances will undoubtedly exist for a test case to be resolved at anyone's instance to determine whether the section 57 preconditions are satisfied, whether there has been a failure to pass, when that failure to pass in fact commenced to operate and whether, indeed, there is any power at all for the Senate to obstruct, by a further request, the passage of a Bill of this kind. These are the matters that are undoubtedly now accepted as being within the High Court jurisdiction following the cases of Cormack v. Cope in 1974, the PMA case, and the Territory Senators case in 1975. Whatever else, it is clear that these issues are justiciable in a way that was not necessarily believed likely to be the case when Garran and the rest of them were writing their opinions, not to mention when Quick and Garran were writing their book in 1901. It is now the case that these matters are justiciable and that adds further colour to the challenge that was thrown out by Senator Walsh earlier in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government really wants to take these points, if it really wants to claim that these powers do not exist, if it really wants to argue that the Senate is behaving unconstitutionally in pressing this matter, it has a lovely opportunity open to it to test the matter, and that is to press the matter to a double dissolution, to claim that the preconditions for a double dissolution exist and to seek to put the matter before the electorate. That will not only be a test of the Government's political will but also it will test the constitutional law of which so much is, I suspect rather hypocritically, being made by the Government today. The point is, of course, that the Government does not want a double dissolution on this issue or, for that matter, any other issue. It knows that we on the Opposition side would be only too happy to accommodate it in respect of such a double dissolution. In saying 'the Opposition side', I cannot extend that description entirely to my colleagues in the Australian Democrats because it is very obvious that they do not now want a double dissolution either, for reasons having, I fear, nothing much to do with principle but everything to do with expediency and with their own political survival, which they know to be very much at risk in the light of the evidence recently and nicely provided for them by the New South Wales voters. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, it is interesting in charting the tortuous path of the Australian Democrats in this debate to note that, even on the question of the time that they are going to allow to run before they cave in, the Democrats have been speaking with a multitude of different voices. When Senator Mason first foreshadowed the Democrats' strategy, if it can be dignified with that description, at the time of the Budget debate, no particularly precise time limit was set. It was simply a matter of Senator Mason saying: 'Time has to be allowed for the electorate to pronounce on this matter, for the Government to reconsider it'. I acknowledge that there was no time limit stated then. But when time limits began to be thrown around, the time limit that constantly recurs in the Democrats' speech making-for example, from the mouth of Senator Haines as recorded at page 575 of Hansard of 9 September-was 1 January 1982, the commencement date of the proposed sales tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> By about 16 September, Senator Mason began to float the notion that three months might be the crucial period because of the double dissolution neurosis syndrome. But on 23 September, Senator Siddons was heard to say once again that the relevant date, the crucial date, in determining the Democrats' response and the date on which they would cave in would be 1 January 1982. I am not surprised that the Democrats are in a bit of a muddle about this one and anxious to disguise their views on the timing issue. They have an unenviable reputation for chaotic unpredictability and I can understand them, having so little record or reputation for anything else, wanting to preserve what reputation they do have. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I wish to make it that the Australian Labor Party, by contrast, is only too happy to create in this instance some of the preconditions for a double dissolution, not out of sheer malice or bastardry--</PARA>

I think it is important to make the point-I am indebted to the chamber for allowing me to do so-that, to the extent that we do insist upon pressing this amendment, it is nonsense to suggest that we are doing it because of some disposition or desire on our part to destabilise a government or to behave in an unprincipled way or because we are in fact behaving in practice in either of those ways. We have made it clear, as we have on numerous occasions, that we are not in the business of opposing those money Bills, or indeed Bills of any kind, which are crucial to the survival of the Government. We have argued, and I will not state the reasons again, that the Bills before us are not in that description.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I finish on the point that the Bills are bad in themselves, for all the reasons that have been spelt out by Senator Walsh and, indeed, by Senator Mason in his very forceful and effective contribution to this debate, that they need as a result to be rejected and continue to be rejected by this chamber. We on this side of the chamber will continue to reject them. The ALP has made its position absolutely clear. We are not afraid of rejecting them to the point that conditions for double dissolutions are satisfied. We would be delighted if the Government chose to take us on in that respect. We just wish that as we pursue this course, as we will with heartfelt dedication over the weeks and months ahead-we will give up our holidays to come back and debate it as often as is necessary to press this matter for the electorate-the Democrats would reconsider once again what it is that they are about and would give real consideration to the fact that if they are going 'to keep the bastards honest', as they have claimed they want to do, the only way to do it is by pressing their case to finality and not retreating to the administration of taps with feathers. </PARA>

However, I do not support the view that the Senate does not have the power to make repeated requests. I do not want to go into the niceties of legal matters that have been debated at length already. I only want to say that the argument put forward by Senator Missen on various authorities is compelling to me. I must, of course, respect the views of all lawyers in matters like this. However, as has already been said, there is a gaggle of lawyers on one side and a gaggle of lawyers on the other. I certainly respect the view of the Attorney-General and I have given careful consideration to the argument that he has put forward, but I do not believe that I would do Government senators any service by taking a partisan view on the legal question just because in this instance it happens to support the view that the Government's Budget should not be hindered. I believe the Government's Budget should not be hindered but I do not, for that reason, support the interpretation of clause 53 of the Constitution that the Senate does not have the power to make continued requests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The speeches made today by members of the Oppostion only serve to show that the Opposition has rejected all principle. The Opposition has rejected its commitment made in 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978 and up until very recently not to frustrate a Budget, not to use the Senate's powers to block a government's money Bill which is an integral part of the Budget. I believe this rejection is evidence of the hypocrisy of the Opposition and this is now all the more transparent to the Australian people and to this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the Australian Democrats, I see their present position as being irresponsible. It is a matter of dithering as we witnessed today in the speech by the Acting Leader of the Democrats in which he did not in any way indicate what he as an honourable senator is going to do about these Bills. Clearly in this Committee consideration he is dithering and in so doing is irresponsible. He is frustrating the processes of the Senate and the Parliament as a whole. I believe that in so doing he and those colleagues who support him are irresponsible. They are also irresponsible with regard to the solemn undertaking given to the people of Australia not to frustrate an integral part of the Budget. I understand that all Australian Democrats candidates for election signed a statutory declaration giving a solemn undertaking to the people of Australia not to be a part of any Senate exercise of power which would frustrate the Government's Budget. I genuinely dismiss the Opposition's approach in this matter as being hypocritical and unprincipled and the approach of the Democrats in this matter as dithering and irresponsible. I can only appeal to other senators to support the motion that is before us, that is, that we do not press the requests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The motion that is before the Committee not to press the requests will not be supported by the Australian Democrats for the reasons that we have stated since the speech of Senator Mason on the Budget. The reasons are, I think, fairly clear. We believe the Senate is a House of review and as a House of review it must look at every piece of legislation that comes before it to see whether it is in the interests of the Australian people but we would like to make a distinction about how that House of review operates in respect of those money Bills which are part of the Budget and other Bills. A House of review, as we see it, in looking at money Bills as part of the Budget can allow a time for the electorate to review those Bills. We have chosen the period of three months quite deliberately. That is the period that was discussed at great length in the constitutional debates leading up to 1901. Indeed, it is the only period in the Constitution which has anything to do with Bills. It is a period, we believe, which will give adequate time for the electorate to pressure the back bench members of the Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we get down to the realpolitik of what is going on here we will see that it is simple. We support a pressing of the requests to allow the electorate to press the back bench members of the Liberal Party and the Australian National Party to change its mind on this issue. That is precisely what is going on. That is precisely why we are seeking to provide that time for the electorate. We would not be pressing these requests if we did not believe that is a possibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The back bench members of the Liberal Party, both here and in the House of Representatives, know as well as I do that whilst individuals in the electorate have been relatively busy it is only in the last week that the major pressure groups in society have started to move. Those pressure groups are massive and they are moving in on the Liberal Party as I speak. The back benchers know that and the Government knows it, and that is why they do not want to wait for three months. They do not want to wait because of that enormous pressure that is building up from groups which, in the last election, put money into their campaign. That is what is worrying them. It is worrying their organisation. It is worrying the back benchers. That is the realpolitik of what is going on in this discussion and that is why we of the Australian Democrats are pressing for the three months. </PARA>
<PARA> Anybody listening to this debate in their rooms or over the radio would, I am quite sure, have difficulty. Unless they were able to recognise the voices of the members who were speaking they would not know whether the members were speaking in 1981 or in 1975, with a couple of exceptions. Anyone who reads Hansard, as I have done, will see that the types of arguments that the Liberal Party supporters are putting forward were put forward in 1975 by the Australian Labor Party and the types of arguments that are put forward now by the Labor Party were put forward then by the Liberal Party. This is acceptable in that type of context. It is not acceptable to us. </PARA>

The members of the Labor Party are digging a ditch for themselves, but of course having done the figures they know they will not have to jump into it. If at some stage in the future the Labor Party is in office and there is a hostile Senate, not a Senate in which the Australian Democrats have the balance of power, the Senate will reject the Labor Party Budget. The Labor Party, however, knows that if it is in government in two years time that will not be the situation and it knows that for the first time it would have the opportunity of governing for three years. We believe that is also extremely important. Although the Liberal Party was willing to sell out its principles to get rid of the Labor Party and the Labor Party is now willing to sell out its principles to get rid of the Liberal Party, we will not have a bar of either. A government which has been given a mandate by the people to govern for three years, while we hold the balance of power in this place will be allowed to govern for three years unless it takes itself to the people.</PARA></TALK.START>

I suggest she have a look at the figures again. That is, unless the Government intends to go to a double dissolution. We have not heard that suggestion as yet from the Government. If we were willing to take the Government to a double dissolution on the sales tax legislation-the nonsense that has been talked about this is extraordinary-we could have demonstrated ourselves to the people as being the white knights coming in to save the people from this ogre of a tax and we could have in fact doubled our numbers in this place, and everyone knows that is the situation.

We are addressing ourselves particularly to Liberal back benchers who hold marginal seats. The back benchers are the people who are counting the numbers. They are the ones who are concerned. We believe that as the major pressure groups move in on them, they will become more concerned. The power, as we see it, is not in our hands but rather in the hands of the electorate-the Labor Party and the Liberal Party. While we hold the balance of power in this chamber, those parties can be assured that their Budgets will be passed to allow them to remain in government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will enter the debate for only a very short time because my views are well known as far as the sales tax issue is concerned. I have already made my point. I believe that the assessment involved in the philosophy of broadening our tax raising capacity in this way and the way in which we did it were ill-conceived. Unfortunately, the Government's advisers did not have regard to the implications that some of these measures may have on the community at large. However, it is in the interests of the Government's determination to keep personal taxation at a lower level and I believe it is quite a proper way to raise revenue to provide the Supply necessary to run Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as I am concerned, my main criticism is levelled at the retrospectivity of the tax as it affects people who in good faith entered into contracts well before the Budget was announced and who ordered commodities overseas which they had contracted to purchase. They found themselves in the position, after the Budget, of being required to pay far more than they anticipated in the first instance. That is the crux of my objections to the whole issue and the way we have gone about the measures that we are considering in Committee at the present. However, I am comforted by the fact that the Government recognised that although the sales tax has been embarked upon in this way over the last 51 years, it is prepared to recognise that some measures could be introduced in the future to obviate the confusion that has resulted in the business community. I am encouraged by what the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) said on the last occasion when this matter was debated in the Senate. She stated on 23 September:</PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me and to the Government that the best way to consider matters that have been quite properly and thoughtfully raised at this time would be to have a paper submitted by the Commissioner for Taxation and the Comptroller-General of Customs. We could then consider the problem as a whole. Recommendations and suggestions could be proposed. They may be acceptable by the Government. Certainly they would be considered by it. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a measure of the Goverment concern over the questions that have been raised during this debate. I was impressed also by an article in the Canberra Times of 30 September. The public concern over this matter was indicated when Professor Geoffrey Sawer analysed the events that occurred in this chamber on 23 September. In particular, he raised the matter of retrospectivity in respect of both customs duties and sales tax. Professor Sawer pointed out that in 1934 the Customs Act was amended so that it:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . expressly provided that customs duties are validly applicable from the date of first announcement in Parliament . . . provided the relevant Customs Tariff Act is passed within six months or before the end of that session. </PARA>
<PARA>He then posed the question: Why was this not done with respect to the Sales Tax Acts to overcome problems of retrospectivity? Whilst I do not necessarily agree with the Professor's solution he has raised the matter and brought it before the public. I hope that the Government will note what he has said. I believe that the Government is cognisant of the points raised. However, I am distressed that in respect of the retrospective element within the proposals the Government has not yet responded to the concern that I mentioned earlier. I moved an amendment last time this matter was before the Senate with respect to sections 119 and 119A of the principal Act. This amendment involved those people who had entered into agreements to purchase gliders. Also charter vessel operators who have entered into contracts to buy tourist vessels have been subjected to subsequent problems associated with the sales tax. I have one case in mind in particular-involving additional expenditure of the order of $100,000. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the glider people are concerned in one case brought to my attention $3,000 additional expenditure was incurred although the contract for the purchase of the item overseas was made in May this year-well before the Budget was determined. There are other examples where this matter has caused problems. One of the most irritating to me is the situation brought about through the irresponsible action of Australia's maritime unions. About eight weeks ago we were experiencing chaos on the waterfronts of Australia due to inter-union demarcation disputes. These held up goods that otherwise would have been delivered to Australia before the Budget was announced. I am pleased that the Government has recognised the points that have been raised. I have been to the Treasurer (Mr Howard) on two or three occasions concerning this matter. He undertook to take the matter of retrospectivity back to Cabinet and to report to me and others interested. That has not happened. But I have the assurance of the Government that this will be borne in mind and the assurance that a paper will be presented by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation and the Comptroller-General of Customs. </PARA>
<PARA> These papers to be presented will describe the history of the way in which we have imposed these taxes. I would like to get the assurance of the Minister in charge of these Bills that these papers will be presented as soon as possible. I ask her to make certain that it is done very early in the piece so the matter can be debated in the Parliament and also so the public can have an opportunity to express views on ways in which the methods adopted in the past can be amended to obviate the retrospective matter that I have raised which is objectionable to me. I hope this will provide some constructive suggestions as to ways in which transitional provisions can be provided to the people of Australia in order to avoid unnecessary disruption to business and confusion in the minds of members of the public at large. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was absent from the Parliament when this legislation was previously debated and voted on and I would like to take this opportunity to make a few brief comments on the issue. Firstly, I would like to comment in relation to the motion that, I gather, we will be voting on shortly. I shall be supporting the motion moved by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). However, I would not want it construed that my support for that motion is support for all the arguments put in relation to constitutional matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been quite an extensive debate on the constitutional implications of the principle of the Senate pressing a request. I am certainly not persuaded that we are constitutionally in error whenever we press a request. I refer very briefly to Australian Senate Practice by J. R. Odgers. I do not intend to debate the matter at length; others have done so. I am persuaded by the information that is conveyed that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . at the Melbourne session of the Federal Convention in 1898 an amendment was moved to substitute the word 'once' for the words 'at any stage'. The proposal was defeated on the voices, which is indicative of the Convention's view that the Senate should not be restricted to one suggestion only. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, in debate in the House of Representatives on the matter of the Senate repeating a request, the late Right Honourable W. M. Hughes said:</PARA>
<PARA> If any man had dared to stand up and tell the smaller States that the Senate had only such a power, the Constitution would never have been accepted. </PARA>
<PARA>I think there is fair evidence that, in the framing of the Constitution, it was not the intention that the Senate should be restricted to one instance of making a request. </PARA>
<PARA> I note also in the information that we are given about occasions when the Senate has made requests, that the House of Representatives on quite a number of occasions has acceded to substantial requests-not just requests relating to drafting, but to substantial issues of what must have been government policy. I find it difficult to believe that a government would accede to requests which modified government policy if it believed that it was only a polite expression of opinion from the Senate and that the Senate was in fact powerless to impede that legislation further once the House of Representatives had rejected the request. I think the political sanction of the Senate having the right to repeat requests is an important one and one that must have counted in the past when decisions were made for the House of Representatives to accede to requests. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I shall be supporting the Government's motion because the matter of the controversial sales tax is, we are told, a substantial aspect of this Budget and also a substantial aspect of government taxing policy. I notice that Senator Jessop referred to the notion that, as a matter of policy in Australia, we should try to shift away from direct tax to indirect tax, to lessen the amount of revenue that is collected through direct tax and increase the proportion of indirect tax. I do not quarrel with that as a general principle but I nevertheless think we should be careful with the detail. We ought to bear in mind that a number of households in Australia are living on incomes which in terms of direct income tax, are too low to be taxed. They will pay a higher rate of their very low incomes to government in revenue--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just gave another reason-the honourable senator was probably not listening and he was probably chatting-as to why I will not but I will repeat it shortly if he likes. When there was some debate about value added tax abroad in the community some time ago, I was certainly opposed to that on the grounds that I believe that when all items are taxed, including what we call essential items, the burden is much heavier on lower income earners than on middle and higher income earners. I have been taken to task for statements such as the proportion that lower income earners spend on essential items is a higher part of their income than it is for middle and higher income earners. I have had pointed out to me figures that show something quite different. That does not alter the fact that middle and higher income earners can adjust the quality of their consumption. For example, a dress may cost $20 at Woolworths Ltd or $200 at Georges Australia Ltd in Collins Street. The fact that they attract the same amount of sales tax does not indicate anything in relation to equity as between the person who can afford to pay $200 and the one who can only afford to pay $20. In fact higher income earners can adjust down, not the volume of their consumption necessarily, but certainly the quality of their consumption when faced with an extra tax imposition in sales tax. They have a choice that lower income earners may well not have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope that, in the future, the Government will review its attitude on this tax. We have always accepted a discretionary level of sales tax. We have accepted some moral judgments in relation to sales tax on luxury items such as jewellery. We have accepted that there is nothing wrong with there being higher rates of tax on certain items versus other items. We have made that moral and discretionary judgment on a number of occasions. I regret that the Government has not acceded to that argument on this occasion. I hope that in the future it will. I believe that, as time goes on, a number of quirks will emerge in the implementation of this virtually across-the-board tax which will be worth such a small amount of revenue that the Government will have to modify. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of tax on newspapers, periodicals, books and so on is something that attracts my attention particularly in these terms. I do not object to a tax on books-the so-called tax on knowledge-because plenty of civilised countries have it and I do not believe it is a deterrent to knowledge. I think the tax on newspapers and news-type magazines and periodicals is unfortunate and will be a considerable annoyance to the public and to others who are involved in the tax. For example, I am informed that, if one has a subscription to a publication which is paid for and posted from overseas, one has to pay the tax to the post office. For a matter of a few cents on each occasion, people will be required to go to post offices and bail out their magazines. </PARA>

I think details like that will come out, which I hope will persuade the Government to look at some of these silly aspects. I hope that the Government will realise that the tax is not going to be a large revenue earner but could be a major annoyance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Housing is already heavily taxed at a number of levels and in different ways. The question there is essentially: What is our national policy on home ownership? Doubtless, tax will eliminate a number of borderline cases. However, the principle of whether we try to keep the cost of housing low in Australia-one of the most significant factors in our standard of living-is one that ought to be debated objectively. The general issue of the imposition of the tax is one that I believe the Government will probably have to review and to reconsider. If there is to be a further move in the direction of indirect tax, accompanied by a diminution of the level of direct tax, I hope that these sorts of items will be taken into account. For Senator Walsh's benefit, I repeat that I shall be voting for Senator Durack's motion and shall not be voting for the requests to be pressed because this is a major budgetary measure. I accept that the Government has the right to implement this budgetary measure. I am earnest in the hope that it will see, as it has in other instances, the errors inherent in some details of its policy and re-consider the matter in the future. </PARA>

I was interested in the interjection of the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) in speaking about the 2 1/2 per cent sales tax which is to be applied on magazines which are imported. From her interjection, I understood that this was not to be the case. To put the record straight, I want to read into Hansard a letter from Mr R. A. Gill, the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in Perth, dated 9 October, to Mr G. W. Pidcock of 30 Edward Street, Bedford. The letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Dear Sir</PARA>
<PARA>SALES TAX</PARA>
<PARA> Receipt is acknowledged of your letter dated 19 August 1981 concerning the proposed sales tax applicable to magazines. </PARA>
<PARA> In this regard, legislation currently before Parliament proposes to impose sales tax of 2 1/2 per cent on certain categories of goods that are presently exempt from sales tax. The tax is to be imposed on goods which, on or after 1 January 1982, pass the point at which sales tax becomes payable. </PARA>
<PARA> Magazines, newspapers and books are some goods that will be affected by the 2 1/2 per cent sales tax unless an overriding exemption applicable to particular industries and organisations is claimed. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no provision in the sales tax law to provide exemption on the magazines purchased by you and therefore sales tax will be payable at the time the magazines go into home consumption in Australia. Sales tax will be payable at the post office at the time you receive each magazine. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Pidcock has written to me because of his concern that if he subscribes to an imported magazine which costs the equivalent of an Australian dollar he will be required, firstly, to go to a post office and, secondly, to pay 2 1/2c sales tax. He is undecided as to how he can achieve that. He cannot interfere with the coin of the realm, but that is the only course open to him, on the determination of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, to pay for his magazines as they come, as the Deputy Commissioner describes it, 'into home consumption'. I think that the Government has to get its act together. It is constantly placing people in the community at a disadvantage. I would suggest that many people who subscribe to magazines are already disadvantaged in that they are housebound for various reasons. Some of them-I know that this is hard to believe-are even physically handicapped and would find it impossible to get to a post office. This is why they subscribe to magazines. I question whether any provision was made by the Government, when it determined that this 2 1/2 per cent sales tax would apply to magazines, for handicapped persons to be able to pay that 2 1/2c on a dollar subscription at home. Will such people be able to post an amount of, say, 50c to the post office? Will they be able to give it to the postman and say: 'Put this on the slate and when it runs out let me know', or will there be some other mechanism by which they can pay their 2 1/2c tax?</PARA>
<PARA> We have heard a lot from the Government on the issue of sales tax not being applied to foodstuffs. Let me inform the Government that if it checks in the supermarkets it will see already the effect of sales tax on foodstuffs. Already retailers are making a profit at the expense of the consumers and they are going about it in a very neat way. They are telling us that because a sales tax is applied to the packages in which goods are placed they are quite entitled to charge that 2 1/2 per cent or whatever the particular percentage may be. In actual fact, the price of food is being increased by the Government's decision to apply sales tax to packaging. Unless the Government has some valid reason for imposing this extra payment on families, particularly low income families, I think it has to accept that the Senate has a justification and a right to continue to send these requests back to the House of Representatives until the Government gets its act together and determines, firstly, that there will not be an impost on food and, secondly, that there will not be such stupid provisions as this 2 1/2 per cent tax applied to subscriptions to magazines from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Like Senator Martin, I also give the National Geographic Magazine to a number of friends of mine. I hesitate to think what they will think of me because now for imposing this additional amount on them. The National Geographic sells for, I think, $1.50. We are aware that Mr Pidcock has been getting uptight about how he is going to pay 2 1/2c. I wonder how my friends will pay 3 3/4c., which will be the tax applicable to the National Geographic. This ridiculous situation will be exacerbated. As I have said, unless the Government can come to terms with these simple items, it will find itself in a lot of strife when it tries to make a comprehensive assessment of those major items on which it is determined to apply a tax which does not already apply. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating a motion moved by the Government that the requests which we as a Senate forwarded to the House of Representatives in respect of the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) be not pressed. I do not intend to canvass the subject matter of the Bills as I have done so on previous occasions, but I do wish to point out to the chamber the incongruity of the motion proposed by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) that the requests be not pressed, together with his statement that the Senate does not have the right to press those requests. I think that in a debate such as this we sadly miss Senator Cavanagh. I could just imagine what he would do with that type of action from the Government front bench. I have mentioned that Senator Durack indicated that the Senate did not have the right to press the requests. I think I may be slightly in error there. I should have said that Senator Durack came into the chamber with an armful of legal opinion to suggest that the Senate did not have such a right.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I think that is probably fair to Senator Durack. If Senator Durack is of the opinion that the Senate does not have the right to press those requests he ought to get up and say so. If he wishes to pursue that course, let him take the matter to the High Court of Australia, if he can. There lies the nub of the issue. At this stage he cannot take the matter to the High Court because we are dealing with proposed laws. We are not dealing with laws that have already been passed; we are dealing with proposed laws. The method by which we deal with those proposed laws is the business of the Parliament. It is not the business of the courts. If the House of Representatives has a view about this matter, which it has expressed on some but not all occasions, and if the Senate has a contrary view about it, it is not beyond the realm of possibility that there should be a conference between representatives of both Houses of Parliament to resolve the issue. The armful of legal opinions is of no value whatsoever in view of the fact that we are dealing with proposed laws. I will quote one of the opinions which I understand the Attorney-General put forward. It is the opinion of R. Garran dated 13 March 1943. On the first page this opinion states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On each occasion when the House of Representatives has reserved its own constitution position the Senate has recorded a declaration of its own constitutional right to press or re-iterate a request. The practice of the Parliament therefore has left this difficult question unresolved. </PARA>
<PARA>It is also true to say that not on every occasion has the House of Representatives adopted the attitude that the Senate does not have the right to press these requests. I submit very briefly, because we have canvassed all of these matters in regard to these Bills ad infinitum before, that the motion put forward by the Attorney-General, 'That the requests be not pressed' is inconsistent with the viewpoint expressed by some Government members that the Senate does not have the power to press those requests. Clearly we do have the right under Standing Order 256 to do just that. Standing Order 256 states:</PARA>
<PARA> If the Bill is returned to the Senate by the House of Representatives with any request not agreed to, or agreed to with modifcations, any of the following motions may be moved:</PARA>
<PARA> That the request be pressed. </PARA>
<PARA> That the request be not pressed. </PARA>
<PARA> That the modification be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA> That the modification be not agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>The Attorney cannot have it both ways. He cannot pick and choose which Standing Orders he considers are appropriate to the Senate and which are not because all of those Standing Orders are appropriate to the business of the Senate. I, as a senator, have the responsibility to proceed in accordance with those Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to advert to the possibility of a valid argument being advanced that the Government may regard the Senate pressing its requests as failure to pass the legislation. That is another opinion. There is more weight in that opinion than in the opinion that we do not have the power to repeat the requests. Nevertheless, at this stage I do not hold to that opinion either. As I have said, there appears to be more weight to that opinion. If the repeated request does form the basis for action to be taken pursuant to section 57 of the Constitution, so be it. The Government can turn around next year or three months from tonight-as I see it-and reintroduce the legislation. Let us see what happens. Let us see whether the Government is prepared at that stage to go to a double dissolution on the issue of the taxation of housing materials or babies nappies. I should think that it would not. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the constitutional situation, at that stage it would be up to anybody to test the action in the High Court because decisions and steps would have been taken towards implementing the provisions of section 57 which, of course, could be subject to an action in the High Court. My view at present is that it is completely premature for the Government to adopt the attitude it has adopted. I am heartened by the number of Government members who hold strongly to the view that the Government's attitude on this matter is not correct and that the Senate does have power, in fact, to press these requests. I oppose the motion proposing that the Senate not press the requests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly in this absurdly titled debate on the motion: 'That the requests be not pressed'. It is an extraordinary thing for people to be debating. I do so largely because of some misapprehensions and historical inaccuracies which have occurred in the contributions to the debate that have already been made by various honourable senators. Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I listened to the replay of the agony of Senator Missen, which was most manifest in 1975. His recollection of those events in 1974 and 1975 now appears to be somewhat different from mine.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that is what she said: 'I accept the right of the Government to pass all its Budget measures'. That reminds me of Senator Missen's speech. The distinction which the Australian Labor Party has drawn between what is happening now in relation to the Labor Party's intended vote on this issue as I understand it-of course I cannot speak for all my colleagues; they all make up their own minds-and what happened in 1974 and 1975 needs re-emphasis. I am so glad that Senator Missen has come into the chamber. I remember in 1975 Senator Missen's personal agony-if I may so describe it-over a decision by the majority Opposition of the Senate at that time to fail to pass legislation which was designed to bring about the defeat of the Government. Indeed, if there needs to be any doubt about its design of bringing about the defeat of the Government, the friendly interjector, Senator Withers, very explicitly put in Hansard in 1974 what it was all about. Of course, he is not quite in a position now where he can make those threats in the same way as he did then. But it is worthy of memory that what Senator Withers had to say about this issue was very carefully documented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1975-to use Senator Withers's expression-the then Opposition embarked upon a course to bring about the defeat of the Government. We are not, in voting against this sales tax legislation, embarking upon a course to bring about the defeat of the Government and we will not so embark upon such a course in the Senate. I was disappointed to hear earlier today Senator Missen take up the refrain of Senator Carrick. I use the expression 'refrain' because Senator Carrick's debating techniques remind me of a sort of Port Said hawker-when you get on a good thing, keep flogging it. The particular phrase which Senator Carrick is now stuck on challenges the alleged veracity of the Australian Labor Party 'maintaining its rage', as he puts it. Senator Carrick has put this phrase into the ever vacuous head of Senator Missen, who has taken it up and used it as his own. I make the point in terms of 1974 and 1975 and what is now happening in the Senate to remind Senator Missen and Senator Martin about the Budget of 1974 because in that Budget the then Liberal-Country Party majority in the Senate rejected the Medibank levy, which was an essential and important part of the Whitlam Government's Budget legislation. Senator Missen did it in 1974 with no agony and with no sweat. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is absolutely true and it is exactly the same sort of thing as we are doing now, I am sorry to say, with no agony and no sweat because it is a small part of the Budget legislation. In 1974 when the Medibank levy was rejected the Whitlam Government said, 'That is bad luck; we have had our legislation rejected in the Senate; so we will have to do it another way'. The fact that it was forced to do it another way was an awful thing for this country, as has been seen by the five changes to the health insurance system of this country since then. That system still is not working. It was an awful thing that the Whitlam Government had to go and do it in another way, but that is what it did. That is what this Government will have to do when this sales tax legislation is rejected. There is a very clear distinction between that course of action by a majority Opposition in the Senate and the course of action upon which honourable senators opposite embarked, as a majority Opposition, in 1975. It is in respect of that course of action that the expression 'maintain your rage' was invented and will continue to live and exist in this country. It is a vastly different thing from the sort of exercise which is being indulged in now by the Opposition. Let that be made quite clear.

That is when it all started to happen-two days after the election.

<PARA> The only other issue I want to touch on is the question raised by my colleague, Senator Walsh. Part of the reason the action was taken in 1975 allegedly was because of the economic performance of the Whitlam Government. Senator Walsh went through, in the course of his speech this afternoon, four major indices of economic performance in respect of which the record of the Fraser Government is abysmal and shonky. Little hope for the future is gained from the indices of inflation, unemployment, interest rates and so on which were mentioned by Senator Walsh. Of course that issue goes to the question of the Government's economic credibility. We are told by this Government that this bit of sales tax legislation, to raise about $100m this year, is essential to its budgetary strategy. What a lot of bunkum. What is essential to the Government's budgetary strategy? Clearly the Government has no idea.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Button for making the Opposition's position quite clear. As the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) said earlier in the debate today, the Government has given careful consideration to the requests that were made by the Senate for changes to the sales tax Bills. I do not wish to add to the constitutional argument that was put by the Attorney-General. Perhaps there is no need to say again at this stage that the Bills would impose a 2 1/2 per cent rate of tax after 1 January next year on a range of commodities which are at present exempt from sales tax. We have heard the figures that relate to the Bills. The measures were expected to yield $132m in this year and $330m in a full year. That was stated in all of the Budget documents and I do not think anyone argues about that. I do not think anyone has been arguing that they are an integral part of the Budget. To agree to the requests made by the Senate would significantly alter the Budget proposals of the Government. Therefore the Government has made it quite clear that it does not accept the requests made by the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It might be said-as it has been said-that the loss of $100m or $200m here and there cannot be accepted lightly as it would damage the Budget but I think the Government has come to the conclusion that it cannot accept the amendments that were requested and maybe we ought to address ourselves to some of the points that have been made. I think it has been a fascinating debate because I was one of those who sat on the other side of the chamber in 1975. I am interested to see here my colleague, Senator Withers, who was then the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. I think he will recall, as I do, that it was often said at that time that were the then Government supporters, the senators of the Government party, sitting on the other side of the chamber they would have done exactly the same thing in the same circumstances. I think we have had that explained to us today by the attitudes of Opposition senators to these Bills, particularly the attitude that was expressed by Senator Walsh. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; There we had some difference. Apparently Senator Button had not heard what Senator Walsh said. There was some difference between them because Senator Walsh said the Opposition would take these Bills to the ultimate; the Opposition would expect to see the Bills resulting in a double dissolution of Parliament. He challenged the Government to dissolve Parliament. Over the years the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats have both stated time and again their opposition to the blocking of money Bills in the Senate. I think we have heard today that the ALP has an entirely different view when it is sitting on the Opposition benches from the one it had when it was sitting on the Government benches. As far as Government senators are concerned, we have never had a different view with regard to the powers of the Senate and its dealing with legislation. Our attitude is entirely the same. We just wish, as someone has said, that the Senate would put its act together and that everyone would say the same thing at the same time. In particular, I speak to the Australian Democrats. The attitude of the ALP, as expressed by Senator Walsh, Senator Evans and others, is perhaps one worthy of note. To contrast what has been said by them today in particular with an address made to the National Conference of Labor Lawyers by Senator Evans, I think we ought to read his words. In that speech on 3 July, Senator Evans implored his colleagues to resist the temptation to block Supply Bills. In a speech to the Senate on 20 August, Senator Evans said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are ample quotes that can be produced of my saying that, as a matter of principle, it is inappropriate for the Senate not only to block Supply but to block money Bills for Budgets. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable senator may take whichever quotes he likes. Senator Evans went on to introduce some spurious distinctions which attempted to amend and qualify the hard and fast ALP principle on the Senate and money Bills. I think it was a weak attempt to explain the about-face of the Labor Party; perhaps the cynicism of the Labor Party's action has now been widely recognised. I think it is interesting to see the enormous advance that has been made in the powers of the Senate in the opinion of Senator Evans since 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans told the Labor lawyers that the ALP could 'lose its self-respect and its credibility as a movement'. We can judge whether he is right about that; but, by its own definition, the ALP is not only taking an unprincipled stand but also, as the shadow Attorney-General has said, it is an arguable power that the Senate has. He apparently has some doubts about the constitutional argument that is being put by the Democrats whom he is supporting on this particular vote. The Attorney-General has stated on behalf of the Government that he believes that the Senate does not have the constitutional power to press the request for amendments to a Bill which the Senate cannot amend. I would imagine that the actions of the Labor Party parliamentarians could certainly have been expected by us, particularly those of us who know that they repeatedly oppose money Bills in the Senate. Nobody argues about that. Nobody has argued that there is no power to reject a money Bill in the Senate. We have never argued that. We have never expected any different treatment from that which has been given by the ALP; to use the Democrats words, 'again and again and again and perhaps again'. Labor senators vote against them if they do not like them or if it is politically suitable for them to do so. We have never argued against that. But we cannot help marvelling at the circuitous route of justification which they have used today to explain what apparently has been of some embarrassment to them by the quotes which they all made during 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the Democrats, perhaps we could say that they were an unknown quantity because they were not members of this House or any other House at that time. But they did make their view abundantly clear. They said on many occasions that they had one abiding principle and one policy. That was, as far as we could make out, because most policies were to be decided by a vote amongst those people who supported them. I think that the one principle that they tried to portray was honesty. The policy that they tried to portray by standing on platforms and waving statutory declarations was that they would never block money Bills. Perhaps in this one debate they have shown that they can throw out what was their one policy and perhaps they have thrown out their one platform. They may have also considerably embarrassed the Leader of the Democrats, Senator Chipp, who on their behalf made very serious commitments with regard to their approach to Bills that would be presented by governments.</PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General made it clear that the Democrats are in breach of their own statutory declarations, signed by each of them, not to use their voting numbers in such a way as to cause the blocking of money Bills in a manner which would prevent the majority party in the House of Representatives from governing. Their choice was to make those declarations. Nobody asked them to make them. In fact, it is probably part of their inexperience in politics to think that that is essential. A person is elected as a member of parliament and uses his or her judgment when he or she is in the Parliament. He or she is not bound by some other outside authority. People ought to come into the Parliament and use their judgment. Why the Democrats thought they ought to be elected with some divine right and that it would give the people of Australia some assurance in electing them if they signed statutory declarations has always seemed a bit obscure to me. However, that was their way of dealing with the matter. I think we have to say: So much for their honesty, so much for their statutory declarations; go out and tear them up right now. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth recalling how far the Australian Democrats have fallen from their solemn pledge to bring a new purity into Australian politics. We could go back to 1977 and look at their policy statements at that time when they stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We solemnly undertake to exercise the power responsibly and constructively. We will not be blockers. We undertake never to exercise that power to block the supply of money to the democratically elected government . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was said in 1977. They were not all elected that time. But, in 1980, Senator Chipp extended this view by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> The prime responsibility we have is to assist the Government to carry out its legislative program. We're not in the business of obstructing or disrupting. </PARA>
<PARA>We have repeatedly heard Senator Chipp say such things. In 1980, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats in the Senate would try to help in governing Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>That was said on 20 October 1980, exactly one year ago. Compare those statements with what the Democrats have said today. The following statement appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald on 20 October 1980. An article in the Australian dated 20 November contained this statement by the Democrats:</PARA>
<PARA> We would not wilfully attempt to frustrate or obstruct a government that has won a clear majority of seats. </PARA>
<PARA> We expect to be able to help the Fraser Government with its legislative program. </PARA>
<PARA>It will be noted that all of these statements were made by the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Chipp, in the run-up to the last election. They were the solemn promises of those who were going to bring a new purity to government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats were making this sort of statement in the course of the election campaign while at the same time reflecting on the honesty of the electioneering material of all other parties, including those who are now joining them from the Opposition benches. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the statements made by the Australian Labor Party and the spokesmen for the Democrats today, it is difficult to see who wins the hypocrisy stakes. All we can say is that they are certainly well suited to each other. Someone said there were no unity tickets between Hayden and somebody else. I would have to say that the courting of the Democrats by the Australian Labor Party is now over. They seem to be united in opposition. One of the speakers for the Democrats said: 'This is not the Democrats moving this. This is a joint effort by the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats'. They are united in opposition. Perhaps the Democrats' honeymoon with the Australian people is now over. Let us see how they get on living together. </PARA>
<PARA> In this debate, Senator Mason's statement in the Senate on 26 August has been quoted by the Attorney-General. Let me repeat part of that statement. Senator Mason said:</PARA>
<PARA> Listen to this, Senators, it is my bottom line. Those on the Labor side in particular should listen to this. Undesirable though the sales tax increases are, damaging though their impact might be, the consequences of the Senate meddling in or unilaterally rewriting a Budget seem to us too horrifying to contemplate. </PARA>
<PARA>They have overcome their horror very quickly. They have very quickly learned that one uses what one of them described as pressure on marginal seats of government members-pressure by groups of people. The comment outside is: 'As groups move in'. It makes one wonder what groups have moved in on the Democrats to get their solemn assurance to tear up their statutory declarations and to go through this tortuous logic that they have used to explain the party's position now and as it was then and to see what sorts of principles they were able to use to overcome their own difficulties. We urge Senator Mason and his colleagues to remember the campaign statements of his party and to look at the election promises that they made the next time they want to embark upon action like this. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the honourable senators said that it was not made clear by the Attorney-General what the Government would do when this matter had been regarded as a failure to pass and the three month period had elapsed. It was said that Senator Durack did not say that the Government would bring back the Bill. What Senator Durack said was that, in three months time, it was not in the hands of the Democrats to originate the Bill but he gave a very clear assurance that, at the appropriate time, the Government would deal with the sales tax legislation and it would present to both Houses the Bill that it required to be passed. I do not think that there need be any doubt as to what the Government's approach to that matter would be. What Senator Durack was trying to make clear is that the Democrats have some idea that between now and then it is in their hands to keep the Bill bouncing backwards and forwards between the two Houses. That is just not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> There were one or two matters which were raised by honourable senators which I perhaps quickly ought to try to deal with. Senator Jessop mentioned a statement in an article by Geoffrey Sawer in the Canberra Times. I am advised that what was stated in that article does not represent the true position. A provision of the Customs Act prevents officers from being sued when they charge duty in accordance with customs tariff proposals. The essential difference is that Customs have control over goods for both tariff and excise purposes; that no such control for sales tax purposes exists. Perhaps if Senator Jessop seeks further clarification on the matter I could provide it to him. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator also referred to an earlier request and to the commitment that I made with regard to items that were regarded by him as being retrospectively affected under other Bills, not the Bill that is now the subject of this debate. (Extension of time granted). I give him an assurance that when the papers are available from the Commissioner and the Comptroller-General they will be the subject of debate concerning matters that were raised by a number of people in relation to the application of changes in the Sales Tax legislation. An opportunity will be provided at some time soon, I hope, for such a discussion to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Martin and Senator Coleman referred to the importation of books and magazines. Senator Coleman referred to a letter written in Perth by the Australian Taxation Office to a Mr G. W. Pidcock. I am advised that that letter did not contain correct advice, and we will have to see that that matter is remedied. </PARA>

I suppose that if honourable senators make gifts of that value some problem may arise, but the usual imported periodical magazine would be exempted under item 145.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button, I believe, said that the reason we dealt with the Bills in 1975 was because of the economic performance of the Government. Let me put on the record one other fact that was very important at that time. It was that the Whitlam Government thought it could govern without parliament and without Bills if it was not able to have Bills passed. It did not accept that it needed parliamentary approval to do some of the things which governments under our system of parliament are required to do through the parliament. It was also prepared to do a number of other things in a way that was outside of the usual way of doing them, through the Loan Council and a whole range of other things. It was not the very simple and glib situation that was described by Senator Button as the pre-condition to the events of 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills have been canvassed by a number of honourable senators. Their impressions, opinions and explanations have been put on record and I simply commend Senator Durack's motion and hope that it will have a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the last 20 minutes Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle has been endeavouring to defend the Government's indefensible position about the introduction of indirect taxation. She has conveniently forgotten that her role is to defend the Government's legislation, not to attack the motives of the Opposition or the other parties in the Senate. She ignores the essential difference between the present and 1974 and 1975, those two momentous years in which the part she and her party played in the double dissolution were quite notorious-as distinct from the motivation of the Opposition, and the majority of the Senate, in respect of the motion that we are required to debate, that is, that the requests be not pressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Guilfoyle is on the public record as setting about with some of her well-known colleagues, within a few brief months of the Whitlam Government coming to office, to bring about the downfall of that Government on any grounds whatever. In 1974, within virtually a year of its coming to office, she played a significant part in affecting adversely the proper management of the economy by the Whitlam Government and helped to bring into play such forces as finally did affect adversely the Budget considerations of that year and those of the following year, 1975. She has not attempted to defend the fact that she conspired on that occasion to undermine the position of the Government, using the majority in this place-including the then minority party, the Democratic Labor Party-for that purpose. That minority party was the motivating force. It joined the Opposition to defeat the Medibank legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> She now has the audacity to suggest that it is immoral for another minority party to seek in 1981 to take a position which is identical to that of the Labor Party. Our position is quite clear. We have consistently opposed in the Senate Bills which sought to introduce indirect taxation. That is the Labor Party's view. If, because of our advocacy of that isue and because of public opinion outside the Parliament, which is strongly against the Government's proposals, the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine are prepared to join us to become a majority in the Senate I do not believe that that is an immoral position. But I do believe that in 1974 it was immoral to affect the Budget strategy of the Whitlam Government, as indeed it was in 1975 when the Opposition of that time, the Liberal and Country parties, in the Senate failed for more than three months to pass the Appropriation Bills. To suggest, therefore, that the blocking of Supply, which was an essential ingredient of the 1975 fiasco and of the great divisions that occurred in the Australian community as a result, is also the ingredient of this debate is to ignore the essential differences that exist. It is to ignore the fact that the Labor Party has a policy commitment in respect of indirect taxation which is different from that of the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> Our position in respect of this matter has been consistent. We do not see ourselves as denying the right of the Government to rule, nor are we involved in a conspiracy to bring down the Government, as were Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle and Senator Withers in 1974 and 1975, when they set about quite deliberately to make untenable the position of a Government with which they disagreed. That Government had been given a mandate in 1972 and again in 1974 and yet the then Opposition set about to cause that Government to fall. In fact, in respect of this legislation, the will of the Senate has been expressed. I believe that we are obliged to reject the motion that has been moved by Senator Durack. Under Standing Order 256 half a dozen options are available to the Senate. The Government has seen fit to move only one of those propositions. That is one which asks the Senate to rescind its previous position and ignore public opinion. The Labor Party is being asked to ignore its policy commitment concerning indirect taxation. The Democrats are being asked to take the same position as that taken by the Government which is notoriously known as a government of broken promises. Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle has the gall to suggest that it is the Democrats who should be on trial because of some statutory declaration they may have signed when just 13 months ago the Government gave a commitment that it would not introduce a value added tax, that it would not introduce a commodity tax and that it would not increase indirect taxation. Even as late as May of this year the Treasurer (Mr Howard) is on the public record as having said that the Government would not consider the introduction of indirect taxation unless it gave a comparable cut in personal income tax. Of course, that is not involved here. It is this Government that is breaking its word to the electorate; it is this Government that has no mandate in respect of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this afternoon we were subjected to a specious argument by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). It was not a legal argument, although the Attorney-General tried to trade it off as one. It was not even a moral argument because he does not have an argument. He was really asking the Senate not to make a political decision in respect of the matter that is before the Committee, that the request be not pressed. The Committee, of course, has indicated that it is not impressed with the Government's attitude on this matter. The Government is budgeting for a $1.5 billion surplus. In order to allow a capital inflow of some $7 billion from overseas, allegedly for the purpose of strengthening our economy, this Government quite cynically and quite carefully has designed a Budget that will take $1.5 billion out of the domestic economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of sales tax to be levied on the necessities of life represents a small part of the Budget-and in no way will affect the basic position of the Budget itself. If this legislation is not passed because the view of the Senate is finally supported in the other place, very little difference will be made to the integrity of the 1981-82 Budget. Such a move would certainly affect income in respect of the Howard Budget. But it will not cause the Budget to fall; it will not cause the Government to fall. It will not make that much difference in respect of Budget income and expenditure. But it will make a big difference to the living standards of average Australians who see that the Government's move does not have the support of the Senate and it certainly does not have the support of the Australian electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> Absolutely no arguments have been put forward by any of the three Government speakers who took part in the debate this afternoon. Senator Jessop and Senator Martin had some misgivings about the legislation. We know that considerable misgivings were expressed in the Government parties' room about the sales tax proposals. If there are such misgivings in the Government parties, how wrong it is to suggest that the Australian Labor Party or the other sections of the Senate that make up a temporary majority on this issue have some ulterior motive. </PARA>
<PARA> Senators are not prepared to somersault on this matter. At least I can say on behalf of the Australian Labor Party that we will certainly not change our mind. Our well known total opposition to any form of indirect taxation is set out in our policy and platform. We believe that that is the view of the Australian electorate. The Government has produced no evidence-certainly the Minister for Finance at the table has produced no evidence-that would suggest that the Labor Party ought in some way or other, to be persuaded to change its view and pass this piece of legislation. I think it is a weakness on the Government's part that it has not been able to prove conclusively that the request that has been made to us by the Attorney-General ought to be supported. Therefore, one would expect that the Committee would maintain the position it has held since this matter became public in the Budget of August this year. I trust that the Senate will continue to maintain that view right to the point of defeating the legislation. </PARA>

The facts of the matter are that on Wednesday 23 September when the sales tax legislation was first introduced into the Senate I said precisely that we would delay the legislation to at least 1 January. I have been criticised because we subsequently said 24 January. I was a few days out. But our intention was made quite clear the evening that the sales tax legislation was introduced. We said that we would delay it for a certain time-three months. I admit that was a few days out. The same evening of 23 September Senator Haines said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek leave to have the substance of the statement incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has selected, as Australia's new tactical fighter, the F/A-18, manufactured by the McDonnell-Douglas Corporation of the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA> In April 1979, I said to the Parliament that our strategic and geographic circumstances differ in many respects from those of the countries for which the contending aircraft were primarily designed. </PARA>
<PARA> If our force is called upon to defend this country or its interests, it may have to do so alone, not as part of a larger allied force having the range of capabilities possible with a mixture of aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> We therefore sought an aircraft versatile in several roles, against both air and surface targets, in all weather conditions. We could not favour an aircraft because of its excellence in any one particular quality. </PARA>
<PARA> In air combat, our fighters are likely to have to operate over and beyond our vast Northern regions without the extensive and close control available in the European environment. Hostile surface forces would usually have to cross large expanses of water. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's tactical fighter therefore requires long range and endurance to be able to seek out its targets at a distance. It requires a comprehensive array of air-to-air and air-to-surface weapons necessary to engage them. </PARA>
<PARA> The nature of our land is such that we must be able to deploy our tactical fighter force at short notice, over long distances, into bare bases, and to operate there supported by extended air re-supply links. </PARA>
<PARA> The aircraft we sought therefore had to be maintainable with the minimum of front line support equipment. It had to have superior qualities of reliability and operational availability. </PARA>
<PARA> We also sought minimal peacetime training losses of aircraft and pilots. Because the aircraft chosen must see us through the next twenty years or more, we sought the potential to accommodate the improved weapons and other systems that will undoubtedly emerge during its long life span. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the operational factors that bore on the selection-a selection which, to a large extent, will determine the shape of the RAAF into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA> We had to choose between two magnificent aircraft-the F/A-18 and the General Dynamics F-16. Both in their different ways are splendidly impressive and capable machines. However, it has become clear that, in relation to the operational factors I have just indicated, the F/A-18 will be better suited to our needs. </PARA>
<PARA> The F/A-18 has been developed from the outset as a multi-role aircraft, with all-weather, air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles, and all-weather navigation and weapons targeting systems. These systems give it unparalleled flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Because it was designed to operate from aircraft carriers, reliability and ease of maintenance were essential elements of the specification of the F/A-18. The testing program has established confidence that these objectives-and from them a very high level of availability-will be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> The F/A-18 is well suited to deployment and operation from forward bases because it requires relatively little airfield support and test equipment. It is well suited to our operating, deployment and maintenance requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> It has good potential for adding improved weapons and other systems as these become available. It has features which strongly support the pilot in the efficient and safe prosecution of his mission. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, my advisers are unanimous in their advice that, principally because of its twin engines, the F/A-18 offers a clear prospect of fewer losses throughout its operating life. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Government deferred the selection last year, teams of RAAF and civilian officers have re-examined and refined their assessments of the two contending aircraft. In their endeavours they have had, throughout, the unstinting assistance of the U.S. departments of defence, navy and air force and of the two prime manufacturers and their sub-contractors. The government is deeply appreciative of the support given. </PARA>
<PARA> My senior advisers-and in particular, the chief defence scientist and the chief of air force technical services-now see no substantial technical obstacles to the development of either aircraft in the form that we have sought. </PARA>
<PARA> The aerodynamic problems evidenced in the F/A-18 have been satisfactorily resolved. The U.S. Department of Defense has now given approval for full production of the aircraft in the air-to-air fighter role. Clearance of additional weapons for the air-to-surface attack role is not due until about this time next year. My advisers are now confident that the outcome will be acceptable, but we will be requiring the U.S. Navy not to place the main contract for our aircraft until this clearance is available. </PARA>
<PARA> Sufficient structural fatigue testing has been completed to clear the F/A-18 for its first ten years of operation. Tests necessary to give assurances of a further ten years of life will continue until 1984. Any consequential modifications to achieve this will be known by then. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the F-16, uncertainties that earlier surrounded the progress of its weapons enhancement program have receded, but nevertheless persists in some respects. Particular doubts have arisen about the F-16's new all-weather targeting and navigation systems-necessary to meet Australia's requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be very proper concern too that the cost of such a vast project should be known with confidence. There will be a temptation to turn back to earlier experiences and see them reflected in the future and there can never, of course, be absolute guarantees about a production program which reaches until the end of the decade. </PARA>
<PARA> Concerns about cost should be tempered with an understanding of the processes that have contributed and will continue to contribute to our confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> In their examination of the two contenders, our evaluation teams have had unconstrained access to all of the material on these aircraft that is available to the U.S. Department of Defense. That organisation has behind it the experience of managing the world's most formidable manufacturing programs.</PARA>
<PARA> The review processes available to me have been strengthened by the defence re-organisation of the mid-1970s. Recommendations now flow from a formalised process of examination which consolidates the deliberate judgements of the most senior specialists in all of the relevant skills: scientific, engineering, financial, legal-contractual and more. </PARA>
<PARA> It deserves to be said that the professional and technical qualifications of those involved in the new tactical fighter project are second to none. I hope the country will make proper acknowledgement of that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> To implement the project, we are making arrangements that will allow this country to place its experts within the U.S. Government's project management team. They will participate in its day-to-day processes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that a program can be implemented that minimises Australia's exposure to the uncertainties of the future and that a decision can and should be made now. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall project cost of 75 F/A-18 aircraft is $2430 million in August 1981 prices. </PARA>
<PARA> This includes the costs of some configuration changes to meet the RAAF's operational requirements, and the cost of simulators, spares, test equipment, training equipment and the like. It also includes the cost of new buildings and overhaul facilities at RAAF bases and the costs of establishing important support capabilities in Australian industry. A contingency sum has been included where risks remain. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been public speculation about the difference in the cost of the alternative F-16 aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall project cost for the F-16 would have been some 7 per cent less than for the F/A-18. However, it is estimated that when we take account of running and support costs and of attrition throughout the life of the aircraft this difference will be substantially reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The F/A-18 costs have grown during development. I cannot rule out further increases. I have said that there could be modifications flowing from structural testing. They are not expected to be costly. </PARA>
<PARA> The chief risk appears to be the possibility of reduction in the production rate in the early years of the program, thus increasing production costs. </PARA>
<PARA> To contain cost growth, the Government is stipulating that the manufacture of the first of our aircraft should not precede a specified number of aircraft in the U.S. program unless we decide otherwise. In this way, we will secure for Australia the benefit of the continuing testing and development of the aircraft and of early U.S. squadron experience. These and other arrangements too detailed to relate now give us advantages that we have not had in the management of earlier programs. </PARA>
<PARA> There will, of course, be cost increases due to world-wide inflationary trends. As it has done in the past for other major equipment acquisitions, the Government will keep the House informed of movements in cost of the project, both up and down, and both real and inflationary, against the base of the August 1981 price levels. </PARA>
<PARA> During 1980 I reached with the U.S. Department of Defense very satisfactory arrangements under which the project has been developed and under which the associated Australian industry program will be put into effect and managed. The actual purchase instruments will contain more detailed conditions. My Department has necessarily yet to conclude discussions with the U.S. Departments on a number of matters that relate to the specific aircraft chosen. I will not be agreeing the acceptance of formal purchase documents until a satisfactory position has been reached. </PARA>
<PARA> On present planning the RAAF can look forward to receiving its first F/A-18 before the end of 1984. Pilots should begin operational training with them in the second half of 1985. Aircraft should be flowing from Australian production at a rate of three aircraft every two months by the middle of 1986, and deliveries should be completed in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the role that the Australian industry will have in the new tactical fighter program. </PARA>
<PARA> Establishment of a capability for through-life support in Australia is a fundamental element of the program. The new fighter will be in service with the RAAF well into the next century. Australian industry must command key technologies needed to support it. </PARA>
<PARA> Agreement has been reached with the U.S. contractors on work to be carried out on our aircraft in Australia and on an associated export offset program. The added value of the offset work is to be 30 per cent of the imported cost of the program, and there will be compensation provisions if the U.S. contractors fail to honour their commitments. </PARA>
<PARA> The corner stone of the Australian industry program will be the final assembly and test of the F/A-18 at the Government Aircraft Factories at Avalon. This will equip Australian engineers and technicians with an intimate understanding of the sophisticated sub-systems of the aircraft. The engines will also be assembled and tested in Australia, at the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation at Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> Major parts of the aircraft, of its engines and of its electronic and mechanical systems will be manufactured in Australia in order to introduce new technologies we need to support the F/A-18. </PARA>
<PARA> To carry out this work many new facilities and items of specialised production and text equipment will be introduced into our factories. This will have a dramatic effect on our skills in many areas-to name but a few: radar, digital electronics, control systems and new super-materials in engines and structures. </PARA>
<PARA> Unavoidably the cost of work done in Australia for our own relatively small numbers of aircraft will be greater than those in the U.S. These additional costs are the price we have to pay for the self-reliance we want in the support of our own aircraft. They have been included in the total cost figure I gave earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> Included in the costs are investments in tooling, test equipment and machinery, plant and facilities. Much of this investment would be required in any event to support the new tactical fighter in Australia and will have application to other defence programs in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The tactical fighter force project is a major national enterprise. It will involve not only the RAAF, and my department, but a host of contractors and sub-contractors in Australia's defence-related industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It will provide us with a central element of the forces needed to defend our nation's security. </PARA>
<PARA> It will develop our technological and industrial capacity in an area critical to our defences but also important on a wider national basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The presence, in this part of the world of repair and overhaul facilities for the F/A-18 will be a significant military advantage also for our ANZUS ally, the United States. The benefits of inter-operability and common support will be of value to both nations. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not entered upon this large and testing program without carefully weighing the risks. I am confident that we have in being a work force with the skills necessary to meet this demanding challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be difficult for anyone not close to it to conceive the scale of the task involved in the tactical fighter evaluation and its industry progam. Those who have carried it through have worked with extreme dedication. I express my appreciation of their efforts. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the House to give this undertaking its complete support. </PARA>
<PARA> I now inform the House of a further major decision concerning the RAAF's long range maritime patrol force. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of the modernisation announced last year of the older P3B Orion aircraft, the government has decided to sell the P3Bs and to acquire ten more P3Cs subject to satisfactory contractural negotiations. The cost of proceeding this way is estimated at $240m. It involves a premium of some $50m which, in the government's view, is worth paying. </PARA>
<PARA> We shall avoid the major disruption of the maritime patrol force involved in a major modernisation of half of its aircraft. The P3Bs when modernised, would have had a life expectancy of less than half of that of the existing P3Cs, which will not need replacement until beyond the end of the century. </PARA>
<PARA> The new aircraft will be equipped, as are the ten P3Cs we now operate, for the harpoon anti-ship missile and the Australian-developed Barra anti-submarine sonobuoy system. I expect the first aircraft to be delivered in 1985 and the entire squadron to be re-equipped by 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will recall the government's decision last year concerning the follow-on destroyer project. I announced the intention to build two FFG-type ships at Williamstown Naval Dockyard, subject to satisfactory resolution of a number of problems affecting productivity there. </PARA>
<PARA> I expect to be dealing shortly with recommendations about the future of that dockyard. Meantime, the government has decided to order long-lead items from the United States for the construction in due course of the first vessel. </PARA>
<PARA> In making this decision now, we make it possible-should the problems that have beset Williamstown in recent years be resolved-to begin construction of the ship there next year. If there is no improvement-and I want this to be clear-we shall have to look to construction elsewhere. An order of long-lead items for a follow-on destroyer involves no commitment to build at Williamstown. </PARA>
<PARA> Our plans for the development of the Australian-designed minehunting catamaran are proceeding and tenders for construction of two prototypes are presently being evaluated. But to complement these minehunters we need to be able to sweep mines. </PARA>
<PARA> I confirm to honourable members that the British hunt class is under consideration for this role. We have the opportunity to acquire vessels ordered originally for the Royal Navy. We are investigating the acquisition of two vessels with an option on a third. The decision will be made later in this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> In September 1980, I informed the house that Government had decided to replace HMAS Melbourne with a purpose-designed ship to be equipped with helicopters for anti-submarine warfare and to have the potential to operate short take-off and vertical-landing aircraft. I said also that further definition of the details of the new carrier would be completed in the next financial year. These investigations are proceeding and, as honourable members will be aware, have been widened to include an examination of the offer from Britain of an invincible class ship. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall make a statement in due course on the new carrier. I also hope to be able to inform the House of the Government's intentions for the further modernisation of our three DDG guided missile destroyers. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been a number of recent decisions regarding new equipment for the army. </PARA>
<PARA> Equipment operated by the army is characterised by quantity and diversity. Few items attract the public spotlight sometimes focussed on the ships and aircraft of the other services. The Budget makes provision for a range of new equipment for the army. Several decisions, for example those relating to the acquisition of some 2235 new trucks of two types, totalling over $150 million, have been the subject recently of separate announcements. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I want to mention three projects today. All three will be implemented in such a way as significantly to enhance Australian self-reliance. </PARA>
<PARA> The first is the establishment of production capability and the initial manufacture by Australian industry of a new 105mm artillery weapon of an overseas design. On the successful completion of this pre-production phase, the weapon and its ammunition will be ordered in substanital numbers. It will be considerably more capable than our existing 105mm guns. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall be releasing further details shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> The second, project raven, aims to provide the army with a new family of single-channel portable tactical radios. The government has decided to allocate resources to the development of the high frequency component of the radios by Australian industry, and to preparations for its subsequent production. This project will transfer design skills and technology to Australia that will place this country in the forefront of world developments in the field. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly I inform the House of the Government's decision to spend over a period of several years, some $80m on expanding the army's operations reserve of ammunition. Some $60m of this will be spent on manufacturing ammunition in Australia, including types of ammunition not previously produced here. </PARA>
<PARA> The development, within industry, of capacities needed to supply and support the defence force, and thus to increase our self-reliance, continues to have a high place in the Government's considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> Participation by Australian industry in the provision of defence equipment is one important means of implementing this policy. Another involves direct expenditure on facilities in industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1981-82 Budget makes provision for an approximate doubling of expenditure (to $39.5 million) on new plant and facilities in the aircraft industry and munitions factories. Major facilities being established include a nitro-glycerine plant at Mulwala, New South Wales; a composite material and bonding workshop at the Government Aircraft Factories, Melbourne, and a heavy shell-forging facility at the ordnance factory at Maribyrnong in Victoria. We are also expanding the existing facilities for manufacturing barra sonobuoys in Sydney and for the production of micro-electronic components in the plants of several commercial defence contractors. </PARA>
<PARA> Virtually all defence activities depend on infrastructure-bases, barracks, dockyards, workshops, stores, training establishments, communication stations and a variety of other facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1981-82, $179 million is to be spent on capital facilities for defence-much of it in the north and west of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This month, a new ammunition depot was opened at HMAS Stirling, near Perth: and a fuel storage capacity is being provided there. </PARA>
<PARA> During 1982, the new patrol boat bases at Cairns and Darwin will be completed. </PARA>
<PARA> Improvements will be made to the RAAF airfield at Darwin, in preparation for the basing there of a tactical fighter squadron, and to the airfield at Learmonth. Work is continuing on the design of the proposed airfield at Derby.</PARA>
<PARA> The second major stage in the modernisation of Garden Island Dockyard, Sydney, will be commenced this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The RAAF's operational flexibility will be improved by additional fuel storage capacity at Tindal, Williamtown, Amberley and Richmond. Planning will continue for facilities at Williamtown to support the new tactical fighter. The Government proposes to improve the airfield at Woomera so that it can be used more intensively by all the types of aircraft operated by the defence force. </PARA>
<PARA> The increasing technical sophistication of modern defence equipment requires additional trained manpower. Accommodation to cope with extra trainees is to be provided at RAAF technical training schools at Wagga and Laverton. Plans are also being developed for new training facilities at the RAAF School of Navigation at East Sale. </PARA>
<PARA> New works will be undertaken at the army's armoured centre at Puckapunyal, and improved facilities for training army officers for higher command are proposed at the Army Staff College at Queenscliff. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also proposed to construct a new building at the materials research laboratory at Maribyrnong to support advanced research and development in laser technology. </PARA>
<PARA> An important element of the defence infrastructure is housing for servicemen. Over 200 houses will be provided in Townsville, for members of the operational deployment force and 95 houses at Liverpool/Holsworthy, for members of the army's 1st task force. Some service houses which are below acceptable standards, such as at the army establishment at Woodside, South Australia, will be replaced. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures and decisions that I have so far been describing-all involving capital investments-are mostly directed towards longer term objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Some-especially in the areas of industrial capacity and defence facilities development-are specifically tailored to allow us to shift more easily to a higher level of defence preparedness should that later be judged necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Time will not permit me today to describe the multiplicity of other activities being undertaken with a similar purpose. Many of them are not especially glamorous and do not attract much attention. They concern infrastructure and manpower, especially in areas where there are long lead times for the acquisition of skills. They are, however, very important for their effect on our expansion capabilities for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> So too are the underlying planning priorities that require each new initiative to provide in Australia, managed by Australians, arrangements that will allow us to use and support our weapons in an independent force: The training schools, the ''software'' facilities, the computer-managed stock control systems, the command, control and communications systems, the joint staff training and the hundreds of other activities that could stand us in good stead should we need greater military strength and have to fight alone. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as these longer-term measures, we are lifting our levels of defence preparedness in the shorter term by a number of means. I can touch briefly, today, on but a few. </PARA>
<PARA> The activity of the defence force has been stepped up-and this will continue under provisions in the present Budget. In particular, maritime operations in our northern and western ocean approaches have been increased. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past three years there has been a significant and sustained increase in combined and joint exercises. Some 53 were conducted in 1979-80, 80 in 1980-81 and 81 are planned for 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> I should make here a brief reference to exercise Kangaroo 81, currently being conducted off the east coast of Australia and in the Shoalwater Bay training area. The exercise is the fourth in the series and some 25 ships, 100 aircraft and 20,000 ANZUS and British military personnel are involved. Kangaroo 81 is a complex and ambitious exercise which has been developed from previous exercises in the series. It will develop further our-that is, Australia's-operational doctrine and procedures for the command and control of joint and combined operations in our region. </PARA>
<PARA> We are steadily increasing the number of regular defence force personnel to support increases in activities and the manning of new equipment and to expand the training base. The estimates provide for service manpower increases of over one thousand above the level at 30 June 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The army reserve has been expanded in less than a year to reach very close to the Government's target figure of 30,000. At 1 July the figure was 29,822. I want to pay tribute to the young people of this country and also to the work of those responsible for the massive effort that was involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The task remains to round off this achievement, and to consolidate it. Appropriate provisions have been built into the defence estimates, including provision for additional modern equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also inform the House that the operational deployment force or ODF in Townsville has received the additional personnel necessary to bring it to full operations strength, including integral combat, administrative and logistic support elements. </PARA>
<PARA> The raison d'etre for the ODF is to provide the first land element of the defence force deployed in a contingency. It has completed its re-equipment program and is now organised to be transportable in the aircraft of the Australian defence force. Provisions have been built into the defence estimates for its continued development and maintanance at a high state of readiness. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of the defence program on which we have embarked will be very heavy. It will impact on every Australian. It has been necessary this year to make the largest peacetime allocation (in real terms) to defence ever made in the history of this nation-and at a time of budgetry restraint and continued prosecution of the war against inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> The effort will have to be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the period since 1976 estimated real growth in defence outlays has already averaged slightly more than three per cent per annum, as compared with an annual average real growth in total Commonwealth Budget outlays, over the same period, of slightly more than one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister announced early in 1980 that the Government had decided upon greater allocations of resources to our defences. </PARA>
<PARA> Allocation of resources is made in the context of the Budget each year. However, the Government understands the need for a stable planning base and in March 1980 I announced details of the planning basis for the five years 1980-85. It involved:</PARA>
<PARA> Defence spending of some $17,600 million (in August 1979 prices) over the five years;</PARA>
<PARA> An average annual growth rate of about 7 per cent;</PARA>
<PARA> Spending to increase to around 3 per cent of GDP by 1984-85;</PARA>
<PARA> An increase, over the five years, in the proportion of expenditure on capital investment rising to over 25 per cent by 1984-85. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1980-81 Budget provided for real growth in defence outlay of about 7 per cent including a provision towards the purchase of the new tactical fighters. </PARA>
<PARA> In the event, a number of factors, of which the most substantial was deferral of the decision on the fighter, resulted in a somewhat lower real growth of about 5.6 per cent in 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> The deferral last year of the decision on the fighter, together with difficulties in progressing other capital equipment projects, will also affect the rate of increase in expenditure in the immediate future. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus in 1981-82, the Budget provides $4,112 million for defence outlay, a real increase of 5.3 per cent over 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the obligations already entered into, mainly for capital equipment and facilities, now total $2580 million. These obligations will be further increased by the very large commitments soon to be entered into for the new tactical fighter and for other major equipment projects. </PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure in the next several years against these obligations will plainly require the allocation of resources to defence to continue to increase. If I may give but one example, on present projections a little less than $100 million will be required for the new fighters in 1981-82. The figure will increase to $400 million per year in 1983-84. That is comparable with what we spent in 1978-79 on all capital equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is resolved to sustain the long haul begun in February last year to lift our defence preparedness into a new plateau. </PARA>
<PARA> What I have announced represents a significant burden to the Australian taxpayer. I an thoroughly conscious of that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> Our circumstances and our responsibilities have changed greatly during the course of the past ten years. We have a clear commitment to fend for ourselves and to contribute to stability in our immediate region. </PARA>
<PARA> I find myself in complete agreement with that philosophic view which contends that men and women who have a preference for the estate of liberty must carry with grace the burden of protecting it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just as the Government is in something of a shambles on matters organisational this evening, as has been demonstrated, and just as it lacks credibility in that respect, it is clear that the Government has no credibility at all on defence matters. This is because of a very long history of broken promises in this area. Back in 1976, it announced a five-year program involving a 5 per cent increase in expenditure each year in real terms. In actual fact, the percentage increase has been something less than 4 per cent. Again, in that period, it was to dedicate 24 per cent of the total defence budget for spending on capital equipment but in actual fact the figure has been only approximately 15 per cent. In its most recent commitment, the Government has stated a concern to ensure something like 7 per cent in real increases each year for the next five years. But it has already failed to meet that commitment this financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I guess that the problem from now on will not be so much a failure to meet stated commitments of this kind. The problem in the future is likely to be not so much one of a defence budget limping behind targeted expenditure, as has been the case now for the last five years, but rather, in terms of the aftermath of today's statement, one of expenditure exploding out of control in a situation where there has been no substantial cost benefit analysis and an area in which a number of questions still remain unresolved so far as major procurement provisions are concerned. The decision announced today to order the FA18 over its immediate competitor the F16 is a gamble which highlights the parlous defence position we are now in. As is evident from the terms of the ministerial statement, the decision has been made without any convincing knowledge of the costs finally of the aircraft, without any convincing knowledge of the aircraft's perfomance-for example, the likely number of losses: That is to say, the attrition rate-and without any convincing assessment, most importantly, of Australia's real strategic environment and defence needs. </PARA>
<PARA> In all these respects we are completely in the dark. We are no less in the dark as a result of the ministerial statement than we were before Mr Killen rose to his feet to deliver it. Insofar as the cost question is concerned, the Government has not been able to produce any guarantees that we will not witness a repeat of the dreadful saga of the F-111. Indeed the elements are there for such a saga to be repeated. In the first place, the United States Government's foreign military sales policy requires that a purchaser pay the full commercial price at the time of delivery. Indeed, just yesterday, the Australian Financial Review reported the United States Deputy Secretary of Defence, Mr Frank Carlucci, as having assured a congressman recently that the Australian price for the FA18 would be at least as much as the United States Navy would pay for its FA18. He said that the United States will use:</PARA>
<PARA>'. . . audit assistance during the negotiation process to assure there are no subsidies and that any Australian unique costs will be charged totally to the Australian Government'. </PARA>
<PARA>He also told the congressman that the estimated total program unit cost is:</PARA>
<PARA> far in excess of the cost cited by the Australian press. </PARA>
<PARA>That latter comment of course is particularly important and certainly lends support to Labor's suspicions that we are with this particular transaction at this stage still buying a pig in a poke. Secondly, it is the case that the estimated cost of the FA18 is based on a production run of over 1,360 planes. Naturally, economies of scale in this respect are most important. Should the total number of planes be reduced, as happened in the case of the F-111, the cost of the planes that Australia buys will naturally escalate. It was reported in this morning's Australian Financial Review that the Republican Chairman of the United States Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Mark Hatfield, called for the Reagan Administration to cancel the FA18 program altogether. He dubbed the program as being, among other things, 'of dubious military value, and in many cases riddled with costs overruns'. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is a Republican. He is very close to the Reagan Administration. He knows, far better than I or someone like Senator Teague, exactly what is the thinking of the US Administration, the highest political level on these matters. The fact that those sorts of things can be said as recently as the last day or so surely makes it very doubtful indeed that we can be guaranteed as to the production run of these aeroplanes. While it certainly does not seem reasonable to make the supposition at this stage that the program will be scrapped altogether, it could very easily be scaled down. Again we have the example of the quotation on the record from US Navy Secretary Lehman who, on 20 August this year, warned that the United States Navy might cancel its FA18s if there were any further significant cost increases. He is quoted as saying somewhere: 'We may be forced to shop elsewhere'. Naturally there are unresolved questions about the FA18s. What makes those unresolved questions and the costing of them so important is the sheer magnitude of the dollars and cents involved and the competing uses, obviously, to which those dollars could be directed at the moment. The estimate by the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) in this statement of an overall cost at the moment of $2,430m appears to be, even at this stage, verifiably wrong. In December 1980 the United States estimate was $24m per aeroplane. If there is added to that what seems to be the going rule of thumb calculation-a 50 per cent sum for spares, training and so on-the figure comes out at a total $2,700m, compared to the figure of a little over $2,400m announced today. The figures start to escalate wildly once one gets into the future in inflationary dollars rather than present day dollars, but the United States Navy says that the cost per aeroplane in 1982 will be around $27.7m and that in 1984 it will be around $30m. Adding the 50 per cent component for spares and the like, we are talking already of a total cost of around $3.3 billion by 1984. That is substantially in excess of the dollar figures mentioned in the Minister's statement. This is of obvious significance to the Government's capacity to deliver not only in the defence area but also across the whole budgetary spectrum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also to be noted that the major competitors of the FA18 have been prepared to offer the Australian Government a contract which involves a fixed price for the aeroplanes, and a fixed escalation factor for inflation, neither of which seems to be built into the present calculations for the FA18. In addition, the F16 and the Panavia Tornado have been in production, as we all know, for much longer than the FA18 and the likelihood of cost escalation in respect of those two aeroplanes at this stage must now be regarded as far less. The cost of the FA18 has already risen by 20 per cent in real terms, not inflationary terms, over the life of the program. There are very real and natural fears in many responsible quarters that that escalation could continue much further. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the performance and the potential of the FA18 are great indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly do not claim to be more capable than any of my colleagues of making any substantially effective technical evaluation of the competing merits of these aeroplanes, but clearly from everything we have been told, everything objectively on the public record, it is an aeroplane with a very substantial number of plusses. At present, as we know, only 12 to 15 of them are actually flying. They are not fully operational in any air force in the world. The Canadians, who are first in line in this respect, are already becoming visibly restive. Delays are developing in the program and some aspects of that program are now running two years behind even more recent estimates. The Minister simply has not provided any hard evidence of the kind that I think can reasonably be demanded of him and of the Government when expenditure of this magnitude is being contemplated that all the kinks involved have been or will be capable of being ironed out. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, there is a precedent for the Defence Department's procurement advisors to go for state of the art technology, as it is described, without adequately considering the practical issues at stake, and with disastrous results. As recently as 8 September this year there was an article by John Stackhouse in the Bulletin entitled 'Defence Department in $200m Contract Fiasco'. This article, concerning the way the new defence communications system had gone off the rails, said that the key group of Defence Department experts had become hooked on what was described as the 'technical elegance' of the integrated switching system. They regarded technical elegance, to the exclusion of all else, as the paramount consideration. We hope simply that with precedents of that kind littering the Defence Department's landscape within recent memory, we are not confronted with a similar passionate pro-occupation with state of the art technical elegance to the exclusion of other considerations as the finally decisive consideration behind the choice of this aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps more significantly than all of that, we have not been provided with the strategic basis on which the decision to purchase these fighters was made. In the whole of my time in this Parliament I have never heard any full scale debate on what Australia's strategic situation actually is and what our defence needs really are. There is certainly nothing in the Minister's statement today which even begins to answer these questions and there is nothing in any of his other statements that I have read over recent years. For example, on what basis did we decide to increase the number of front line fighters from 25 to 75? What sort of enemy do we believe we will be fighting during the potential lifetime of these aircraft? In what circumstances do we believe that the aircraft will be used or might be used? What are the kinds of contingencies against which we are planning by the introduction of these aircraft?</PARA>
<PARA> There has not been any reassessment of which I am aware, certainly not one made publicly available, of the whole tactical fighter force program following, for example, such events of crucial international significance as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The strategic basis document simply does not address itself to these kinds of fundamental defence questions. It says nothing about our optimal defence posture, whether it should be essentially maritime, ground, unconventional, nuclear or whatever. The language of that document is grey and qualified and it can be used, as it seems to have been used by the Department of Defence, to justify the purchase of any equipment that for extrinsic reasons the key officers of the Department are minded to get behind. </PARA>
<PARA> With our obviously limited resources it does not seem to be especially desirable that all three Services should be striving after and attaining superior or state of the art-so described-capabilities. Obviously we must have the capacity to strike out from the Australian continent and, equally obviously, we need to have the ability to mobilise our resources within the continent. Just as there is a need for mobility of this kind, there is a need for industrial capacity to lie behind it. In this respect the Government decision to sell the ordnance factory at Bendigo to private enterprise is a nonsensical demonstration of the Government's failure to commit itself to serious long term planning. </PARA>
<PARA> There does need to be established a far more cost-effective approach to defence of the kind involved in the purchase of PC3 Orions or submarines, which are by all accounts very cost-effective bits of equipment and weaponry, in defending Australian territory. There does seem to be a need, which is generally accepted, for more cost-effective purchases along the lines of surface vessels of frigate standard, and tactical fighters that do not necessarily involve the kind of extravagant and, on the face of it, state of the art technology that is being striven after here with the FA18s. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these are questions upon which reasonable men and women can undoubtedly differ. They are all matters which it is ridiculously superficial in many ways to be endeavouring to touch upon, even in this preliminary reply to the Minister's statement. The only reason that makes me mention these matters is that there is little evidence on the face of this statement, last year's major defence statement or the one which was made back in 1976, that the Government has seriously thought about these issues. If it has thought about them it has not shared its understanding and its thinking with the Parliament and the Australian people. Instead it simply seems to be enamoured of the kind of knee-jerk option, the knee-jerk approach that throwing money at defence-it might almost be described as the Reagan approach-will solve our problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's statement describes the defence allocation that is proposed with the purchase of the FA18s and the other equipment as set out, as being the largest peace time allocation to defence in real terms that has ever been made in the history of our nation. Those of us who have seen this Government time and time again skate away from its undertakings on defence will believe all this when we see it. More disturbingly, the increased spending is not accompanied by any indication on the Government's part of what its defence priorities and actual aims are. Some of the planes which the Government was offered were better dog-fighters. Others were better at interception. We have not been told-if indeed it has ever been a matter for Government decision-what criteria are ultimately appropriate to judge these alternative and other relevant skills. The only thing that does appear to have happened in this regard is that the Department of Defence used some kind of pea and thimble trick-the technical details of which remain undisclosed-to eliminate, firstly, the Panavia Tornado by saying that we needed to have a dog-fighter and then, secondly, eliminating the Mirage and the F16 on the basis that a strike capacity was more important in Australia than a dog-fighting capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years we have witnessed a history in the Department of Defence of neglect and bungling. On the one hand, purchases have been delayed. It has been suggested that already we are in difficult circumstances as a result of that. We know that the Mirage is now subject to severe and worsening fatigue problems and that its avionics are now museum pieces. It has been alleged that in some years-in the middle of the 1980s-we will be lacking any tactical air defence worthy of that name. On the other hand, we are not persuaded that the issues are any nearer to resolution as a result of the Government's delay. We believe the decision should not be made on these issues until all the various matters to which I have referred tonight-necessarily superficially and only in outline-are resolved. The Australian public cannot be expected to dig ever deeper to support a massive program of expenditure of this kind unless it can be satisfied, and unless we in this Parliament can be satisfied, that the issues of cost and strategic effectiveness-above all else, strategic effectiveness-have been resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> Alternative aircraft are still available to the Government. The Australian Labor Party is not in a position to endorse one of these options rather than the other. At least it is obvious that there are still serious alternatives. It remains a very real question as to whether the decision should have been made at the time despite all the delays in which the Government has engaged in the past in it re-equipment program. Nonetheless, this is the big one and this is the one on which the Government ought not to have moved in the direction it has moved with the FA18 unless it was absolutely sure that in every critical respect it was overwhelmingly superior to its competitors. It is not obvious even now that that is so. It is not obvious from the terms of the ministerial statement. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the F16 aircraft, the cost estimate at $1,027m for the planes and 50 per cent for the spares, training and so on component, makes an all-up cost of $1,541m. That is half the cost of the FA18, which is not the percentage as suggested in the ministerial statement. At this sort of cost we could buy, it seems, something like twice as many F16s. The comparative attrition rate becomes far less significant under those circumstances than it has been claimed to be. It seems to be generally accepted that the aircraft has a formidable strike capacity. As a result of its undergoing the multinational staged improvement program, it will soon meet all the demands that the Royal Australian Air Force may reasonably make of it. The Panavia Tornado remains a viable contender in the event that the FA18 proves to go down the plug hole either in terms of utterly unacceptable cost escalation or for some other reason. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) has received a telex to the effect that the whole program could be achieved for a sum of $1,508m at January 1981 prices. That is a fly-away price of something like only $15m per plane. As we all know, that is a technologically advanced aircraft. The comparative cost of that aircraft has certainly been reduced vis a vis its competitors since the Department of Defence scrubbed that proposal at the end of 1978. We are told by the experts that in its F2 version it is not such a good dog-fighter as its competitors, but it is an effective interceptor which, it can be argued, is more important in Australia's circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The FA18 may still prove to be a better plane by all the relevant criteria that again I have been trying to spell out. As things stand, we can scarcely be assured that this is so. We can scarcely be confident in being asked, as a Parliament, to approve and endorse this purchase without more information and more satisfaction being given along the lines that I have described. The Government has approved in this statement a total expenditure of something like $10 billion, which is equivalent to 16 years of expenditure at the present rate. There is no indication in this statement that this has been done on an adequate basis which will prove defensible as the years roll on. There is no basis for supposing, on the terms of the ministerial statement, that our chickens simply will not come home to roost in the way they have so often and unfortunately done in the defence area in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I disagree with a good deal of what Senator Evans said at the beginning of his speech, which is not entirely unusual. I wonder whether he could have perceived at last that the coin may have dropped into the machine, as far as the Government is concerned, and that the Government may be beginning to appreciate in some dim sort of way that we may have to defend this country ourselves at some time and it is important that we should think about how we will do it, especially in conditions where we know, regarding this episode of a 17-year-old drama about a fighter replacement, how long it takes the Government to get around to obtaining this sort of material. I think the Government is now beginning to realise that there is not automatically a big powerful daddy who will hold our hand and lead us on safely through the perils of this world. The decision to buy 75 highly sophisticated aircraft is a practical expression, perhaps the first practical expression, of this new view. It is expressed in the first page of the statement of the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) where he says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If our force is called upon to defend this country or its interests, it may have to do so alone, not as part of a larger allied force having the range of capabilities possible with a mixture of aircraft. We therefore sought an aircraft versatile in several roles, against both air and surface targets, in all weather conditions. We could not favour an aircraft because of its excellence in any one particular quality. </PARA>
<PARA>I was heartened to hear those remarks because now, in spite of its great cost, we have in the F18 Hornet a weapon which is designed to defend this country, in combination with other forces-I will go on to that a little later-against any kind of attack or invasion on it. This is definitely a change in the Government's views as expressed over the last few years, especially in the naval area. I have complained before about the pop-gun Navy and the way we have built a first class small warship of the Fremantle class. I have been aboard HMAS Fremantle, have looked at her and have discussed the ship with various people who know much more about it than I do. They say that it is a first class small warship. </PARA>
<PARA> We have given the ship a main armament of one World War II type Bofors gun. I am assured that if the vessel is attacking upwind in a slight chop, that gun cannot even be fired to put a shot across the bows of a Taiwanese fishing boat. Those Bofors guns at one stage many decades ago had a proper place on the flight decks of strike aircraft carriers. They certainly have no place on the foredecks of our rather expensive small warships. They are patrol vessels of a type used everywhere else in the world to carry missiles as missile attack ships. Of course, our ships should be used in that role too. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we have hope that the Government possibly is getting its eye on the ball. We hope that it will now be consistent, that it will tidy up the Fremantle class and make sure that later ships in that class which are built in Cairns have the potential to be converted to missile capability quickly. I know they have the space within them. I have had pointed out to me the actual space where hardware could go. But it is necessary, as the ships are built, for them to have the wiring channels and so on in them. Of course, it would be far better if they were organised for a ship to ship missile like Exocet right from the start. I have hopes that the Government might even do that. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us forget all this nonsense about a short-deck aircraft carrier at great expense and with some vague anti-submarine function which it could not even perform very well. It could not perform it very well up to the time when it was knocked off by a much faster attack submarine or something of that sort. There is no way in the world that the World War II idea of having a short deck aircraft carrier will work any more. Goodness knows what it is going to do, anyway. It would need a complex screeen of other vessels around it to try to protect it. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot understand why we are going to the enormous expense of creating this monster which will have jump-jet aircraft on it. Their main idea-this is certainly the case with the British class-will be to defend the carrier itself. If there were not a carrier, there would not even be a need for them. Helicopters would be needed on it which are not as suitable or efficient as many other airborne systems of anti-submarine surveillance and attack which we have. Where the helicopters go after the carrier has sunk the naval planners have not deigned to tell us yet. It is a very interesting question. Presumably they will go into the sea with the crew of the carrier and everything else. It is a disastrous thought. It would be an absolute disaster of the first magnitude and it should be recognised as such. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us instead get the naval equivalent of the F18 aircraft which is available to us. By that I mean the fast missile attack ships, preferably hydrofoils, which have an efficient co-ordinated missile capability-harpoon missiles. It is a fact that there are such ships, which I have mentioned before-the Pegasus class-although I am by no means sold on that vessel. At least it carries eight harpoon missiles on light-weight launchers. A group of those in fact would be the naval equivalent of the F18. They would carry out the same kind of role. Indeed, they could work in with what we are aiming at with the F18s. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government wants the F18, we go along with that. They are terribly expensive. We could argue all night about whether we should have that aircraft or something else. If we are to get that aircraft I think we are at least working along the right lines. But for heaven's sake, let us also try to get our naval capability enhanced and get whatever else we might be able to get so that the Navy can fulfil the same role as other forces. We might even consider repairing and patching up a few Leopard tanks and moving them from Puckapunyal to Darwin. It would take a long time to get them there. We will not be able to get them there when an enemy is attacking us. That is a place for a tank force, if it is to be anywhere. It should be placed where it can attack an invader. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the F18. The Government has selected it on the ground of versatility. It believes the attrition rate will be lower for the FA18, presumably on the basis that it has two engines. That is a respectable argument. We agree with it. The Canadians came to a similar conclusion and they chose the F18 for the same reason. It is almost impossible to assess what the cost will be in the long run. One can pick any figure out of the air up to $4 billion by the time we eventually get these aircraft. If we want to go into the defence business and we want to be able to defend the country, that is part of the cost. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to raise one matter at this stage. There was a report in the Australian this morning that the Government at long last apparently will go ahead with the jet trainer. It has announced the formation of a new company, the Australian Aircraft Consortium, to be owned equally by the Government Aircraft Factory, Hawker de Havilland Australia and the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation. The article states that the turbo-prop trainer which has been designed in Australia:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . will be the first aircraft for more than 20 years to be designed in Australia specifically for defence purposes and the first local design project since the civil-military Nomad. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope these reports show that the Government has come to the conclusion that we need an aircraft industry in Australia. It has to start somewhere. We obviously cannot produce sophisticated aircraft such as the F18. The industry has its values and it is time that we got one started again. </PARA>
<PARA> A few questions were not addressed in the speech but I take it that they will be tidied up in time. One question is whether the FA18s will be equipped for in-flight refuelling. Their range without that refuelling capability, especially in the strike mode, is nothing to write home about. I gather that some elaboration will be made on that point by the Government. Has the aircraft been tested with the harpoon missile? Will there be any difficulties in using harpoon air-to-surface missiles with the aircraft? That will be the background of our anti-shipping capability in the indefinite future. </PARA>
<PARA> The offset capability is a little interesting too. We are told that 30 per cent of the imported cost of the aircraft will be offset to Australian industry and that there will be compensation provisions if the United States contractors fail to honour their commitments. That is something the Australian Democrats will certainly be watching very catefully. We think this is very important, not merely so that it can be loot in the hands of the Australian industry but because, obviously, it is important to the building up and development of our own aircraft construction industry that that exists. I hope that we do not see huge increases in the price and find that the offset has been set at a certain figure and remains at that level. Let us hope that the 30 per cent level can be maintained one way or the other through the program. </PARA>
<PARA> The purchase of 10 new P3C aircraft to replace the P3B Orions now in service has been mentioned in the statement. That is a good move too. Again we ask whether there will be any industrial offsets for this purchase because no reference is made in the speech to offsets for that program. Possibly the Minister can enlighten us on that point at some stage. </PARA>

<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>NEW RIVER MURRAY WATERS AGREEMENT</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to inform the Senate that the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia have endorsed a draft of a new River Murray Waters Agreement. This was the outcome of a meeting which the Prime Minister and I attended last Friday in Melbourne, together with the three respective Premiers and their water resources Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister and Premiers have agreed that the draft new Agreement now be referred to the Crown Law advisers of the four governments with a view to the early introduction of the necessary legislation. In the meantime, the River Murray Commission has been authorised to operate fully within the terms of the new Agreement, pending completion of the necessary legislative action. </PARA>
<PARA> The draft new Agreement is the result of the first major review of the Agreement signed in 1914. It is now proposed to expand the responsibilities of the River Murray Commission to include water quality in addition to the responsibilities it now has for water quantity in the main stem of the river and associated storages. At the same time, the Agreement is being updated to make it more relevant to present day requirements by giving the River Murray Commission responsibilities in regard to other water management objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the proposed new Agreement, the River Murray Commission will be authorised to formulate river water quality objectives or standards, as appropriate, for various locations on the river. State authorities will be required to inform the Commission of all proposals under their consideration which could significantly affect water quality and quantity in the river and provide the necessary information to permit an assessment of their likely impact. Obviously, the agreed water quality objectives will be of central relevance to such an assessment. The Commission will be empowered to make representations as necessary to the appropriate State authority on such proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the water distribution provisions of the new Agreement will enable account to be taken of the quality of the inflows of tributaries and man-made outfalls in assessing the credits of the States in the Commission's water accounting procedures. Rules are to be drawn up for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> As in every river system, water quality in the River Murray is the end product of numerous activities which take place in the catchment-in irrigation, dryland agriculture, processing industries, urban centres, forestry, et cetera. These are all State responsibilities. There is no intention of the River Murray Commission having a regulatory function, the power of sanctions in regard to these matters or the right to interfere in the States' affairs. The new arrangements aim at a joint assessment of all relevant water and land use and other factors significantly affecting water quality. This is consistent with the development of river management strategies where a river and its catchment fall within the responsibility of a single government. </PARA>
<PARA> While in this regard the River Murray Commission will have only the power of persuasion, its representations will be based on mutually agreed water quality objectives or standards, and on an ever increasing body of knowledge of the river system and its problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Subject to the new water quality provisions, the current water sharing principles and arrangements between the three States will continue. South Australia will be entitled to 1.85 million megalitres annually as measured at the South Australian border in accordance with specified monthly volumes. This includes the recent 23 per cent increase made possible by the completion of Dartmouth Dam. The two upper States will share the balance of the water resources available to the River Murray Commission, but with some flexibility to cope with year-to-year pressures in water demands. </PARA>
<PARA> While the River Murray Waters Agreement is, and will continue to remain, the main policy instrument for the Commonwealth's involvement with the three States in the management of the nation's most important water resource, considerable financial assistance has been provided to the three States for those salinity control and drainage works in the Murray Valley which fall outside the area of the Commission's responsibilities. These are all priority works recommended by Consulting Engineers, Maunsell and Partners, in the plan of action they proposed in their 1979 report on salinity and drainage problems in the Murray Valley. </PARA>
<PARA> By the end of this financial year, we will have provided about $18 million in grants to the cost of underground and surface saline water drainage works on a $ for $ basis with the three States-a total of $36 million. Together, we are well advanced in the implementation of urgent works identified in the Maunsell plan of action. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the view of this government that, before any decisions are contemplated regarding a follow-up to the implementation of the plan of action, time must be allowed for the accumulation and assessment of vital information arising from the three important recent joint Commonwealth/States initiatives. We need to know the effectiveness of the new water quality responsibilities now proposed for the River Murray Commission, the full operational impact of Dartmouth Dam and the efficiency of salinity control projects already completed, or under construction. Subject to this review, we will give careful consideration to new salinity control projects in accordance with priorities identified by the States in conjunction with the River Murray Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Basic data for this purpose is already being gathered. The Commission has now established a water quality monitoring network along the river to record salinity and other key parameters and consultants are being engaged shortly to develop a mathematical computer model to simulate the operation of the river system, not only in terms of river flows and storage changes, but also in terms of river water quality. This model should be an invaluable instrument in the development and operation of long-term strategies to reduce salinity in the river system to manageable proportions, and all efforts are being made to ensure its early completion. </PARA>
<PARA> There are already signs that recent initiatives by the four governments are gradually becoming effective. Water quality recordings by the River Murray Commission during last season's severe drought indicated that salinity levels were lower than in previous comparable dry periods. This comparative improvement has been attributed to the initial operations of Dartmouth Dam-now about two-thirds full-and the effectiveness of already completed salinity control works. High river flows resulting from heavy winter rains and snow-melt are having a very beneficial flushing effect on the river system, and adequate water supplies of good quality should be available next season. </PARA>
<PARA> It is recognised throughout the world where irrigation has induced salinity problems, that techniques which reduce the application of water surplus to plant requirements are essential to the success of any long-term strategy to bring the problem under control. Amendments in May and December 1980 to the Income Tax Assessment Act now provide strong incentives to irrigators to improve their watering practices. The new provisions of the Act allow full deductibility of expenditures for income tax assessment purposes on water conservation and conveyance, salinity control and associated drainage works in the same year as they are incurred. We understand that these incentives are now starting to become effective. </PARA>
<PARA> However, a better definition of the magnitude of the problem is required, and the four governments agreed last Friday that a Commonwealth/States working group should review the extent to which irrigators are adopting improved irrigation practices and assess the possible need for additional incentives. It is clear that without complementary preventative measures at the farm level, initiatives by the four governments in the fight against salinity will be impaired. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is mindful of South Australia's specific problems with River Murray water quality-particularly during prolonged periods of minimum river flow conditions. To some extent, these problems originate outside the State. In relation to drinking water, there is the additional problem of turbidity caused by the presence of suspended soil particles and organic material, which reflect run-off conditions in the vast catchment including parts of Queensland. Commonwealth financial assistance, already reaching $40 million, is enabling South Australia to build a water filtration scheme for metropolitan Adelaide. Two filtration installations are already operational. The scheme, when completed, will contribute significantly to an improvement in the colour and taste of drinking water from the Murray integrated into Adelaide's water supplies. </PARA>
<PARA> The River Murray Waters Agreement has worked to the advantage of all three States for over 60 years. Admittedly, managing the river for water quantity is far less demanding than taking account also of water quality, having regard particularly to the constitutional role of the States in practically all aspects of water and land use which affect river water quality. We do not underestimate the difficulties and complex issues which lie ahead. But with goodwill on the part of all concerned and a determination to make the proposed new River Murray Waters Agreement work, the long-term environmental health of the river and the economic well-being of the numerous urban centres and vast irrigation settlements in the Murray Valley can be assured. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Agreement recorded in this document, which was tabled in the House of Representatives earlier today, represents a big advance in relation to the approach of governments to the problems of the Murray River. It is a matter with which I have been concerned for some time. It is one of my rare achievements in politics that I actually received the plaudits of the Premier of South Australia in relation to comments I have made about this issue. I think it is unlikely that we can expect an agreement between the State governments and the Commonwealth Government to give sanctions to the River Murray Waters Agreement because that would involve a diminution of State and Commonwealth sovereignty. The major point in this statement is the inclusion of water quality as well as quantity responsibilities. Of course, that is very important to the citizens of Adelaide particularly. The River Murray Commission will be empowered under the Agreement to formulate objectives or standards for quality and these are very badly needed, particularly throughout South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Several things about the statement still give some cause for concern. Firstly, the Agreement apparently refers only to 'the main stem' of the river. Those are the words used in the statement. By that it excludes the tributaries of the Murray River and it does not deal with the Murray River system as such. It deals only with what it calls the stem of the Murray River, which in my view excludes the tributaries. This is a problem, although it is to be hoped that co-operation between State authorities will mean that standards can be arrived at for the tributaries of the Murray which are consistent with the standards which the Government will be seeking under this Agreement in respect of the main stem of the river. </PARA>
<PARA> There is some disquiet amongst farmers and others near the evaporation basins, in Victoria particularly, that putting large quantities of salty water into these areas eventually will degrade land nearby. It is another problem about which scientists-and particularly scientists acting in an unco-ordinated way in terms of their responsibilities-perhaps do not yet know enough about. It is up to the State authorities to establish that this is not so or to arrive at satisfactory land use policies, particularly policies for land use adjacent to the river and in the areas contingent to the river where salty water presumably would be stored. </PARA>
<PARA> The solution of the Murray basin problems appears to go forward in leaps and bounds by a series of consultants' reports. On the bases of the sorts of reports which have been given, I would say these consultants have done a very good job in respect of the problems. But the River Murray Commission should be technically equipped with proper legislative backing to work continually on the amelioration of problems in river management. It should be developed as a body with a truly national outlook. The River Murray system is a great national resource. Perhaps some of the problem has been alleviated by heavy rainfall this winter in the catchment areas. It still remains a cause of continuing concern that the administration of a national resource and the planning for the development of such a national resource should be in the hands of what is perhaps a weak body where State representatives appear as State representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The task in connection with the use of the Murray will require engineering, economic and scientific competence and probably some diplomatic skill. In time a task force of the nature of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority may be required to grapple adequately with the problems which cover those broad areas of engineering, economic expertise and scientific competence and to ensure that the parties to the Agreement are not, as it were, State representatives but are genuinely concerned with the administration of a national resource. One would hope that, arising from the Agreement, some attempt would be made to formulate time scales for achieving the quality standards to which the statement refers. The injection of the notion of quality standards is something, as I said, which is very much to be commended but, if those quality standards are not subject to time scales for achievement, there may be little satisfaction with the way in which the problem is being handled. </PARA>
<PARA> Some time ago, the Opposition proposed in the House of Representatives-a private member's Bill has been introduced into the Senate for the same purpose-the establishment of an Institute of Freshwater Studies. In a continent the size of Australia, with water having been a recognised national problem for a very long time, we think it is high time that the expertise which is available to this country in the various disciplines which I have mentioned be brought together in a cross-disciplinary way to tackle on a national level the problems of the provision of an adequate supply of fresh water and the question of water quality. This would appropriately be done in such an institute. We believe this is still needed and we will be proceeding with a private member's Bill in relation to the establishment of such an institute. At the appropriate time we will be commending it to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a South Australian, it is something of a compulsion for me to make a few comments about any report, any piece of legislation or anything at all that comes into the Senate in regard to the River Murray. Unfortunately, I do not think that my comments on the new River Murray Waters Agreement will be nearly as laudatory as those of Senator Button. In fact, most of what I have to say will not approve at all of this statement. Before I make the comments, I stress that I hope that what I say will be proved wrong not just in the long term but also in the short term. Nevertheless, the points have to be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The new River Murray Waters Agreement is the result of a meeting between the Commonwealth Government and the governments of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia; that is, between the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Premiers of those three States. We have in the Federal sphere and in Victoria and South Australia Liberal governments, at least for the time being, and again at least for the time being in New South Wales a Labor Government is in office. It seems fairly incredible to a rather cynical soul like me that three States of different political persuasions and a Federal government could have come so quickly to an agreement on a water source which has been, far from the source of water for South Australia, the source of disagreement between those States and the Commonwealth for a great many years. </PARA>
<PARA> From a close look at the statement, it is hardly surprising that those three State Premiers and the Prime Minister of Australia were able to come to such an apparently amicable agreement. The fact is that there are no teeth in this Agreement at all. The statement points out in paragraph three on page one that the new draft is the first major review of the Agreement since 1914. That, in itself, is an indictment of State and Federal government attitudes to the problem. It should have come to some sort of review a lot sooner than this. I can recall saying as long ago as 1978 that South Australia's water required chewing 32 times before being swallowed. Senator Macklin can smirk but his State does not have the sort of water that we have. It is not even opaque. </PARA>
<PARA> This statement recommends that the responsibilities of the River Murray Commission be expanded to incorporate water quality as well as water quantity. This was a subject that was hardly likely to interest our founding fathers or the people who were looking at the problems of water distribution from the Murray in 1914 since quality was not even considered to be a matter warranting any sort of legislation. Neither the population nor the sort of water usage at the time warranted it and certainly the technology of the day did not presage the sorts of events and usage that we now have. So it is good to see the statement incorporates into the Agreement what it terms as present day requirements by giving the River Murray Commission responsibility in regard to water management objectives other than simply quantity. </PARA>
<PARA> It will formulate river water quality objectives or standards, as appropriate, for particular locations on the river. So it should because I contend that what South Australia has had to put up with over the last couple of decades is nothing short of water piracy. Page 2 of the statement says that the Commission will be empowered to make representations as necessary to the appropriate State authority on the proposals mentioned earlier in that paragraph. One's first thought when reading that is to ask 'Will they be binding?' The answer to the question comes two paragraphs further on where, having pointed out that numerous activities are taking place in water catchment areas-irrigation, dryland agriculture, processing industries, et cetera-the statement blandly and calmly states:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no intention of the River Murray Commission having a regulatory function, the power of sanctions in regard to these matters or the right to interfere in the State's affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>It is nothing more than a toothless tiger whose only power is in the power of persuasion. Its representations will be based on 'mutually agreed water quality objectives or standards'. I ask: How on earth can anybody expect State and Federal governments with different aims, different ambitions and different political colourings to come to any sort of mutual agreement, much less over their major waterway? It is hardly likely that one State government will voluntarily agree to a politically unpopular move-for instance, a measure to limit irrigation licences or other sorts of water restrictions-simply to adopt what Senator Evans persists in calling a spirit of co-operation and friendship with another State government of a different political persuasion. It would be political suicide. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1914 politics were slightly more gentlemanly than they are today. Any increase in water for South Australia is absolutely useless if the commodity is not potable; if it is in effect not only not drinkable but also not usable for agriculture and irrigation purposes. The only solutions that this statement puts forward, and I commend it for at least doing something, are short term, wrong-ended ones. At the moment it is being forced to look at the situation and provide some sort of financial assistance for salinity control and drainage works in the Murray Valley. That, of course, is commendable. It is, unfortunately, not a solution to the problem but a cure of something. The two are not necessarily synonymous, particularly where the River Murray is concerned. If they are not wrong-end solutions or attempts to mend fences, they are long term ones. On page 4 the statement says that time must be allowed. I emphasise the word 'time'. I just wonder how much longer South Australia must wait for time to be allowed for things to be sorted out, for vital information to be accumulated and assessed, before we get some sort of concrete solution. Perhaps I should not use the word 'concrete', given the magnitude of the pollution of the river at the moment. The statement says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We need to know the effectiveness of the new water quality responsibilities now proposed for the River Murray Commission, the full operational impact of the Dartmouth Dam and the efficiency of salinity control . . . </PARA>
<PARA>My contention is that we need to do and to know more than that. We need to know that there will be genuine co-operation between governments, genuine concern not just for their own short term political benefits but for the general welfare of the State at the wrong end of this river. At the moment we are being forced to depend on climatic good luck. On page 5 the statement makes the point that we are very fortunate that, despite last season's severe drought, the salinity levels at the moment are lower than those in previous comparable dry periods and that there is expected to be a very beneficial flushing effect due to the heavy winter rains, and so on. But those are fortuitous circumstances, unless somebody is going to try to tell us that at last governments control the weather. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 6 the statement points out that some attempts have been made to offset the damage being done to the river's quality by irrigation because in May and December 1980 amendments were made to the Income Tax Assessment Act to provide incentives to irrigators. This is terrific news. But it is not enough to have an incentive such as that simply to offset another abuse. Finally, at the bottom of page 6, South Australia rates a particular mention, being the recipient of the thin edge of the wedge. The statement states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is mindful of South Australia's specific problems with River Murray water quality-particularly during prolonged periods of minimum river flow conditions. To some extent, these problems originate outside the State. </PARA>
<PARA>I know a large number of people in South Australia's Riverland who would attribute all of the problems in the water that gets to them as originating outside the State. Certainly it gets worse as it goes on. The fact of the matter is that we have fruit trees dying off, we have people becoming bankrupt, and most South Australians are unable to drink the water simply because of what starts before the water even gets to our border. A more incredible statement, however, appears on page 7 of the statement. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The River Murray Waters Agreement has worked to the advantage of all three States for over 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA>I am wondering which three States it is concerned about here. The RMWA has not worked to the advantage of South Australia in the past 60 years, certainly not over the past decade. We have had most appalling water in South Australia for as long as I can remember and it has been, to a certain extent, because the agreement has never had incorporated in it the element of quality control. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA> We do not underestimate the difficulties and complex issues which lie ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>That somewhat understates the matter-</PARA>
<PARA> But with goodwill on the part of all concerned and a determination to make the proposed new River Murray Waters Agreement work, the long-term environmental health of the river and the economic well-being of the numerous urban centres and vast irrigation settlements in the Murray Valley can be assured. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think we will get that goodwill. I do not think it will come from this statement although, as I said at the beginning of my speech, I hope more than anything for which I have hoped for a long time that my comments on this matter will be proven wrong. To me this statement is little more than a series of pious platitudes. It does nothing to ensure that the upstream States give South Australia good quality water as of right. It does nothing to move in the short term for an improvement, certainly not for a drastic improvement, in the quality of a waterway which is rapidly approaching roadway status. It makes some attempt to solve the problem at the wrong end of the river by providing funds for salination control and so on. For that I do give it credit. Nevertheless, as far as South Australia is concerned, I am unable to do anything else but reject and resent the rather glib long-term solution proffered in this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems of the River Murray can never be solved, as I am sure you are aware, Mr President, by a gentlemen's agreement in a political situation in Australia in which gentlemen's agreements no longer apply. There is no longer any place for them in Australian politics. It seems to me that this is a grandstanding exercise on behalf of all three State governments and the Prime Minister. I hope I am not being excessively harsh in saying that. They are going to be able to get up and claim kudos for endorsing this Agreement. The resulting headlines will, I daresay, do each of them some good and I guess that will achieve their short term aims. But it will not do anything in the short term that is positive for South Australia's water. The last paragraph on page 2 of this statement makes this perfectly clear. Unless and until some more positive solution is found, South Australia will continue to suffer from the selfishness and the thoughtlessness of actions in other States. I would have thought that more positive action could come through the Prime Minister's much vaunted co-operative federalism scheme. The States concerned could voluntarily relinquish to the Federal Government their powers over the River Murray. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a plea to Senator Baume, as Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman), in relation to the industrial future of 11 Commonwealth watchmen who are employed by the Commonwealth and deployed at either Chifley Square, the Grace Building, the Plaza or at an address in Goulburn Street, Sydney. As Senator Baume will appreciate, my argument is based on my experience-which he will endorse-of the service that these men have given over a number of years at the Commonwealth Centre.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that, as a by-product of the operations of the razor gang, it is proposed to terminate the services of these men in the very near future. They are thus faced with a rather dismal prospect. One alternative for them is to take a chance and join the appropriate private security organisation that is to take over their work, with the possible fate that within several weeks they could be axed from their employment. To digress for a moment, I ask the Minister to consider the industrial relations inferno that develops in regard to some of these private security operations. For instance, at the Black Mountain Tower, when one contractor took over from another, we witnessed rival groups in conflict. They were all members of the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union of Australia, but the question that arose was who would be retained and who would not. I would not like that situation to develop in metropolitan Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, in developing this theme, may I say that we had introduced in the Senate today the Judges' Pensions Amendment Bill, which is an attempt to resolve a judicial dilemma which confronts the Government. I do not propose to canvass the issues concerning that legislation, but all of these watchmen have seen service in World War II in either the Australian Defence Force or the allied armies. However, only one of them pays into the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund. Therefore, if they accept the rather dubious future that is presented by employment with the private operator they could be axed at any time. Conversely, all that they appear to have been offered so far is their final salary and any long service leave entitlements that may have accrued. I mention now an aspect which gives me a great deal of worry. I understand that there is a slender opportunity that the Public Service Board might find the watchmen alternative employment, but the thrust of my argument is that if their future in that regard is barren I would hope that the Commonwealth Government would make some gesture by way of providing adequate severence payments. Even some of the very skimpy, vulnerable industries, after trade union agitation have accepted the concept of severance pay. </PARA>
<PARA> I am speaking from notes that were prepared a day or so ago, but I understand that the representatives of the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union of Australia have had talks with senior officers of the Department of Administrative Services on the matter. When we urge private enterprise to provide adequate severance pay we should follow suit. We have only to consider the protracted dispute that occurred at the premises of General Motors-Holden's Pty Ltd in New South Wales at Pagewood, and one or two other private enterprises, and the fact that ultimately the unions were given severance pay. I regard that as a fall-back type of action and continue to hope that the Minister will exercise his responsibility and indicate that the Public Service Board will provide continuity of employment for these watchmen, even if that be at another site. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to issue a note of warning. The Commonwealth Centre is a building that Senator Baume, I and other honourable senators, must use at all hours, often on the run. I think the Minister will agree that the tact, blended with firmness, that is displayed by the present watchmen is not something that is acquired overnight. On the contrary, I fear the consequences if the building is to be guarded by some of these private security operators. Some of them may be all right, but their employees seem to gravitate from job to job. They sometimes have employees who cannot meet the requirements that are expected of officers of the ordinary State or Federal law authorities. Some of those employees, to say the least, have idiosyncracies. </PARA>
<PARA> I also fear that if Pritchards, which operates a security and cleaning service, is to have a monopoly, we will have to consider a situation about which we have to be very vigilant at the moment. On numerous occasions in my presence this particular cleaning firm has compressed the span of the working hours from five to three. The excessive speed thus employed has meant that it has had the temerity to endeavour to get security employees to stop all of the lifts at one time so that it can mount a mass cleaning attack. Only the vigilance of the watchmen employed by the Commonwealth Government has prevented that from happening. If Pritchards is to be given a monopoly of both cleaning and security, you will not find its security officers telling their fellow employees to clean the lifts section by section, as happens now. That is just one of the possible spin-offs of such an arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> I am always sceptical about some aspects of security. When John Howard, the Treasurer, had an office adjacent to mine on the twelfth floor of the Commonwealth building, although he certainly did not keep his Budget papers there, extra security gadgets were installed. I did not object to that. However, when you enter the building on some Sundays you realise that the system does not work too effectively. I am too chivalrous to refer to the staff of some other parties-not socialists-who have also had problems with the so-called security apparatus. The Minister will know to whom I refer. I would be very curious to know whether the employees of private security agencies receive a Federal Police or Australian Security Intelligence Organisation clearance. The present watchmen should be given severance pay, if not suitable alternative employment. Their record, both in the Defence Force, or allied forces, and subsequently, shows that they are people you can trust. If their continuity of employment at the Commonwealth building is broken it may be possible to plant people, for all kinds of dubious purposes, among those who take their place. I am not referring to espionage groups from overseas but to other skulduggery that at times is indulged in by media elements-certainly a minority-to obtain scoops. In short, the way to reduce efficiency is to dispense with the watchmen to whom I refer. I might also note the significant fact that the Pritchard cleaning-cum-security service seems to bear a charmed life. If honourable senators will refer to the Senate Hansard record of the proceedings of Estimates Committee A on Monday, 21 September, they will note that I asked Mr Linehan of the Industrial Relations Bureau whether the IRB checked the time sheets of the people employed in Commonwealth Government offices in Sydney. Mr Linehan, to say the least, was very vague. He said that he did not think so; he did not know how often it had been done but he would see what the score was. That was on 21 September. I know that the resources of the Industrial Relations Bureau are homing in on the Builders Labourers Federation but I still think that I could be given an answer in a reasonable time. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat two pleas. Firstly, I would like the status quo of these watchmen to be preserved. If it is not to be preserved, I would like to believe that these men, who have given excellent service, would receive adequate recognition. They are the kind of people who sometimes, when their colleagues have been ill, have been prepared to work more than the customary eight or ten hours in order to keep security in operation. If it is good enough to give Mr Justice Marks protection in view of the dilemma in which, at the top, he finds himself, it is good enough for these 11 watchmen-if we are to talk about having an egalitarian society-to be given similar recognition. I will leave the matter with the Minister on that basis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity to place on record in the Senate the birth of a new socialist government in the world. I refer to the birth of the PASOK Government of Andreas Papandreou in Greece. It was only seven years ago that the Greek people were living under a junta. The junta was United States inspired and Central Intelligence Agency operated in conjunction with internal intelligence sources. It was a junta that worked to the detriment of the interests of the Greek people. It did that in many ways. It worked to deprive them of their sovereignty and independence. It worked to ensure that Greece played an obsequious role in world affairs. It worked to deprive them of their liberty. In fact, the Western world was rather amused by the fact that in 1974 the Greek people could not listen to the music of Theodorakis or enjoy the writings of Theodorakis and other great Greek literary figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The middle of 1974 saw the fall of the junta. It saw the election of a new government, but a government that was very much a right wing government, aligned with once again and propped up by the security forces. At that 1974 election the New Democracy Party of the then Prime Minister Karamanlis polled over 54 per cent of the vote. That election also saw the birth of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement-the PASOK party. In 1974 that party polled 13.6 per cent of the vote. The emergence of PASOK has continued since 1974 and in the 1977 election it almost doubled its vote to about 26 per cent. At that election the vote of the New Democracy Party fell. However, it managed to maintain sufficient seats in the 300-member parliament to retain government. </PARA>
<PARA> The election of 18 October, just three days ago, saw once again a doubling of the vote for PASOK-a vote which now stands somewhere in the vicinity of 48 per cent. At the same time the Moscow aligned Communist Party has managed to maintain and increase its vote. All in all, the election of two days ago has meant a clear mandate for reform and radical changes in Greece. It has ensured for the first time in recent Greek history that a left wing socialist government has an absolute majority of seats in the Greek Parliament. PASOK now has 175 seats out of 300 seats and can govern in its own right. The main proponent of PASOK, the person who gave PASOK birth, was Andreas Papandreou. At the moment he is 62 years of age and he has been involved to a large extent in recent Greek history. He is a doctor of economics. He has in fact instructed at the Harvard School of Economics. His involvement in Greek economics has included both Guggenheim and Fulbright fellowships. He was also asked in 1964 to establish a Greek centre for economic research. He has an adequate and quite good knowledge of the Greek economic system. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1964 he stood for a seat in parliament. He in fact won a seat as a member of the Greek Centre Union Government, a government in which his father was Prime Minister and in which he was a prominent member and a prominent Minister. That Government did not last long. In fact, the first coup to befall Greece in the 1960s came in 1965 when the King deposed the democratically elected government, a government which had been elected with the support of 53 per cent of the Greek people, and replaced it with puppet governments for almost two years. In the middle of 1967, when an election was to be called again and when the Papandreou Centre Union Party was expected to be returned to government, another coup occurred. The election was not held until 1974. Papandreou suffered at the time of that coup. He was arrested and held in solitary confinement for eight months. At the end of that period he was given amnesty on the basis that he leave Greece and stay out of Greece. He said at the time:</PARA>
<PARA> For America-</PARA>
<PARA>The coup-</PARA>
<PARA>represents a dangerous experiment in foreign policy, consisting of the extension of its Latin American policy to the shores of Europe. </PARA>
<PARA>It is this theme that he has continued amongst other themes in pursuance of the independence of Greece. He recognised that the obsequious nature of Greek governments since 1967 meant that the Greek people had not been able to realise their true worth and independence. </PARA>
<PARA> The implications of the election of the present Greek government are wide and many, not only for Europe and for the Greek people themselves but also for the world. This government is the second government of a European Economic Community country in six months to be elected on a vote against conservatism and a vote in favour of democratic radical socialism. This election and the election of Francois Mitterrand in France can be tied in with the growth of a popular movement throughout Europe at the moment which is well portrayed in disarmament rallies and anti-nuclear campaigns. In fact, it represents a move throughout Europe, and I would suggest a move that will be carried on throughout the rest of the world, for a radical reorganisation of the world system. </PARA>
<PARA> The vote of the Greek people meant a number of things. It was a vote for a new economic and social order for Greece; it was in fact a vote against the current transnational domination of that country and the economic repression that comes with that. It was a vote against inequality and it was a vote against external domination. In fact, it was a vote for independence, for a better share of wealth and for a better quality of life for the Greek people. The Greek people ought to be commended for their perception and their strength in taking their convictions to a vote. </PARA>
<PARA> The Papandreou victory means a number of things. For the Greeks in Greece it means, as the now Prime Minister mentioned throughout his campaign, a reorganisation and a restructuring of the Greek economy. It means regionalisation of both administration and power. It means socialisation. Papandreou has always said that to him socialisation means that Greek people should benefit by both control and profit sharing from the most basic and profitable areas of Greek industry and that this includes areas such as energy, transport, banks, ship building, chemicals, fertilisers and cement. The most profitable areas of Greek industry should, under the PASOK Government, accrue benefits to the Greek people and not their foreign masters. It also means-and this is one of the most underrated areas of his policy-a revision of the role of women in Greek society. The PASOK Government has promised equal pay, anti-discrimination legislation and state provided child care facilities. This will bring about a radical reorganisation and a radical restructure in the role of women in the Greek community. </PARA>
<PARA> He also promises a dissociation of both church and state, something which I believe is to be welcomed and which can only be in the best interests of Greek people. He also promises worker involvement, wage indexation and a number of social welfare reforms, including universal medical care and pension reform. If one studies the rise of Papandreou, one can see that all of those policies were tenets of his when he was last in government in 1967. He has maintained his themes, he has maintained his beliefs and he has developed on them. Over a period he has managed to sell them to an electorate which has now shown that it was quite willing to accept them. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the experience of Papandreou in 1964, 1965, 1967 and thereafter is shown more and more in the field of foreign policy. During that period he realised that Greece could no longer continue to be a servant of the United States and that it had to stand up for itself. That type of theme comes out time and time again in respect of the PASOK policies which have been endorsed and accepted by the Greek people. PASOK has promised to review Greece's involvement with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. The Prime Minister of Greece has promised that this review will involve a rejection of military involvement with NATO but a reassessment of the continuation of political involvement with NATO. It is obvious that the Prime Minister will now make Greece stand up and use its independent status, its realigned status, in the interests of the Greek people and the Greek Cypriot people and not in the interests of foreign powers. </PARA>
<PARA> His attitude in respect of United States bases is one which I think we in Australia should look at with interest. His experience between 1964 and 1967 showed him that the Central Intelligence Agency could not be trusted and its involvement in the Greek community and society could not be tolerated. His policy in respect of United States bases now is that they be withdrawn over time but that in the meantime, as he asserted time and time again during the campaign, the role of the bases should be de-Americanised, as he put it, and over the short term renegotiated to ensure that Greece controls in the interim the operation of the bases. </PARA>
<PARA> During the campaign he also declared that there would be no nuclear weapons on Greek soil. We also know that it is proposed to hold a referendum of Greek people on the renegotiation of continued EEC involvement. As I said, the PASOK policy for Greece promises an independent nation that can stand in world affairs as a non-aligned country. Papandreou is not going into government this time without experience. I mentioned earlier some aspects of his experience. He has been involved in three coups of one sort or another. In 1961 falsification of election results by the then Prime Minister Karamanlis ensured that the Government of George Papandreou was rejected by the people. As I said earlier, there was a coup in 1965 from King Constantine and once again in 1967 there was a coup. Papandreou comes into government having lived through that recent history of Greece and having suffered from it. He knows that there are no soft options for him. </PARA>
<PARA> I finish my speech by referring to a couple of quotations from his book Democracy at Gunpoint which was published in 1971 and which in many ways laid the groundwork for his campaign over the last 10 years. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>We placed many hopes, much too many, on the possibility of mobilising the private sector of the economy to perform its developmental role . . . but we failed to understand that it was not enough to create a climate of opportunity for investment and set up a system of incentives. </PARA>
<PARA>He knows that and his intervention in the economy is a response to that. He went on to say as a matter of tactics that the then Government's much milder, less demanding, less radical development program, which had been intended to prevent the alienation of the Establishment, created no less hostility. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>That any reform was poison to them-we might just as well have gone further and formulated a plan of action that would have made a difference for Greece. </PARA>
<PARA>It is that difference that he has now had the Greek people accept. He now has a mandate from the Greek people. The last quote I put on record from the same book-I think it sums up the future of Greece under Papandreou-is:</PARA>
<PARA>The struggle for a free Greece will continue until victory comes. And then Greece will move forward to take its place in Europe as a free, democratic, sovereign nation. </PARA>
<PARA>Once again I congratulate the new Prime Minister of Greece, Mr Andreas Papandreou. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There were two speakers in the adjournment debate tonight. I listened with interest to Senator Bolkus's eulogy on the new Greek Government. I hope he passes copies of his speech on to the new Prime Minister. I am sure he will be interested.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to respond to Senator Mulvihill's comments in which he asked a number of questions to which I think answers are required. I start by saying that I am not aware of the intricacies of demarcation problems that may arise. I think the honourable senator referred to some of those as possibilities in relation to the watchmen on whom he and I as early birds or late birds in that building in Sydney depend so much. But I do agree there is a need for adequate arrangements to protect them. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the Government decision to transfer the cleaning and watching function of the Department of Administrative Services to the private sector was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in the statement on the Review of Commonwealth Functions on 30 April last. It reflects the view of the Government that certain services presently provided by the Government could be more effectively provided by the private sector. The honourable senator was not questioning that view. He was questioning the kinds of arrangements that might be made and protection for some of the people whom he knows and who have worked there. </PARA>
<PARA> Guidelines for the arrangements for staff affected by such transfers do envisage staff being offered employment by the contractors taking over the function, to the maximum extent possible. That is envisaged in the arrangements which are provided. The staff who are offered employment will receive benefits normally applying on retrenchment because that is another aspect of their protection that has to be looked at. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are talking about employment with the new employer. You are not talking about the obligations of the Commonwealth to make severance payments.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not come to that. If a new contractor comes in, it is hoped that the present employees would be taken up to the maximum extent possible. When that happens, they will require benefits applying on retrenchment when they change from one employment to another. The staff not offered employment with the contractor or the staff who choose not to take up an offer will have the protection of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act and they will have the protection of associated arbitral determinations which are administered by the Public Service Board. These arrangements and the decision to effect the transfer next month were conveyed to the staff concerned by officers of the Department of Administrative Services last week, on 12 October 1981. The Department at the present time is in discussion with contractors interested in tendering for the cleaning and watching of Commonwealth properties and its expectation is that they will engage existing staff if they do take over that function.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of other points were raised by Senator Mulvihill, particularly points relating to possible conflicts between people doing different functions for the same firms, which I will pass on to the relevant Minister. I finish my remarks by observing that at least one of the watchmen whom we both knew well over the years, Mr Bill Burgess, who looked after us both for many years, made the transfer at one stage from the Commonwealth service to work for Pritchard Security Services and at least he survived the change. We continue to see him around quite often still doing the watchman's function. I believe the change can be made. I would hope that the talks which are presently in progress can be brought to a successfull conclusion and that the concerns which have been expressed by Senator Mulvihill can be met adequately. </PARA>
