<PARA>Plant Variety Rights</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. there is a lack of public information about the content and intention of the proposed legislation on Plant Variety Rights;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. there is concern that the ethical and moral issues of granting private proprietorial rights over genetic resources have not been properly and publicly considered;</PARA>
<PARA> 3. there is evidence to suggest that such legislation may lead to a reduction in the plant diversity;</PARA>
<PARA> 4. there is reason to fear that farmers may be restricted in their activities due to the controls placed on the use and propagation of seed stocks;</PARA>
<PARA> 5. evidence suggests that Plant Varietal Rights legislation will lead to higher costs for the farmer, the consumer, the plant-breeder and the tax payer, and</PARA>
<PARA> 6. evidence suggests that Plant Varietal Rights legislation will lead to a further increase in foreign control of Australian resources.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that Parliament ensure:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) that information be made freely available to allow full and informed public discussion of the issues involved,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that the Government undertake to carry out an analysis of the costs and benefits involved to the various sectors of Agriculture and the Nation as a whole.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that Senator Grimes asked that question. It will help to ensure that the policy we announced last week is more clearly understood. The answer to his question is yes. The figure of $160 is selected as being $20 above the current unemployment benefit for a married couple, rounded to the nearest dollar. It is proposed that the income level will move with that benefit which is indexed on the twice-yearly basis that the honourable senator mentioned. In other words, in determining whether people are entitled to qualify for medical treatment under the disadvantaged program, the figure of $160 will vary twice a year in accordance with index changes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TS7">Senator THOMAS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Yesterday I received a letter from the Premier of Western Australia which expressed extreme disappointment with the outcome of the recent Premiers Conference. Several points were made, including the lack of consultation regarding the decision to change the basis of tax sharing from personal income tax to total Commonwealth taxation revenue. Sir Charles Court pointed out that the tax sharing allocation for 1981-82 represents a reduction from the present allocation of 39.87 per cent to 38.32 per cent, or $38.5m less than my State's entitlement would be under an assurance given in 1976 when the new tax sharing arrangements commenced. He made the further point that Western Australia received only $1.8m of a total supplementation of $69m, which will alter substantially the relativity factors on which the Commonwealth Grants Commission will base its formula for dividing the tax sharing revenue among the States. I agree that the States should share the responsibility for cutbacks in government expenditure and I strongly endorse those cutbacks; but, in view of the substantial contribution my State is making to the prosperity of all Australians and the very expensive commitments to further development, particularly in areas of resource development, will the Leader ask the Prime Minister to reconsider this matter?</PARA></TALK.START>

I, as with all other Ministers, believe in collective Cabinet responsibility. That is a fundamental of the Westminster system. I was asked about the Leader of the National Country Party. My understanding is that the National Country Party, as a separate party in the coalition, has its own separate policy points. I think that, as Leader, he was drawing attention to the National Country Party's policy point. The Cabinet has indicated its decision to put under study the question of converting TAA into a public company. That course will be proceeded with.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Members of the Australian Labor Party get very tender indeed when the vast dichotomy between the two parties in terms of principle and freedom is demonstrated. I have not seen the statement in the Press. Members of the Government parties in the normal course of their duties understand their own collective responsibilities and support the policies of the Government as they come through. On the few occasions that they cross the floor the Press, for some extraordinary reason, sees this as a division in the parties. On the contrary, it shows freedom which, used sparingly-because there is a heavy responsibility upon the member-is a very valuable asset within the parties. I commend the principle to the Australian Labor Party without, however, much hope that it will be taken up.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen the statement of the particular gentleman from Tennessee, nor would I take such a pessimistic view of the future of solar energy. What is true is that the present state of the art, the present knowledge of technology, is such that the use of solar energy is very limited or restricted. Often the production of solar arrays uses as much, or more, energy as in a lifetime they may save. That is not to be taken at this stage as a criticism. Above everything, we want to find renewable energy sources that will be able to replace the non-renewables-the oils, the coals and the shales. The present development of solar arrays means that very large areas have to be used to produce relatively small agglomerations or accumulations of heat. Much more work has to be done in the photovoltaic cell area and much more work has to be done in collector systems to focus a greater intensity of heat in a particular concentration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nevertheless, there is a significant and growing use of solar energy. My Government and I have anticipated that in some 20 years' time solar energy could be providing about 8 per cent of Australia's energy needs. What is needed-what is being done-is to concentrate research on this matter. Recently in Western Australia I was privileged to see quite a lot of very useful research going on. It is also going on in other States. I would like to see the research intensified. We are working with the Japanese towards the possibility of establishing, in the Northern Territory, a pilot plant that will provide a significant collector system. I hope that that will be done. I do not want to knock solar energy; I do not want to be over-pessimistic. On the other hand, realism suggests that at this stage of development much more concentration of research and technology is required, and that is what we are aiming to do.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, concerns East Timor. Is it a fact that the Republic of Indonesia had, and has, no ethnic, historic or moral justification whatsoever for its invasion and subsequent occupation of East Timor?

Will the Australian Government now support, with vigour and expedition, the approach from the Prime Minister of Portugal, Mr Balsemao, to the United Nations Secretary-General, Dr Waldheim, for self-determination in East Timor, whose people helped Australian servicemen so much at so much self-sacrifice during World War II?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government regrets the circumstances under which Indonesia took control of East Timor. However, it believes that the best interests of the people of Timor are now served by positive encouragement of the Indonesian Government in its efforts to improve the living conditions of the population. I am aware of Press reports that the Portuguese Foreign Minister asked the United Nations Secretary-General, Dr Waldheim, to set up a special committee on East Timor. It is noted that Dr Waldheim is reported to have indicated that no decision could be taken on the idea without consulting all interested parties, including Indonesia. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government hope that Dr Waldheim's mission will lead to a satisfactory solution of this long-standing problem.

The advertisement suggests that there will be a 20 to 25 per cent reduction in long distance telephone call rates over certain distances. Is the Minister aware that this large reduction in rates will apply between Melbourne and Sydney, Sydney and Brisbane, and Melbourne and Adelaide, amongst other places, but not between Melbourne and Hobart? In other words, the reduction will apply between all adjacent capital cities in the east of Australia, except between Melbourne and Hobart. Obviously I ask: Will the Government examine or ask Telecom Australia to examine the situation to see whether the reduction can apply between Melbourne and Hobart?</PARA></TALK.START>

I understand that Senator Townley, in raising this question, welcomes the reduced rates offered and is acknowledging that if that is so it is an advance for many people using the services of Telecom. However the point of his question is why these reduced rates do not cross that body of water separating Tasmania from the rest of Australia. The honourable senator asked: Can I undertake to seek from my colleague an assurance that this matter will be referred to Telecom for its consideration? Of course I shall accede to that request, knowing, as all honourable senators do, the interest that Senator Townley has in the affairs of Tasmania and his concern that the citizens of his State should receive a fair go at all times.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister: Is it a fact that at the Premiers Conference of last week there was never any agreement on the part of any State Premier with the Federal Government's so-called final offer? Was part of the Commonwealth's argument to the Premiers that any savings to the Federal Treasury as a result of the squeeze on the States must be returned to the taxpayers of Australia by way of income tax cuts? Does the Minister agree with the statement by the Premier of New South Wales that the Federal Government therefore has the capacity to offer income tax cuts of 10 per cent from 1 July next, representing an amount of about $8 a week for the average taxpayer? Finally, with substantial increases occurring in hospital charges and reduced services being provided, at both Federal and State levels, directly as a result of the Government's decisions of the last fortnight, is there any truth in the report that the Government is considering imposing heavy increases in excise charges on wage and salary earners in the next Budget?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All honourable senators will know that it is the normal routine-almost a ritual-following a Premiers Conference that the Premiers, even though they may feel they have got a fair deal, never express that feeling and always express dissatisfaction. Premiers Conference after Premiers Conference the Premiers do not indicate agreement, and they did not indicate agreement following their last meeting. I am bound to say to the honourable senator that a number of Premiers indicated that in the past the formula had been considerably generous and they expected any formula for the future would be less generous. Senator McClelland well knows that the original offer of the Government was 8 per cent, modified to 8.4 per cent and finally concluded at 9 per cent. It was the Commonwealth's offer at each stage that the Premiers declined, but that is not unusual. It was not indicated at the Premiers Conference that the primary purpose of any program, whether it be the Review of Commonwealth Functions committee program, the health program or tax sharing, would be to give tax benefits. At all points it was stressed that it was necessary to get the economy into a deflationary state that would enable us to expand, to do more and to provide more jobs and more industries for Australia; that that was the primary goal. Indeed, the evidence indicates that that is working, and that is acknowledged overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, it is also the keen desire of the Government that it should, where it can, provide tax cuts. The Commonwealth has set such an example in the past. I have seen something of the comment of Mr Wran. I am interested to learn that he accepts savings should be made through payments to the States and suggests that those savings might be directed towards tax cuts, but I cannot comment on whether his formula of 10 per cent is over-generous or not. I note that the State Premiers have a capacity to give advice on Commonwealth budgetary matters very frequently. The fact is that a new hospital and health scheme has been introduced throughout Australia. I think it is important for the Senate to realise that at least four Premiers have expressed the view that they accept the health scheme in principle.</PARA>

As to Senator McClelland's last question, he knows better than I that no government will make any kind of statement about what is going to happen in the Budget, whether by way of revenue or expenditure. Of course, at this moment a keen campaign regarding excise is running in the Press and elsewhere in the media.

As one of those who chooses to have my telephone number non-listed I certainly have not protested. I would like to say that I and many other Australians regard the capacity not to be listed in telephone directories as a very distinct service and one which we would not want to give up easily.

Senator MacGibbon's question is really related to whether people should pay for the privilege of not having their service listed. He will be aware, of course, that one of the main calls upon directory assistance is from people pursuing telephone numbers which they cannot find in the directory and which prove to be those unlisted numbers. They take longer to deal with because people actually require a considerable amount of explanation as to why those numbers cannot be released. It has turned out that there is quite a cost to Telecom in maintaining that service-directory assistance-and explaining why various subscribers have chosen not to have their numbers listed. Having said all that, I am aware of the more frivolous or humourous part of Senator MacGibbon's question. I think I might refer that to my colleague for his enjoyment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Health. In June 1978 the private health funds in Australia owed the Government millions of dollars. This was because Medibank had paid claims which should rightfully have been paid by the private funds. It occurred during the period of the restructuring of the health scheme so that beneficiaries would not be disadvantaged. The health funds said at the time that they would not pay back the money. When I asked in June 1978 what action the Minister proposed I was advised that the money owed would be vigorously pursued. When I asked about the matter again in November 1978 the Minister advised that there was doubt about the legality of pursuing the claims and that the Government would not insist on repayment. In view of the Government's deep concern to cut government costs and, presumably, its anxiety to collect all money owing to it, will the Minister advise what possible legalities prevent it from collecting these millions of dollars from the private health funds?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For some time it had been arranged that I should return to Darwin for a meeting on 11 May. This followed an earlier meeting held on 19 March between representatives of the Northern Territory Government, the Commonwealth Government and the three land councils in the Northern Territory. At that first meeting we explored a number of issues concerning matters relating to the administration of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act and we made considerable progress on a number of agreed positions which might form the basis for some amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The meeting on 11 May, yesterday, was a long planned follow-up meeting. I understand that discussion is going on today to try to reach some further agreed positions which might be acceptable to the land councils, to the Northern Territory Government and to the Commonwealth Government. I think all honourable senators would realise that it is in everyone's interest to have an Aboriginal land rights Act in operation in the Northern Territory which, in addition to looking after the legitimate interests of Aboriginal people, can properly advance the cause of racial harmony and community development on all sides. If, in fact, we reach an agreed position in which the land councils themselves are active participants-that is something which most people would, of course, commend-the positions would have to be taken back to the land councils and I would have to go back to the Commonwealth Government to have the proposals examined further.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me now answer the second part of the honourable senator's question. While I was in Darwin I took the opportunity to talk to some of those who are concerned with the Koongarra negotiations and to reinforce the point that I made in this place last week that the whole of the Kakadu National Park is Aboriginal land; that for any mining to take place on that land requires the consent provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act to be followed completely; and that there is no intention that those consent provisions should be set aside.</PARA>
<PARA> I was aware, as I think most of those to whom I spoke were aware, of an excision from the Kakadu National Park made, I think, in 1977. That excision was made to provide for the possibility of later mining on the Koongarra project. Of course, that excision would have effect only if eventual consent were given by the traditional owners. Any proposal for an altered excision area would be dealt with on exactly the same basis-it would not have effect of any kind unless consent to mining were given by the traditional owners. I found the discussions, which are continuing, very fruitful and productive. I undertake to keep the honourable senator advised of any further progress.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The new arrangements which have been outlined will require some considerable administrative adjustments within the States. These will not be totally easy to implement in some cases. In some States there will be large adjustments to be made where only small numbers of people carry health insurance and where, we hope, large numbers will be moving to become insured. It is for the purpose of providing some kind of time cushion to allow the change to be phased in that the 60 per cent has been set down for the first year. The question of the speed of adjustment required is a significant one and it seems to us that the 60 per cent figure is one way of indicating our desire to deal fairly as between governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the other part of the question asked by the honourable senator, he is correct in what he asserts; that is, if the States are able to move to a situation where they are gaining in revenue the full amount available to them from the collection of fees, that will, at least in the first year, be a potential windfall gain to the States. It is up to them to collect that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today Senator Cavanagh asked me a question concerning a story which appeared in the Weekend Australian concerning the disposal of surplus Hercules aircraft. I have been able to obtain some information for the honourable senator. It is true that on three occasions, since 1979, world-wide tenders have been invited for the disposal of these aircraft, but unfortunately without success. The various offers submitted by Captain Ellis on behalf of John Woods Inc. of Texas or by John Woods Inc. in conjunction with others have received due consideration on each occasion. However, the offers to act as brokers for the Commonwealth would have involved the Commonwealth in significant expenditure on scarce manpower and resources to bring the aircraft up to civil airworthiness standards. On the occasion when the consortium offered to buy the aircraft, the prices offered were exceeded substantially by those of the Parmax organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In March 1981, my colleague, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) issued a media release which canvassed the history of this project and announced that further negotiations were being entered into rather than the reinvitation of fresh tenders. Interested aircraft brokers and other potential purchasers who have shown an ongoing interest in the disposal of these aircraft were contacted regarding the 10 available aircraft, together with some 2,330 line items of spare parts and related equipment unique to the C130A models which have now become available for disposal with the aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA> Captain Ellis was one of several people approached early in March 1981 and his response was one of six which have received careful evaluation with a view to determining the best means of maximising the Government's return on these aircraft and spares.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since 1977 we have seen a sustained attack on democracy in Western Australia engineered by the State Government and Liberal Party and in particular by the Premier, Charles Court. In 1977 a Liberal Party operation of intimidation and trickery prevented large numbers of Aborigines in the Kimberley from recording their votes as a result of which that election was ultimately declared void and a by-election was held. In 1979 there was an unsuccessful attempt to change the Electoral Act in order to place impediments in the way of enrolment. That attempt failed. Unfortunately the next year a similar attempt succeeded and those impediments which do not exist and never have existed in any State or Commonwealth legislation have been placed in the way of enrolment in Western Australia and I regret to say they have been quite successful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A few weeks ago some 30,000 fewer electors-that is almost 5 per cent of the State's voting population-were enrolled on the State roll compared with the number on the Commonwealth roll. This campaign has been superimposed on a long and dishonourable tradition of manipulating electoral laws to entrench governments which do not have majority support. That dishonourable tradition, of course, is not unique to Western Australia, nor has it been unique to the Liberal Party or even to the Liberal and Country parties in the past. I regret, but I acknowledge, that Labor governments, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland, in past times-now they are fairly distant past times-have been guilty of the same type, but not to the same degree, of electoral manipulation as has been practised and continues to be practised by conservative governments and as is practised now in Western Australia in particular. The fact that both political sides have done it in the past does not justify one side continuing to manipulate the electoral laws to defeat democratic processes today. </PARA>
<PARA> The normal method of manipulation is that malapportionment and in particular the system of malapportionment which says that there shall be a greater number of electors in urban areas per electorate than there shall be in country areas. There are some variances of that theme but basically that has been the method under which electoral malapportionment in the defeat or subversion of democracy has been practised. The normal rationale for that geographically-based malapportionment is what is euphemistically called equality of representation, by which it is argued by the people who support that system, and the conservative politicians who continue to support it, that electoral boundaries shall not be determined on the basis of population alone but there should also be a consideration of the area of the electorate, the remoteness of the electorate, and the difficulties of communication within it and between it and other electorates. </PARA>
<PARA> The specific form of malapportionment used in Western Australia for many decades is pursuant to the Electoral Boundaries Act under which a line is drawn arbitrarily around the city of Perth, that is the city zone; another line is drawn around the south west land division; the space between the city zone and the south west land division is the country; the eastern goldfields and the statutory seats are in the south east and in the far north of the State. The degree of malapportionment which is practised, and which has been applied for many years, is roughly that country seats shall have one-half of the number of electors-I am talking about Legislative Assembly seats-that city seats have; that goldfield electorates, of which there are now only two, shall have a number slightly lower than but comparable with country seats. Until very recently the number of electors in statutory seats in the north and the far south east had far fewer electors than even those electorates in the country zone. The boundaries within those four statutory seats were not drawn up by electoral commissioners but were laid down by legislation in the State Parliament. The boundaries of the other three zones-the country, the goldfields and the city-were determined by legislation. The boundaries of the electorates within those areas were determined by electoral commissioners. </PARA>
<PARA> That system and the rationale which under- pinned it-that is, the spurious concept of equality of representation incorporating population, area, remoteness, difficulties of communications and so on-are not accepted by the Labor Party and are not accepted by me. Until very recently the system was applied within Western Australia with reasonable consistency-the figures I am using are the latest figures available-thus, the largest electorate in area in the State, Murchison-Eyre, has the smallest enrolment. The second largest electorate in area, Kimberley, until quite recently had the second lowest enrolment. It now has the third lowest enrolment. Whilst there are some aberrations, as one looks at the enrolments and the electorate areas one can see that there is a very clear and negative correlation between the area of individual electorates and the number of electors on the roll. The system operated in a manner which was not inconsistent with its claimed ethical justification. The fact that it favoured the anti-Labor parties was claimed by its advocates to be coincidental-a coincidence which was fortuitous for the Liberal Party and the National Country Party but a coincidence nonetheless. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The degree of malapportionment from the extremes was significantly greater than it was in Queensland. The net effect of it, insofar as it distorted the representation of the individual parties, was roughly comparable to the situation in Queensland. The new electoral districts legislation which was introduced in the Western Australian Parliament last year is a travesty, even of that doctrine of convenience. It is a corrupt perversion of democracy the like of which no previous government, not even the notorious Bjekle-Petersen Government in Queensland, has had the audacity previously to attempt. It does not even purport to have an ethical rationale. It is naked abuse of power to ensure the survival of an increasingly unpopular and alarmingly authoritarian government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To give some of the details to support that charge, I refer first to the four statutory seats in the north, the far east and the south-east. I refer to the seats of Kimberley, Pilbara, Gascoyne-which is centred on Carnarvon-and Murchison-Eyre, the largest of all in area, most of which of course is uninhabited desert. The most recent enrolment figures show-for simplicity I will use round figures-that Pilbara had 15,000 electors. To the north and east of Pilbara the electorate of Kimberley had 5,700 electors, and to the south the electorate of Gascoyne had 3,700. Pilbara had for that area, indeed for the State, a number of electors well above the whole State average and almost double the average for other non-city seats. It had to the north of it an electorate with an enrolment of nearly 6,000 and to the south of it an electorate with an enrolment of 4,000. Moreover, the electorate of Kimberley, which was larger in enrolment, had an area of more than a quarter of a million square miles. The electorate of Gascoyne has an area of 64,000 square miles. </PARA>
<PARA> Under those circumstances and given that all of these seats adjoin, any government which was interested in applying a compound formula of the number of electors and the area of the electorate and its remoteness would have put portion of the Pilbara seat-if this were the only option-into the electorate of Gascoyne which was smaller by a large margin in area and enrolment than any of the other electorates. This was not done by the Government of Charles Court. It split in half, both demographically and geographically, the electorate of Pilbara so that the electorate of Kimberley, which is the most remote and the second largest in area-it is more than a quarter of a million square miles; almost as large as the States of New South Wales and Victoria put together-and which is in the far north of the State and inaccessible in the wet season, took one half of the electors of the Pilbara seat and the Gascoyne electorate was left untouched. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it not extraordinary to add more areas and electors to one seat as against another when the seat to which the numbers and the area are added has four times the area and 50 per cent more electors than the other adjoining seat? It is extraordinary until one realises why it was done. The marginal seat of Pilbara was split in half, as I have said. That half of it which had a consistent record of voting Labor-at recent elections it has had a very heavy record of voting Labor-will be put into the Labor held seat of Kimberley and the remainder, which will be called the seat of Pilbara, thereby will be made a relatively safe Liberal Party electorate. Some members of the Liberal Party have denied that this is the reason for the division. They do not go on to give an alternative explanation for the extraordinary action. Mr Withers, a member of the Legislative Council for North Province, who is no relation, to my knowledge, of Senator Withers, let the cat out of the bag when he attacked the Liberal Party for writing off the seat of Kimberley. Mr Withers said that the putting of the strongly Labor section of Pilbara into Kimberly had written off Kimberley for the Liberal Party and that Kimberley would remain a blue-ribbon Labor seat. He was thereby acknowledging, of course, that the Labor section of Pilbara was taken out of the electorate and put into Kimberley. Never mind about areas, numbers or anything at all, the electoral boundaries are being rigged so that the Charles Court Government will remain in power. </PARA>

I know that that figure does not sound like very much in New South Wales, but it is 30 per cent larger than the average enrolment in the 22 country seats, all of which are within 300 miles of Perth and all of which could be fitted within the area of Kimberley.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The most remote electorate, one-third of the area of the State, has 12,000 electors. Twenty-two electorates are on the doorstep of Perth. They have 9,000 electors and a combined area of less than that of Kimberley. What has happened to the principle of equality as previously defined by the Liberal Party, this formula for electoral justice which incorporated number of electors, area, remoteness, difficulty of communication and so on? What do the small 'l' liberals, those who proclaim themselves to be the standard bearers of John Stuart Mill, think of that? How do they defend the actions of their Liberal Party? This is the same Liberal Party which is represented in this chamber and in the House of Representatives. How do they defend the actions of the Liberal Party and of the Liberal Government of Western Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to show the alternatives without a map, but if anyone cares to look at an electoral map of Western Australia and the four statutory seats which I have named, what could have been done to ensure reasonable equality both in numbers and in areas is obvious. I am talking only about the statutory seats. The southern portion, the Eyre section of Murchison-Eyre, should have been put into the seat of Yilgarn-Dundas or Kalgoorlie. The remainder of Murchison-Eyre should have been combined with the seat of Gascoyne, and Pilbara should have been split in halves. There would have been four seats with electoral enrolments varying between 5,500 and 6,000. The largest seat in area would have had the smallest number of electors and the smallest seat in area would have had the largest number of electors, in conformity with what is claimed to be the objectives of the Liberal and Country parties. The reason that was not done is that, in all probability, the Labor Party would have won three of those seats. Under the corrupt arrangement which the Court Government has engineered, the Liberal Party will most likely hold three of them. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not the only thing the Western Australian Government did. In the time remaining I want to touch briefly on the situation regarding this arbitrary line which is drawn around the city of Perth by the Government, not by the electoral commissioners, which separates the city from the country. In the existing country zone is the seat of Rockingham, held by Labor, with 13,000 electors. If a redistribution were held, under the pre-existing law some 3,000 or even 4,000 of those electors would have to be redistributed, which would endanger two adjoining seats currently held by the Liberal Party. The Labor Party surplus from Rockingham would endanger those seats. Solution: Put Rockingham in the city, neutralise those Labor voters and protect the two adjoining Liberal seats. Kalamunda, on the other hand, which is 10 miles closer to the GPO than Rockingham and a Liberal-held seat, remains in the country zone. Is not that amazing? A commuter suburb 10 miles closer to the GPO than Rockingham remains in the country, and Rockingham goes into the city. That is astounding until one realises the real reason it was done. These are banana republic politics which ought to be highly offensive to anyone who claims to have any affinity at all with the classical nineteenth century liberals. </PARA>
<PARA> Confronted with such electoral corruption-I use that word advisedly-any responsible Federal government would introduce legislation to conduct another referendum, as was done in 1974, to impose electoral democracy upon those State governments which legislate against it. This will provoke from some people a cry of States rights. States have no rights. States are a legal concept. They are inanimate institutions. States have no rights; people have rights. When the political rights of the people of Western Australia are filched, as they have been by an unscrupulous assembly of political bandits, the Commonwealth has an obligation and ought to accept the obligation to seek constitutional amendment to ensure that that practice ceases. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table headed 'Western Australian State Electoral Divisions as at 6 April 1981' showing the present enrolments and areas and a table headed 'Statutory seats' showing present and proposed population and areas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We had all hoped to hear today from Senator Walsh, who proposed this matter of public importance, some argument relating to the terms in which he proposed it, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need for the Commonwealth Government to initiate moves for a constitutional guarantee of a one-vote-one-value principle, particularly in view of the proposed new electoral redistribution in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>What we have heard in fact is what might be called an account of the honourable senator's domestic concerns within his own State. Only within the last minute and a half of his address did he state that in view of all this it was obvious that the Commonwealth had to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> One vote one value is a desirable principle but in this country it has always been set aside to some extent in order to meet special needs. By definition, the Senate has always done that. The value of a Tasmanian vote for that State's ten senators is much greater than that of a vote for the ten senators from the State of New South Wales from which Senator Sibraa-who I notice is in the chamber-and I come. A New South Wales voter has much less power, in terms of capacity to select a member of the Senate, than has a Tasmanian voter. If we consider the position in regard to the House of Representatives--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Sibraa" NAMEID="EJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EJ4">Senator Sibraa</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a different House.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator interjects that that is a different House. We note that since the Constitution was agreed to and Federation was achieved, Tasmania has had five guaranteed seats in that House. Those five statutory seats have always had fewer electors than those of seats representing the mainland States. Certainly more electors are required to elect a member of the House of Representatives in my State of New South Wales than is the case in Tasmania. I wish to make clear that I accept that that compact was necessary. I understand the reasons for it. I understand that although one vote one value would be desirable, that concept had to be abridged slightly in the interests of achieving the constitutional compact which led to Federation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If I may return to the question of the federal system, I remind the Senate that the only powers that the Commonwealth holds are those which have been referred to it; the other plenary powers remain with the States. They include powers over the very matters to which Senator Walsh has referred. They are powers and responsibilities of the States. They are matters concerning which the States must legislate and concerning which the States must become answerable. There is a considerable movement, in the structure of Commonwealth law, away from one vote one value in respect of a number of areas of activity. Let us examine the constitutional amendments themselves. We do not find the one vote one value principle applied there because we have a federal system of government. The veto power of the electors in States of small population, such as that from which Senator Walsh comes, is much greater, voter by voter, than that of electors in New South Wales, Victoria, or indeed any of the larger States. The individual vote there counts for much more than it does in my State of New South Wales, where each vote is discounted by its being but one of a much larger pool. It is interesting that Senator Walsh would like to see this constitutional amendment process, which by its very nature abridges the one vote one value principle, used to achieve the aim upon which his matter of public importance touches. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I must observe that the champions of one vote one value, the members of the Australian Labor Party, have no such commitment in regard to their own internal affairs as members of a party, or at the national level in terms of the Federal Conference and the Federal Executive. Those bodies are based on a federal principle rather than representation on a one vote one value basis. For the honourable senator to tell us how we should run our States and the nation, to say that anything other than one vote one value is improper, is hard to understand when one remembers that the honourable senator is a member of a party which quite deliberately moves away from that concept in regard to its own procedures, structure and distribution of power, a party which tends to devalue the power of a party member in New South Wales compared with the power of a Labor member in Western Australia. Let me add the comment that I accept that in many aspects of Australian life the federal structure is appropriate. My own party also has a federal structure. I do not object to that. I am sure that the honourable senator would defend the federal structure of his own party and the inequality as between the value of votes within that party, but that fact should be taken into account when he seeks to advance another argument in regard to electoral redistribution. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party is, and always has been, open to further criticism on the basis that, certainly in some States, the unions are able to elect up to 60 per cent of delegates. For example, they may elect that proportion to the New South Wales Labor Party State Conference but the branches may elect only 40 per cent-irrespective of where the membership lies, irrespective of what that does to the principle of one vote one value. In other words, the vote of a union member of the Labor Party is worth more than that of a rank and file member when it comes to matters of internal democracy within that party. These facts should be put on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party has long known about the situation about which it complains today but when it was in office it did very little about it. It tried to propose a referendum on the issue of basing electoral divisions on population rather than numbers of electors. This, in itself, would have moved us away from one vote one value to a very different principle, that of one person one value. The Labor Party went to the people. It did not advocate one vote one value. It advocated a constitutional amendment that would have moved us toward the principle of one person one value. This would have taken into account the number of children and of non-citizens and would have moved away from, and distorted, the electoral system. In some electorates which had large numbers of children or large numbers of non-naturalised immigrants the power of each voter would have been greater than that of a voter in another electorate with a different demographic pattern. In areas with a high concentration of children and non-citizens the votes of electors would have been overvalued compared with those of people who live in electorates with few children and few non-citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party put that proposal to referendum. It took the action which Senator Walsh says should be taken. It gave the Australian people an opportunity to decide whether they wanted to move towards the principle of one person one value. The referendum proposal was to apply not only to the Federal Parliament but also to parliaments throughout Australia. I have before me the results of the referendum. I notice that in only one State in Australia did the voters accept the proposition. In that one State it was accepted by only 50.55 per cent-in other words, by a majority of just over one-half of one per cent-and a majority failed to be obtained in the other States. The people of Australia, having considered the proposition, the trade-offs and what was involved all round, decided that a federal level we would not amend the Constitution in the way in which the Labor Party sought. What are we to do? We have the result of a referendum conducted to test the will of the people. The result said: 'No change'. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to what I said previously. I do not have the power to tell New South Wales, where I live, Queensland or Victoria how to set their electoral boundaries. Those are properly matters for those States to determine. They are matters which, the people have determined at a referendum, should properly remain within the powers of those States to determine. I will not get into a domestic argument in this Senate about what is going on in a particular State in relation to a particular redistribution. That is the responsibility of that State. Senator Walsh talked about Western Australia. By raising this matter of public importance he tried to put into the Hansard record his own views of a situation in a State and his vitriolic hatred of the Government of that State. But it is not a matter in which we, as a Federal Parliament, have any standing, on which we can comment or in relation to which we can move. When it was put to the people of Australia at a referendum, they said that was the way they wanted it to be. The States which move in that way will have the authority to do so, will have the responsibility for doing so and will be answerable to their electors in due course for anything they do. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is the view of Senator Walsh that a redistribution that any State wants to bring in is deficient, and if he can convince the citizens of that State that that is the case, they will have the remedy at an appropriate time when an election is due. I return to the words of the matter of public importance which sought some Commonwealth action in relation to this matter. Part of Senator Walsh's matter of public importance, as written, speaks of 'The need for the Commonwealth Government to initiate moves'. There were moves. This matter was tested by the Australian people. They have determined that the authority should remain with the States, and that is our view of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government, for its part, is concerned with electoral matters. Within the area of my portfolio I draw the attention of the Senate to the statement made at the time of the last election policy speech when, acting on the advice of the National Aboriginal Conference, the elected body of Aboriginals, we had a recommendation that voluntary electoral enrolment of Aboriginals be changed to compulsory enrolment. That is a matter within the authority and responsibility of the Commonwealth. It was recommended to us by the National Aboriginal Conference. It is a move which will put Aboriginals in the same position as all other Australians. Of course, it is a matter which the Government has promised to legislate for. It is something which is within our area of responsibility and in relation to which we will move. The rest of the matter of public importance had very little to do with this Federal Government and with its responsibilities. I believe the honourable senator made out no significant case. Therefore, I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Colston from moving forthwith the motion of which he gave notice this day. </PARA>
<PARA>Before Question Time this afternoon I gave notice that I would move the following motion:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate requests the Commonwealth Government to enter into immediate negotiations with the Queensland Government to arrive at an appropriate financial formula to enable the continuation of the longstanding free hospital system in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>Standing Order 448 states, in part:</PARA>
<PARA>In cases of urgent necessity, any Standing or Sessional Order or Orders of the Senate may be suspended on Motion, duly made and seconded, without Notice:</PARA>
<PARA>This afternoon I just want to outline in brief why this is a case of urgent necessity and why I have thus moved that Standing Orders be suspended. Under normal circumstances the motion of which I gave notice this afternoon before Question Time would be placed on the Notice Paper and brought forward at some time in the distant future. It could be debated late this year or, if there were sufficient notices of motion on the Notice Paper, it could be debated even next year. But for a motion of the type of which I gave notice this afternoon, that is definitely not satisfactory. It is important that the Senate now make a request as outlined in my notice of motion. It should do so at this time because a request made later would not be valid. </PARA>
<PARA> We in this chamber are representatives of the various States. If the States are being subjected to hardship by the Federal Government, it is important that we, as representatives of those States, immediately bring that hardship to the mind of the Government, show our opposition to it, express our attitudes in such a way and outline the course of action we consider should be followed to rectify that hardship. The urgency surrounding my moving for suspension of Standing Orders has arisen from a number of factors. I would like to outline some of them. Firstly, we are fast approaching the end of the autumn session. Under normal circumstances such a motion would not be debated before we returned in August. The Government should be aware of the Senate's request, should this motion be passed, well before then and well before the Budget discussions commence. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, announcements were recently made in this Parliament about changes in the Government's health policy. One of the consequences of that policy is that the people of Queensland are in danger of losing their long-standing free hospital system unless additional Federal funds are forthcoming. Should the motion to suspend Standing Orders be carried, I will be outlining certain factors surrounding the danger that the Queensland people face by having this system taken away from them. Thirdly, we heard last week an amazing admission that the Government would have made an additional $70m available to the States had the States held out longer at the Premiers Conference. Thus, it does not seem that the Federal Government cannot make funds available to the Queensland Government, as outlined in my notice of motion this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, I believe from media reports that the Premier of Queensland was to have been in Canberra today to try to convince the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that more Federal finance should be made available to Queensland. I am not aware whether the Queensland Premier has come to Canberra, whether he is still in Brisbane or whether he is somewhere in between. I have made some inquiries and there seem to be different reports, but the fact is that media reports said that the Premier of Queeensland was to come to Canberra today to talk to the Prime Minister about the danger facing the free hospital system in Queensland. That being so, the Senate should be able to determine its opinion on the question I raise so that the Prime Minister is aware of the thoughts of the States' representatives when he is talking to the Premier of Queensland. To make a request of the sort I have outlined in the notice of motion after discussions have concluded, after Mr Fraser has spoken with the Premier of Queensland, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, would be just an academic exercise. A request expressed today would be of practical value. </PARA>
<PARA> So far I have dwelt on matters associated with Queensland. Being a representative of Queensland I make no apology for having done so. No doubt senators from other States are acutely aware of the widespread criticism of the Federal Government in their own States. For example, today's midday news reported that the Victorian Premier was being very critical of the Federal Government and saying that the Federal Government's actions were likely to cause him a loss at the next Victorian election. Not only the Victorian Premier and the Queensland Premier have complained but also there have been complaints all over Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I am not asking senators to record a vote on the motion which I have expressed. I will certainly do that if the motion is debated after this motion for suspension of Standing Orders is decided by the Senate. I am asking the Senate to allow the debate on the motion to proceed forthwith. I will read the motion again because I think it is pertinent that senators know the motion for which they are being asked to suspend Standing Orders. The motion reads:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate requests the Commonwealth Government to enter into immediate negotiations with the Queensland Government to arrive at an appropriate financial formula to enable a continuation of the longstanding free hospital system in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>Under Standing Orders, having sought the suspension of Standing Orders it is not possible for me to debate the contents of that motion. I will certainly do so provided the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders is carried. At this stage, I conclude my remarks on my request for the suspension of Standing Orders by indicating that I want the debate on this matter to proceed forthwith because I believe that it is a case of urgent necessity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. I am certain that after such an eloquent appeal by Senator Colston the Senate will accept the proposition that the Standing Orders should be suspended. It interests me, of course, that the proposition before the chamber is of no interest to any Queensland senator on the Government side. Not one of them is present at the moment. I would have thought that they would have had notice of this move to suspend Standing Orders. That merely makes the need for suspension even more urgent. Their absence from the chamber at the moment and their refusal, in fact, to meet with the Queensland Premier at his request outlines the indifference which they show and make the Opposition's proposition even more urgent. Because of such indifference to the Government's action of cutting back the funding which will seriously affect the Queensland hospitals, that action should be debated at the earliest opportunity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Premier of Queensland invited all-I hope-of the 20 to 22 Government members who represent Queensland in the House of Representatives and the Senate. Only three Government members turned up at the meeting. One was Senator Bonner, a long-time enemy of Mr Bjelke-Petersen or vice versa. I am not quite certain of the relationship. </PARA>

In view of what the honourable senator is saying they did not make the future of the free hospital system in Queensland a priority. Of course, that will be to their disadvantage. It seems that the Premier of Queensland has now threatened their political future, which also makes the matter serious. To bring my remarks back in order, it is a matter of urgency that we should debate the proposition forthwith. For that reason I have pleasure in seconding the motion. By this time I do not doubt that the Government has awoken to the seriousness of the matter Senator Colston has put before us. If the matter is not to be debated today the Government will have to put the case for debating it at some other time-we expect this week. My suggestion is that we should debate the matter now. It is extremely urgent. The States are in revolt. The Premier of Queensland is threatening to come into conflict with criminal law in Queensland and, I think, with the Australian Constitution by threatening his members that if they do not come to order in this matter he will make certain that they do not receive an endorsement in the future. So the matter is serious on two counts. It is serious in that the Queensland hospital system is at risk. I cannot give honourable senators any information as to how much it is at risk because I would offend against the Standing Orders if I were to say that in Queensland, apparently--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the practice in relation to reports is the same. We have not had that facility as far as the report of the Special Broadcasting Service is concerned. If I might say so, that is not surprising because the Special Broadcasting Service is not an organisation which has complied with the obligations normally imposed on such organisations. The Auditor-General had some remarks to make about the Special Broadcasting Service, the reading of which I commend to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Special Broadcasting Service was set up, I think in 1977, with the opposition of the Australian Labor Party in both Houses of the Parliament. This report covers the financial year 1979-80. It is some ten months since the year in question finished. Much has happened since then. It is not good enough for this report to be tabled at this stage. In fact, it is a matter which I ought to draw to the attention of Senator Rae, as usual, who will no doubt make some comment on it in due course. I also indicate that the report was not available from the office of the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) as expected. It highlights the Government's failure to have a firm policy in relation to ethnic and multicultural affairs, especially for television. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that it was this Senate which said, very wisely in my view, that multicultural television in Australia should not proceed until the inquiry by the Dix committee into the Australian Broadcasting Commission had been completed. We have had no firm statement that the Government has asked the inquiry into the ABC, presided over by Mr Dix, to consider the possibility of the ABC's having a second multicultural television channel. That possibility was canvassed by the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts. It is a possibility that we on the Opposition side of the chamber will continue to canvass, because it is important that the role of the national broadcasting service be considered as embracing the activities of Channel 0, the multicultural television station operating in Melbourne and Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> All this stems from a commitment by the present Government in line with one of the obsessions-if I may quote from the former Minister for Industrial Relations-of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to provide services to ethnic communities, a commitment which springs from a further obsession about the popularity of the former Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, amongst ethnic communities which the present Prime Minister has never been able to attain. That obsession has manifested itself in a number of ill-considered attitudes and expressions of policy in relation to broadcasting. This report is another example of that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> If I might deal first of all with the question of ethnic radio, I state quite clearly that the consistent position of the Opposition has been that in relation to ethnic radio broadcasting, ethnic communities should be placed in exactly the same position as Australian broadcasters, that is, broadcasters whose ethnic origin is in this country. That is not happening. Ethnic radio broadcasting is substantially embraced in the two radio stations 2EA in Sydney and 3EA in Melbourne. Both those stations are subject to government guidelines and directions; they are particularly subject to guidelines and directions in relation to the political content of programs. That is making members of ethnic communities who wish to broadcast in their own languages second class citizens in this country. No political constraints or guidelines, other than the libel laws, are placed on Australian broadcasters. Political guidelines and government guidelines are imposed on ethnic broadcasters in Australia, and we will place ethnic communities in the same position as Australians in relation to radio broadcasts until we give them the same facilities as community broadcasters in Australia have, namely, the right to have their own licences. The most successful ethnic broadcasting in Australia over many years has been 5UB in Adelaide. As a result of an organisation called Ethnic Broadcasting Inc., as I think it was originally called, the ethnic communities agreed amongst themselves on program times, content, and so on, and ran a very successful ethnic radio service through the facilities provided by 5UB in Adelaide. That is an example of a success story which has not been repeated as a result of the establishment of the Special Broadcasting Service in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Special Broadcasting Service legislation contains extraordinary provisions which provide the Minister for Communications with powers to set up, in essence, a government radio. Those provisions should not be included in any legislation of this Parliament. They are totally inconsistent with the legislation establishing the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, and establishing the view that politics should be taken out of broadcasting for Australian broadcasters. </PARA>
<PARA> In a letter of transmittal dated 30 June 1980, which is referred to in this document, we are told, that there is 'turbulence over radio'. That is turbulence over ethnic radio, particularly in Sydney. No explanation is given in this report of what 'turbulence' means. I take it it does not mean a sort of crackling noise over the air waves. I think it means that there have been all sorts of rorts in relation to program co-ordinators in Sydney, all sorts of disputes about the news services provided by ethnic radio, and what should and should not be included in those programs. But there is no explanation in this report of what the term 'turbulence' means. Members of this Parliament are asked to interpret the expression 'turbulence' in the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make one or two general observations. First of all, the financing of ethnic radio through public broadcasting is a policy to which the Opposition is committed. It is the correct policy for Australia in terms of the considerations that I raised earlier. We need to know more about the present situation. No information is available on the possibility of granting public broadcasting licences to ethnic communities. Secondly, I would like to ask the rhetorical question of whether ethnic communities are happy with their ethnic broadcasting input. Last year the Special Broadcasting Service conducted a survey into this matter. On 4 March 1981 I asked whether a survey had been undertaken amongst the ethnic communities to determine their reaction to ethnic radio. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA>if so (a) who commissioned the survey; (b) has the survey been completed and received; (c) who carried out the survey; (d) has the survey been released; and (e) what are the conclusions of the survey. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Communications provided answers to those questions. The survey was done for the Special Broadcasting Service. It is complete. It was carried out by Martyn Research and Associates Pty. Ltd. The recipients of the results of the survey included-surprise, surprise-the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) and the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee), Special Broadcasting Service board members, John Clemenger Pty Ltd and a number of academic institutions. We were then told in the answer to the question that the Special Broadcasting Service issued a Press release on 10 December 1980 summarising the conclusions of the survey, and they are set out in the answer to the question. I ask: Why is the survey not available to the Australian Parliament? Why is it available to John Clemenger Pty Ltd and to certain academics? Why is it available only to members of the Special Broadcasting Service? It would be very interesting to study that survey of the reactions of the ethnic communities to the services provided for them by the Special Broadcasting Service. That survey should be released in full. </PARA>
<PARA> In the limited time available one or two other questions should be asked in relation to the provisions of multicultural television. The important question about multicultural television is: Who is it serving? Might I hazard a guess that it is serving middle class, middle brow or slightly high brow Australians living on the North Shore of Sydney and in suburbs such as Eltham in Melbourne who no longer have to go to the Savoy cinema or to the local continental cinema to see continental films. They can do this in their homes as a result of the multicultural television services which have been provided at enormous costs by the Fraser Government. Might I hazard a suggestion that it is not serving ethnic communities at all, or hardly at all. It is another service which is provided to the literate and the esoteric, the inhabitants, as I said, of suburbs such as Eltham and the north shore of Sydney. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not to mention Hawthorn, as Senator Evans points out. But of course we do have a very high multicultural content in the suburb of Hawthorn-surprisingly high-which I am not sure is true of the suburbs of Eltham and the North Shore of Sydney. I think that is probably the correct answer to the question. But there is no information available about that at all. There is no information as to what are the ratings and effectiveness of multicultural television in respect of its stated purpose of serving ethnic communities in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those who are familiar with the situation are very much aware of the discontent and the disagreement within the ethnic television panel, or whatever it is called, over this very question. There are those who are pursuing the view that multicultural television should serve the needs of ethnic communities and be directed to those purposes. There are those, like Mr Bruce Gyngell, who has announced himself as a professional authoritarian, who will decide what the content of ethnic television in Australia will be. In fact Mr Gyngell has said that it should be for the clientele that I mentioned a moment or so ago. There is a continuing debate about the effectiveness of multicultural television, which is costing the taxpayer in this country an enormous sum of money. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer again to the comments made in the Auditor-General's report and to the questions which were asked in the Senate Estimates Committee about this matter, and in respect of which satisfactory answers were not received. I think I can speak for all honourable senators who attended the relevant Estimates Committee when I say that they left that Committee with the feeling that the Special Broadcasting Service spends money like a many man with no arms, and does so in the interests of the sort of programs to which I referred. I reiterate that there is a need to look at the question of multicultural television in Australia, so-called, in the light of the Dix committee report and the development of a better and more satisfactory national broadcasting service. Might I say that if there is one outstanding thing that has come out of multicultural television in Australia it is the quality of the news services provided by Channel O in Sydney and Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter in connection with multicultural television is the question of how long citizens in other capital cities will be denied the service which is now available in Sydney and Melbourne. That is a problem with which all senators will be familiar because the question consistently raised is when those services will be available in other capital cities. My understanding is that that will be an election promise prior to the next election as the very costly effort in Melbourne and Sydney was a promise prior to the last election. The Opposition strongly endorses the idea of ethnic and multicultural broadcasting services and supports government funding to assist those services to provide the best possible programs. We question very much the structure and effectiveness of the present system. Basically we question the way in which the Broadcasting and Television Act continues to exist in its present form. We commend to the Senate in particular the questions which were asked at the Estimates Committee hearing about the Special Broadcasting Service and the unsatisfactory answers which have been received. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and I also made the plea during the debate on the report. I did it last week when the Bill was before the chamber. I note, from looking at the list of members of the Commonwealth Council for Rural Research and Extension, that Mr Ian McLachlan, a pastoralist from South Australia, was on the Council but resigned in July 1980. I take it that he was replaced by Mr E. N. Fitzpatrick, Director-General of the Department of Agriculture in Western Australia. He was appointed in August 1980 so I take it that he replaced Mr McLachlan. I express my concern that South Australia has missed out again on having a representative on another important body. When I look at the membership of this Council I see that New South Wales has four representatives-Mr Walter Ives, Chairman of the Primary Industry Bank of Australia Ltd, New South Wales; Professor McClymont of the Department of Biochemistry and Nutrition, University of New England; Mr R. M. Watts, Director-General of the Department of Agriculture in New South Wales, and Mr P. D. A. Wright, a pastoralist of New South Wales. Whilst New South Wales has four representatives, Western Australia has one, the Director-General of Agriculture; Victoria one, Dr P. S. Lang, a pastoralist; and the Australian Capital Territory one, Professor Stuart Harris from the Australian National University. Tasmania and Queensland have no representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I look at a couple of matters that were picked up by this Council as needing urgent attention, I find that one relates to pig research and another to poultry research. Among those people who make up the Council I cannot see anyone with expertise in poultry. We have a couple of pastoralists on the Council. I would like to know what they know about running a poultry farm. In my view they know absolutely nothing. The Council saw fit to pick out two matters which need urgent attention-pig research and poultry research. The other matter which needs urgent attention is agricultural engineering. No doubt some of the pastoralists on the Council might have some idea about that, but certainly they would have no idea about the needs of the poultry industry. Whilst the poultry industry has been picked out as one which needs more research, we do not have a poultry expert on the Council. I would have thought that somebody from a poultry research station in one of the States, or somebody from the World Poultry Science Association, which has many people who have great expertise, would have been co-opted to the Commonwealth Council for Rural Research and Extension. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether it is the Government's intention when the terms of office of some of these people expire to appoint someone who has expertise in the poultry and pig industries to carry out this research. From the quick look that I have had at this report I cannot see how long the term of office is for a member of the Commonwealth Council for Rural Research and Extension. </PARA>
<PARA> The poultry industry is one of the very few primary industries in this country, as you well know, Mr President, that stand on their own feet. It does not ask for Commonwealth or State subsidies. It has been able to keep its house in order for many years and it is a very viable industry. While the quota system is in vogue, I cannot see any reason why it will not continue to be a viable industry. </PARA>

Now we find from Senator McClelland, who has had a good look at the razor gang's report, that the Council has been abolished. I need to say no more than express my utter disgust at any government which brings in a report such as this-a report which does not have a covering comment to say that this is the first and last report of the Commonwealth Council for Rural Research and Extension.

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The report I have just tabled deals with item 15 in the 73rd series of variations of the plan of layout of the city of Canberra and its environs. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory presented its report on the other 16 items contained in the 73rd series on 5 May 1981. At a meeting to consider the 73rd series the Committee decided to defer consideration of this item until further information on the proposal had been obtained from the Department of the Capital Territory. Variation 15 is in the Jerrabombera-Tuggeranong district and is part of the Hume industrial estate. It concerns the construction of a road which would service industrial sites. The industry which would initially use this road is Koppers, a timber processing plant. The proposed road reservation is in the southern portion of the estate designated by the National Capital Development Commission as an area identified for large scale industrial use. </PARA>
<PARA> The main concern of this Committee and the reason further investigation of this proposal was undertaken was due to the lack of legislation controlling air, noise and water pollution in the Territory. The Committee wishes to place on record its disappointment concerning the slow progress of proposed pollution legislation which has been under consideration for some years. Assurances have now been given by the Department of the Capital Territory that such legislation will be introduced by the end of 1981 and the Committee welcomes this development. In its examination of the proposal the Committee is not satisfied with the practice of burning waste timber in the open which is presently taking place in the area. This is discussed in greater detail in the report. The Committee approves variation 15 but recommends that the period of grace for existing operators to conform with the proposed pollution legislation in the Australian Capital Territory be reduced to three years from when the new ordinance takes effect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This claim was the eighth to be heard by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner under the provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. The Act provides, amongst other things, a mechanism whereby Aboriginals may lodge claims to unalienated or vacant Crown land in the Northern Territory on the basis of traditional ownership of that land, and for the claims to be heard by the Commissioner who then reports to me and to the Administrator of the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The present claim comprised a narrow strip of coastal land in the Gulf of Carpentaria adjoining the southern boundary of Arnhem Land, together with several off-shore islands and reefs, totalling 768 square kilometres. Approximately 57 per cent of the coastal strip is subject to inundation and mangroves line much of the coast and estuaries. The Commissioner found that the land is unalienated Crown land, that there are Aboriginals who are the traditional owners of the land, and there is a strong attachment by the claimants to most of the land claimed but not to Maria Island-the largest of the off-shore islands. After hearing evidence from some 67 witnesses and having regard to the strength of the claimants' attachment to the land, the Commissioner recommended that the land other than Maria Island be granted to an Aboriginal land trust. Such a grant would benefit not only the traditional owners, who number 150, but also others with a traditional attachment to the land-in all about 250 people. </PARA>
<PARA> After carefully considering the Commissioner's report and the transcript of evidence, including the evidence of likely detriment to commercial fishermen and others, I am satisfied that except for a small excision, the land other than Maria Island should be granted to an Aboriginal land trust, as recommended by the Commissioner. In accordance with past practice and as recommended by the Commissioner, I will recommend to the Governor-General that the grant be made to the low water mark. The Commissioner commented that a grant in accordance with his recommendation would be likely to result in some detriment to commercial fishermen, and to residents of the town and district of Katherine who use the rivers in the claim area for recreational or leisure purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner has suggested that an excision of 20 hectares near the mouth of the Roper River be provided, primarily for use by commercial fishermen who would benefit by having an area set aside to provide access to the river with space to camp and carry out repairs. This area could also be used by tourists and Katherine residents seeking a place to launch boats. I have decided to excise such an area from the land to be granted and although it will be in the vicinity of an area known as the Number One Landing, I shall make no decision as to its precise location until the Northern Territory Government, the Northern Land Council and representatives of the commercial fishermen have had an opportunity to discuss the matter with a view to reaching a consensus as to the precise boundary. There are two roads on the claim area over which the Commissioner found the public has a right of way and these will be excluded from the grant as required by the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. I shall establish a land trust and will recommend to the Governor-General that a grant of an estate in fee simple in the land be made to the trust. </PARA>

<PARA>That the Senate take note of the paper and the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to make a few remarks because I am very concerned at what is happening in respect of the granting of land to Aborigines. On this occasion the Aboriginal Land Commissioner has recommended that an area be precluded from the land to be granted. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) has, after consultation with the Northern Territory authorities, agreed with that recommendation because the area of land may be of some value to fishermen and to tourists. Most of the land to be granted is subject to inundation; it is swamp area. Apparently Aborigines get only land which is of no use to anyone else. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="757">Senator CAVANAGH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my statement and it is somewhat supported by the evidence. We know that at Borroloola when land was excised from a proposed grant to be used as a travelling route by the mining company and the mining company made available a suitable area of land a swap of land took place. On 7 April I asked a question on the granting of land at Mudbura. The Land Commissioner had recommended the granting of land with the exception of one square mile for stock route and quarantine purposes but the Minister in his wisdom did not accept the Commissioner's recommendation. Instead, the Minister decided that five square miles of land should be excluded from the grant. I asked whether the land would be used as a stock route and for quarantine purposes or had some other value. The Minister replied to me by way of a letter. He said that after referring the matter to the Northern Territory Administration it was decided that five square miles would be excluded from the grant. Obviously the decision is made by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, not by the Australian Government. It is pertinent to point out that the Commissioner stated he had made the recommendation on the evidence of the Northern Territory Department of Primary Production. If it is up to a Minister to decide what land is to be granted it will be on the basis of political opportunity or favouritism. The Commonwealth established the Aboriginal Land Commission to get over that sort of problem. We appointed an impartial commissioner who is compelled to make a recommendation on the evidence that is presented to him. The evidence presented to the commissioner in the Mudbura claim indicated that one square mile should be excluded from the grant but the Chief Minister said, after consideration: 'No, we want five square miles'. The Minister has decided to exclude five square miles. I think it is important to point out for the record that the question I asked was without notice but the Minister was unable to reply at the time I asked the question because the grant of land had been approved under the previous Minister. As the present Minister replied to me by way of letter on 5 May 1981, I therefore seek leave to have the reply incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Aboriginal Affairs Canberra, A.C.T. 2600 5 May 1981</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Cavanagh,</PARA>
<PARA> On 7 April 1981 you put to me a Question Without Notice concerning the Yingawunarri Mudbura Aboriginal Land Claim. As your question dealt with a decision of the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, I undertook to examine the matter and provide you with an answer. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act the Aboriginal Land Commissioner reports on each land claim to both the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Administrator of the Northern Territory, who in turn passes the report to the Chief Minister's Department. Before any decision is taken on the granting of a claim, the Minister obtains the views of the Northern Territory Government, as it is Northern Territory Crown land which is alienated by the granting of a claim. </PARA>
<PARA> In his report on the Yingawunarri Mudbura claim the Aboriginal Land Commissioner did not recommend that one square mile around Pussycat bore be excluded, but he commented that the evidence ''did demonstrate a value in the retention of an area of one mile square or thereabouts around Pussycat bore''. The Northern Territory Acting Chief Minister, after reviewing the Commissioner's report, suggested that a five square mile excision might be more realistic for quarantine purposes, particularly where larger stock numbers are quarantined for an extended period of time. This view was not presented to the Land Commissioner at the time of the hearing. What was put forward, however, by the Northern Territory Department of Primary Production was that a one square mile reserve around Pussycat bore would be the ''absolute minimum'' area required for quarantine purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney was satisfied that the larger excision proposed by the Northern Territory Government was required and announced his decision accordingly. The exclusion is for quarantine purposes only. </PARA>
<PARA> Title deeds for the land grant have not yet been prepared. The NT Chief Minister has agreed to close a disused section of road known as the Murranji track, which the Commissioner had found to be a public road and therefore liable for exclusion from the grant. This road passed through some of the best country on the claim and included an important sacred site. Its closure will enable the land concerned to be included in the land grant. </PARA>
<PARA> At paragraph 25 of his annual report the Aboriginal Land Commissioner notes that ''there is no inconsistency at all involved in accepting the recommendations and excluding the five square miles''. Questions of competing land use, such as arose during this hearing, must ultimately be decided by government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only other point I want to make is an important one because it relates to what the Minister said today about discussions with the Northern Land Council. In return for excising an extra four square miles from the grant of land at Mudbura the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory has closed a disused section of the road known as the Murranji track which the Commissioner had found to be public road and therefore liable for exclusion from the grant. In exchange for four square miles of land which the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory wants to retain and without any justification on the evidence presented to the Commissioner, there has been a closure of the road. It looks as though following consultation there was a trade off in land which the Northern Territory Administration did not want for land that it does want, contrary to the Commissioner's recommendation. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs made certain recommendations in relation to Kakadu National Park. A uranium mining company found that its activities extended into areas which were not excluded from the Kakadu National Park. The need for its mining operations to be extended was greater than the company thought. That was what it claimed. The Minister, in a statement to the House--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am trying to make a point. The Minister went there yesterday to hold discussions. I should like to mention that the same thing happened in relation to this claim as happened at Mudbura. There was a trade-off of land. Some area of the escarpment might be granted to Aboriginals as a trade-off to allow the mining company to operate in a particular area. This has nothing to do with impartiality, the consideration of traditional rights and so on. It is a question simply of trading off one area of land for another which the Commissioner found should rightfully belong to Aboriginals. What I am saying is that we do not know the actual findings of the Commissioner in this case, but the Commissioner has recommended the excision of land, possibly with the consent of the Aboriginals. Are the Aboriginals getting a fair deal? Should we establish the position of Aboriginal Land Commissioner to decide such questions but then allow the Government to make the decision? That is the whole point. Although the Act provides that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has the right to make the decisions it would appear that the Northern Territory Chief Minister is making decisions on what land should be given to the Aboriginals. I am fearful because of the rotten deal the Aboriginals in the Northern Territory are getting.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cavanagh did not seek leave to continue his remarks. Therefore I should like to speak for a couple of minutes and then seek leave to continue my remarks. We should like to debate this matter at a later stage. I have a couple of points to make. It was very disappointing that the report was not available to us today so that we could examine it. We were given a copy of the statement two hours before it was presented in this place. We have not seen the report although I understand that some copies were made available to other people. I will not take that matter any further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason the report should have been available today is that there is much to be said about it. I ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) to give the Senate some assurance that the matter will be brought on for debate fairly soon. I will not press this point strongly in view of private comments made to me by the Minister. He said that we will be able to debate a number of related matters later. A couple of points must be mentioned. Maria Island must be mentioned. Unless we are given further information we must question whether this will be another situation like the Borroloola land claim when the island was given to Mount Isa Mines Ltd against the wishes of the people. </PARA>
<PARA> We must ask, as Senator Cavanagh has asked, what will happen to professional fishermen with the excision of this land. We must query this point. We do not know the purpose for the excision of land. We do not know whether the Aboriginal people will have any rights. We do not know whether another case will arise where the barramundi industry will be interfered with by professional people dragging the rivers. We must certainly put a question mark against any excision of land at the mouth of the Roper River. Twenty hectares of land is a large amount. We do not know the reaction of the Aboriginal people to the suggestion that such an excision take place. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicate that members of the Opposition would like this debate brought on fairly soon so we can have an opportunity to examine the document which has been circulating since this morning and have an opportunity to discuss these matters with the Aboriginal people involved. We can then be assured-the Minister has given an assurance-that the Aboriginal people have been well satisfied. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill is an omnibus Bill by which the Government seeks to extend and update the Quarantine Act: To provide comprehensive quarantine and disease control arrangements for the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Territory; to give effect to outstanding recommendations for legislative change put forward by the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources in its report on the adequacy of quarantine; and to make additional provisions and amendments and to provide additional powers which are required for effective quarantine administration and enforcement in Australia. The Bill is a reflection of the Government's strong commitment to an efficient quarantine service which must continue to play an effective and major role in Australia's social and economic well-being. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will know that a high security animal quarantine station is under construction in the Territory of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The station will provide a safe means of achieving genetic improvement in our economic livestock through the importation of genetically superior animals from disease risk areas of the world. Without the security of an offshore station, importation of such animals from all but a very few countries could not be contemplated. Current estimates are that construction of the station will be completed in September 1981. Security of the station depends on appropriate quarantine and other disease control arrangments for the Territory as a whole. Because of the integrated nature of the arrangements which are required the legislation must encompass animal, plant, general and human quarantine areas and authorise all necessary measures to prevent the introduction or spread of diseases affecting animals, plants and man. The Government has decided that these comprehensive quarantine arrangements would best be achieved by extending to the Territory, with amendment where necessary for Territory application, the relevant powers, functions and requirements of the Quarantine Act. The proposed legislation would differentiate between Australia and the Territory to ensure that suitable controls can be exercised over the movement of vessels, people, animals, plants and goods between Australia and the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes provision for the internal control of diseases and pests of animals and plants in the Territory. These powers are exercised in Australia by State authorities under State legislation and form an integral part of Australia's overall animal and plant protection framework. These necessary State-type powers are not currently available in the Territory. I draw the attention of honourable senators to clause 4 of the Bill which provides for the application of the Quarantine Act in the Territory. Clause 7 of the Bill amends section 13 of the Act to authorise the Governor-General to make proclamations which will prohibit or control the importation of animals, plants or goods into the territory from Australia or overseas. I would like to emphasise that for the purposes of entry into Australia of persons, vessels, goods, animals or plants the Cocos Islands will continue to be regarded as an overseas place under the amended legislation. Similarly Australia will be an oversea place for the purpose of entry into Cocos. Clause 41 provides for the making of regulations relating, inter alia, to the internal State-type stock and plant disease control measures to which I have referred. The system for setting the fees which are to apply for the management and maintenance of animals at the quarantine station will also be provided for in the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to turn to the report of the Senate Committee on National Resources. This report 'The Adequacy of Quarantine And Other Control Measures To Protect Australia's Pastoral Industries From The Introduction And Spread Of Exotic Livestock And Plant Diseases' was tabled in November 1979. The Committee recommended, inter alia, that the Quarantine Act be amended to eliminate problems relating to the granting of pratique and the lack of certain powers for quarantine officers, and to provide legislative support for contemporary quarantine problems not currently covered by the Act. The Government's reponse to the Committee's report was tabled in this chamber in September 1980. The Government pointed out that although many of the important matters referred to by the Committee had been taken up by the Quarantine Amendment Act 1979, the need for further legislative action would be closely examined in the light of the Committee's concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before the Senate proposes amendments developed in the light of the Committee's views. It follows an extensive review of relevant legislation and current quarantine requirements and problems. I would like to highlight some of the more important changes: Firstly there are new arrangements regarding imported animals, plants and goods which will ensure that they remain under quarantine control until specifically released. Presently the granting of pratique to the vessel releases all the goods on board. The Bill also makes provision for pratique to be granted by radio message as well as by conventional means. New powers for the examination of imported animals, plants and goods before and after release from quarantine are included in clauses 24 and 27. An examination under these provisions would include sampling and testing. The Bill provides power for quarantine officers to ask questions, require documents or samples and undertake tests in relation to goods which are, or are suspected to have been, subject to quarantine. There are also new powers under warrant to enter premises for the purpose of examining goods, including animals and plants which are subject to quarantine. Finally, the power to order imported goods, animals and plants into quarantine on disease grounds are clarified and expanded. Mr President, I believe that these and other amendments contained in the Bill, taken in conjunction with the amendments effected in the Quarantine Amendment Act 1979 meet the specific concerns raised by the Senate Committee on National Resources which are appropriate to quarantine legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also rectifies a number of other deficiencies identified during the Department's examination. Section 20 of the Act makes it an offence for the master of an overseas vessel arriving in Australia to enter any port other than a port that has been declared to be a first port of entry. It is not an offence to land anywhere on the coast other than at a port. Clause 15 would extend the provision to make it an offence for the master of an oversea vessel to beach the vessel or to anchor or moor the vessel above the low water mark around the shore of Australia or the Cocos Islands, excepting under stress of weather or other reasonable cause. Section 69A of the Act provides for compensation under certain circumstances for goods, including animals or plants, which are destroyed under the Act for disease reasons. These arrangements were introduced in 1979 to encourage co-operation from owners and to facilitate prompt action in exotic disease eradication operations. The appropriateness of these compensation provisions for imported livestock species and certain other classes of imported animals has been reviewed. Advice to the Government is that no other major livestock importing nation-that is, Canada, the United States of America, New Zealand and the United Kingdom-compensates where destruction of imported livestock is ordered for disease reasons at a quarantine station. Inquiries in Australia indicate that this eventuality, should it occur at an Australian mainland station or the Cocos Island station, is an insurable risk. </PARA>
<PARA> In the circumstances, the Government has concluded that it is reasonable for Australian importers of livestock and certain other classes of animals to carry the risk of destruction in a quarantine station under the Act as part of total importation costs. The Bill therefore provides at clause 33 that imported horses, asses, mules, pigs and ruminants, animals imported for a zoo or circus, or animals imported for research will not qualify for compensation if they are destroyed at a quarantine station under the Act and had been in quarantine at all times between their importation and destruction. Compensation will still be paid for these types of animals if after release from the quarantine station they are later ordered into quarantine and destroyed. Compensation will also be available under the Act for other imported species such as cats and dogs, lawfully imported and for all animals of Australian origin. </PARA>
<PARA> I now draw the attention of honourable senators to clause 38 of the Bill. During the course of coastal surveillance operations, a number of unauthorised landings in Australia have been reported. In the main, these breaches of quarantine legislation have been by foreign fishing vessels. These quarantine breaches by small craft in remote areas of Australia pose grave threats of the introduction of major exotic diseases. Foot and mouth disease, Newcastle disease and rabies are some of the diseases from which Australia is free but which are well established in adjacent countries. Much of our northern coastline is backed by economically important livestock areas which are also abundantly populated with feral animals and insect vectors capable of transmitting any introduced exotic disease. For this reason any reports of an unauthorised landing evoke a quarantine investigation of the landing place and appropriate measures to minimise the possibility of disease introduction. </PARA>
<PARA> Quarantine actions of this type have highlighted serious practical deficiencies in the relevant enforcement and penalty provisions of the Act. Amongst other things, powers to apprehend or detain vessels used in connection with major contraventions of the Act are inadequate. Also there are no provisions which compel persons on such vessels to comply with directions regarding quarantine clearances. As matters now stand quarantine measures can be nullified by non-compliance. Further, present penalties have little practical relevance or deterrent value in the situations which have been encountered. Accordingly clause 38 of the Bill inserts new section 75A which authorises the detention of vessels of less than 45 metres in length or aircraft which are believed on reasonable grounds, to have been used in or in connection with certain specified major breaches of quarantine legislation. The Minister for Health may, after consideration of the circumstances, direct that the vessel be returned to the master or owner. In other cases the vessel will be forfeited to the Crown unless the owner brings an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for the return of the vessel within a prescribed period and the court finds that the vessel was not used in connection with a breach of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The new section also empowers quarantine officers to destroy any goods which may present a disease risk or any animals or plants which are on board, or which he believes have been on board the detained vessel. Honourable senators should note that at section 75C an approved person is also empowered to destroy overseas animals which he locates on any prescribed sea vessel in Australian waters, unless he is satisfied that arrangements exist for the security of those animals. The possible escape of such animals present an unacceptable disease risk. These new provisions demonstrate the Government's determination to provide the strongest possible deterrent to unauthorised landings in Australia and to the disease threat that these and other activities pose. The Government is not prepared to tolerate activities of this kind which place our economic and social livelihood at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I draw the attention of honourable senators to clause 35 of the Bill. This clause inserts a new section which relates to the provision of quarantine information to travellers to Australia. Honourable senators will be aware that unauthorised importations of animal and plant materials by overseas visitors or returning Australians are a major potential source of disease introduction. Large quantities of such materials are intercepted at our international ports of entry. Better co-operation from an informed travelling public is essential if we are to continue to maintain the quarantine security on which our economic wellbeing depends. As one step towards this objective the Government is conducting a major national quarantine publicity campaign to increase awareness and encourage individual responsibility and self-regulation in quarantine matters. The Government has now decided on additional measures to ensure that travellers to Australia are informed of our quarantine requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, proposed section 74AA requires the masters of all vessels travelling to Australia, including aircraft, to advise everyone on board of our quarantine requirements. The content and form of such advice are to be in accordance with approvals of the Director of Quarantine. Mr President, the Bill before the Senate is a most important piece of legislation. It would provide our quarantine service with increased capacity to meet Australia's present and future needs. It is a Bill which should receive support from all sections of the Senate. Mr President, I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I know that the Senate has requested in the past that tabling statements made when Estimates committees' reports are presented should be brief. I shall try to be brief. I want to bring to the attention of the Senate a couple of matters relating to the report of Estimates Committee B because I think they are important. Indeed, I think they are quite startling. It is unusual for Estimates committees, when considering Additional Estimates, to find matters of such substance as to entertain them at any great length. However, when the report of this Committee is printed and available to senators they will find that it is 15 pages long. Estimates Committee B found a number of matters which it considers to be very serious and which the Committee of the Whole should spend some time scrutinising when it debates the Estimates. The Committee of the Whole should give some thought to what it means for the future of Estimates Committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Essentially, I want to refer to two types of issues that are raised in the report-that is, where departments have engaged in things which are in contravention of Acts of Parliament and where Estimates committees, indeed the Parliament, are given contradictory or unreliable evidence. I draw the Senate's attention in particular to the 1978-79 report of the Special Broadcasting Service, which the Committee is recommending ought to go to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations for investigation and report, in which it was claimed four times in evidence by a departmental witness that a Minister of the Crown told departmental officers that they did not have to comply with the Broadcasting and Television Act in relation to providing a report to Parliament on their activities and to other instances where the Audit Act and finance regulations have not been complied with in what appear to be very serious terms. I mention this because supplementary evidence that was given was unsatisfactory to the extent that in what is a very serious matter, a matter of giving someone nearly $200,000 of public funds, $100,000 was given on certain conditions which were not complied with, namely, accounting for how those funds were used and an additional $93,000 was forwarded even though there might have been reason to believe, at the time when additional funds were asked for, that some questions should be raised. </PARA>
<PARA> In supplying additional information-and there is a great deal of it-the Department of Home Affairs and Environment supplied a covering statement in which it refers to an attached statement from Mr Warby, who is the gentleman concerned in this through his accountant, on cash disbursement from 1 June 1980 to 20 August. When one looks at that attachment one sees reference to an accountant's compilation report. That report was not supplied to the Committee with the additional evidence that was given by the Department. We have it and it will be available but only because the Secretary of the Committee requested the Department to make it available. We refer to one paragraph of it which is very disquieting indeed because it seems to indicate that very serious questions should be raised as to the method of accounting for $100,000 of public funds and in relation to granting another $93,000 of public funds. The covering statement provided by the Department indicates that the approval was given for further money to be paid to Mr Warby on 27 August 1980. The date of this accountant's statement is 21 August 1980. It does not explain whether the accountant's statement which says things such as 'the accounts are not presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles' was in the Government's hands at the time it made that additional grant. </PARA>
<PARA> One other matter which I think should disturb us greatly and which we might look for in consideration of Supplementary Estimates in the Committee of the Whole is that of contradictory or unreliable evidence. In one case-the Southern Cross Replica Museum which was mentioned in the report-contradictory evidence was given by the Department of Home Affairs and Environment and subsequently by the Department of Finance. The evidence from the Department of Finance appears to be correct. On the subject of observance of Australia Day, contradictory information was given by the Department of Home Affairs and Environment, by the Department of Communications and by an Australian Broadcasting Commission officer. It appears that the Australian Broadcasting Commission officer was telling the truth. On the subject of international standard sports facilities on which information was also given by the Department of Home Affairs and Environment, it is clear that the explanations given in the explanatory notes to this Parliament are misleading. I raise the question whether they were intended to mislead. That raises a question in relation to all our consideration of Supplementary Estimates and whether we can accept, at face value, explanations that we are given. The fact that the explanation given was highly misleading is something that was come across only by accident by the Committee. There was nothing to indicate that there was anything at all untoward in that supplementary appropriation or its explanation. I believe that they are points that honourable senators should be looking at when they move into consideration of Estimates committees' reports and indeed of the Supplementary Estimates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not oppose these Bills which give effect to one of the key decisions made by the Government last year with respect to assistance to the textile, clothing and footwear industry. The scheme introduced by the legislation involves a two-tier quota system. First of all, there is a base quota made up of 85 per cent of the initially established quotas for each item, which base quota is to be allocated among established importers. The remaining tier involves what is described as a tender quota which constitutes the remaining portion of 15 per cent and which may be extended in practice in certain circumstances in the future. It is to be available for sale on a Dutch auction basis to bona fide importers, the idea being to provide easier and more flexible access to import quotas by both new importers and those already in the market who are wanting to expand their market share.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition approaches any scheme involving substantial protection for any Australian industry with a very considerable degree of caution because any such protection does, of course, involve by its very nature substantial penalties for Australian consumers. But we are all too well aware that over 120,000 jobs are at stake in the textile, clothing and footwear industry. A great many of those jobs, of course, are in regional areas, especially in Victoria, where there simply is no conceivable alternative employment available now and nor will there be in the reasonably foreseeable future on an appropriate scale. We have also consistently supported the view of the Crawford study group on structural adjustment that whatever might be the strength of the case for a longer term reduction in protection in industries such as this, drastic reductions in protection simply cannot be contemplated at times of high unemployment. The present rate of over 6 per cent-it is much higher than that if one includes invisible unemployment-is simply impossibly high by any historical or, indeed, any humane standard. Furthermore, we in the Opposition, focusing now more narrowly on the legislation before us, have taken the view that the specific kind of protection that is involved in import quotas is appropriate to the kind of industry which we have here, although it may not be so for other industries in other circumstances. It probably is the case that only quota protection of this type is likely to produce the kind of certainty which will encourage the textile, clothing and footwear industry to invest, over time, in new plant of such a kind as will enable it to become more competitive in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> All that said, we nonetheless have some reservations about this legislation or, if not the legislation itself, about the administrative and larger economic context in which it is introduced. Let me briefly indicate what those reservations are. There is no need for me to go on in any detail about this matter since these and other points I have made have in fact been canvassed already in the other place. There are three or four short points I wish to make. The first point is that there are clear opportunities for profiteering by those privileged persons holding base quotas unless the rate of duty on the base quota for each item is reconsidered annually and is adjusted in line with the trend of prices that is in fact revealed by the tender system. Some indication from the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) that this is in fact intended, although it does not appear on the face of the legislation, I think, would be welcomed and in the public interest. The second point is that there is a real prospect, unless the scheme is again properly administered, that a number of large importers will tie up the market here and that small firms will be excluded. The crucial factor is the amount of the security which will be required. Like my colleague in the other place, I repeat the call of Mr Clive Rodger of the Apparel Importers and Manufacturers Association of Australia, who has strenuously made the point that the amounts required by way of security should be calculated with this consideration very centrally in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point I make is that if the right to buy and sell quotas is not to be abused and exploited by persons who are not bona fide importers, the formal provisions of the new legislation, as effective as they may well be on paper, will have to be enforced. There must be very grave doubts about the capacity of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs to do this when it, like every other department in the Federal Government at the moment, is subject to the savagery of the razor gang cuts, in particular the three per cent wind-back on administrative expenses to which all departments and authorities are to be subject and, beyond that, of course, the further 2 per cent reduction in staff ceilings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General's report for March 1981 demonstrated with fairly breathtaking clarity just how the staff ceilings that had already been applied prior to the razor gang have had a quite devastating effect on the efficiency of a number of departments charged with law enforcement activities and revenue collection activities. It is a very real concern on the part of the Opposition and, I imagine, many of those in the industry too that the Department simply will not have the resources available to it to engage in this new form of administration which is involved in this quota scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I make is a more general one and that is that we cannot but notice the degree to which the Government is willing to protect the private sector from the rigours of free market competition in areas such as this but at the same time is engaged on what can really be described only as a rampage of deregulation when it comes to beneficial and proper interventions in that market by bodies such as the Prices Justification Tribunal, which is now to be abolished, and by the Trade Practices Commission, which is to be emasculated. The private sector just simply should not be allowed to have it both ways in this respect. If the private sector is to be nurtured in the public interest by protective arrangements such as those embodied in this legislation, in the public interest it should also be subject to that degree of discipline which is enforced by organisations such as the Prices Justification Tribunal and the Trade Practices Commission where that discipline is manifestly unable to be administered or is unwillingly administered by the market. But to ask the Government to act in a way which does not give the private sector the advantages of its beneficence, both coming and going, is of course to ask the Government to act both rationally and in the national interest. Regrettably, they are not characteristics which we have all too often been able to recognise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take issue with Senator Evans on only one point, and that is the need to distinguish between free competition and fair competition, particularly when most of that competition comes from countries whose governments highly subsidise an export, quite often for the purpose of merely generating hard currencies. But I come back to the main point. In August last year the Government announced its decision in relation to the Industries Assistance Commission report on the clothing, textile and footwear industries. Although basically the Government rejected the main thrust of that report, which advocated, honourable senators may recall, progressive reduction in protection of those industries, it took up a number of features which it believed or acknowledged were desirable. The Customs Amendment (Tenders) Bill, the Customs Securities (Penalties) Bill and the Customs Undertakings (Penalties) Bill reflect those Government decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But we must recognise that the Government, in its wisdom, as from 1 January 1982 has provided a 7-year period of protection to those industries. The Government believes, I must say, contrary to a great deal of industry advice, in the need to open up the quota area. In its endeavour to do this it has recognised two distinct types of quota. The first type of quota is a base quota, and the second type is a quota based on a tender system. In the base quota, 85 per cent will initially be reserved, which will establish a quota ceiling. This 85 per cent is based on data for the year 1979-80 and will apply as from 1982. The purpose is to protect those industries which have been established in the trade over a number of years and to provide a degree of continuity. Some argue that possibly the 85 per cent is too high and that it gives, as Senator Evans rightly said, an opportunity to trade and to profit unduly in the event of substantial price rises. I acknowledge that point. </PARA>
<PARA> The second feature contains a tender element, and this takes up the remainder. The remainder will be a minimum of 15 per cent. This remainder is subject to two additional factors. A growth factor is built into the 15 per cent. Another factor is called the liberalisation factor. Nowhere in the legislation do we see this 85 per cent or the remainder, which is essentially 15 per cent plus the growth of liberalised factors, mentioned. That comes by way of ministerial statement. So I believe that with a change of government heart or attitude this possibly could change, although I say it may be undesirable to change it at this point. This leads me to believe that we will see a general liberalisation of the import quota system. I think this is further evidenced by virtue of introducing a tender system providing for these two factors, a growth factor and a liberalisation factor. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we also have to recognise that it is right and proper that what economists would refer to as the scarcity rent value accrues not to individuals but to the Government. As to the 85 per cent, it accrues to individuals. Under the tender system, the scarcity rent value accrues to the Government. That is right and proper. However, some critics tend to say: 'Is this not really immoral? Is it not really a duty on a duty, in effect a double duty?' We must recognise that factor, but I believe the argument that the scarcity rent value should accrue to the Government is the superior argument and must prevail. Therefore, taking these factors into consideration, one must assume that over the next six or seven years there will be a liberalisation of quotas, which will open up import competition. </PARA>
<PARA> A further feature of the program which I believe deserves comment, but reference to which is not found in the Bills before us today, is the new system of paying a bounty on cotton spun yarns. It is to be regretted that there is so little understanding of some of the problems in this area and that it is taking so long to bring into effect, despite the goodwill on the part of government officers, who are trying to establish an acceptable scheme, and the industry itself. There is a genuine fear that if the suggested levels in this area of activity prevail, this system, which is regarded as one of the more efficient in the textile industry, will be quite uncompetitive. We would then be faced with the dilemma of having a scheme which, because it has not been properly devised, will run counter to the genuine philosophy of providing adequate protection for at least the next seven years. Few people recognise the large degree of rationalisation and restructuring that has taken place in the clothing, textile and footwear industries. The media continue to peddle this free trade argument, as do importers, consumer groups, farmer organisations, retailers, resource-based operatives or industries--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And some Government senators, from Western Australia in particular. They fail to recognise the impact that inevitably this restructuring will have on people's lives. People are our most important commodity, although that is possibly a bad term to use. Too often, the decisions of the Industries Assistance Commission fail to recognise the social consequences which may flow therefrom. The Government should place far more emphasis on the need for the Commission to bear this in mind. I refer, for instance, to the tremendous dislocation such decisions can produce, especially in decentralised areas, where opportunities are fairly limited. All the developed nations which desire to improve, or at least maintain, their standard of living enjoy a high degree of protection. We acknowledge that that is true of Australia, but it is also true of the United States of America, the countries of the European Economic Community and Japan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many groups which advocate free trade themselves enjoy a large measure of protection, though in a different form. Currently there is much news of change in the banking industry. That industry is possibly the most highly protected of any in Australia, but that protection is spoken of very little. The industry is surrounded by a plethora of government legislation and regulation. The primary industries also enjoy considerable income tax incentives. Again the service industries, such as the Public Service, insurance companies and the like, enjoy a high degree of protection if only by virtue of location. To import cheap labour is against the Australian philosophy. Apparently it is one thing to import cheap goods but contrary to our philosophy to import cheap labour. I am not advocating that that should be done but pointing out that that inconsistency of argument often prevails among those who advocate the freeing of trade. </PARA>
<PARA> That leads me to the observation that it is quite incredible that at a time when employers potentially have many jobs to offer the unemployed, whose problems are accelerating daily, the wage mechanism appears to be getting out of kilter. Although employers say, 'Yes, we want to put on more people', they have not the resources or returns to justify doing so. Unless we can resolve that dilemma in our day and age we will be in for some major problems. We must overcome it. We have resources to develop. We have manpower-many of whom are unemployed at this time-but there is something wrong with the pricing mechanism, in that the price of certain types of labour is being bid so high that those who are essentially unskilled are finding it extremely difficult to enter the work force. Once they have been out of the work force for a considerable period after leaving school it becomes extremely difficult for them to re-enter it. It is far easier to go from one job to another than it is to go from a state of being unemployed to one of being employed. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to draw attention to certain points that are not generally recognised. They relate to dealings with developing countries. Those countries, because of preferential rates of duty, have better access to the Australian market than most people recognise. From the beginning of the seven year program of protection, quotas in some areas will be increased annually by between one per cent and 9 per cent. Therefore, let us not believe that an overall blanket of protection is to prevail. Many representatives of Australian industry are claiming that the protection afforded them is inadequate. The free trade element must be very happy with this Bill and with the fact that quotas will be raised annually by between one per cent and 9 per cent. These indeed represent large figures. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish now to refer to a matter that was raised by John Collins, the chief executive of Bradmill Industries, which is one of the largest textile organisations in Australia. In the company's annual report, speaking of the developing countries, he states:</PARA>
<PARA> Around 150 countries will be able to sell products on to the Australian market without controls by quota at prices even more competitive than other imports. The result of this could be extremely damaging to the very industries the assistance program is designed to protect. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government needs to re-assess, on an appropriate needs basis, a formula for determining the eligibility criteria for classification as a 'developing country'. Too many nations are taking advantage of this particular provision. Potentially, their actions could throw thousands of people in Australia out of jobs. We need to re-assess the basis for deciding which countries are truly developing and which are not. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 15 per cent of the quota will be offered for sale by way of tender, the Customs Amendment (Tenders) Bill is necessary in order to formulate the administrative arrangements for determining the operations of a tender system. Basically, the higher the price tendered by a person the higher will be his priority in relation to the allocation of the quantum for which he tenders. However, the price will be determined by the lowest acceptable tender submitted. Naturally, it will be necessary to ensure that those who tender will give undertakings that they will take up the amount for which they have tendered. To ensure that they do so, there must be appropriate penalties. Hence the need for two of these Bills-the Customs Securities (Penalties) Bill and the Customs Undertakings (Penalties) Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation also provides an opportunity for transferring rights to import goods at concessional rates of duty, but before that can be done the Minister will require two types of undertakings: Firstly, a security for the payment of the penalty and, secondly, a security or an undertaking to import the quantity at the price which was tendered for. That is designed to prevent an underutilisation of the particular tender. I believe two major reservations have emerged as a result of this contemplated legislation. First, large companies could dominate the tender system. However, in answer to that, the small and specialist importer or retailer can bid fairly high because he has a market in which he can establish a satisfactory margin. On the other hand, there would be a real danger should the G. J. Coles and Woolworths of this area bid too high. As they are going to take up the bulk of the tender, if they bid too high they might become uncompetitive in the market. This will be the discipline which will prevent them from essentially bidding too high a price and which will determine the allocation price for all tenders, including the specialist tenders. </PARA>
<PARA> The other reservation that some people have is that quotas could be bought by merchant banks, which could resell them to the highest bidder. Whether that is an objection remains to be seen. The merchant bank has to provide the undertakings and the security. Should it fail to sell off those rights, it would have to pay the penalty. If it bid too high it would not establish an adequate market, would lose on the deal and, next time round, would be less attracted to the particular system. I commend these Bills to the Senate, but only as part of a trade-off. That trade-off was a recognition that the Government in the main would provide an adequate measure of protection. We could not get as much as we had hoped for and I regard this legislation as a bit of a quid pro quo for the main thrust of what we were seeking, which was the protection of jobs in the textile, clothing and footwear industry, to provide a degree of security to the people working in the industry. I commend the Bills to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators for their support of the legislation. I draw attention to one or two remarks which my colleagues have made, in particular Senator Watson's concerns, obviously sincerely expressed, for the people with whom he has contact and who are employed in industry not only in Tasmania but also in other parts of Australia. The government policy incorporated in this legislation is designed to express the conscious concern of the Government about the disruptive effects of any major changes which could occur in the kind of marketing proposals that other people may have been proposing. Consequently, the setting of a base quota at 85 per cent, with a freeing up of the 15 per cent tender quota, appears to be a reasonable approach to the problem and certainly heads down the track of establishing a freer market in the textile, clothing and footwear industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clearly Senator Watson was seeking some kind of information from me with regard to the Government's policy on future direction. All I can say in that regard is that understandably the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) will be reviewing this whole matter in his statement with regard to the scheme which will be outlined following the passage of this legislation and its assent by the Governor-General. Senator Watson also made a point in connection with the accrual of the revenue to the Government as a result of the tender system operating. Of course, that is in line with current practice and certainly would help to stem abuse of the system. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans made three or four points during the debate. He sought some advice with regard to some reservations he had. The first of those concerned an annual appraisal of the duty on the base quota. I am advised that the approach of the Government in this regard will not be to conduct that method of appraisal but from time to time to consider the penalty rates of duty upon the recommendations of the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Advisory Committee. Senator Evans also mentioned the privileged position of those people who are already in the scheme and who will continue in it on the basis of 85 per cent of their imports established in the year 1979-80. The point here is that this is a step in the right direction towards freeing up the system which does not seek to disrupt the industry. The argument revolves around that particular question. Some of Senator Evans's predecessors in government had more radical approaches to this question. We have perhaps seen some of the results of that and we can refer him to that experience for his own benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, Senator Evans mentioned the ability of the staff of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs to manage the system. I am advised that that will occur through redeployment of people in the Department. It will be necessary to do so only on a relatively short term basis-for approximately two months per annum. Consequently, it is likely to be easily encompassed within the Department's normal operations. I wish the legislation a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) the re-introduction of fees is not only a breach of an election undertaking but will grossly disadvantage students with limited means and will compromise Australia's research effort;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) the gutting of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme will confirm tertiary education as the preserve of the rich, and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) the heavy-handed threat in the review to 30 colleges of advanced education is based on the wholly false premise that the consolidation of single purpose colleges will result in cost savings in spite of the Tertiary Education Commission's advice to the contrary'. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said at the outset, the Opposition does not oppose the provisions of the Bills. There are four major provisions in the first Bill. Firstly, the first instalment, that is, $7.4m for this year, of the $25m capital assistance for non-government schools promised before the last Federal election is contained in this Bill. The Opposition is not opposed to that provision. Secondly, there is a compression of the current six levels of non-government schools for the purposes of Schools Commission funding into three levels. Again, that is not opposed by the Opposition. The third provision is a new program of assistance for the education of severely handicapped children both at home and in institutions. That provision is warmly welcomed by the Opposition. Fourthly, there is the support for non-profit, part time, ethnic schools which are providing supplementary education in community languages and cultures. Again, the Opposition strongly welcomes this provision because it has long recognised the great value to our multicultural community in Australia of the Saturday schools or the ethnic schools, as they are known. It seems to us to be a very sensible measure of support to provide some financial backing to these schools which are undoubtedly contributing to the general education welfare of our multicultural society. </PARA>
<PARA> However, as I have indicated, the Opposition is severely critical of the Government's general attack on our education system, both secondary and tertiary. In the secondary education system we have seen government policies, particularly those announced last week, which will result in a lowering of standards, especially in government schools; in reducing access to later secondary education, again particularly in government schools; and in a dismantling of national education programs such as those carried out by the Curriculum Development Centre and the Australian Schools Commission. This dismantling not only represents a waste of public investment of the public money that has been invested in developing those two national programs but also, and perhaps more importantly, represents a waste, a squandering, of the personal resources of skill and experience which have gone into the development of both the Curriculum Development Centre and the Australian Schools Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe the Federal Government is withdrawing, by these and other methods, from its statutory, primary obligation-I repeat that it has a statutory obligation-to provide to all without fees or religious tests public education at the highest possible standard. It is very clear that the overall effect of the various onslaughts of the Fraser Government on secondary education in this country will be the reduction of standards in government schools. I repeat that the Federal Government has a statutory and primary obligation to ensure that education of the highest possible standard is available to all without fees or religious tests. When we look at the tertiary scene we see a similar onslaught by the Fraser Government. The Fraser Government is intent on destroying research and development in this country. It could not have picked a worse possible time in terms of the Australian economy to mount this onslaught. Day after day in this place we debate problems in the economy. It is very clear to all of us that many of those problems arise because of the old-fashioned, antiquated nature of a great deal of our manufacturing sector and, indeed, of many aspects of our primary industry. </PARA>
<PARA> If we need anything in Australia at this time it is new skills, ability to research and develop new industries and to improve, update and introduce more sophisticated techniques into the whole running of our economy. At the time when we need these new skills and new industries to provide employment and these new avenues of creating revenue in this country, what do we see? We see an onslaught on research and development, on the ability of universities and other institutions in this country to carry out research and development and on the ability of gifted, highly motivated individuals to develop their skills and experience to a point where they would be able to compete with the skills and experience of other developed countries. I cannot express strongly enough my criticism of that development. We are reducing the already low level of advanced skills available in our economy. I will be making some detailed comments on that matter later. Let us lay to rest once and for all the idea that we have a highly educated community in Australia when we compare ourselves with other developed countries. We have not. When it comes to higher education and to advanced technological skills Australia is trailing behind most of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries and other advanced countries. Yet we see in the decisions which the Government has recently made on access to education that fewer and fewer people will have the opportunity to develop their skills in a way that would enable us to compete. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the various decisions of the Government to make study at university difficult, or in some cases impossible, have come about because of three new policies. They are the restriction of access to the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme; the decision to introduce a loans scheme which, of course, discriminates very badly against students from poor or even average backgrounds; and the decision to introduce tertiary fees for second or higher degrees. All these decisions, of course, will undermine the standards of our universities and tertiary institutions. All these decisions have already very seriously undermined the morale of the research and teaching staff in all our tertiary institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the Senate to the very alarming picture regarding participation rates in secondary and tertiary education in this country. The Schools Commission in its most recent report drew attention to the declining retention rates, especially among male students. I preface my remarks on this point by reminding honourable senators that the increase in retention rates to the end of secondary school came about as a result of Schools Commission policies which had evolved through the investment of more public money in education during the period of the Whitlam Government. This was seen as the single most important criterion for the raising of the standards of school education in this country. It is a very alarming fact that so few of our secondary students completed secondary education in the 1950s and 1960s. The proportion of students who stayed to the end of secondary school was far too low. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator asks why. If the honourable senator had been listening to my remarks he would know that access to education in this country is primarily a matter of economics. Before we had significant Federal Government involvement in education at secondary and tertiary levels the only way children could finish secondary education and get access to tertiary education was to have parents who could afford to keep their children at school. A development of policies made secondary education and tertiary education more accessible. That development has been drastically and so tragically reversed by the Government's recent decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The retention rate for male students in the government school sector, which is more significant because of the greater number of students involved, fell from 30 per cent in 1972 to 26 per cent in 1979. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's report on Australia published in 1980 presents very disturbing figures. In relation to full time school enrolments of 15 to 19-year-olds Australia, inauspiciously, ranks fourteenth on an OECD table of 23 nations with only a 45 per cent involvement, in contrast to comparative figures of 74 per cent for the United States of America and 70 per cent for Switzerland. Recently the Tertiary Education Commission referred to a decline in the number of students proceeding direct from school to higher education when measured as a proportion of the relevant age group. The figure decreased from 18 per cent in 1974 to 14.5 per cent in 1980. The report added that this represented a rapid and substantial reversal of the trend towards greater participation of the young in higher education which had been operating strongly for some 20 years. This decline is occurring at a time when demand for higher education is rising steadily in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. As I pointed out, it is making our position compared with other OECD countries even worse. Significantly, the Tertiary Education Commission points to the reduced provision of student financial assistance as having played a significant role in this decline. </PARA>

<PARA> The supplementary provisions of the two Bills before us this evening can in no way compensate for the recent ideologically inspired attack on learning and scholarships and on the objective of widening access to education. I should point out at this time that the educational objective of widening the group of citizens who have access to education was not only the objective of the Australian Labor Party-certainly that has always been its objective-but also has been the objective of a succession of conservative governments in this country. If we look at the history of education policy in this country after the second world war we find a continuum of development. We saw the supportive policies of Prime Minister Chifley and we saw Prime Minister Menzies, the great conservative leader, take up the question of Australian universities. I am the first to acknowledge the achievement that was made by Prime Minister Menzies during those years. He introduced substantial Federal Government involvement in universities and Commonwealth scholarships and later on introduced some assistance by way of grants to the non-government school sector. None of these things achieved the objective completely, but we witnessed a development towards establishing wider and wider access to education in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Under Prime Minister Gorton we experienced a great boost for colleges of advanced education. A number of colleges were founded with a new and, I think, quite relevant charter of providing vocationally oriented education at a tertiary education level. Then of course under Prime Minister Whitlam we saw the abolition of tertiary fees and the establishment and development of the Australian Schools Commission-the first significant Federal Government involvement in government and non-government schools throughout Australia. If we look forward from Chifley through Menzies, Gorton and Whitlam we see a development of education policies which broadened all the time the access of citizens to different kinds of education and also raised the quality of education available to Australian citizens. All of this was very desirable and, to a large extent, bipartisan. The general public wanted it and major political parties were prepared to agree to development in broad terms. Of course there were some disagreements on particular matters but broadly there was a consensus that education was an important area of Federal Government involvement and justified public expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, of course, we have a drastic and radical departure from this tradition in Australia. We have, for the first time, a moving away from the importance of education as a national government responsibility and objective. We have, for the first time, deliberate policies aimed at restricting access to education institutions at secondary school level and, more significantly, at tertiary level. I will be very interested to hear the response of the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick), who represents the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) in this chamber. I hope to hear some explanation as to why, at this crucial stage of Australia's economic and social development, there is a sudden turning away from education as a nationally agreed concensus. </PARA>
<PARA> I think a particularly unpleasant aspect of this attack on education is that it has been perpetrated by a person-I am referring to the Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser-who obtained his first degree at an English university because his parents were able to afford to send him there. We read in the Press that he is about to be awarded a second degree by an educational institution in the southern part of the United States because his economic policies have toed the line currently fashionable in America. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lajovic's interjection is pertinent to an extent. It is not the most significant aspect we have before us; it is just a particularly unpleasant aspect of the situation with which we are dealing. Let us return to more substantial matters. Let us return, for example, to the decision of the Government to introduce tuition fees for second and higher degrees in tertiary institutions. A number of things can be said. The first is that this represents the breaking of an election promise by the Government. Mr Fife, the current Minister for Education, before the election said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There continues to be speculation about Government plans to re-introduce fees for tertiary education. I have given an assurance publicly and I repeat that assurance, that no proposals are being considered by the Government for the possible re-introduction of tertiary fees. </PARA>

<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Lajovic" NAMEID="NH7">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What you are saying is not correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lajovic seems not to understand that students engaged in post-graduate or second degree studies at tertiary institutions are in fact engaged in study at tertiary institutions about which Mr Fife gave an undertaking which has been broken. The fees, of course, will disadvantage students with modest means. Post-graduate awards are awarded on merit and not on need. It is important to point out that only about 15 per cent of post-graduate and second degree students receive the kind of award which obviates the need for the payment of fees. I am pleased to see that Senator Carrick is in the chamber. He was reported over the weekend as saying that most post-graduate students were able to attract post-graduate awards. That is completely wrong. As I have said, the figure is something like 15 per cent. There are simply not nearly enough post-graduate awards to cover all the talented and motivated people who are currently engaged in post-graduate studies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Fewer post-graduate students will now enrol; that is quite clear. The majority of post-graduate students will not be able to overcome the problem of having to pay fees. Of course, the withdrawal of students from campuses will not only mean the closing off of options for those particular students but will also be severely disruptive to both the teaching and the research programs currently carried out at Australia's universities. The views of various vice-chancellors have been brought forward in this place and will no doubt be brought forward again, but there is no doubt that those tertiary institutions which have been so carefully built up by a succession of Federal governments of different political complexions ever since the Second World War will now be very severely disrupted in both their teaching and their research programs. Campuses will be unable to plan, courses will disappear because there will not be enough students to take them, staff will lose their jobs because there will be no students to teach and the ability of the universities to maintain and to develop standards will be irrevocably and very severely damaged. </PARA>
<PARA> Campuses such as Macquarie University, where I spoke just last week, have a very high proportion of second or higher degree students. This is because Macquarie University was established much later than were the other major universities in New South Wales and has attracted a different kind of student undertaking a different kind of course. I point out that one of the strengths of such a campus as the Macquarie campus is that it has been able to accommodate the needs of many mature age students. We are all very aware that because of the restrictions on access to education-the financial restrictions that prevented people from being able to go to a university-that were very serious before the Second World War and even in the 1950s, the opportunity for many mature age Australians to be able to undertake tertiary studies has meant a very important liberalisation and opening up of new options, personally and professionally. A university such as Macquarie, which has a very high percentage of mature age students-and I might say specifically mature age female students-who have been taking advantage in a most admirable way of those sorts of opportunities, who are proving to be excellent students and who will then go on to join the work force and make a very important contribution to our entire society, will be very severely damaged by the decision to impose fees for those studying for second and further degrees. Of course, once the students are forced to withdraw, once the staff disappears, it will be an enormously difficult, if not impossible task, to rebuild campuses with high standards, with appropriate relevant, modern courses and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government seems to think that there is some sort of equity in announcing that although it will restrict access to the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme it will introduce a system of loans. Let me remind honourable senators that the very people who most need the loans are the people who will be least able to take them. Students from very poor families or families with moderate means will find it very difficult to burden themselves at that stage of their lives with a heavy loan. Some Government senators say that the students will become lawyers and doctors and will earn a lot of money and they ask why students should not take loans. Of course, if we look at the socio-economic make-up of the kinds of students who go into medical school and law school we find that by and large they come from the most advantaged sectors of society. This is because education at secondary and primary school levels is still not equally available to people in all suburbs and all parts of Australia. The children who can go to the most advantaged schools are the students who get into the most prestigious courses and are able then to enter the most remunerative professions. So we still have a pattern of inequality and the advantaged being advantaged and the disadvantaged being disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> Introducing loans into this system will not make things better for the economically disadvantaged; it will make things worse. Young people-perhaps, in the case of a second degree, people who are just starting family responsibilities-will have to take on a loan at a very vulnerable time. Of course, the students who have the security of parents who back them up, saying: 'We will pay the loan if anything happens to you', are the very students who do not need the loan. Not all graduates of universities will become doctors or lawyers. What about the people who go into very low-paid but very important areas of activity? What about the people who work for, say, Aboriginal legal services or voluntary organisations, welfare organisations? They are the sorts of organisations which the Government pretends to support because they use voluntary labour, because they are not bureaucratic and because they often represent a community response rather than a bureaucratic or government response to a social need. Those very sorts of organisations use graduates. The Brotherhood of St Laurence, which is known to honourable senators, is a very good example. Of course such organisations use graduates. They need the skills and the knowledge of graduates but they certainly do not pay $50,000 a year or $100,000 a year, which some of our medical or legal graduates can so easily earn. </PARA>
<PARA> If we impose this system of loans we will have two sorts of graduates. We will have the graduates who can undertake a course in law or medicine without worrying about a loan and can then go off and become rich, probably engaging in practices which create a great tax burden for the rest of society; and we will have the people who want to work in areas of need in the community but who will have that option cut off to them because they will have to take a loan and then, of course, they will have to try to find a remunerative job, rather than a satisfying or important job, so that they can repay that loan. So the introduction of the loan scheme will close off options for the less advantaged, will do nothing to equalise the situation as between the advantaged and the disadvantaged and will in no way improve the access of people to tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make some comments about the Government's attack on the Curriculum Development Centre. I point out that the current budget for the Curriculum Development Centre is $2.5m and $1m is set aside for the Education Research and Development Committee. The savings to be made by eliminating these two bodies entirely will be absolutely minimal, so we must look for some reasons other than financial ones for the Government's decision to attack these two bodies. The decision to abolish the CDC takes no account of the major contributions to the Centre by both the States and non-government systems, which contributions for 1980-81 total about $1m. Both of those bodies have conducted and supported important work in research and the promotion of new approaches to education. Some of the research has been directed towards access to education and, of course, some of the results of this research would embarrass the Government. Perhaps that is why these two bodies have come under such severe attack by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very strange to see the CDC under such an attack as this when the Minister, Mr Fife, publicly acknowledged the Centre's contribution to Australia's education at the official opening of its new premises only six weeks ago. Very clearly, this attack, as is the case with many provisions of the Lynch Committee's report, is not a result of carefully considered investigation and planning. It is the result of a last minute decision to wipe out something for what seem to be ideological rather than financial reasons. I am very concerned about the effect on the non-government schools sector of the attack on the Curriculum Development Centre. The Fraser Government likes to pose as a friend of the non-government schools sector. It likes to pose as a government which believes that if parents exercise that sort of choice they ought to be supported and assisted in exercising that choice, as if that had not been exactly the position promoted by the Whitlam Government. But when it comes to longer term assistance to the non-government sector, such as the Curriculum Development Centre was providing, apparently then the non-government sector gets no consideration at all. The non-government sector was heavily involved in the work of the Curriculum Development Centre and I think benefited very much from having a national curriculum development body. So it seems that, whilst the non-government sector is still to receive money, it is not to receive the benefits of national planning by curriculum. </PARA>
<PARA> Another question to be asked is this: What sort of pressure is being put on the States to continue the support of the CDC? We have been told by the Treasurer, Mr Howard, that if the States decide to pay half of the costs of the CDC the work of the CDC will continue. Does that mean all of the States, some of the States or the majority of the States? If all of the States do not decide to find the funds to continue the CDC, will the legislation be withdrawn? The Minister in charge of these Bills seems to know the answer to none of these questions, and again it is suggested that the attack is purely ideological and has nothing to do with either fiscal responsibility or administrative efficiency. Least of all does it have anything to do with educational standards. The Government has been heard decrying again and again the standards of some of our schools. Indeed the interjections of Senator Lajovic earlier this evening was a repetition of that kind of decrying of standards. Yet we have a national body which costs very little to maintain and which could bring about the establishment and development of national standards in the core curriculum, and that body is to be dismembered for no good reason at all. It makes no sense. </PARA>
<PARA> A similar attack has been made on the Australian Schools Commission. The Government has decided that the direct involvement of the Schools Commission in program administration in the States is to be reduced and that State offices are to be scaled down accordingly. The buildings unit in the central office is to be abolished and the collection of information by the Commission reduced. The contraction of information collection and the dissemination activities of the Commission constitute an obstacle to the debate on education policy and will limit accountability for education expenditure. This Government parades as a government which is a vigilante of the public purse. It indicates that it is concerned to make sure that all public expenditure is accountable and is being spent efficiently. Yet this Government is now demolishing the ability of the Schools Commission to collect data by which we could judge whether the money is being spent efficiently. If the Australian Schools Commission does not know how its grants are being spent or what benefits or gains in terms of education are being achieved, where is that accountability? There is none. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the withdrawal of the administrative functions of the Commission at State level will limit and downgrade the service the Commission provides, particularly to the non-government sector. I stress that point because, as I said, this Government is so keen to parade as a friend of the non-government sector, and yet it is dismembering or reducing the ability of those national bodies which have been so helpful to the non-government sector and so supportive in a developmental way. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like at this point to make a general comment about the attacks of the Government on the Australian Schools Commission. I believe-this view, of course, is shared by many people within the Parliament and certainly outside the Parliament-the establishment of the Australian Schools Commission by the Whitlam Government was the greatest boost to schools education that this country had every seen. It represented the first serious significant move by the national government into education for all Australians. It was not only a financial development but also an administrative development. It gave a national focus for educational standards. It provided a national focus for people involved in the education communities throughout Australia. It was, I think, welcomed by all people within the education communities. It was certainly welcomed by all of the teachers federations; it was welcomed by the government school sector, the parent organisations, and by the non-government schools sector. Indeed, well may it have been welcomed by the non-government schools because, particularly in the case of parish schools, they were on the verge of absolute breakdown. The burden of maintaining parish schools without significant State aid had become such that most of them were on the verge of closure until the Whitlam Government set up the Schools Commission, established the policy on funding according to need, and then poured all those funds into the parish schools, which enabled them to survive, develop, and in many cases, of course, to flourish. </PARA>
<PARA> There were two significant things about the Schools Commission. The first was that it allowed for national involvement in education. It involved all Australian children. The second significant thing was that funding was to be according to need. The Schools Commission was to have the job of establishing the needs in education-country versus city, government versus non-government, primary versus secondary, and so on. For the first time funding was to be rational and according to need. Of course, both of these objectives have been destroyed by the Fraser Government. The Schools Commission has been reduced and reduced until no longer is it able to perform that function of funding all Australian schools according to need and setting national agreed on objectives for Australian education. That, I think, is a great tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear much about the polarisation of the Australian community. We hear much about the unwelcome divisions within the Australian community. We hear many criticisms of our education system and the inability of our education system to meet the needs of modern society. Perhaps there is something in those criticisms, although they are not criticisms which I wish to make personally. But if we are to overcome the polarisation and divisions, the lack of standards, the unevenness of standards, the inequality as between country and city and different States and territories, we must have a national education policy and national education standards. I believe the work of the Curriculum Development Centre and, more particularly, of the Schools Commission would have been absolutely crucial in establishing, maintaining and developing those standards, and that all Australians should have benefited. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most distressing features of forcing programs such as education programs away from the Federal Government back to the States is that we will see dreadful unevenness emerge again and grow a lot worse than previously. Why should it be that a child's chances of a good education depend upon which State he or she happens to live in, or whether he or she happens to live in a country town or in a city? Why should it be that if parents move from State to State-many parents have to do that, especially in these days of high unemployment-their children's education should be totally disrupted, that the children should be totally set back because they go from a State where one standard is important to a State where that standard is not important. I believe that sort of fragmentation and unevenness is not in the interests of our children, is not in the interests of education generally, and is certainly not in the interests of developing a modern competent economy. Yet the effect of the Government's changes will bring about just that sort of fragmentation, disadvantage, unevenness and disruption. I believe all of those things are matters on which the Fraser Government has already been condemned and will continue to be condemned. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I remind the Senate that, whilst the Opposition does not oppose the Bills before the Senate this evening, at the end of the second reading debate we will move to each Bill the fairly wide ranging second reading amendment I have foreshadowed. </PARA>

I support both Bills. I am sure that all honourable senators will support the Bills. No honourable senator has expressed opposition to any words in the two Bills that are before the Senate. Indeed, the Opposition has supported the two Bills. It recognises the new programs were election promises designed to assist severely handicapped children, to assist with ethnic language instruction and to overcome in this machinery way, as in the normal fashion, the supplementation that is required to meet cost escalations in relation to projects that this Parliament approved for the years 1979-80 and 1980-81.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What, then, has been the dispute voiced tonight in the remarks of Senator Ryan, who led for the Opposition in the debate? They have been entirely away from these Bills. They have contained some general, pessimistic, exaggerated prognostications about the impact of the razor gang decisions on the education area. As a Liberal, given the input to that Review of Commonwealth Functions, I believe that we can be happy that there have not been severe cuts in education. We have heard exaggerations about the Schools Commission, which is a good institution and which is performing its job well. Given the refinement to overcome duplication of State funds, it will perform its job better. Given the continuing provision for tertiary education-whether universities or colleges-and increasing funds in the technical and further education area, the Commonwealth continues to provide direct to the States and tertiary institutions a very high level of support for education in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party still labours on the early period of the 1970s when everyone recognised that there was a need to apply more resources to education. But that great expansion has come and since the mid-1970s the urgent and important challenge before all levels of education has been to consolidate those massive increases in funding, to make sure that there is quality in education and that the money is being used appropriately, whether under Commonwealth or State programs. Nevertheless during that time the Schools Commission's targets for standards in secondary schools throughout Australia have been exceeded in all States. The same real levels of funding for universities and colleges and real increases in the TAFE area where there have been real needs have been maintained. I do not think that the Government should in any way apologise for the fact that it places its priority upon achieving quality of outcome for the secondary and tertiary students of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the red herrings introduced in this debate by the Opposition spokesperson are largely false, alarmist and pessimistic. I refer, for example, to the reflections upon the Curriculum Development Centre. A number of extravagant accusations were made that there was an attack upon curriculum development and that the resources of the CDC would be wasted. The proposal is that the Curriculum Development Centre be retained if the States wish it to be retained and pay half the cost of its programs. After all, the Curriculum Development Centre will serve secondary schools, which are the direct responsibility of the States. As the curricula will be implemented in schools which are the responsibility of State governments, it is appropriate that the States contribute towards funding that body. There will be better co-ordination and better usefulness in the curricula that are developed if there is such a large input. In that context perhaps it is generous that the Commonwealth has agreed, if the States come to the party, to continue to fund the CDC up to 50 per cent of its costs. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to another area mentioned by Senator Ryan, the reintroduction of fees. She called this a breach of an electoral undertaking. At best it is a matter of semantics, but I believe that no such charge can be made against the Minister for Education (Mr Fife). He denied at the time of the last election, under persistent questioning about rumours which will spread by opponents of this Government that fees might be reintroduced, that they were contemplated, that they were discussed by the Minister or that options were being prepared. That statement has never been shown to be false. It has never been shown that the Minister gave an undertaking, in that election context, which is not true.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you were a student what would you have concluded from that?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That it was a matter for the Government to determine, in the light of the facts in any Budget year, whether some fees would be introduced but that there was no active consideration by the Minister or Cabinet towards the introduction of fees. The same allegations were made by Government opponents regarding the reintroduction of national service in the defence area. The Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) denied that there was any active pursuing by the Minister or the Government of that option. He was right and that statement was true. It is appropriate for a Minister in an election context to give such undertakings and to make sure that they are true. Every government would maintain that the evidence and the facts should be brought together in any Budget year, in any review year by year of government programs, to allow Ministers to make decisions. So I reject the charge that the introduction of fees is a breach of promise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to another aspect regarding post-graduate students. Senator Ryan said that this move would destroy research and development in universities and that there would be a falling away of all students who did not have post-graduate awards; that is, were not fully funded, Commonwealth supported students undertaking masters degrees, degrees of doctors of philosophy and other post-graduate study in universities. I believe that that is a gross exaggeration that could never be maintained in any rational debate. It is pessimistic, alarmist and false. For example, the loan scheme to be introduced and which will be available to all tertiary students has not been fully detailed. The announcement on that program will be made in the coming months. What is to stop an enlightened Commonwealth from providing a loan to a post-graduate student that at least equalises the amount of fees that that student may be required to pay in fees for a post-graduate degree?</PARA>
<PARA> If a loan is available to a post-graduate student in recurrent terms he will not in any way be disadvantaged in continuing his post-graduate studies and completing those studies. The disadvantage for him personally will come during his employment, when he has an income and will have to repay that loan which was necessary for him to pay for his studies. So priority is being given in the arrangements that have been announced in this Review of Commonwealth Functions to first degree and post-graduate students who are taking their studies with post-graduate awards. Other students taking secondary degrees or post-graduate degrees without an award will, I believe, be able to find the necessary finance from the loans scheme to enable them to take those studies. So I believe that to neglect those options is further to add to the Opposition's record in this matter as having a reaction which is alarmist, false and pessimistic. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to highlight four aspects of the two Bills that are before the Senate. I welcome and commend them to all honourable senators. The general provisions of both Bills are machinery matters. Altogether they provide in excess of $160m in supplementation for the purposes of schools and tertiary education assistance in all States and in all programs. In addition, these Bills contain some new proposals which are very significant. One is the additional assistance to non-government schools. I note that in part this is a response to what has been described as a public rush to non-government schools. A recent headline in the Adelaide Advertiser carried exactly that by-line. The article in that newspaper stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Private schools in SA are experiencing an application explosion. </PARA>
<PARA> Only four or five years ago all the leading schools were actively touting for students. </PARA>
<PARA> Now most have waiting lists . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The numbers involved in this rush are significant and they are more significant when not only the new places in non-government schools but also the growth in the waiting lists at those schools over recent years are taken into account. So the capital grants that the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill provides will enable extensions to schools to be built to cater for students who are increasing in numbers coming to non-government schools. </PARA>
<PARA> The general arguments in regard to providing assistance for non-government schools in Australia need be put only briefly. These schools provide equality of opportunity and freedom of choice for Australian families. It is still true to say that in the average situation only about one quarter of the cost of educating a person in a non-government school is met by taxpayers. Taxpayers pay the full cost of educating a child in a government school and on average pay about one-quarter of the cost of educating a child in a non-government school. The assistance in this Bill to allow slightly increased rates for some of the lower levels of schools is again another welcome feature. </PARA>
<PARA> The aspect of the program assisting severely handicapped children which particularly interests me and which I commend is that the facilities which will be provided by this extra money will enable education development not only in the institutions where severely handicapped children may live but also in their own homes. I believe this is a response to the call that has been made in all parts of Australia for severely handicapped persons to be able where possible to retain their normal lifestyle and relationships with the family in their homes and when they go to education institutions they are able where possible to go to the normal schools that they would otherwise have attended. </PARA>
<PARA> The other new program relates to the assistance to non-profit part time ethnic schools. The money to be provided under the first Bill will enable a $30 per head payment in respect of those who attend language instruction in languages other than English in ethnic schools. The programs must be approved by the responsible Minister. The Bill sets out very carefully the terms of that approval, including the provision that the program be run in a non-profit way and that the language instruction, which may include cultural instruction in conjunction with that instruction, must not, I stress, be wholly or predominantly of a political or religious nature. The Government is seeking by this $30 per head payment in respect of students in ethnic schools to give direct financial assistance not for political and religious controversy in Australia but for language instruction associated with some cultural instruction. I believe this to be of value not only to the younger people of ethnic families in Australia but also to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the special features of the Bill is that any such approved program of instruction must be open to persons irrespective of their ethnic origin. All Australians must be able to attend for language instruction whether in Italian, Greek, Chinese, Vietnamese or whatever language is being taught in this part time capacity. Language instruction in, say, Greek must be open to a member of an Italian, a Vietnamese family or an entirely English-speaking traditional Australian family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Georges that perhaps a person from an Italian family may only rarely be seeking to learn the Greek language after school or on a weekend. Let us encourage such multiculturalism in Australia and while we are so doing let us acknowledge, because I believe this is the direct intent of this program, that we are one Australia, that we have one national language-English-and that we are encouraging in all our citizens and in the children of Australia an awareness of the different personalities of the individuals who live in this country, the different languages of everyone in Australia, the different backgrounds and to respect, to come to learn and to appreciate that in Australia we can be not only English-speaking but also Italian-speaking. I am proud of the fact, Senator Georges, that my three sons will go through primary school learning Italian from grade one. I hope that by the time they get to the age when I first started to learn a foreign language, in my case French, they will be as fluent in Italian as I was after the many struggles in-between football and other activities through my secondary schooling. This is something which we should encourage. I believe this is one of the election promises which is now being implemented and is very much to be commended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In expressing my support for these two Bills, I reject the amendments that have been moved and foreshadowed by the Opposition. The Opposition supports the Bills, but I believe the extravagant terms such as 'breach', 'gutting', 'wholly false premise', 'obstacle', 'downgrading' are not only inaccurate charges but also are unnecessarily divisive and not helpful in their pessimistic and alarmist intent of trying to exaggerate the quite minor implications for education in Australia as a result of the Review of Commonwealth Functions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not detain the Senate for long. I feel obliged to speak in this debate because two amendments have been moved and foreshadowed by the Australian Labor Party to both Bills now being debated cognately. In passing I mildly rebuke Senator Ryan and the Labor Party for not paying the Australian Democrats the courtesy of informing us that the Opposition intended to move any amendments. In fact, the first I heard that any amendments were to be moved was when they were distributed in the Senate chamber. I say to the Labor Party, with as much goodwill as I can, that is not good enough, not courteous enough and after 30 June when votes in this Senate will be more finely resolved it certainly will not be good enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I just say in passing, for the benefit of Senator Carrick, that all that has been done tonight has been in conformity with the Standing Orders, but I just wonder about the incongruity of a situation in which there are before the Senate two Bills on which there is unanimity yet amendments have been moved to them which virtually open up a whole range of debate on education-a total debate on education. This device could well be used in respect of any legislation that is brought before the chamber. I wonder whether this is in the best interests of the Senate. I know it is in conformity with Standing Orders but the point I am raising is this: Is it not a situation that, for a start, could be discussed between the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick), the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Button) and other senators to see whether it could be rationalised? I believe that the Government in the Senate and the Standing Orders allow generous time for back benchers to debate matters of their liking. If the Senate is to be permitted to debate any matter or any Bill by the device of moving an amendment, I think that such action needs revision and needs to be thought about. That is not a party political remark. The business of the Senate could be expedited. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats will be supporting the Opposition's amendments notwithstanding the fact that the third amendment to the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1981 is one that we do not totally understand. I suspect that if we did understand it we would not agree with it. It deals with the rationalisation of a number of colleges of advanced education. The Democrats have been arguing for a long time that there are far too many colleges of advanced education and that a number of them could well be rationalised. We have stated time and time again that this is an area in which little bureaucrats can become principals of colleges or see an opportunity to become principals. The bureaucracy then mushrooms and there are more deputy principals, new libraries, new laboratories and a new this and that. Colleges of advanced education have been mushrooming all over the country. I believe the Government is to be commended for pursing that particular line of action. With respect to Senator Ryan, she did not expound on that part of her amendment to such a degree that I can totally understand it. </PARA>
<PARA> We agree with the other amendments moved by Senator Ryan on behalf of the Labor Party in relation to the reintroduction of fees. That is a breach of an election undertaking. It is not semantics, as my friend Senator Teague, suggests. It will grossly disadvantage students with limited means and will compromise Australia's research efforts. In fact I think Senator Ryan chose a mild form of words when she said that it will compromise Australia's research effort'. The Democrats believe it will result in a brain drain from Australia. It is unreal to think that the Government, by not funding any person who is undertaking a second degree, will save money and is being just. Where is the justice in the government providing fees for someone undertaking a medical course, which takes seven or eight years at the taxpayers' expense, and someone doing an arts course, which takes three years? Do we say to the person who has taken the arts course: 'You have done your course; that is it'? A person undertaking an arts course will study for only three years, whereas a person undertaking a course such as medicine, science or law will take longer. Does the Government not know that in some areas of advanced technology, such as electronics, a basic degree is almost useless and that a second degree or a post-graduate degree is absolutely vital for any Australian to make a contribution in the highly complex field of technology, electro-processing and so on? We agree with the Labor Party on that point. </PARA>
<PARA> We certainly agree that the gutting of the Tertiary Education Allowance Scheme will confirm tertiary education as a preserve of the rich. I am drawing the long bow in my language. It will certainly keep tertiary education the preserve of the middle class and the wealthy class and will certainly militate against those people in worse socio-economic circumstances. Let me tell Senator Teague, who is one of the small 'l' liberals on that side of the House--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Primmer" NAMEID="SO7">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SO7">Senator Primmer</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is, and I respect that. I would never accuse Senator Davidson, who is attempting to interject, of that. That would be the last thing in the world I would accuse him of being. I would not accuse him of being a small 'l' Liberal or of being a Liberal at all. Senator Davidson can rest easy that I will not be mentioning him in this context. Does Senator Teague know that the present maximum TEAS allowance is $49 a week? That is at least $16 or $17 below the poverty line. We have people such as Senator Teague suggesting that we ask students to exist, to learn, to pass examinations, to obtain a degree and in some cases to bring up a family on an allowance which is below the poverty line. Not content with that, the razor gang has now recommended that the TEAS allowance be reduced further. Any move the Labor Party takes to recify that situation will have the total support of the Australian Democrats. We think it is unthinkable that a student should have to study with an allowance even at the poverty line. Our announced policy is that the TEAS allowance should be 120 per cent of the poverty line. In other words it should be 20 per cent above the poverty line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats agree with the two amendments moved by Senator Ryan in relation to the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill 1981. Had she consulted us we would have suggested, with respect, that she add the words 'that the Senate views with great concern the shift of funding from the public to the private sector in education'. This matter concerns the Democrats. I have received from the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) an answer dated today to question upon notice No. 278 in relation to the shift of funding from the public to the private sector in schools. I should like to make the point that the kind of information a back bench senator like myself gets from the Government is quite unsatisfactory. I think that the answer I am about to read illustrates the desperate need for the Freedom of Information Bill to be passed. I wanted to know why Dr Ken McKinnon, the former Chairman of the Schools Commission, was not reappointed. I think that is a fair question for a senator to ask. Dr McKinnon was a most distinguished, if outspoken, person in the field of education. I asked whether Dr McKinnon was relieved of his position by the Government--</PARA>

<PARA>I will read to the Senate the answer I received. It is an insult to my intelligence and it is an insult to the Senate's intelligence. If the public servant who wrote this answer wants to spur on those members of this Parliament who want freedom of information he could do no better than give an answer like this. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Dr McKinnon was not relieved of his position as Chairman of the Schools Commission. When his period of appointment expired, the Government exercised its prerogative to make a fresh appointment. </PARA>
<PARA>What sort of rubbish is that? I ask the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) to convey my remarks to the Minister for Education. I would rather that the Minister for Education or the bureaucrat who wrote that answer treat me with the contempt of not even answering a question than serve up that kind of garbage, which is not worthy of any bureaucrat or public servant who receives taxpayers' money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am brought into this debate because of comments made by way of interjection by Senator Lajovic and certain comments made by Senator Teague. Although, as Senator Teague said, the two Bills before the Senate have the support of the Opposition, it is really a case of the Government giving with one hand and taking away with the other hand. Although this legislation makes money available, the subsequent decisions of the Lynch gang, or razor gang, as it is called, seriously deplete the advantages given by these two Bills. That is the point which is being argued by honourable senators on this side of the chamber. Some remarks were made by way of interjection which did not quite get across to honourable senators the fact that, in spite of the benefits which the Bills transmit, subsequent decisions seriously affect the educational programs of this country to the extent that the Opposition has been moved to foreshadow certain amendments. In spite of what Senator Chipp said, when the opportunity arises and legislation comes before the House it can be amended, as these Bills will be amended, and the debate is broadened. I should have thought that the broadening of the debate by these amendments would have brought other Government senators into the debate because it is necessary not only for the Opposition to put a case but also for the Government to defend itself. The failure of the Government to defend itself seems to indicate that many Government senators do not approve of some of the savage decisions which the Government has announced just recently. Those decisions are savage indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V4">Senator GEORGES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In some ways it is backing away. For instance, there has been some change in the area of fees for second degrees and fees for students studying for a Ph.D. The purpose of the Opposition is to try to drive forward the enormity of what has been decided. There is a failure to recognise the position in which students find themselves these days. My own experience with my family was that at the conclusion of an honours degree, subsequent employment was not available for 12 months. The person concerned was therefore faced with the prospect of doing ordinary work. The time he performed that work would limit his ability for subsequent employment. He was faced then with a decision to go back for a further degree, to engage in study for a Ph.D. Anyone who has any knowledge of what a young student has to do to gain a Ph.D.-the sacrifices, the misery, the poverty, the hard work-can appreciate how enormous that decision can be. Of course, the student, if he is fortunate, will have the advantage of Commonwealth support. But only a few of them have the advantage of Commonwealth support. It amounts to only $80 to $90 a week on which they must survive and, sometimes, raise a family if they are entering that age.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Teague" NAMEID="PJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator Teague</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With extra allowances for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V4">Senator GEORGES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With very small extra allowances, if I might say so, and with all the limitations that can be imposed upon them. Nevertheless, there is hardship and misery. What does the Government decide to do? It decides to make it more difficult for these people to take on the extra degrees, especially for those without Commonwealth support. The reason-I want to emphasise the reason-many of these students study for second degrees is not, as Senator Lajovic said, that they are professional students and that they wish to continue on and on to accumulate degrees. There may be one or two people who are so obsessed, but by and large a student takes the extra degree to enhance his or her qualifications or because there is no opportunity for employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this society at present there is very little opportunity for employment for those who have the extra qualifications. Let me give an example. Recently, one of my colleagues advertised for a research assistant. He received 60 replies for a job which has a salary level of approximately $14,000-not particularly high for a person with qualifications. Neverthless there were 60 replies. Twenty of those applications were from people holding Ph.Ds. That shows the level of qualifications in the market-place at present. The Government's approach to that is to say: 'Knock it off. There are too many. Let us make it difficult. Let us not allow young people to get these improved qualifications. We have no jobs for them, therefore let us limit the number.'</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V4">Senator GEORGES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Teague says: 'They are not being denied. They can enrol.' Sure, they can enrol, but the economic limitations which the Government is imposing upon them make it difficult for them to do so. For that reason they hesitate to do so or do not enter that area. But the Government has made a considered judgment that the universities are producing too many qualified people for whom it has no jobs. Instead of taking the step which any reasonable government would take-that is, finding or creating the jobs or creating an economic environment in which the jobs are available-it is turning the clock back. The Government stands condemned for that action. The Government ought to appreciate that the standard of education needs to be maintained at an exceptionally high level at all stages-primary, secondary and tertiary. The funding of schools should be equal and not discriminatory. That is not quite the word I am seeking, but funding ought not to be as it is-an increase in support for the private sector with a reduction in support for the public sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot quite understand what Senator Teague said. He said that the trend in South Australia is now for people to apply for entry into private schools. Senator Teague did not explain why that was happening. Is it because the funding of private schools now is at such a level that it can give better education and education to a higher level? Is it because the state schools have been so deprived that the level of education at state schools is limited? Is that the reason? What is the reason? Senator Teague did not properly explain. All I can say is that the method of funding schools in Australia has placed too much emphasis on the private schools and far to little emphasis on the public schools. </PARA>
<PARA> I am getting too deeply into the subject now. I rose merely to make a couple of comments in support of the amendments and the need of these amendments to emphasise just how the Opposition feels about the recent decisions which have been made. Today during Question Time I sought to ask a question, but it was not my turn. I accept that.I put the question now because it is relevant to the debate before the Senate. It concerns a statement made by Professor Brian Wilson, the Vice-Chancellor of Queensland University. He stated publicly that the limits on the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and the introduction of a student loan scheme would reduce the opportunity for students from low income families to attend tertiary institutions. He stated also that the introduction of fees for second degrees was not in Australia's long term interests since the majority of students taking second degrees are teachers, thus affecting the future education of all young Australians. When one compares that statement from a person who is very much involved in the education of people and who would be considered to be an expert in the area with the decision of the Government not to fund two colleges of advanced education in Queensland, the Mount Gravatt College of Advanced Education and the Kelvin Grove College of Advanced Education--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V4">Senator GEORGES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They will be funded under limited arrangements which, in the very short term, will decrease the number of students flowing from those colleges. It seems odd that the honourable senator does not seem to realise that the Government is attacking the problem incorrectly, that the priority of education funding should be maintained. If, as the honourable member has argued-I believe Senator Carrick has argued this from time to time-there has been a reduction in the number of children entering school because the baby boom has now passed, I would have thought that the answer would be not to reduce the number of teachers available, or to restrict their education, not to close colleges or to limit them, but to reduce the numbers in classes.</PARA></TALK.START>

If that were done many of the social problems that we now face could be countered. The smaller the class, the better the teacher, the greater the opportunity to impart the knowledge and enlightenment that young people require. It would at least remove from the classroom that 'front row' which sociologists have shown to be the origin of much delinquency in our society. I repeat, the Government's priorities are wrong. The decisions that it is making are incorrect. If our society is to improve, if our general standards, values and the quality of our life are to be improved, there should be no reduction in funding of education. Rather, the level of education should be maintained. We should encourage the flow of students and graduates from our universities and make certain that once they do graduate employment will be available for them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is well to remind the Senate of what the debate is all about. We are debating two Bills, the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill and the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill. It would also be well to remind anyone who might be listening, or who might read Hansard, that within this chamber there is unanimity concerning the whole of the substance of those two Bills. That is very important to understand. Equally, if one had listened to the debate, one would never have suspected that the Bills not only do what States grants Bills do at this time each year-provide supplementary assistance-but also propose substantially new policies and attain new frontiers of education-in other words, that they represent an expansion in policies. There is a famous Japanese play called Rashomon which depicts how one can look at given circumstances and see in them totally different situations. I have not seen a better example of the scenario of Rashomon than I have seen tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me remind the Senate of the content of the Bills. I remind honourable senators that the State Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill, apart from adjusting cost supplementation, does a number of things. For example, it compresses into three the existing six subsidy levels which apply to all non-government schools. Moreover, it provides an additional $25m for new places in non-government schools. That is a policy matter. It brings in an ethnic schools program and it provides an additional $2m per annum for severely handicapped children, commencing in 1981. One would have thought that the Senate was debating Bills that were pulling down education; that next one would be hearing about a proposed reduction in funding. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1981 all government schools programs will be maintained at the same real level as applied in 1980; this, despite a decline in numbers enrolled. Thus, there will be a real increase in per capita expenditure upon each student. Over the last three years there has been a 4.3 per cent to 4.5 per cent falling off in the government school population. That has not been taken into account. Also not taken into account is the fact that recurrent grants have been maintained in real terms. To hear honourable senators opposite one would have thought that the scythe had been put through education. No honourable senator opposite mentioned the arbiter, the Schools Commission. As the world knows, that Commission-which used to be the bible of the Australian Labor Party-set up a series of targets, including the Karmel targets and said that by certain years primary schools should reach particular Karmel goals, and secondary schools should reach them several years later. Who could believe, upon hearing this evening about the Government's supposedly having cut funds, that the Karmel goals, the Schools Commission goals, had been achieved throughout Australia several years ahead of time? That represents an extraordinary situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A moment ago Labor Party supporters were saying that they did not like interjections. Perhaps they like them only when arguments are not coming back at them. Technical and further education enrolments have increased by 3 1/2 per cent or more. I refer honourable senators opposite to the transition from school to work programs, to the increase in migrant education programs, the special education program, the handicapped education program and the Education Program for Unemployed Youth. What of all the other programs that have accrued? Then we are told that there is something wrong with the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. I propose to remind honourable senators of the track record in regard to TEAS. We are told that the amount paid ought to be equal to that required to sustain living standards. The Whitlam Government, of which Senator Georges was a member, set up the Williams Committee. That Committee brought down a report-which the Whitlam Government accepted-stating that TEAS was not meant to be a sustenance allowance at all; it was to represent a supplement for the student. The Whitlam Government accepted that principle. In fact, in the last 18 months of its regime, it did not increase the TEAS allowance at all. That allowance declined severely in terms of purchasing power. We are confronted now by the sudden-found argument that we ought to be doing more. In fact, we have brought down Bills which have created new frontiers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Labor Party supporters have offered criticism of the Government's policies concerning non-government schools but, year after year, the Schools Commission has reported that the average non-government school has a resources level that is significantly below that of government schools. If there is to be equality, instead of the average in the non-government school being some 70 per cent of the standard attained by government schools, should not members of the Opposition welcome this Government's lifting of the standard in the non-government schools? Always there is the pretense that non-government schools are rich and that government schools are poor. The Karmel targets and the Schools Commission targets showed the reverse, that in fact 90 per cent of non-government schools were in level 6, the class of most disadvantaged. So one by one the dollies fell in the debate tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, there is, I understand, unanimity about these two Bills and about what they seek to achieve. The other matters that have been raised will all have their chance of being discussed when the supplementary measures are brought before the Senate. The fact is that great progress has been made in education in Australia over recent years, and much more is to be made. Senator Georges referred to teachers colleges and to teachers. In the six years from 1972 to 1978 the increase in the number of teachers in Australia was over 30 per cent, although the school population increased by less than 6 per cent. There was an enormous upsurge and expansion in the number of teachers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My opportunity to speak on the first reading of this Bill was deferred for a couple of weeks and in that time one matter additional to the two other points I intend to raise has blown up. I refer to the disclosure, or announcement, today that the Queensland Government has secured an extra $16m or $17m by means of bluster and bravado after the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said that not another cent would be granted. I have two observations to make about that fact. The first is that it has obviously tarnished Mr Fraser's carefully cultivated macho image. Indeed it has ignominiously collapsed. As always, the Prime Minister, when confronted by Mr Bjelke-Petersen, caved in. The second is that the Premier of Western Australia has been shown to be a paper tiger-he cannot frighten even Mr Fraser. Whilst Western Australian Liberals have done a great deal of local grandstanding, the Prime Minister knows that they will toe the toady line when called upon to do so, whereas Senator Bonner and Senator Martin have shown from time to time that they are rather different.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to raise two other matters. The first is to lodge a protest about the way in which the Government conducted the business of the Estimates committees and failed to inform the Opposition. Although not a member of the Estimates committees which were scheduled to meet on 27 April, I had a particular interest in several of the issues before those committees. I was told by the Opposition Whip on Friday 24 April-that was the weekend of the air strike, in case it has been forgotten-that if the hostesses strike was still on the Estimates committees would not be sitting on the Monday, as scheduled. That information was confirmed at around 4.30 on the Friday afternoon by the Government with the Opposition Whip and passed on to me. The Whip's secretary did not know until Monday morning that, in fact, the Government had called on the Estimates committees to meet. </PARA>
<PARA> There were a number of questions which I wanted to put to those committees but which I was not able to put as I was stranded in Perth. Nor, of course, because of the airline strike, was I able to post those questions to those members of the Australian Labor Party who were able to attend committee meetings. That is in conformity with the way in which the Government has conducted the business of this chamber throughout most of this session and the situation is steadily getting worse. We see anything up to six changes in one day in the order of business listed on the Notice Paper. The Government cannot plan its activities half an hour ahead. Given that it cannot run the business of Parliament House, it is no wonder that it cannot run the country satisfactorily. </PARA>
<PARA> The second issue which I have been waiting a couple of weeks to raise is an issue which is again in the news following the Rundle partners scandal and particularly the huge 20 February turnover in which nearly half a million shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange alone changed hands following the visit of the Minister for National Development and Energy, Senator Carrick, to the Rundle site on 18 February. That is, of course, the issue of insider trading. The extraordinarily high number of shares which changed hands following that visit naturally begs the question: Is there some connection between the visit and the subsequent heavy trading on the Stock Exchange? That the Ministers of this Government, especially Senator Carrick and the Minister for Trade and Resources, Mr Anthony, who waxed lyrical about Australia having sufficient oil locked up in shale to last 12,000 years, were responsible for talking up the Rundle shares in the first place is a matter of public record and is beyond dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no proof that any Ministers actually traded in shares or unloaded them on 20 February. However, we know that several prominent Liberals, including at least one Minister, hold or have traded in Rundle shares. These prominent Liberals include the Liberals Party's public relations manager, Mr Robert Baudino; his wife; Senator and various other MacGibbons; Judith Thomson, wife of the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson); and, according to an admission wrung from the Prime Minister last Thursday week, another Minister in a direct capacity. One can only speculate on whether that Minister is one of the two present and one previous Ministers who have been reported to some journalists to have been trading heavily in Rundle, naturally through nominee companies. The Prime Minister certainly is not eager to name that Minister or Ministers to which he referred last Thursday week. A year ago he dodged two questions from Senator Wriedt on this matter. The Prime Minister and Senator Carrick dodged many more questions last month and at the beginning of this month. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's standard reply is that all Ministers are abiding by the Bowen guidelines. The catch is that we do not know what those guidelines are. He asserts that all Ministers abide by these undefined guidelines. When any Minister is shown to be in dubious pecuniary interests position the Prime Minister asserts that that position is within the guidelines, which are still not defined. This is a sort of benign or inverted catch-22 situation in which nobody can be caught. Nobody can be caught outside the guidelines because of their potential, infinite flexibility. The operation is expedited by disclosing nothing voluntarily to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> The most notorious insider trading scandal in history was probably that concerning the Poseidon company in 1969 and 1970. Not all of the Poseidon stories have been told. One of these stories concerns one Esther Grace Stevens who worked in the office of Burrill and Jones, who were at the time consulting geologists to the Poseidon company. Esther Stevens bought 300 Poseidon shares between 15 and 18 September 1969. At that time the company was drilling at Windarra. Sometime between 26 and 29 September a Geomin laboratory employee stationed in Kalgoorlie supplied to Mr Burrill the result of the first Windarra nickel assay. At 30 September Esther Stevens, who worked in the office of Burrill and Jones, bought 400 shares, which was fortuitous because the next day the public found out about the assay via a statement to the Adelaide Stock Exchange and the share prices rocketed. That information regarding those dates comes from page 16 and other places in the 1974 report of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange, commonly known as the Rae report. </PARA>
<PARA> The 700 shares owned by Esther Stevens would, if they had been purchased at the daily price quoted, have cost $2,495.80 or, in round figures, $2,500. Between 6 December 1969 and 16 January 1970 Esther Stevens sold 570 of those 700 shares. For those shares-again if she sold at the quoted daily price-she received $44,510 or, in round figures, $44,500, a profit of $42,000. She still had 130 shares. Subsequently, without the benefit of the inside knowledge she gained as an employee of Burrill and Jones, her speculation was not so profitable. At this stage I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table showing the purchase and sale of Poseidon shares by Esther Grace Stevens with share certificate numbers and the quoted daily price. The quoted daily price has been obtained from Australian Financial Review reports. The share certificate numbers and other material have been obtained from the Poseidon share register. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One point to be made regarding that table, in case somebody picks it up and sees more to it than there probably is, is that one of the dates-6 December-was, in fact, a Saturday, which seems to be anomalous. At that time given the heavy volume of share trading, I guess it is quite possible, that some transactions may have been actually processed on a Saturday. Either that is what happened or a slight clerical error has been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the time of this trading Esther Stevens was engaged to one Noel Browne, who has since become Noel Crichton-Browne, a senator elect from Western Australia. Esther is now Mrs Crichton-Browne. It is common knowledge in the north-west that Noel Browne too made good use of the inside information provided by Esther and possibly by others. Unfortunately, his trading is not recorded in the Poseidon register in his own name. Like the Ministers alleged to have been trading in the Rundle twins he preferred to remain anonymous-very wisely too, considering he was a mining registrar at the time. The senator elect is described by some fellow West Australian Liberal members of parliament as 'the crook' or 'that crook Crichton-Browne'. However, he is well qualified to join the Fraser team and uphold the ethical standards established by the Prime Minister, his loan bludging relatives who broke the law of Victoria to get a 4 per cent loan, the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair)--</PARA>

Senator Chaney said that he thought that those words might have been used in substantive motions, and no doubt they were. I have quoted them here before. But they were also discussed in the party room. Just to put Senator Chaney's mind at rest, I quote from page 1314 of the Senate Hansard of 13 May 1975. I will not quote all the words but just some of them to illustrate one instance where the words used were not spoken in a substantive motion. Senator Carrick, when speaking in a debate about the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the other cable there is a series of statements which the Government knows to be lies because its own Department says they are lies. Its own Department publishes information proving that the Government is lying. The Government, knowing this, corruptly uses the information to show its full support. </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to talk about lies, corruption and deceit. That was all in the course of debate, not in respect of a substantive motion. Mr President, I think the day is fast coming when I will have to stand up in this chamber and make a speech and include all those things in the one speech so that Senator Chaney will be made aware of what took place when he was in Opposition. When he was in Opposition, he made no objection to any of those statements. Senator Chaney sat on this side of the chamber and I sat on the other side of the chamber and he revelled in the fact that his own leader, Senator Carrick, levelled all these accusations at Mr Whitlam and his Ministers. And he thought it was great. He gloried in it. But now that Senator Walsh on this side of the chamber, who is very temperate in his language at this stage, makes some remarks, Senator Chaney objects to them. I might add, Mr President, that votes were taken in this place on those occasions and you, Senator Chaney and Senator Missen-I do not know whether the other two honourable senators opposite were here at the time-were recorded as having voted for those substantive motions which accused the Whitlam Ministry, and other people in the Government, including me, of being corrupt, dishonest and deceitful. I say again that it ill becomes Senator Chaney as a lawyer, and a man of some legal standing, to rise in this place and to object to the very temperate words that have been used so far by my colleague Senator Walsh. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have been talking tonight about the functions of the Review of Commonwealth Functions committee. I would like to talk about some of the functions of government in the opportunity provided by the first reading of this money Bill, first of all in a general way and then in a more particular way. The review committee did a good job insofar as it looked at what the functions of government should be and what resources we should devote to it. But what the committee did was really only phase one. There are two parts to any review of this nature. The first is the actual functions performed by governments and the second is how efficiently those functions are performed-whether we are getting value for every dollar we spend or whether we are spending a dollar and getting only 40c worth. These are two different considerations but both must be weighed if we are to get the cost of government down, which certainly is the aim of everyone on this side of the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The review committee looked at the end points of government actions and looked at functions as ends in themselves. That is a self-limiting exercise because one very soon runs out of things that can be cut out and thrown away. There is a need to go back to basics, to go back and review what the duties of a Federal government should be. Those duties, of course, are quite different in many ways from those of a State government. When the duties of a Federal government have been defined, then we can move to the structure of that government, the ministry, and achieve efficiency in that way. As far as I am aware, there has never been a review of this nature performed in the Federal Parliament. Since Federation, the four basic duties of a Federal government, namely, the offices of treasury, defence, foreign affairs and the Attorney-General, have had functions grafted on to them to accommodate the pressing needs of the time and the demands at a national level or, on some occasions, to accommodate the needs of personalities either in the form of a Prime Minister or for political reasons within the government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> I took the time to write out the present departments of this Government without including the names of the Ministers. To say the least, the result looks very strange. If we look at all those departments and think about them divorced from the personalities, the Ministers involved in managing them, it really is quite an odd list. Looked at in that way, I am not sure that we can argue persuasively that that is the very best way to run Australia. That is an important point because good organisation does not necessarily give good management, but poor organisation makes good management difficult or even impossible in many cases. If we look at the ministries apart from the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Government in the Senate who, I think should be a Minister without portfolio, clearly a case can be made out for the combination of some ministries, the expansion of others, the elimination of some and the creation of some new departments. </PARA>
<PARA> One example of combination that is quite glaring is all the finance or money related ministries. I believe they should be combined in some way so that the policies can be co-ordinated. Quite clearly, the offices of the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Finance, the Department of Trade and Resources, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs all have something in common. I am not saying that there should be only one Minister: Far from it. I think there should be a number of Ministers in the department and really, the number of Ministers is not of any concern to me. Nor am I saying that the one main department should necessarily be split into the sub-divisions which the present departments represent. We obviously would need some divisions in this. But just as we got at the Department of Defence and combined it with four other departments-the Departments of Army, Navy, Air and Supply-to make one Department of Defence, I think the same argument can be extended to Treasury, though taking care not to repeat some of the organisational mistakes which are now manifest in the Department of Defence. That is an experience we can learn from. </PARA>
<PARA> That leads me to the case for expansion in the Department of Defence. Quite clearly, the load placed on one Minister in that area is impossible. Five departments have been combined into one. I think it can be argued that we need at least one Minister for the armed services, one for supply and maybe even more. </PARA>
<PARA> Dealing with departments that could be eliminated, the obvious choice is the Department of the Capital Territory. We need a Minister for the Capital Territory as much as we need a Minister for the city of Ipswich in Queensland. To have a Minister for the Capital Territory is just a nonsense. All of the State functions that are performed by the Federal Government, such as health and education, do not deserve departments of their own. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am on that theme of federal relations, I say that quite clearly the results of the events of last week emphasise the need for creating a department which is responsbile for the management of federal affairs. It is surprising that, as Australia is a federation, that has not been done in a formal way previously. Once there is some agreement on the duties of the Federal Government and related structure, the next step is to go to the people involved in the Public Service-the heads of departments. Most heads of departments are capable people but some of them fall short of the high standards that are required in these positions. It is important to fill these departmental positions with people who have the abilities that are required for the job. When we get people with the abilities at the top we can move down and get the efficiency in the department that we require to give us cuts in the numbers and in costs. </PARA>
<PARA> I personally deplore staff ceilings and staff cuts of an arbitrary nature. We lose only the tea ladies and the gardeners when we go about it in that way. We do not get rid of the fundamental structure which has caused the proliferation of numbers. To make arbitrary cuts is bad politics because it just alienates the Public Service against the government of the day. Public servants take the opportunity with the public to attack the Government and to blame it for all the shortcomings. Such cuts are also illogical becaue they take no account of priorities and do not reward efficiency. Reduction in numbers and improvement in operations are achieved by working from the top down, not from the bottom up. I think implicit in this principle is the need to review terms and conditions and promotional criteria in the Public Service and the pyramidal structure of departments. I do not propose to develop that theme tonight because I wish to leave time for Senator Hamer to speak if possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to move from a general discussion of the operations of the Government to a discussion of one departmental organisation in particular. One Department seems to have had more than its share of organisational problems in recent years. I refer to the Department of Transport and particularly to its aviation activities. There are many reasons for the problems that have arisen in this area but fundamentally they have come about because the Department has the wrong structure. All we have done is to prove that we cannot combine aviation with surface transport. I recognise the fact that there is a big difference between land and sea, but there is a very much bigger difference between air operations and surface operations. One area is two dimensional and the other is three dimensional. It is rather trite to put it in those terms, but there is a very real difference in attitude and in capacity required to operate in those two fields. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia learned how to operate efficient air services over many years. I think we are not living off the fat of that experience. It was a very expensive learning process in terms of both lives and money. We learned under the concept of a single dedicated regulatory service-the Department of Civil Aviation. That Department was disrupted when we acquired the multimodal concept which is really the product of a collectivist philosophy and a collectivist government that was in office at the time. The belief of that government was quite simplistically that all transport is transport and all we need are good administrators to run it. </PARA>
<PARA> I should explain that I have some interest in this matter. I have been interested in aviation for many years. I have been flying for a long while and I have owned my own aircraft. I have been very closely involved with the Department. I have a fair insight into the way in which it has operated over a matter of decades. My concerns are with some of the problems that I see connected with the aviation section of the Department of Transport today. I am concerned about morale, the capacity and the capability of the Department, industrial relations-the way in which negotiations are handled with internal airlines and international airliness and the poor state of relations between the Department of Transport and the various sectors of aviation industry. I am very concerned at the slow erosion that is occurring in the safety standards in aviation in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at morale first of all. People joined the Department of Civil Aviation because they were interested in aviation-not only in flying but also in all of the things that go with it. They joined because that was what they wanted to do in life. When the Department of Transport was formed most of the skilled people came from the old DCA. They were transferred to other transport functions. We had cases of people with aviation backgrounds being sent to be directors of lighthouses or something like that. There is a story, probably apocryphal, of a regional director of civil aviation in one of the States who went on holidays. He was replaced by somebody in the Public Service who had an equivalent rating, who received the same salary and all the rest, but who used to be involved with railways or ships or something of that nature. So no decisions that were normally taken by a regional director could be taken during the period when the replacement filled the post. </PARA>
<PARA> All these things together with the shift to Canberra, where the industry has been quite divorced from the Department, have added up to a degraduation in morale. People have lost their esprit de corps. They feel that they do not have an identity, that there is no purpose in what they are doing. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the most visible sign of problems within the Department is in the area of industrial relations. Formerly the links were so intimate that the Department of Civil Aviation knew in advance what industrial problems were coming and these problems were intercepted and corrected in time. We did not have the business of strikes by controllers, hostesses or pilots that have so plagued the operations of the airlines in the last five years. There is a very real cost to the community in the lack of that contact. The relations within the airlines are a classical case of what I am talking about. Inquiries are being conducted incessantly into matters related to the airline industry because not many people in the Department of Transport now know what civil aviation is all about. Our relations with the Association of South East Asian Nations have caused us considerable trouble in the international area. That comes largely from the advice that has been received from the Department of Transport. That is to say nothing of the troubles we have had with the Australian population with regard to air fares, both internal and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department also has very poor relations now with most of the sectors of the industry. There was always a competitive atmosphere in relationships with the Department of Civil Aviation inevitably because we had operators mixing with regulators. Quite clearly, the atmosphere in the past was very much better than the one that exists today. There was a basis of mutal respect on both sides for the people in the business. </PARA>
<PARA> Erosion of safety standards is a rather intangible matter. Under the separate Department we had the best safety standards in the world. I cannot point yet to any increased accident rate but one senses that things are not all that they might be. There is a lack of experienced people and morale is poor. These things do not bode well for the future. To ensure safety we need careful, analytical thought and discussion, experience, adequate training, discipline, good organisation and a high morale. We have had an erosion on economic grounds of the margins that once existed in the industry. There are now enormous pressures on all aviation operators to cut costs to the bare minimum. This is evidence in graduated power takeoffs, maximisation of seats in aircraft and many other things. They are not significant in themselves but cumulatively they gradually erode the margins of safety that we have built in over the years. In addition to this there is the effect of strikes, the refuellers strikes for example. More and more aircraft are flying when these strikes are on-flying at maximum all-up weight, carrying fuel so that they do not have to fuel at airports where fuel is not available. All of these things add up to an insurance of safety rather than an assurance of safety. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish my remarks to be taken out of perspective on this matter. I do not wish to be alarmist in any way at all. But it is a matter that needs some very careful attention and some very careful thought. </PARA>
<PARA> The most recent activity in which the Department of Transport has been involved has been the General Aviation Study which was tabled in this Parliament a few weeks ago. I hope that at a later date we will have the opportunity of debating that subject at much greater length. I would like to make one point, and go into a little detail about that study. First of all, I should define a few statistics about the general aviation industry. There are 5,865 aircraft or 97.8 per cent of aircraft on the register which fall into this category. The hours flown annually by this section are 1.6 million or 82 per cent of all hours flown in Australia. They carry 133,000 tonnes of freight annually, or 50 per cent of all the freight carried, which is a greater fraction then freight carried by the major airlines. They carry two million passengers annually or 16 per cent of the passenger traffic in this country. The number of aircraft in this category has doubled in 10 years, the hours flown are up 55 per cent and the capital involved in the aircraft probably exceeds $550m. </PARA>
<PARA> In this sector the problem of cost recovery is very acute. Basically, the cost recovery doctrine says that all the costs involved will be paid by the user of that sector. In aggregate that means that everyone involved in aviation should pay all the costs of providing the regulatory functions and services of the Department. That rather denies the commonsense point of view that the community benefits by having an aviation industry in this country-from the point of view of defence, from the employment benefit that it brings, the communications and the social cohesion, and above all the tourist trade, particularly the international tourist trade which we are trying so hard to develop. It is not exaggerating to say that someone who never flies as a passenger benefits in living in this community from the services that the aviation industry provides. But when the costs are fully attributed and broken up to various sectors within the industry some problems come to light. They come to light more acutely with the general aviation sector than anywhere else. There is a case to be made that there is taxation without adequate representation. The Department of Transport does impose certain standards of equipment on the general aviation sector that it does not need, that it does not want, but it really does not have much say in the whole business. It is simply told to pay. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, yes, and there are under 200 of the larger aircraft in the country. If the cost could be allocated correctly, no one in the general aviation sector would have any quibble at all. But when figures are bandied around in public that the general aviation sector pays only 12.6 per cent of the cost attributed to it, people in the industry get very concerned. When they are told that that 12.6 per cent will be raised to 34 per cent, in the words of the report 'as rapidly as possible, dependent upon the degree of suppression that can be tolerated' people get very concerned. As Senator Missen said, the operators in this great sector, which comprises over 5,000 aircraft, of which 3,323 are in the private sector-the great majority of aircraft on the Australian register-want only grass airfields. They do not want sealed runways, they do not want elaborate air traffic control procedures. Most of them operate on their own in visual flight rule conditions. I quote from page 60 of the report, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Most GA flights in Australia are carried out outside controlled airspace under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) procedures which provide 'see and be seen' conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>The demands made by VFR operations are very limited. The do not require elaborate navigational aids, they do not require the things that the airliners require. In fact, about the only thing that is ever used by general aviation aircraft is the automatic direction finders, ADFs, and most general aviation pilots work off the commercial broadcasting stations, because they have a greater range than the non-directional beacons, NDBs, operated by the Department. I quote from page 169 of the report on this matter. The Department takes the numbers of aircraft and relates those to movements. In making its cost attribution, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The major factor used in the apportionment of airway and operations direct costs was aircraft movements. </PARA>
<PARA>Again on page 162, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the number of movements by aircraft in each of the sectors is often used as a guide for cost allocation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the fallacy on which the whole document founders. What is required is for the Department to recognise that there is a very great difference between most general aviation operations and the commuter airlines which are included in the General Aviation Study, and which are essentially public transport operators, and very close to being in the RPT category, and therefore they should be classified in the airline section of the report and taken out of the general aviation section. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very sympathetic to the needs of the commuter airlines. They have a much harder row to hoe than the regular airlines. Their financial problems are very acute, and they need support from the Government in many ways. But it is quite wrong to allocate the cost of the general aviation sector, as this report does specifically at page 165, to the private operators. Basically those are to meet the needs of computer airlines which are mini airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the table on page 165 of the study, we see an astonishing allocation of costs. At competitive airports, which are basically the international airports in Australia the international airlines are assigned $33.8m, but other general aviation, which is principally the private operator, is assigned $38m. That is just a nonsense. There is no way I can go flying into Sydney or Melbourne on demand any time I like. Against that $38m which is allocated to general aviation, only $9.5m is allocated to computer operations. If we look at regional airports, we see that the disparity is $1.8m for computer operations against $11.1m for general aviation. In commuter airports, which are specifically named after the commuters because they operate into them, we have $1.9m for commuters against $11.5m for private operators. This is nonsense. The commuters have to be taken out of the general aviation sector. If that happens, we will get to a reasonable actuarial basis for assessing funds. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to continue much longer. I think there is a real case for looking at the operations of the Department of Transport with a view to going back to having a ministry that is concerned with aviation in this country in the civil field. I would like to see that Department go back to the three essentials that it was once concerned with; that is, air operations, air worthiness and air traffic control. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had hoped that the matter that I wish to raise tonight would have been raised last Tuesday during the Joint Sitting of the Parliament. It would have been more appropriate had it been done then. As I missed the opportunity to raise this matter last Tuesday at the Joint Sitting I put my name down to speak on the first reading of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1981. I had hoped to get the opportunity to speak on this matter last Wednesday or Thursday, but because of the complete disarray in which the Government seems to find itself, and the business sheet being altered sometimes three or four times a day, I have had to wait until today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter that I wish to refer to is legislation which has been before the Senate on three occasions previously; that is, legislation to allow the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory to have Senate representation. Tonight I will confine my remarks to Senate representation for the Australian Capital Territory. I found it very interesting sitting here last Tuesday and listening to the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) when nominating Mrs Reid as senator for the Australian Capital Territory to fill the vacancy created by the untimely death of a man well respected by us all, Senator John Knight. The matter was capped off when Senator Carrick seconded the nomination. He said that he was privileged to second the nomination of Mrs Reid. He said at the conclusion of his very short speech:</PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that she will be considered a considerable acquisition to the Senate. She conforms to the requirements of the Electoral Act and other legislation. I am happy to commend Mrs Reid to the Joint Sitting. </PARA>
<PARA>When we look at the debates in this chamber on three occasions and in the Joint Sitting held to get legislation through so that this Joint Sitting could be held it is revealing to see what Senator Carrick said on those occasions and how he changed his mind completely last Tuesday. We must remember that if it had not been for the Joint Sitting forced upon the Whitlam Labor Government in 1974 there would not have been a Joint Sitting in the Senate last Tuesday to fill a casual Senate vacancy for the Australian Capital Territory because we would not have had the legislation to allow senators from both the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory to be represented or to take their seats in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier the legislation came before this chamber on three occasions and every time the Opposition had the numbers and voted against it. Before we had the Joint Sitting the Liberal Party went to the High Court of Australia and sought to have the legislation declared invalid. After it was passed by a Joint Sitting of both Houses the Liberal Party again challenged the legislation in the High Court. It was defeated as it was on all other Bills which it challenged in the High Court. The will of the people prevailed and we were proved to be right. That is beside the point. Honourable senators who sit opposite took every opportunity to prevent this chamber having senators representing the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. If the Liberal Party had had its way Senator Kilgariff, Senator Robertson, Senator Reid and Senator Ryan would not be senators. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Bill is to remove an anomaly in the Beef Industry (Incentive Payments) Act 1977 which affected the amounts which lawfully could be paid to certain claimants. Honourable senators will recall that the beef industry incentive payments scheme was introduced in 1977 as one of a number of Government measures to assist the then ailing beef industry. It was aimed at assisting the cash flow position of producers and enabling them to maintain desirable standards of cattle husbandry. Producers were eligible for a payment of $10 per head of cattle receiving any one of certain approved husbandry treatments during the 12 months from September 1977. Payments were limited to a maximum of $2,000 per producer. Payments made under the scheme totalled $118m. The assistance provided went a long way in helping beef cattle producers to maintain a satisfactory level of husbandry in difficult financial circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The anomaly which the Bill sets out to correct concern sets of producers who between them own more than one cattle herd. A typical example is where two individuals each own a herd of their own and as partners also own a third herd. As the Act stands, payment of the maximum $2,000 against a claim by the partnership rendered each of the partners ineligible for any further payment in respect of their individual herds. If, on the other hand, claims were first lodged and paid in respect of the individual herds, each of the claimants could receive $2,000 for a total between them of $4,000. The partnership would then not qualify for any payment. These provisions mean that the amounts which lawfully could be paid to groups of producers with similar herds and ownership arrangements could vary depending only on the order in which claims were lodged and paid. </PARA>
<PARA> This anomaly was unforeseen when the Act was introduced and the Government proposes that it should now be corrected. To that end, we propose to amend the Act to enable all these interrelated claims to be assessed in the order which maximises the total of the amounts payable. This will ensure that no claimants suffer a disadvantage because of claims being lodged in one order rather than another. Most claims have already been assessed in this way and consequently the amendment will not require any substantial additional payments to be made.</PARA>
<PARA> Initially, the Department of Primary Industry assessed claims made by sole proprietors separately from claims by partnerships. This procedure was found not to accord with the Act and to have resulted in overpayments. Claims were then reassessed and action to recover the overpayments was put in hand. The overpayments totalled $432,000 on 300 claims, some 83 per cent of which have since been recovered. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators may recall that these matters attracted comment by the Auditor General in his 1978-79 report to Parliament. Subsequently, they were the subject of an inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts. In re-examining related claims received from sole proprietors and partnerships the Department of Primary Industry assessed claims in the order which maximised the collective payments to the set of claimants. This was done without regard to the order in which the individual claims were actually lodged or paid. Subsequent advice from the Attorney-General's Department indicated that this course was only appropriate for claims which were capable of being assessed concurrently. Without amendment to the Act it was inappropriate to include a previously paid claim in the reassessment as if it had not been paid. The requirement to take order of payment into account in assessing related claims is the anomaly which this Bill redresses. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have explained, the majority of claims already have been assessed and paid in the manner now proposed. Only a handful of existing claims, which have not been fully paid pending a government decision on the procedures to be applied, remain to be finalised. Such payments are estimated at $50,000. If the Act is not amended as the Government proposes, payments totalling some $700,000 in respect of 542 claims will legally be classed as overpayments. That situation results simply from the fact that the claimants did not lodge their claims in the order which gave the most beneficial result permitted by the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the specific provisions of the Bill. Sub-clause 3 (1) inserts a new section 9A in the principal Act. The new section overcomes the anomaly to which I have referred. It provides that where the total of two or more incentive payments would vary depending on the order in which payments are made, then the payments shall be made in the order which maximises the total of these payments. Sub-clause 3 (2) provides for further payments to be made in accordance with the new section 9A against the small number of claims yet to be finalised. Sub-clause 3 (3) provides that no previous lawful payment shall be converted to an overpayment by virtue of operation of the new provision whereby the order of payment of claim is disregarded. This is considered to be a necessary safeguard even though an examination of claims has not disclosed any cases where this would occur. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 2 of the Bill provides that the new section 9A of the principal Act shall be deemed to have come into operation from commencement of the principal Act on 10 November 1977. The other provisions to which I have referred will come into operation on the day on which the amendment Act receives the royal assent. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish very briefly, as I indicated to the Whip's office, to mention a matter of concern to people in the vicinity of Devonport, Latrobe and a wide area radiating from that city and that town. It concerns the proposal by the Federal Government to agree to the Devonport Marine Board's acquiring local ownership on behalf of the community of the Devonport airport. I express concern that the decision by the Federal Government should not be delayed by any considerations arising out of any proposals by any other local community in Tasmania to acquire local ownership of its airport. In other words, the State Government has passed legislation to enable the Devonport Marine Board to acquire local ownership. This is in accordance with the national Government's policy of encouraging transfers in regions such as the north-west coast of Tasmania. It seems to many people in our local community that there is no valid reason for the inordinate delay on behalf of the national Government in signing or ratifying such agreements as are necessary to transfer that ownership. I simply ask that we receive an assurance from the Government that the signing of such transfer should take place in the very near future and be totally independent of any decision which relates to any other Tasmanian airport.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Carrick</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In its 1980 election policy statement the Government re-affirmed its commitment to freedom of choice in school level education. Accordingly, it was announced that recurrent and capital grants for non-government schools would be increased during the life of the present Parliament. In his statement of 11 January 1981, the Minister for Education announced details of the first stage of the Commonwealth Government's undertakings in the area of recurrent funding. The existing six-level subsidy scheme for Commonwealth general recurrent grants will be changed to a three-level system. Over the years 1981-83 the basic rate of subsidy will be increased to 20 per cent of standard government school operating costs at both primary and secondary levels.</PARA>
<PARA> Schools presently classified to Levels 4 and 5 will receive a supplementary grant equivalent to 10 per cent of government school costs, giving a total subsidy of 30 per cent for the second level. The schools most in need in terms of resource standards, those presently classified Level 6, will be moved to a 40 per cent subsidy rate.</PARA>
<PARA> As a first step in 1981, Level 6 primary and secondary non-government schools will receive per capita grants equivalent to 36 and 35 per cent respectively of government school costs. This will provide an estimated additional $12 for each primary pupil and $40 for each secondary pupil over and above the increases already announced in the context of the 1980-81 Budget. These increases mean that 84 per cent of the increased grants would be directed in 1981 to those schools in most need because of their low resources. The table below sets out details of the implementation of the increased subsidy rates.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Commonwealth assistance to non-government schools recognises the right of the parents of all Australian school children to a basic level of financial support from public sources for their children's education, as well as the right to additional support for children in those non-government schools which have a relatively greater need because of lower resources. The minimum 20 per cent subsidy rate has been a long-standing policy of the present Government. Underlying its programs of assistance to government and non-government schools is a concern to ensure that freedom of choice and equality of opportunity continue to apply to all Australian school children.</PARA>
<PARA> The base levels of funds allocated by the Government in 1981 as direct financial assistance for government schools in the States and the Northern Territory, through programs administered by the Schools Commission, is being maintained at the same level in real terms as in 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Dr McKinnon was not relieved of his position as Chairman of the Schools Commission. When his period of appointment expired, the Government exercised its prerogative to make a fresh appointment.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) To put the overall funding situation in perspective it should be pointed out that for government schools the role of the Commonwealth is one of 'topping up' the resources provided by State Governments and the Commonwealth contribution to governments school costs is about 12 per cent. Any inadequacies in staffing and facilities at particular schools are primarily a matter for the States' attention since expenditures are made, including expenditures from Commonwealth general purpose grants, in accordance with States' priorities, over which the Commonwealth has no responsibility or control.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Federal Government in the United States of America offers financial incentives for the purchase of solar water heaters. Some State and local governments also provide various kinds of incentives.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The development and use of solar energy in Australia is being actively encouraged. As a result of the Prime Minister's statement of 27 June 1979 detailing the Government's energy policy, a provision, exemption Item 153, was introduced into the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act which exempts from Sales tax all solar appliances for all uses and certain classes of goods connected with the use of solar energy, such as pumps, stands, racks and motors used in solar panel water flow and storage systems.</PARA>
<PARA> These exemption provisions have provided significant financial incentive to people wishing to install solar water heaters in their homes.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Government is seeking to make solar appliances more attractive to the public by funding, through the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council, research projects aimed at improving their reliability and cost-effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has provided added incentive to fuel users through taxation concessions which encourage commercial and industrial users of oil-fired and LPG-fired equipment to convert or replace their equipment with plant utilising non-oil energy sources, such as solar.</PARA>
<PARA> Last financial year the solar industry had a turnover estimated at about $20 million and about $30 million in sales is anticipated this financial year. Domestic sales have been growing 50 to 60 per cent a year for six years or more.</PARA>
<PARA> These encouraging results provide evidence that the community is becoming aware that the rising price of oil products combined with a high average level of sunshine hours per day in many parts of Australia have combined to make solar water heaters increasingly attractive.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Department of Veterans' Affairs has no plans to disband the Repatriation Artificial Limb and Appliance Centres (RALACs). Long term planning envisages that there will be a degree of decentralisation of the service currently provided, with the establishment of prosthetic and orthotic centres in select locations throughout the community.</PARA>
<PARA> Over the past few years, as a direct response to the needs of amputees and requests from amputee organisations or institutions providing for the needs of amputees, Repatriation Artificial Limb and Appliance Sub-centres have been established in Canberra, Newcastle and Townsville. Regular visiting services are also provided to a number of other regional centres.</PARA>
<PARA> In each instance the sub-centre has been located in an established health facility where the staff of the sub-centre can participate fully in the clinical management and rehabilitiation of the amputee. These sub-centres are staffed by RALAC staff who have transferred from the major centres which experienced a decreased workload upon the opening of a sub-centre. The sub-centres have proved most successful and it is envisaged that further developments along these lines will occur in the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Capital Territory has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am advised by my Department that there is no comprehensive legislation in force in the Australian Capital Territory to control either noise, water or air pollution. The following Australian Capital Territory ordinances and regulations allow for limited control:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Noise-The Animal Nuisance Control Ordinance 1975 covers noise emitted by animals; the Inspection of Machinery Regulations made pursuant to the Machinery Ordinance 1949 sets noise levels above which the use of hearing protection devices is compulsory in the workplace; the Motor Traffic Ordinance 1936 allows for the refusal of registration for a motor vehicle which emits excessive noise and provides that it is an offence to drive a motor vehicle which emits undue noise; and the Police Offences Ordinance 1930 provides an offence of emission of noise which causes undue disturbance. In addition, the Small Claims Ordinance 1974 allows individuals to take action to have noise nuisance emitted by neighbours abated.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Water Contamination-The Police Offences Ordinance 1930 provides for offences against the dumping of dead animals and the diversion of water-courses; the Cotter River Ordinance 1914 seeks to protect the Cotter River catchment; the Public Health (General Sanitation) Regulations made pursuant to the Public Health Ordinance 1928 provide for the protection of the water supply; the Canberra Water Supply (Googong Dam) Act 1974 provides for the protection of that part of the Canberra water supply derived from the Googong Dam; the Canberra Sewerage and Water Supply Regulations made pursuant to the Building and Services Ordinance 1924 provide for an offence for pollution of a stream which is part of the water supply; and the Lakes Ordinance 1976 provides for an offence for pollution of a lake and any stream, creek or river flowing into a lake.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Air Pollution-The Building Ordinance 1972 allows the Building Controller in considering plans and specifications to take into account whether the proposed structure makes adequate provision for the disposal of smoke, gas, fumes, and ash; and the NSW Smoke Abatement Act 1902, in its applicaiton to the ACT, provides that it is an offence for a person to use a furnace which has not been constructed so as to prevent the formation of smoke therein.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) All of the legislation referred to in (1) is administered by the Minister for the Capital Territory with the exception of the Police Offences Ordinance which is administered by the Attorney-General and the Public Health Ordinance which is administered by the Minister for Health. Various powers and procedures are available under the legislation which does apply:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Noise-The Registrar of Dogs is given power under the Animal Nuisance Control Ordinance to make an application to the Court for an order which may order that an animal not be kept, that specified works be carried out or in any other manner that the Court thinks fit.</PARA>
<PARA> The Chief Inspector of Machinery and Inspectors appointed under the Inspection of Machinery Regulations have the power to enter any premises when machinery is in operation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Registrar of Motor Vehicles has power to refuse registration to a vehicle which does not comply with registration standards and the Police have normal powers to prosecute persons who operate a motor vehicle which causes undue noise.</PARA>
<PARA> The police have normal powers of prosecution under the Police Offences Ordinance.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Water Contamination-The police have normal powers of prosecution under the Police Offences Ordinance;</PARA>
<PARA> The Capital Territory Health Commission, Medical Officer of Health and Inspectors have powers under the Public Health Ordinance and Public Health (General Sanitation) Regulations to prosecute offenders;</PARA>
<PARA> The National Capital Development Commission has powers to plan and make provision for the prevention of pollution of water supplied or to be supplied from the Googong Dam under the Canberra Water Supply (Googong Dam) Act;</PARA>
<PARA> The Proper Authority appointed for the purposes of the Canberra Sewerage and Water Supply Regulations and the Minister have power to prosecute offenders;</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for the Capital Territory or the police have the power to prosecute offenders under the Lakes Ordinance;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Air Pollution-The Building Controller has power to refuse approval for a structure under the Building Ordinance.</PARA>
<PARA> The police or an owner or occupier of premises may bring an action under the NSW Smoke Nuisance Abatement Act.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Statistics have been gathered since April 1976 on the numbers of complaints received relating to noise, water and air pollution. These are:</PARA>
<PARA> a. Noise-913</PARA>
<PARA> b. Water Pollution-118</PARA>
<PARA> c. Air Pollution-145</PARA>
<PARA> Statistics are not available on the number of prosecutions for particular offences relating to the various forms of pollution.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Capital Territory has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Dieback and death of many species of eucalyptus (gum) and acacia (wattle) is common in many parts of the Australian Capital Territory and is a cause for considerable concern. It appears to be part of a large scale phenomenon of dieback reported from many areas in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> In some areas the causes of decline have been identified but in other areas it is difficult to attribute it to any specific factor. Causes identified to date include the effects of insects which attack above and below-ground parts of trees, pathogenic fungi, particularly those which attack fine roots, grazing by native animals such as possums and domestic livestock such as cattle, sheep and horses and changes in the physical and chemical features of the environment following fire, drought, flooding and water-logging of soil, wind and cyclonic storm damage, land clearing, application of fertilisers, road construction and the use of herbicides.</PARA>
<PARA> In urban areas eucalypts are more often affected by root damage due to construction work such as trenching and changes of levels. Water stress is more apparent in areas such as bitumen car parks. At the present time many trees in Canberra are suffering from a severe attack of Psyllids causing the foliage to die off. Repeated attacks weaken trees and some may be killed.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) A number of Eucalyptus St. Johnii have been replaced along Anzac Parade. In most instances, the deaths can be attributed to severe spiral rooting initiated when the young trees were growing in large tins prior to planting out and aggravated by the poor quality soil in which they are now growing.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Most acacias are short lived due mainly to attack by wood borers. Life expectancy varies between 10-20 years. They develop rapidly to provide a desirable screening effect and are favoured for this purpose. In many situations it is not intended to replace them when they are removed as other slower growing species take effect.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 February 1981 (Hansard, page 81) Senator Davidson asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Education, a series of questions, without notice, concerning the Australian Education Council's decision to establish a steering committee with a view to the creation of an Australian Children's Television Foundation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Education Council at its February 1981 meeting did resolve to support the establishment of an Australian Children's Television Foundation. I can confirm that the Council has agreed to the setting up of a steering committee convened by the New South Wales Minister for Education and the Victorian Minister for the Arts with a view to creating the Foundation. The Commonwealth has a representative on the steering committee. All States, except Queensland, have nominated members.</PARA>
<PARA> The form the Foundation might take and the extent of its responsibilities will depend on agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, but it could be expected that the objectives of the Foundation would be consistent with the need expressed by the Senate Committee for an independent authority which would stimulate the production of programs available for children.</PARA>
<PARA> Until the report of the steering committee is available, I am not able to comment further on the ways in which a contribution by the Commonwealth might be made. This will be a matter for consideration by the Government when firm proposals have been formulated for the consideration of Commonwealth and State Ministers. I expressed the view at the February meeting of Council that no assumptions should be made concerning the Commonwealth's attitude to the appropriate level of funding for the Foundation and to the Commonwealth share.</PARA>
