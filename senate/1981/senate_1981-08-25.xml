<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I draw attention to the announcement of the death of the Honourable Reginald Thomas Pollard, a former member of the House of Representatives, and I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death on 24 August 1981 of Mr Reginald Thomas Pollard, a former member of the House of Representatives for the divisions of Ballarat (1937-49) and Lalor (1949-66), and former Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (1946-49), and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Leader of the Opposition)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion which has been moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick). Reg Pollard was a member of the Victorian Parliament for eight years and of the Federal Parliament for 29 years. He was a Minister for six years. He had a long life and a very distinguished one. He is probably best known for his period as Minister for Commerce and Agriculture from 1946 to 1949. He was the architect of the wheat stabilisation scheme. He was responsible for getting Australian agriculture back on its feet after the ravages of the war. He remained close to the farming community throughout his parliamentary life and again in his long retirement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a matter for some regret, perhaps shame, that Reg Pollard died without any honours or awards being bestowed on him. Whilst all sorts of other people have been handed out the Order of Australia and things of that kind, he received no such award. I guess he was the sort of person who would not have particularly wanted one, but it is a shame that no such honour was extended to him. </PARA>
<PARA> He epitomised the Australian parliamentarian in a period when pressures enabled members to be robust and unremitting in debate, yet generous, even gracious, to each other away from the heat of the chamber. He had a distinguished war record. He was wounded in France. He spent three years in the trenches and was commissioned at the front in France. It is ironic that, with that war record, he was defeated in 1966 when the Australian Labor Party suffered severe reverses electorally because of its opposition to the war in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA> On a personal note, may I say that I grew up in Ballarat, and for part of that period of my childhood Reg Pollard was the member for Ballarat and a Minister in the Chifley Government. I think it is fair to say that he was very highly regarded by the people of Ballarat. I often observe that after his election defeat in Ballarat in 1955 some 25 years passed before the Australian Labor Party regained the seat of Ballarat, which it did at the last election. That gave me great personal satisfaction, as one who remembered the last Labor member, Reg Pollard. </PARA>
<PARA> In more recent years Reg Pollard retired and became a farmer at Woodend, a small town in central Victoria. I used to see him there from time to time. He maintained a very keen interest in politics and always gave very sound and frank advice. For example, he never hesitated to say if he thought one had made a mistake, and occasionally he was even given to some form of praise. I have very happy memories of him as a very sensible and lovable man. I have pleasure in seconding the motion moved by Senator Carrick. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the Australian Democrats in this tribute to the memory of Reg Pollard. When I became a member of parliament he was a serving member. In those 21 years times have changed a little in this place. In my early days the more elderly of the politicians used to cast a benevolent protection over the younger ones who were new to the Parliament. Reg Pollard was one of those people who did that, irrespective of the party to which the younger members belonged. As a member of the Liberal Party at that time I can say that he was a person who was not only respected by the Liberal Party but also feared for the penetration of his contributions to debates. I never heard any member of the Liberal Party or the National Country Party say one ill word about his character or his integrity. In fact, as Senator Button said, he was a man universally respected, indeed loved, in this Parliament. I pay that tribute to him.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator GIETZELT</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to be associated with the condolence motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) and supported by the Leader of the Australian Labor Party (Senator Button), firstly, because of Reg Pollard's long service to the Parliament, but more particularly because of his long service to the Australian Labor Party. His whole career was characterised by service to his fellow man. His characteristics endeared him to everybody who knew him, met with him or worked with him. We recognise that as a member of parliament he earned the respect, love and admiration of all sections of the Parliament, a feat which is not achieved by very many. When he joined in debate in the House of Representatives people went into the chamber to listen to his contributions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose it would be true to say that if Reg Pollard were to be recalled for one thing it would be for his understanding about the plight of agriculture. He lived through the dark days of the 1930s and the difficult days of the 1940s. He was able to grasp an understanding of the problems in our rural community which perhaps was not matched by many who followed him in the Commerce and Agriculture portfolio. He played a significant part in the post-war rehabilitation of our rural sector. In retrospect, perhaps it is a matter of great regret that the party to which he belonged, and which he loved so much, did not give him a little extra support in the late 1950s, when, had he become leader of the Australian Labor Party, he might well have changed the political history of this country. On that occasion he failed very narrowly in a leadership ballot in the party room, being defeated by Arthur Calwell. He had, perhaps, that little extra public support, understanding and compassion which may well have enabled him to be elected Prime Minister as a result of becoming leader of the Labor Party in that period. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important thing that can be said about Reg Pollard is that he had confidence in the future and in humanity itself. He never lost his belief that mankind was capable of better things. He drew inspiration for that belief from his socialist conviction, in which he never wavered despite the many ups and downs of that philosophy over many years. He was able to express that belief in a way that gave confidence to his colleagues and to the younger members of our party. I am sure that those who knew him would agree with me that the Parliament has lost a strong defender of parliamentary democracy, the Labor Party has lost a stalwart and the Australian people have lost a person who made a great contribution to the development of our country in the very difficult times of the 1940s, the 1950s and the 1960s. It is a matter of great regret that in 1966 the Australian people did not understand what the war in Vietnam was about. He was one of the casualties of that, even though he served his country well in World War I. I offer my condolences to his family and place on record my appreciation of his contribution to our party and to the nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had the honour of serving in the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party with the Honourable Reg Pollard from 1962 to 1966. Not only was he one of the finest parliamentarians I ever knew but also he was one of the greatest Australians I ever knew. He was tough, he was fearless, he was frank, he was open, he was sincere and he was dedicated. When Parliament lost him in 1966 it was one of the great losses suffered by the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party and by the Parliament itself. I well recall his handling of a case on behalf of a constituent who was having difficulty obtaining finance from the War Service Homes Division because the Division claimed that the foundations of the house the constituent was building were sinking. In the adjournment debate in the House of Representatives one night Reg Pollard carried a concrete block on to the floor of the House and placed it next to the Dispatch Box to show that he could carry it and that it would not sink into the ground to the extent claimed. Reg Pollard was a very great Australian. Australians are thankful for what he did for Australia and I certainly mourn his passing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. Is the Minister concerned that only some 40,000 people out of an estimated 600,000 or more have applied for disadvantage cards under the new health scheme?

Will the Government consider using television and radio, which surely should be used in any modern advertising campaign?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has gone to some trouble to try to ensure that advice about the new health arrangements gets through to those who require it. A substantial number of the people entitled to health cards under the new arrangements-existing pensioner beneficiaries, the unemployed and so on-have to take no action at all because they automatically get the cards. There is a requirement that those people who qualify because of low incomes have to apply if they wish to have the health card. For that reason the Government has been advertising not merely in the print media, as indicated by Senator Grimes, but also on radio. Indeed, the Government has been exploiting various forms of the media to get across the message that people do need to apply, and they have been able to apply during the whole of August for the system which commences on 1 September.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been getting some rather mixed messages from the Opposition. Dr Blewett, the Opposition spokesman on health, has been complaining about the Government's propaganda exercise and about the fact that we are spending money for propaganda purposes. On the other hand, Senator Grimes is concerned that we are not taking enough action through the media to alert people to their entitlements. I have been concerned that an effective message should be getting out to the public. The matter is one I have reviewed, and I will increase the advertising if that seems to be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Grimes said, it is true that so far a relatively small proportion of those who are entitled have applied for cards. However, I point out to the Senate that one of the features of this scheme, as against similar schemes in the past, is that it is possible to get entitlement in retrospect. In other words, those people who seek treatment without having previously obtained a card can for 13 weeks after obtaining treatment apply for and obtain a card which will entitle them to reimbursement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Attorney-General aware that the film In the Realm of the Senses by the brilliant Japanese director Oshima was refused showing by the Film Censorship Board unless it was severely cut? Was this film to have been part of a retrospective season of Oshima's work to be shown by the National Film Theatre of Australia to its members? Did the National Film Theatre quite properly refuse to show the film at all as it would have been shown in Oshima's presence and it would have been a great insult to have shown one of his masterpieces in a mutilated form, as re-edited by the Film Censorship Board? Has In the Realm of the Senses been shown uncut at both the Melbourne and Sydney film festivals in the past without noticeable harm to those who saw it? Bearing in mind that the National Film Theatre is a government supported membership organisation of people interested in the art of the film, all aged over 18 years, is not the banning most perverse? Is the explanation to be found in the recent statement by Mrs Strickland, the Chief Censor, that she does not believe that film festivals should be able to show films that other sectors of the adult population cannot see, on the ground that it would be elitist to do so? To avoid a repetition of such a peculiar decision by the Film Censorship Board, will the Attorney-General consider amending the regulations to provide for the special and reasonable requirements of film festivals and the National Film Theatre?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The original version of the film In the Realm of the Senses was shown at the Sydney and Melbourne film festivals in 1977 under an informal agreement whereby films were registered for limited screenings without censorship examination. An important feature of that agreement was that under no circumstances would permission be given for the screening of a film that had previously been refused registration. Later in 1977 this film was imported for commercial exhibition but was refused registration by the Film Censorship Board. An appeal was lodged, but the decision was upheld by the Films Board of Review. A reconstructed version of the film was subsequently lodged in 1977, was registered by the Film Censorship Board and was classified R. An uncut print of the film was submitted for registration by the National Film Theatre in July 1981-its is that decision which Senator Hamer is now complaining about-and was refused registration by the Film Censorship Board on the grounds of indecency and obscenity. The National Film Theatre has appealed against this decision and the appeal has been listed for hearing by the Films Board of Review on 8 September 1981. In light of that appeal I do not propose to make any further comment on the reasons for the Board's refusal or, indeed, to make any comment on the decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Hamer raises with me some questions about arrangements regarding film festivals which have been made in the past. I am informed that an informal agreement between the Film Censorship Board, the States and the film festivals in 1975 was entered into whereby practically none of the films screened at festivals are screened by the Film Censorship Board. However, the Chief Censor has always reserved the right to call in a film which might have difficulty in obtaining commercial registration and very occasionally has done so. At the moment I am having discussions with the Chief Censor and officers of my Department responsible for censorship concerning the present regulations under which the Board operates. They also will embrace questions concerning film festivals and the arrangements for them. In conclusion I say that I believe the Film Censorship Board has a very difficult job to do. It has to interpret community standards, which I think is extremely difficult. I do not accept some of the criticisms Senator Hamer seems to have made of it in his question. As to the future of this film, it is in the hands of the Films Board of Review. As to the relationship between the Board and these film festivals or bodies such as the National Film Theatre to which Senator Hamer refers, as I have said, these are matters to which I will be giving further consideration.</PARA>

The Minister will know that O'Connor's strike is now in its seventeenth day. Does the Government consider that any good purpose would be served by its appealing to both sides involved in the conflict over IRA prisoners' conditions and to enter into negotiations in which both parties are prepared to make some genuine concessions? Will the Minister also consider making a personal appeal to O'Connor to cease his hunger strike at least until a reply is received from the British Government?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this matter was first raised by Senator Martin in the Senate last Wednesday. I was unable to give any particular details as to the situation at Brisbane Airport. However, I pointed out that the Minister and the Department of Transport were extremely concerned about the effect of the shortage of air traffic controllers generally throughout Australia. The Minister has informed me now that a number of options are currently under consideration, one of which is varying rostering principles, shift work and overtime provisions. Discussions are taking place with the Public Service Board regarding concessions for a limited duration in order to ease the immediate problems in Brisbane. Every possible action is being taken to minimise the duration of the limited closure of the airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although Australia has stepped up its recruitment campaign for air traffic controllers both here and overseas, it will not be possible to overcome the shortfall for some months. There is a shortfall at present of some 110 air traffic controllers. However, with amendments to rostering constraints and overtime and penalty rate conditions it may be possible to minimise the period of the limited closure. In any event, it is not intended to impose any restrictions over the Christmas holiday period. If more flexibility can be applied to overtime and rostering provisions it may be possible to lift the airport use restrictions by December.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen the reports to which the honourable senator refers. Of course, I am aware of the problems of youth unemployment and of the need to take action in that field. Part of the question which the honourable senator asked relates, of course, to matters within the province of the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs. Responding in general terms to the honourable senator's question, I think he would be aware-certainly honourable senators who have been here longer than he has would be aware-that earlier this year the Government undertook a very careful examination of the range of programs which affect 16 and 17-year-olds in the community. Of course, when the Government announced it was going to do that it was fairly typical that there was an immediate campaign-it came mainly from the other side of the chamber-to the effect that we were going to abolish unemployment benefits for 16 and 17-year-olds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No doubt the honourable senator will remember that particular controversy. In fact, the Government undertook a very careful review of the range of programs which affect that age group. In addition, of course, it has pursued policies which have seen a very substantial reduction in youth unemployment over the last 12 months. I hope that the honourable senator and all other honourable senators opposite are pleased at the quite substantial reduction of youth unemployment over that 12-month period. The review has resulted in adjustments to a number of programs which affect that age group. Firstly, there have been adjustments to the programs which affect those people who stay at school. There has been an extension of the income test limits which apply to the Secondary Allowances Scheme and to the amounts payable under that scheme. In the area of education there has been an attempt to produce programs which will assist that age group both to stay at school and to benefit from staying at school.</PARA>
<PARA> In the field of employment there has been a lot of publicity in the last week about the measures announced in the Budget. The Government has increased by an overall 22 per cent its expenditure in the field of training programs. Whilst attention has tended to be focused on the question of the Community Youth Support Scheme-indeed, there is a matter of public importance for debate today on that subject-less attention has been directed to the fact that in the field of job training and so on there has been a very considerable increase in the amount of funds made available. What the Government has done is to examine the range of programs, whether they are educational or related to job training or to the payment of unemployment benefit. It has tried to produce a balanced range of measures which will meet the needs of people in that age group.</PARA>
<PARA> It has not adjusted the unemployment benefit for 16 and 17-year-olds. In part that is because the relationship between the unemployment benefit and the benefits available to those people who remain in education are seen to be out of balance. Hence, we thought it more important to improve the provisions relating to youth remaining at school. But in the totality of provisions for young Australians I think the recent Budget indicates a high level of Government concern and an attempt to arrive at a balance between programs which will be effective in helping that age group.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine asked a question regarding person to person calls. I am advised that a question on this subject has already been answered and is recorded in Hansard of 3 June this year. Telecom Australia has advised that, in the interests of improved efficiency and service to customers, the operating procedures in relation to the particular person service were varied as from February last by introducing a 'try again' service in place of the former 'left word' procedure. The 'left word' procedure relied on the person answering the called number advising the wanted person that the caller wished to make contact. Telecom was not able to ensure that the wanted person received this advice. With the 'try again' procedure Telecom retains responsibility for the connection of particular person unavailable calls. When the wanted person is unavailable the operator will advise the caller, giving all available information. As I understand it, the caller may then inform the operator to keep trying until the wanted person is available. In such a case the operator, if possible, will ascertain when the person will be available, or will attempt to call again in 30 minutes, or will speak to an alternative party at the same number. If it is known that the wanted person can be reached at another number anywhere in Australia the caller may ask the operator to attempt connection to that number, advise the operator to hold the call until he wishes it to be tried again, or cancel the call. The service outlined is available to all telephone customers and does not in any way discriminate against customers who do not have subscriber trunk dialling access.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was present when the deputation met the Prime Minister. The Government and I, as the responsible Minister, are very keen that States which have access to abundant supplies of natural gas should extend supplies to various areas. Indeed, in New South Wales the Pipeline Authority, under my direction, has just completed a link between Young, Cootamundra and Wagga Wagga and I will be opening that service very soon. Also, as is well known, the natural gas pipeline will soon be extended to Canberra. So it is quite possible for what the honourable senator suggests to be done. That will be done within a tariff that the ordinary consumer will be well able to bear. It is desirable that a number of pipelines be constructed in Victoria, and I imagine that the impetus for that will be given by a recent increase in electricity tariffs. I have no immediate knowledge of a direct approach by the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria for a loan. Indeed, it would not be appropriate for an authority which is part of a government to make such an approach to the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been discussions between the Commonwealth and Victoria regarding lending. My understanding is that a general extra borrowing process was made available at the last Australian Loan Council meeting. As I understand it, that might well encompass an ability to extend gas pipelines. I say that in the belief that it is now within the competence of the Victorian Government to proceed in that matter. I have no doubt that communications will pass between the Prime Minister and the State regarding the Loan Council deliberations. If, indeed, there were no other source of finance for these pipelines, some three lots of pipelines could be put into position in Victoria, paid for and maintained, with only a very fractional addition to the general tariff for gas in Victoria. The tariff for gas in Victoria is considerably less than in other States, so it is well within the competence of a State such as Victoria to extend its pipelines within its own capacity and within its own finances.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is monitoring events in relation to the movement of roughly 2.2 million Afghan refugees into Pakistan and a reported half million or more into Iran. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has not sought to establish a resettlement program for Afghan refugees. To do so might in fact pre-empt diplomatic efforts aimed at achieving a just resolution of the situation in Afghanistan. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees normally works towards ultimate repatriation of refugees when conditions permit. If the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees were to fail to achieve voluntary repatriation under satisfactory conditions, he would explore next permanent resettlement in the area. Resettlement of refugees in third countries is usually considered only as a last resort.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Australian Government's policy is to endorse this approach, and in fact the Government is contributing financially to the work in Pakistan.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, I do not believe there is any figure or formula by which we can establish the costs in relation to air strikes as directly as Senator Archer would like. Nevertheless, we are able to point out that the average daily revenue of the two major airlines is in the order of $2.5m. Consequently, if the airlines are on strike for any length of time that represents lost revenue of that order that must be recovered in some other way. Obviously the objective of all business undertakings is to make a profit. To achieve that objective they must seek to cover all costs, including losses from industrial action. In this way the airlines are no different from any other business. Permitting the airlines to recover losses from industrial action does not relieve them of the responsibility to resolve industrial disputes as quickly as possible. The fact of the matter is that the airlines have to take into account the costs of a quick settlement, which flow into the cost structure for all time and may be significantly higher in the long run than the cost of resisting unjustified wage demands in the shorter term.</PARA></TALK.START>

In answering my question, the Minister stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of establishing a code of conduct for Australian firms operating in South Africa is being considered further. Officials are currently examining the practice of other countries with more extensive commercial involvement in South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA>In view of the concern being expressed by the Australian community, including the Australian Council for Overseas Aid, about our relations with South Africa and the Government's firm and consistently stated opposition to apartheid, I ask the Minister: Firstly, has consideration now been given by the Government to the various anti-apartheid and employment codes or practices of other countries with extensive commercial involvement in South Africa? Secondly, when will a similar code of conduct be adopted or developed to ensure that Australian companies with active operations in South Africa do not contribute to the strength of the apartheid policy? Thirdly, what additional action will be taken by the Australian Government to increase its diplomatic and economic pressure on the Government of South Africa to terminate apartheid in all its forms?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Missen has raised basically three matters. My understanding is that the matter of a code of conduct for Australian firms operating in South Africa remains under serious consideration. This consideration extends to examination of codes of conduct which have been introduced by other countries but which are not mandatory-for example, those of the United States of America, Canada and the European Economic Community. As to the second matter, I regret that I cannot give Senator Missen a timetable for the introduction of an Australian code of conduct. The honourable senator would be aware that the subject is a complex one. As to the third part of his question, there should be no doubt about the Australian Government's strong and unequivocal opposition to apartheid. The Government has shown by its actions-such as the denial of visas to the Springbok rugby team, its adherence to the Gleneagles agreement on sporting contacts, its decision against Qantas Airways Ltd resuming flights to Johannesburg and other matters-that it maintains its position of strong opposition to apartheid. This policy is continually under review by the Government in the light of developments in South Africa. I will bring the question to the attention of the relevant Minister and see whether there is any further information that can be given.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, the application of the new provisions of the Copyright Act in relation to photocopying, particularly in parliamentary libraries but also in libraries that are serving people in remote areas, has given a good deal of concern to a number of people, including, I must admit, the officers of my Department who have been looking at it. When the legislation was before the Parliament the question was raised in the Senate debate, if I remember rightly. The views of the Federal Parliamentary Librarian were ascertained by some senators and were canvassed here. It appeared that there might be an administrative solution to the problem which would facilitate making this material available in the way in which I think Senator Colston has correctly indicated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been having a look at the problem since then. I am aware that contrary views have been expressed by State librarians. I have had representations from State members. Indeed, it was raised at the recent meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. In view of the amount of concern that has been expressed, as I said, I am having the matter looked at again. It may well be that some amendment may be proposed to clarify the position. I do recognise that there is a problem. It certainly has not been decided whether it can be solved administratively. If I have said anything that may have indicated that the view I have expressed is not the correct view of the law, I assure the Senate that it is not due to my condoning it. Perhaps I have stated a mistaken view of the provisions, although I do not believe that it is necessarily mistaken. As I said, it is one of these areas where there are doubts, and I am hoping to have them clarified.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. In the light of the discussion on the entry of foreign banks into Australia, is the Treasurer aware that there are now 25 merchant banks operating in Australia, that 64 per cent of these are foreign-owned or majority controlled and that a further 32 per cent have a significant foreign element in their shareholding? How has this happened when the Foreign Investment Review Board guidelines state that there must be at least 50 per cent Australian equity in such undertakings? What does the Treasurer plan to do to ensure that equity is taken up by Australians in this area?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="254" SPEAKER="Guilfoyle Sen The Hon Dame M.G.C." NAMEID="6D7" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; When looking at foreign banks, we need to understand that until 1973 the Australian Government did not impose any restrictions at all, on foreign policy grounds, on the entry of foreign interests into the merchant banking industry. Up until that time a number of foreign interests took up the majority, or in some cases 100 per cent, ownership of new or existing Australian merchant banks. The guidelines of the Government's policy on foreign investment in the non-banking financial sector require that proposals for the establishment of a new merchant bank must show substantial net economic benefits to Australia to obtain approval. Where the net economic benefits are small, it must involve an effective partnership between Australian interests and the various investors in the ownership and control of the company concerned. In some cases approval may be more readily granted where a financial intermediary's operations are strictly ancillary to other business operations, for example, an in-house financier, and do not have significant implications for the financial sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised that all proposals to acquire or increase substantially interests in an existing merchant bank are closely examined regardless of the size of the company concerned. Again, substantial benefits must be demonstrated, taking account of the implications of the proposal for the financial sector and for the level of Australian ownership. In such cases the parties would have been required to demonstrate that Australian investors had been given prior opportunity to acquire the interest on reasonable terms. Under these guidelines, foreign investment has been restricted accordingly. It has not been the Government's policy to require foreign interests to advise of their shareholdings so that Australian ownership in all merchant banks is 50 per cent. I think Senator Watson also asked me whether the Treasurer would take any action with regard to this. I will refer the matter to the Treasurer to seek further advice on that point.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Has she seen an article by Douglas Wilkie in today's issue of the Melbourne Sun? The article suggests that the recent downing of two Libyan aircraft over the Mediterranean was part of the scene 'for a Western strategic counter-thrust in North Africa to redress setbacks in Iran and Afghanistan'.

Will the Australian Government take any such scenario into account before Australian troops are posted to the Sinai as part of a peacekeeping force?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I do not know that I am able to deal precisely with the questions raised by Senator Primmer. The information I have from the Minister for Foreign Affairs with regard to Libya and the aircraft is that he is aware of reports that Colonel Gaddafi has said that the two Libyan fighters shot down by the United States Navy fighters on 19 August fired first. He is reported to have said that the Libyan aircraft were under orders to protect Libyan air space from intruders and had therefore attacked after their warning to the United States aircraft to depart had been ignored.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has now been confirmed that the incident occurred in the geographical area of the Gulf of Sidra, further out than the 12-mile limit which we understand is claimed by Libya as territorial sea along the rest of its coast. Libya has claimed the Gulf as an historic bay since October 1973. That claim has not been generally recognised by the international community, including Australia, and a number of countries, including the United States, have specifically rejected it. It is therefore apparent that the incident occurred over international waters, where international law recognises the right of military and commercial overflight.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government rejects the characterisation of the United States exercise in the Gulf of Sidra as a form of provocation. United States forces have carried out such exercises a number of times in the past and in all cases have given proper and timely notice of them. Any nation has the right to conduct properly military exercises in international waters, and in no circumstances can the exercise of that right give legal justification for an armed attack. The Government is pleased that the incident has been an isolated one and that both parties have taken action under the United Nations Charter to report the matter to the Security Council. I will refer the other part of Senator Primmer's question to the Minister and seek information for him.</PARA>

Can the Minister advise what stage Qantas has reached in those evaluations? Can the Minister also comment on the fact that Qantas moved from smaller capacity aircraft to the Boeing 747? What management reasoning has occurred to justify the airline's re-thinking on the capacity?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the new health measures were announced a lot of scaremongering went on and this is just another example. The fact is that the health funds do not set their own contribution rates. They submit proposals for new rates to the Department of Health and to a registration committee. The Australian Government Actuary is a member of the committee. The proposed rates are not approved if, in the expert opinion of the committee, they would endanger the viability of a fund. It is simplistic to consider the financial health of an insurance fund in terms only of its contribution rates. The financial positions of the funds vary according to past operations, the structure of their membership and so on. Many funds have financial reserves well in excess of the guidelines used by the registration committee. They can and do use these free reserves to cushion the impact of health cost increases on contribution rates. This is surely good business practice. The Department of Health regulates the operations of the health funds and closely monitors their viability. The Press reports claiming that the new contribution rates are dangerously low really reflect the sour grapes attitude of people opposite whose predictions about massive increases simply did not eventuate.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is he aware of claims by the Singapore Government that shipping companies are not keen on accepting those drums as cargo back to Western Australia? Is the Minister also aware of an article appearing in the West Australian of 17 July which quotes an Australian High Commission spokesman as saying that 'the Australian Government has set aside a disposal site in Western Australia', whilst a spokesman for the Western Mining Corporation claims that the waste will be stored at Kambalda when it is returned? Will the Minister advise whether the Australian Government has surveyed or selected a site or whether this has been left to the company concerned, and what control the Government will exercise over the safe containment of the drums prior to and during transportation, on arrival and in the continuing oversighting of the safety of the site and the containers in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Coleman will be aware, of course, that this mishap happened when a measuring instrument which contained some caesium radioactive materials was inadvertently sent to Singapore with some scrap metal and went into a furnace. There are many of these measuring instruments around. Indeed, discussions are taking place between the Commonwealth and the States at this moment to see how we can get an orderly, relatively uniform and highly efficient method of ensuring continuing auditing of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been asked for a great deal of information on this matter. I am asked by Senator Coleman whether the material had to be repacked. My understanding is that some of the drums were not considered to be thoroughly efficient and so in fact they were crumpled up and put into new drums. Expert scientists gave the advice that the packing would be perfectly safe, that the methods to be used would be safe and that there would be no damage to the health of anybody in the trans-shipment of the material. We are not relying on any political judgment in this matter. We are relying on the advice of the experts. If Senator Coleman would like more specific advice I would be happy to give it.</PARA>
<PARA> The Western Australian Government has the responsibility for the final disposal of the material. The material itself, as I am technically advised, is quite capable of reasonable and safe disposal and it is not anticipated that there will be any trouble in that regard. I am not aware of difficulties with the shipping companies. As a regular practice, radioactive material, including measuring instruments, is transferred around the world. The honourable senator must realise that in the ordinary daily life of the community a very considerable amount of industrial and medical radionuclides are moved around. Whilst every precaution is taken, from time to time there is some incident. We are taking all the precautions that the scientific advisers tell us are necessary to ensure the safe movement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I rise more in sorrow than in anger to question the decision that the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) has made in asking that further questions be placed on notice. Honourable senators will be aware of the song Never on Sunday. The difference in this instance is that some honourable senators do not get the opportunity to ask a question on two consecutive sitting days. I deliberately watched Question Time today and last Thursday. Senator Carrick's defence has always been that supplementary questions erode the time available for questions. That is true. However, a minimum number of supplementary questions was asked today. There is something wrong with parliamentary democracy if senators, in a House of 64, cannot ask questions more frequently than members of another place, which has double the membership of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter goes a little further. I commend to Senator Carrick the words of Zapata, the Mexican revolutionary hero, who said: 'It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees'. I make that point because it is all very well for Senator Carrick to say that honourable senators will be able to ask a question on the third sitting day but by that time history has already passed by some of the matters honourable senators want to ventilate. I have a final warning on this matter: We have a very evenly balanced Senate. If the Government wants to keep the rank and file quiet and contented the Leader of the Government in the Senate and Mr President will have to devise a much more effective formula because it is utter rubbish for them to blame supplementary questions. Senator Carrick can do better and he knows it. His Government strategy will have to take second place to the wishes of other honourable senators from now on. </PARA>

Mr President, I have consistently raised this matter of Question Time. The reply has been that a precedent has be established and I think the answer you gave was that this precedent was established by a Labor Government. I say that that precedent ought not to bind you to a continuing practice. Mr President, I think you have the discretion to disregard that precedent and in fact to create a new one.

Mr President, if you feel that honourable senators have not been properly considered in getting the call I think you still have the right and the power, even when the Leader of the Government has called for all further questions to be placed on notice, to ignore that call until you are satisfied that each honourable senator has received reasonable consideration. I have raised this matter time and time again over the past three or four years in an endeavour to get from the President an approach different from that which we have received in the past.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, may I first say that by exercising the privilege of asking a question now I am avoiding keeping my colleagues up late by raising the matter in the adjournment debate. I preface my question by noting that early in March I raised with the Minister for National Development and Energy the question of whether the Alligator Rivers system could cope with the expanded uranium mining operations. The Minister then assured me that the activities of the Supervising Scientist and the requirements of the impact statement code would be sufficient. I now ask: In view of the recent mishap at Nabarlek concerning the overflowing of toxic wastes from the holding pond, does he still stand by that statement? Does he not feel that, with all deference to the Northern Territory Government, the Supervising Scientist may need additional powers? Finally, will the Minister tell the directors of Nabarlek to emulate George Washington's approach in the matter of the cherry tree and not lie about their mistakes?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government, and certainly I, share Senator Mulvihill's desire that these tailing pits should be perfectly safe and present no danger by way of overspills; also, that the Supervising Scientist and his staff should be adequate to deal with them. I am advised that on 14 July last Queensland Mines Ltd notified the Supervising Scientist that on 7 March an overflow of rain water had occurred from the plant run off pond. I stress those two dates. The environmental protection measures which apply to Narbarlek are the responsibility of the Northern Territory authorities, who have consulted the Supervising Scientist on these matters. As I have indicated, I am concerned about the delay in notification. I will certainly pursue that matter. The subject was discussed at some length on 11 August at a meeting of the co-ordinating committee for the Alligator Rivers Region and reports on the incident itself and deficiencies, if any, in regulatory monitoring and reporting procedures have been called for. I do not say that there were any, but there may have been. The Supervising Scientist has undertaken to provide further advice on the matter as soon as possible and I will certainly pursue it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The Opposition needs no justification for bringing up the abolition of the Community Youth Support Scheme this week as a matter of public importance. The Press, indeed the media in general, have commented on this move in the Budget for a week now, but it is impossible to find any commentator, any expert in the area, or anyone who is active in regard to youth unemployment, who supports the Government's decision. It was sprung on us in the Budget. The scheme has been abolished without replacement by a substitute community scheme and, for that reason, the Budget proposal has been much criticised. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only has the abolition of the scheme caused concern, but also the manner in which the Government and the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) have deceived the community and those involved in the scheme concerning what was going on has been reprehensible and such as should be avoided at all costs when human lives and jobs are concerned. The deception is reminiscent of the abolition of the Australian Assistance Plan by this Government in its early days in office. That was done without notice by a curt announcement at a meeting of State Ministers and with neither satisfactory public explanation nor parliamentary debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the Minister and the Government have behaved in a reprehensible and deceptive manner, one which is typical of the standards which they have displayed generally. Even more, they have shown a complete lack of concern for the people who have used CYSS-the project officers and tutors who have been employed by the scheme and those altruistic members of the community who have supported it and worked very hard on its committees. </PARA>
<PARA> On August 20, two days after the presentation of the Budget, the Minister wrote to every honourable member and senator in this place announcing the release of a colourful chart which described the employment, training and youth programs that were available from the Government, and his Department in particular. Prominent on that expensively prepared chart is a reference to the Community Youth Support Scheme. Thus, in a letter dated two days after the Budget was brought down, the Minister produced, I imagine for honourable senators to put up in their offices, a deceptive chart, one which was out of date when it was produced. The Minister and his Department must have had knowledge of the demise of the scheme when the chart was produced, yet proceeded with its production. That was the final act in a series of events which led up to this budgetary decision, a decision which has disturbed and disappointed so many people of good will in the community. Some project officers under the scheme were employed only a couple of weeks before the Budget announcement came that as from 1 October they would lose their jobs. At least one individual-I understand there were more-had left other employment to take up work with the Community Youth Support Scheme. Why should someone not have taken up such a job with confidence?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister concerned, the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, allegedly an honourable man, had never given any suggestion to the CYSS groups or to the community that the scheme would not continue. In fact he had assured the community and members of the Community Youth Support Scheme that the scheme would continue in the future. There was no suggestion in the report of the razor gang-the report put down by Sir Phillip Lynch and his colleagues-that there would be complete abolition of the scheme. The Minister, Mr Brown, in his statements was quite supportive of the program. Referring to the Minister, the Adelaide Advertiser of 2 June 1981 reported:</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth funded youth support schemes need not fear coming changes to funding and operations . . . He said the changes would be aimed at making the service 'run smoothly and consistently'. Changes would include paying CYSS grants in lump sum in advance rather than reimbursing projects at a later date. He said this means grants could be given to a project in advance, according to an estimate on the project, and that money could be given to a project in advance, according to an estimate on the project, and that money could be used by project administrators in any way . . . Mr Brown also said he would like to see more work-oriented schemes under CYSS. </PARA>
<PARA>Who would not? The Launceston Examiner of 22 August 1981 quoted a letter written by Mr David Thompson, the State Executive Officer of the CYSS projects in Tasmania. The letter was dated 14 July and was sent to all CYSS projects in Tasmania. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Brown-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Minister--</PARA>
<PARA>has decided that any changes to the CYSS guidelines and grant payments procedures will not be implemented until May, 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> From now until the beginning of May, you-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the project officers--</PARA>
<PARA>should continue to operate according to the current CYSS guidelines and administrative arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>There was no suggestion in that letter or in the report in the Adelaide Advertiser that CYSS was to be abolished. There was no suggestion that employment within the Scheme was not secure or that anything was to change. In fact, the letter and the Minister's statement were quite supportive of the Scheme. Only two weeks before the Budget announcement Mr Brown spoke to Mr Braid, M.L.C., a member of the Upper House in Tasmania, certainly not a supporter of the Australian Labor Party but a supporter of CYSS and a man who worked on CYSS projects. He reassured Mr Braid that CYSS projects would continue, that the guidelines would be reviewed, and that the functions of all the projects would continue to receive Government support. That was two weeks before the Budget announcement. However, Mr Brown said in his Budget statement:</PARA>
<PARA> While CYSS has been a valuable program, circumstances have changed since CYSS was first introduced in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA>That apparently justifies the demise of CYSS. But what has changed? Have we no longer any unemployed youth? In fact there are greater numbers of unemployed youth now than there were in 1976, when the project was introduced. Are many of them still not in need of the sort of support they are getting from the CYSS project? Has the problem of homeless youth diminished? Certainly those of us on the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare investigating this problem do not believe that it has diminished; all the evidence is that it has increased. Those people still need support. The only thing that has changed in the two months since Mr Brown uttered his supportive words in Adelaide, and in the few weeks since he uttered his supportive words in Tasmania, is that the conservative elements in Cabinet, the Government and the Treasury who are so suspicious of community programs, have got the upper hand and destroyed this project. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Brown went on to say in his statement attached to the Budget:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers the most practical way it can help the young reap the benefits of a growing economy is to provide increased education, training and work experience opportunities, so that they improve their skills and better compete in the growing labour market. No young person, in need, will be denied assistance to make a successful transition to the world of work. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the jobs are not there; the young people will simply be denied work. I ask the Senate: Is the Minister suggesting that, by the time CYSS is killed in October this year, the Government will have the employment, training and transitional education programs to cope with the 54,000-odd young people who use CYSS facilities or the tens of thousands more young people who would have used those facilities if the guidelines for the scheme had been broadened to include activities involved in job placement, special counselling, and programs to do with productive activity? We are told, correctly, that the Government is to increase funding for the Special Youth Employment Training Program, but the Government's own figures demonstrate that there can be only 8,000 to 10,000 more positions under that program. The Government at various times has praised the voluntary youth program. We know from what Mr Viner has said in recent times that only 300 people have taken advantage of that. The Government cannot be serious in saying that the work done by CYSS, and the youth looked after by CYSS, will be looked after by those other programs by October this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Many evaluations of the Community Youth Support Scheme have been undertaken by the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs, by the Government, and by independent authorities. None of the results of those Government evaluations has been publicly released. This Parliament has not had the opportunity to debate such reports or to consider what sort of advice the Government has been getting. In April 1980 Mr Viner announced a national review to investigate the Community Youth Support Scheme, to provide for means whereby the Scheme could be consolidated and rationalised. Where is that report? Why cannot this Parliament judge the efforts of the committee that made that investigation? Why cannot we make a judgment on the Government's decision? We do not know what reports to the Government have recommended but we believe with confidence that they certainly did not recommend the sorts of changes this Government has initiated in the Budget. We believe those reports recommended the sorts of changes that the project officers and others have long advocated for CYSS-changes to the guidelines to make the scheme more effective. </PARA>
<PARA> Reports from independent groups from Melbourne University and the Swinburne College of Technology in Melbourne both commented on the lower incidence of crime, drug-taking and other anti-social activities among those attending the various CYSS projects in Melbourne. Some 52,000 people are attending 270 CYSS groups in this country. There are 850 CYSS officers, including those who participate in job sharing and who work part-time. Over 1,000 part-time tutors and assistants and many more people have given valuable voluntary time to CYSS. There are other spin-offs. People associated with CYSS, both voluntary helpers and paid project officers, are often associated with other projects to assist unemployed youth. They have worked in establishing work co-operatives. In particular, they have established and worked in the youth refuges, the hostels and the crisis centres which have been needed to cope with the unemployed homeless youth in our community. They became aware, by their association with CYSS and with the unemployed youth who attended CYSS groups, of the other needs of those young people, of the desperate shortcomings in the lives of the young people. What is to happen to those people, many of whom have given up other jobs and careers to work in the CYSS project?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government indirectly recognised the need for and the value of the Community Youth Support Scheme by increasing the funding for it each year even though that funding, we believe, has been inadequate. In 1979 Mr Viner, recognising the situation, wrote to the then Minister for Finance asking for extra funds-another $3m in fact-for the Community Youth Support Scheme. He said in that letter:</PARA>
<PARA> As you are aware there is strong local support for CYSS projects in many areas and it is considered that large-scale reductions in number of projects or level of funding for particular projects would inevitably lead to adverse criticism from local communities as well as from Members, Senators and other sources. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course Mr Viner was right. The support was well justified. </PARA>
<PARA> The labour force figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed that, in May 1981, 116,000 people aged from 15 to 19 were unemployed and 78,700 people aged from 20 to 24 were seeking work in the community. The average duration of unemployment for the 15-year-olds to 19-year-olds was 23 weeks and for the 20-year-olds to 24-year-olds it was 35.2 weeks. In my own town in the last few weeks over 500 young people have applied for 40 jobs in a newly established business there. The situation is a tragedy. Not only can we not provide jobs for our young but also we are about to pull from under them one of the few supporting programs that we have had and the only community based program that was successful. No one, certainly not myself and certainly not the project officers, believed that the CYSS was perfect. No one disagrees with the suggestion that the guidelines were inadequate and unnecessarily restrictive and that a greater degree of emphasis could have been placed on counselling and training. Some projects, we know, were better than others. But none of these things is a reason to abolish the Scheme completely, essentially without notice, and leave a vacuum. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who worked in and with the CYSS, as with the Australian Assistance Plan, have demonstrated that there was the desire, the ability and the good will in the community to support and help our unemployed youth face a difficult future. As much as anything else, the sudden deceitful abolition of the CYSS, together with the failure to increase the unemployment benefit for those under the age of 18 and the failure to index the unemployment benefit for those over 18 years of age, the harsh restrictions on the work test, the constant denigration of the young unemployed as dole bludgers et cetera and the criticism of their attitude, demonstrates, and can only demonstrate, to the youth of this country that their elected government puts them at the bottom of the list in its priorities. We as a society, I believe, will reap the bitter rewards of this policy. I am afraid that the demonstration which took place at the Liberal Party headquarters last week will not be the last. </PARA>
<PARA> The community and individuals in our community are willing to help but they need assistance. The employment of project officers, the provision of the meagre facilities and what, in budgetary terms, is a very small amount of money should have been improved upon and should have been developed, not abolished. We have again missed an opportunity to do something to assist our youth to have greater self-esteem, greater confidence and a feeling that society is concerned for them. We can no longer tell our children that the rewards of work and study at school is a job and a place in society. We do not provide the jobs. We provide completely inadequate support. We now deny the community itself the opportunity to assist. The resulting frustration, anger and distress will be manifest, I believe, only too visibly in the future and all the wringing of hands by those who are responsible for this policy will be to no avail. </PARA>
<PARA> We in the Opposition therefore urge the Government to reconsider its decision. We are not uncritical supporters of the CYSS. We believe it could have been improved. We believe these people could have been assisted in many ways so as to achieve a more meaningful program, such as getting greater numbers of unemployed involved, but nothing that the Government has suggested will take the place of the CYSS as it exists in so many places in this community. Nothing the Government has on offer will help the community assist its own young people or help the community to set the priorities in dealing with the very real problem of unemployed youth. It is for this reason that we believe this Parliament, not only members in this House but also in the other place, should on this day discuss this matter and urge the Government to reconsider the decision that it has taken. </PARA>
<PARA> The second change to which I refer is the development of new programs. In 1981-82 the Government's emphasis on assistance to the young unemployed will continue, in particular through the Special Youth Employment Training Program, under which it is expected that there will be nearly 90,000 placements of young people in 1981-82. There will be increased subsidies under the Program to assist those young people who have been unemployed for eight months or more in the last 12 months. There will be an increase in the range of educational opportunities for young people experiencing difficulty in the transition from school to work under the Commonwealth School to Work Transition Program. There is available also a transition allowance. This allowance is $42 a week for under-18-year-olds and $64.10 a week for over-18-year-olds. The availability of the transition allowance is being extended this year to ensure that young unemployed people do not lack an incentive to undertake technical and further education courses. This year there is to be a strengthening of the counselling services which are available through the Commonwealth Employment Service to young unemployed people. I have already mentioned the CRAFT program-that is, the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training program-which this year will receive $72m for the training of about 95,000 apprentices. </PARA>
<PARA> To summarise these points, I should note that the expenditure on all employment and youth affairs programs has increased by 23 per cent in this Budget to $203m. Of that, $156m-that is, 77 per cent of all those programs-is directed at young people. The two programs that most relate to the Community Youth Support Scheme-that is, the School to Work Transition Program and SYETP-will this year receive $79.4m, which is a 67 per cent increase in funding. When the economy is growing and when greatly increased job opportunities are becoming available to young people as much as they are to the community at large, it is the Government's view that employment opportunities for the young will best be encouraged by the most practical schemes of giving increased education, training and work experience opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst a number of CYSS programs did assist in this way, in general it is true that the Community Youth Support Scheme provided a group which could draw unemployed young people away from loneliness and from a complete shattering of their self-confidence. These people were able to reach out to a wider group, to meet with representatives of the local community and to be encouraged to think about the kinds of skills required before actually gaining a job. </PARA>
<PARA> These activities are still important. Under CYSS they were only the tip of the iceberg of community support. That iceberg and the community are still there. Youth and church groups, local and State government initiatives and various programs of neighbourly advice for young people will still be available not only in the city but also in the country areas and in local communities. There will not be that institutionalised tip of the iceberg which has been evident for five years during the operation of CYSS. In placing a consolidated priority upon those practical schemes that give direct educational, work experience or training opportunities to young people, the Government is not denying that great mass of the iceberg of community support which has always been in place for young people and which continues even now. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been asked whether the Government would consider alternative sources of funding for individual CYSS projects that have been seen to be worth while. It has been suggested that if, say, one-third of the CYSS projects had been seen to be especially productive they should gain some further Commonwealth assistance. The Government's answer to this suggestion is no. The Government believes that the CYSS program has fulfilled its purpose in the five years of its existence and that the most practical way now of ensuring that young people are in a position to take advantage of the growing labour market is to provide increased financial assistance to those programs that give directly education, training and work experience opportunities. In summary, the people of Australia expect any government to assess and evaluate programs from time to time and to see whether the circumstances in which a program was born, and in which it needs to carry on, continue to exist. The Fraser Government is not a government that will be ruled by Topsy, that will allow programs to grow and never be cut off, and that will never prune the grapevine. The Government had the razor gang Committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions prune away about 1.5 per cent of current Government expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of youth unemployment programs, whilst there has been a massive increase in funding in this Budget, there has also been this degree of pruning. The circumstances now are not the same as those of five years ago. There have been improvements in youth employment and a range of other successful programs which generate youth employment have been consolidated. The priority now is to consolidate our efforts into the areas which are proven to be the most successful. It is not a decision which has been made because there has been a careful six-month analysis of the Scheme and it has not been made because the Community Youth Support Scheme has not generated a large number of successful graduates, as it were, who go on to employment. It is understood that the scheme is more preliminary than that. Along with all the other informal community support programs in the country, it is the first step towards the school-to-work transition programs which show much greater success scores in terms of the graduates at the end of the courses who go on to employment. The decision has not been made for these reasons; CYSS has been discontinued because it was a five year exercise which has proved its worth, and times now are different. The time has come to give priority to the practical schemes that provide increased education, training and work experience opportunities to young people so that they improve their skills and better compete in the growing labour market. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Along with the hike in indirect taxation, the abolition of the Community Youth Support Scheme is perhaps the most glaring example in this year's Budget of the callous disregard this Government has for the people of Australia. In this case, the move to get rid of CYSS will leave thousands of unemployed young people without any assistance or support to cope with their plight or to help them to find work. Contrary to what Senator Teague has said, it will also throw out of work about 1,000 youth workers who will have to go on the dole after CYSS funding ends on 1 November. This is the last community-based self-help organisation which this Government has put into the wastepaper basket, having got rid of the Regional Employment Development scheme, the Australian Assistance Plan and the Area Improvement Program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The responsibility for the consequences of this move will lie fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown). It is significant that the Government has not seen fit to have a Minister defend the abolition of the Community Youth Support Scheme. Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, who represents the Treasurer and the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, has not been prepared to get up and defend the indefensible. Mr Howard claimed on Budget night that the abolition of CYSS would 'allow available funds to be concentrated on programs more attuned to labour market conditions'. The most glaring facts about labour market conditions are that 375,000 people are out of work, according to official estimates, and that 14.9 per cent of 15 to 19-year-olds are out of work. If the Treasurer really took notice of these conditions, schemes aimed specifically at helping these young people would be encouraged and not abolished. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, outside this Parliament, young CYSS workers and participants have gathered to protest against the abolition of the Scheme, which was one of the few signs that something was being done about their plight. They now feel as though the one small piece of firm ground they had has been taken out from underneath them. Some of those young people have made known their views to members of the Opposition and to the Government. They told me that CYSS provided help for the young people who more often than not never see, let alone take part in, the Government's much vaunted training schemes. The Scheme reaches the alienated young person who is convinced that no one cares about his or her problem. For example, in my State alone well over 5,000 young people will have received assistance through the Community Youth Support Scheme. This Scheme, more than any other-more than even the Commonwealth Employment Service-helped young people find work. It just shows to what extent Government senators do not know what is going on. They do not even read or understand the Government's own papers because Budget Statement No. 7 forecasts a slowing down in the rate of growth of employment from 2.6 per cent last year to 2 per cent in 1981-82. It is interesting to note that the same document refers to the fact that the employment of juniors grew by 2.9 per cent in the current financial year compared with a growth of 5.6 per cent in the previous year. So much for Senator Teague's defence of the indefensible. The Government admits that only 23,000 people will benefit as a result of its retraining schemes. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator GIETZELT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, the Budget makes provision for increases in the number of social security payments to the unemployed. So I say to Senator Teague that the Government acknowledges that there will be a worsening of the position, not an improvement. Of course, the young people themselves have confirmed what the Australian Council of Social Service has said-I quote the Council-that CYSS is a unique program unparallelled in other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries and one that is recognising that young people experiencing unemployment may need support and assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am surprised that a person with Senator Teague's background can so easily and airily dismiss the importance of this scheme. In my own area of Caringbah, for example, the value of the Community Youth Support Scheme has been confirmed in a report on the operation of the Scheme in that area. The report shows that the Caringbah CYSS office serviced many hundreds of young people and found them work. In short, after a shaky start it was proving to be a success. The Budget desision to end the Scheme, to the detriment of the experiment, has come as a very rude shock to the young people in my area. What has been the response of the Federal Liberal member for the area, Don Dobie, who is on the local CYSS board? His approach was typical of that which we expect from his party and it typifies the attitude of the Treasurer and his kind. I have been informed that, when asked about the matter, he said that petitions were a joke in this place. He said it would be a farce if CYSS received any support from the Australian Labor Party. As we all know, the Labor Party has had some criticism of the Community Youth Support Scheme but, as Senator Grimes has indicated, it is nevertheless an important community-based organisation which fulfils an important and vital role. </PARA>
<PARA> The young people I have spoken to cannot understand the party political attitude being taken by this Government. They cannot understand the sort of cynicism that is expressed by people such as Mr Dobie, Senator Teague and the others who try to defend a Budget decision made by Executive Government. They cannot understand why this Government has decided to abolish a scheme that it set up in 1976-the scheme it used to parade as evidence of its support for the unemployed youth. Is it a monstrous trick? It is sheer vindictiveness that causes this Government to reduce total unemployment relief by over $9m. In fact, it is yet another example of what this Parliament has come to know as basic Liberal Party philosophy-to transfer funds away from programs that actually assist people, away from the public sector, into the pockets of the private sector; to disband any community based activity that provides some sort of support scheme for those unfortunately unable to find work. </PARA>
<PARA> Close examination of the figures shows that this is happening once again, at a direct cost to the young unemployed. CYSS has been abolished at a saving of a measly $9m. It is no accident that the same amount has been transferred to the Government's much criticised transition education program. Let us have a look at the so-called transition programs for a moment. They are schemes that the Government hopes 15 to 17-year-olds, the people served by CYSS, will move into. In short they are, of course, a farce. The States, which bear the burden of the transition schemes, reject them. Let us look at what one of the Government supporters, a party member, has said in this respect. I refer to the Victorian Minister for Education, Mr Hunt. In a letter to his Commonwealth counterpart, Mr Fife, he said that the approach of these schemes was 'unworkably restrictive, crippling and offensive in principle'. He termed the earmarking of Commonwealth Grants to the States for these schemes 'worse than blackmail; it is plain extortion'. They are not words out of the mouth of a member of the Labor Party or a young worker who is aggrieved by the situation; they are words out of the mouth of a Liberal State Minister. So much for transition to work programs. If this Government cannot even get its State colleagues to support it, what chance do the young people outside have? We might ask the same question about these schemes that CYSS workers are now asking: To what work do these people achieve transition? That is the question that has to be asked. People can be trained until kingdom come, but unless there is work for them to do it means precious little. Until this Government grasps the nettle and sets about a real job creation program through the use of public funds, any notion of transition is just a bad joke being played at the expense of the young unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> The other scheme of which the Government seems to be proud is the Special Youth Employment Training Program, a scheme which it says will gain by the Budget. It is predicted that an extra 8,600 places will be created. Yet one Government spokesman is on the record as saying that 70,000 jobs will be created. God knows where he gets that figure from, or how he can possibly sustain that optimism. </PARA>
<PARA> In so many cases the SYETP is just an employers' rort. Companies get public money given to them to put on an extra young person at low wages for a given period. They sack those young people before the period is up and then get funds to do the same thing to other unfortunate young persons. The Australian Council of Social Service quotes a Commonwealth Employment Service officer as saying that about 70 per cent of employers sack young SYETP workers after the subsidy ends. That statement is contained in the ACOSS report at page 73. CYSS social workers have to cope regularly with young people who have been through three or four SYETP jobs, each job ending with the end of the subsidy. Yet this Government tolerates that situation and goes to the extent of providing an extra $140m to perpetuate that so-called transition program. Meanwhile, the employers rake in huge benefits. There is no check. There is no attempt to examine whether the employers are exploiting that system. As we well know, they are. In this Budget it is estimated that nearly 70 per cent of the funds for training and youth opportunities will be going to employers in the form of direct subsidies of this and other kinds. This estimate has been provided to me by the Technical and Further Education Teachers Association, which is an organisation that I suggest should know something about training if anyone does. The Government's own claims, therefore, are to be seen as hollow, even according to its own logic. </PARA>
<PARA> Funds to these largely inadequate schemes of training have dropped in real terms by 44 per cent since 1975-76, the year of the last Labor Budget. Unemployment has risen by 54 per cent in that time and, as I indicated earlier, in that time schemes that related to job creation or direct assistance to the unemployed have been scrapped. All that is left now are handouts to employers and big words from Government Ministers about labour market conditions. They are not acceptable to the Opposition, they are not acceptable to the unemployed, and they are certainly not acceptable to young workers in this country who want to get a job. </PARA>
<PARA> Around the issue of CYSS we have such a sorry tale. It is a tale of neglect, a lack of compassion, an unwillingness to provide for the real needs of the unemployed, and a real cynicism in hiving off cash to those who need it least and those who can exploit and rort the system. </PARA>
<PARA> The CYSS workers and the young unemployed outside this place today have demanded a number of things, as indeed does the Opposition. They ask firstly that the Government immediately refund the CYSS projects. These projects are, according to the CYSS workers and the young unemployed, according to the social workers, according to all the evidence of those involved in the problems of the disadvantaged in our community and the ACOSS organisation, the most effective and cost efficient employment preparation schemes. They ask secondly that the Federal Government take responsibility for the present economic conditions and situation, specifically relating to young people and the problems they face in relation to housing and unemployment, and provide for them in a meaningful and tangible way. They ask thirdly that the Federal Government reassess the effectiveness of present job training programs; that is, rather than pay subsidies to industry, money should be going to the public sector to be used for the purposes of job creation. They ask fourthly that the Federal Government acknowledge that CYSS is not only providing employment preparation but also is a vitally important support and referral service to the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe these demands are unreasonable. The Labor Party does not regard these demands as unreasonable. The Opposition says that the demands ought to be seriously taken into consideration by the Government. The Opposition demands that the Government defend the action that it has taken and not put up back bench members who obviously are not aware of the full implication of the Budget documents. The Labor Party is concerned that young people are being put in a position of being alienated from our society and, whether the Government accepts it or not, young people see the withdrawal of the scheme as a callous disregard for their needs and their rights. Surely those of us who are concerned about the alienation of young people in our society today ought to be able to recognise that and suggest to the Government that the steps that it has taken in this area are, as in so many other areas of the Budget, illogical, unfair, and often acting to the disadvantage of young people in our community. The Opposition believes that it has a correct approach to the problem of CYSS. It has brought this subject forward as a matter of public importance to be properly debated in this place; not to be seen in the context of just an ordinary Budget debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, may I congratulate you on having been elected to your present office. I hope that you enjoy your time serving the Senate in that capacity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is it seriously being suggested to the Senate that a government scheme, once instituted, can never be changed or varied? Is it suggested that a scheme, once it has come into being, can never go? The Regional Employment Development Scheme mentioned by Senator Gietzelt was brought into being by a Labor government and was abandoned by a Labor government, not as suggested by Senator Gietzelt. Times have changed since the Community Youth Support Scheme was introduced in 1976. We could say that its time came and its time has gone. Prior to 1976-between June 1973 and June 1975-the number of Australians receiving unemployment benefits rose from 38,000 to 160,748; an increase of 324 per cent. Over the two-year period from August 1973 to August 1975 the total full time and part time employed labour force increased by only 58,300 people. By comparison, total employment rose by 146,300, or 2.3 per cent, in the year to July 1981. During that same period there have been strong gains in teenage employment. Total teenage employment grew by 14,100, or 2.1 per cent, in the July quarters of 1980 and 1981. Over the same period the level of teenage unemployment has fallen by 18,500, or 17 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has increased substantially its commitment to the various employment and youth programs to which I wish to refer. It is all very well for Senator Gietzelt to refer to neglect and lack of comparison. The Government is putting money into places where people can obtain skills and jobs in this expanding employment situation. It is an underlying commitment to the youth of Australia that the Government is prepared to transfer from a somewhat loved and emotional scheme, as has been indicated, to something that is more practical and more worth while. As Senator Teague, mentioned there has been an increase of funds to $203m-23 per cent up on last year-in the 1981-82 Budget. In addition, about $58m is provided in the education budget for some of the transition programs. About 210,000 young people are expected to be assisted by the Government's program in 1981-82. Of that total of $203m, 77 per cent, or $156m, has been directed to apprenticeships and other training programs of direct benefit to young people. </PARA>
<PARA> The economy is growing, and we want young people to be able to share in the benefits that flow from this with increased employment opportunities. The most effective and practical way to help young people is to increase the funds for education, training and work experience opportunities. It is not enough just to give the support that CYSS gave in 1976, when there were such vast numbers of unemployed. Now that job vacancies are increasing it is necessary to have the skills to obtain employment. It is very important that young people are able to get into these programs. Undoubtedly, young people in some of these schemes will be employed only for the length of time their employment is subsidised because the employer is giving that contribution in return for some assistance in training somebody. I do not think it is reasonable to say that every employer who takes on a young person under that scheme is promising long term employment. He is offering a part of his skill towards training somebody so that when that person applies for a job he can say that he does have some skill. That is the significance of it. As I have said, the Government has decided that it is more appropriate to devote the available funds to these programs. I shall now deal with the CYSS program a little. When referring to CYSS-Senator Gietzelt may be pleased to know that somebody was critical of it-Mr Mick Young in his book I Want to Work said:</PARA>
<PARA> The scheme is no more than tokenism, confined to creating drop-in centres, providing 'cuddle therapy' rather than the jobs young people really need. </PARA>
<PARA>It is unlikely that Mr Young would have made that comment lightly. He went on to say-</PARA>

<PARA> The $12.26 million would be better spent on genuine job creation and training programmes. </PARA>
<PARA>Let it not be said that the Government does not listen to the advice of those who are prepared to give it. I wish to examine briefly some of the existing schemes. The Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training scheme has been increased in this Budget by $7.6m to $72m. It is expected that the increase in the number who will be assisted under this scheme will be from 78,000 in 1980-81 to 95,000 in 1981-82. This scheme was introduced in January 1977, in support of apprenticeships, to provide training for skills. A financial subsidy is given to an employer to encourage the training and employment of apprentices. It is aimed at compensating employers for the cost of releasing apprentices to undertake technical education in the basic trades and off-the-job training of up to 130 days, usually for first year apprenticeships. The subsidy, depending on the trade involved, is from $15 to $27 a day. An employer can also qualify for a 40 per cent premium on a first year technical education rebate for an apprentice who has done approved pre-training, resulting in up to six months reduction of the apprenticeship. </PARA>
<PARA> Reference has been made to remote areas. There is an allowance of $24 a week for first year apprentices and $10 a week for second year apprentices who are required to live away from home, to enable them to participate in one of these schemes. A lesser but not insignificant scheme of special apprentice assistance was brought into being in 1975 to help an employer retain an apprentice who was indentured to him or to engage one whose employer had had to put him off; in other words, to avoid retrenchment or to assist an apprentice who had been retrenched. The benefit of that scheme was a subsidy over a 12-month period. </PARA>
<PARA> The main thrust of the Government's policy in this area is in the school-to-work and work experience programs. Provision was made for 17 weeks of training, in which an employer receives $55 a week. Since February 1981 that has been extended to include two consecutive periods of 17 weeks-in other words, 34 weeks-where the subsidy is $80 a week for the first period and $55 a week for the second period to enable people to obtain work experience in a full time job. It covers Commonwealth Employment Service registrants in the 18 to 24 age group who are unemployed and have been away from full time education for eight out of 12 months. This program has been increased for this financial year and is up 67 per cent to $79.4m. It is specifically designed to increase the opportunities for further education, training and work experience for those without work who have been away from education for a period. It provides for courses in educational institutions. Allowances are paid to avoid an unemployed person being discouraged from entering a course which would improve skills and employment prospects. There are subsidies to those who will employ young unemployed and provide work experience. Some 76,000 people took part in this program in 1980-81, and in the current year the figure is expected to reach 90,000. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been mentioned the transition allowance of $6 a week, which is paid to young people on unemployment benefits, is an incentive, and I think Senator Teague gave the actual figures. The allowance has been available since the beginning of 1981 to enable participation in approved school to work transition courses at tertiary and further education institutions. It deals with those courses which relate to pre-apprenticeship training, pre-vocational training and pre-employment training and is available to CES registrants between 15 and 19 years of age who are unemployed and who have been away from full time education for at least four of the previous 12 months. Additionally, in the 15 to 24 age category of CES registrants, education programs for unemployed youth provide courses in literacy, numeracy, motivation and social skills. Commonwealth funding has recently been extended to cover State funding of similar courses. In the last 12 months it has been extended for some tertiary and further education courses for those between 15 and 25 years of age. About $1.5m has been allocated for that aspect of the course. It is expected that about 16,000 people will take part in this transition scheme in 1981-82 and the Budget allocation for that is $11.5m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is taking the real decisions necessary to face up to the problem of unemployed youth and to see that these people are provided with recognised course skills which will enable them to obtain employment. What CYSS provides was undoubtedly of benefit to a number of people at the time it came in and subsequently but it did not provide trade courses which offer the certificate one so often needs these days to obtain employment. That is what we must provide. Comfort is not sufficient, though on a temporary basis it may be very nice. There are 305 local CES offices providing a wide range of facilities and the Government has announced that increased counselling services will be available at the CES offices. Ten weeks notice has been given of the closure of CYSS. It has not been an overnight underhand decision as Senator Grimes would have us believe. Ten weeks notice has been given. </PARA>
<PARA> The capital will be handed over to approved local committees. No doubt the committees presently running these schemes will seek to have the capital handed over to them so that, to an extent, they can continue with some aspects of the work. The extent to which there has been a voluntary component in what has been going on has been stressed today and I have not the slightest doubt that those people will continue to provide services in that way. But the Government is putting the money into the job side of the situation in a way which will provide people with real employment opportunities. One truthfully cannot say that the Government does not care although it is very easy to do so. It is more difficult to make the decision which, in fact, gives somebody an opportunity to have a future that does not exist at present. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Twelve months ago the Australian Bureau of Statistics stated that 23 per cent of our young people between the ages of 17 years and 20 years were unemployed. I repeat that 12 months ago 23 per cent of that age group were unemployed. As Senator Teague pointed out, there has been some improvement in the unemployment figures in the last 12 months. But we should bear in mind that last month's unemployment figures showed a very sudden jump. There is a lot of evidence that the economy is now turning down. There is no doubt in our minds that the Budget the Government has just introduced will have the effect of pushing the economy down very rapidly. So there is still a very real youth unemployment problem. It has not gone away. It is very likely to get very much worse. The Government's decision to terminate the Community Youth Support Scheme must rank as one of the most senseless decisions taken in recent years. The scheme has operated successfully for five years and has helped tens of thousands of young Australians. Its future should not lie in execution and dismemberment but in evaluation and revision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For a government so given to expensive evaluations, it is extraordinary that there is no official government evaluation of the CYSS operation. However, an evaluation was conducted by a psychologist at the Swinburne College of Technology. I wish to report on that evaluation in some detail later. The Government's decision abruptly to discontinue the Community Youth Support Scheme will mean the closure of over 250 community-based schemes and the retrenchment, as has been pointed out, of 800 youth workers with experience in counselling, training and assisting unemployed young people. There are over 25,000 regular users and a further 20,000 casual users of CYSS, most of them unemployed young people between the age of 17 years and 20 years. No other youth support program offers the type of support which CYSS offers. It gives advice and assistance in identifying job opportunities. It provides advice on basic bridging-type training, counselling referral of health matters, accommodation and other personal problems. It provides financial counselling and assistance on income security arrangements with the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social Security as well as the support drawn from contact with people in similar circumstances. This is a very important aspect of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The CYSS program also is the only youth support program which draws substantial support from local communities and involves local citizens and organisations giving direct assistance to young people. That is very important. For these reasons I ask the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) to continue funding CYSS programs until May next year, as previously guaranteed by him, while a comprehensive public evaluation is undertaken. I also ask the Minister to consider immediately adding to the terms of reference a requirement that CYSS assist in school to work transition programs, with particular emphasis on permanent part time work in industry on a regular basis rather than the totally inadequate two to three weeks of work experience now provided. </PARA>
<PARA> I will illustrate that point by drawing on a practical example. In the West Heidelberg area some three years ago there was a social worker by the name of Mr Bernie Geary, who had the task of trying to motivate young people who had dropped out of society. Many of them had never worked in their lives and had no intention of working. Some of them were illiterate. They were completely demotivated. A scheme was devised with one or two large factories in West Heidelberg whereby machine places in the industry were made available to be worked on a roster basis for two hours a day. So two machine places offered work for eight people rather than two. This was a social experiment of some considerable significance because over a three-year period there was virtually not one roster time missed. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for the comment that young people are irresponsible and cannot be relied on. In an experiment conducted over three years not one roster time was missed. In addition it was found that the discipline of having to be at work at the rostered time for two hours a day had the effect of allowing the young people concerned to experience work in a real situation. If young people are put in a job for three weeks they know that at the end of three weeks that is the finish of it. But by working two hours on an indefinite basis they were able to see how industry operated from the inside out. They found that many of their hang-ups about having to work with people were not real. They found that they could get on with people of varying nationalities, that people were friendly and that there was comradeship on the shop floor. I put it to the Senate that CYSS is the ideal organisation to involve itself in that sort of school to work transition program. The CYSS program has been tried and found effective. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred a moment ago to a report from the Swinburne College of Technology in Melbourne. I showed that unemployed young people involved in CYSS projects were less likely to commit crimes than those who were not involved. The survey also indicated by implcation that if CYSS were cancelled the crime rate was likely to increase. I suggest that this is a very important finding and one that should suggest that this is a very important finding and one that should be taken note of. The report stated that the involvement of this type of group reduces anti-social feeling and boredom among young people, making them less inclined to engage in criminal and other anti-social behaviour. Keith Windschuttle recently made a very significant comment. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The crucial restriction on CYSS functions is that they are not permitted to engage in job placement or job creation activities . . . </PARA>
<PARA>If the guidelines were revised and expanded pending evaluation and perhaps the development of a new program it would save the termination of CYSS, which will leave tens of thousands of young Australians without hope, without purpose and without direction. I appeal to the Government to reverse its decision and to renew this worthwhile program. The Budget is very tough. We have yet to see its effect on unemployment generally and youth unemployment in particular. Using unemployment as an economic tool is a crime against society. In particular it is a crime against the youth of our society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join in this debate to draw attention to a few matters that I regard as quite important. My colleagues have already indicated that the Government has a good record in youth employment. They have illustrated that there was a strong employment growth, especially among young people, in June and July. I think that record stands as evidence of the competent management of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think one of the things we must remember is that the Government has created an economic climate in which the inflation rate has come down. I note that the Australian Labor Party Administration presided over an inflation rate of something like 16.7 per cent in the financial year 1974-75. The rate dropped a bit after that probably because the Labor Government recognised that schemes such as the Regional Employment Development Scheme should be abandoned because obviously the Government was not getting value for money. Labor took action similar to that being undertaken by this Government when it realised that perhaps the money could be diverted to better use. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) indicated that this was the purpose of the Government's decision on the Community Youth Support Scheme. The Government has decided that more funds should be applied in other directions, for example to training schemes to enable people to be employed under the Special Youth Employment Training Program. I believe those sorts of programs ought to be strengthened. Probably many people in this chamber can point to examples of employers being able to attract people to learn a trade under the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training Scheme. I believe that scheme has been quite effective. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that probably more than anything else we ought to be directing our attention to problems that are restricting opportunities for young people in this country. I would like to draw attention to an important area that we should come to grips with and try to solve on a tripartite or multi-party basis, involving of course industry, the trade unions and perhaps the State governments. I refer to demarcation disputes, which I believe are creating incredible difficulties in this country. I cite the demarcation dispute in Western Australia which is preventing the export of wheat because of a difference of opinion between the Australian Workers Union and waterside workers as to who should be unloading wheat silos. I believe that these sorts of things are incredibly damaging to Australia's credibility overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Other demarcation disputes are evident. In the Australian Capital Territory there is an argument between the Builders Labourers Federation and the AWU. It is hoped that that dispute will be resolved. Many people have been stood down for some seven weeks as a result of the dispute and probably they will not be able to return to work for another seven weeks. Industry will take months, if not years, to recover from such disputes, which overflow with other areas and affect trade unionists who are not part of the argument that has caused their misfortune. So I think there is a challenge to everybody in the community to try to work out a way in which these disputes can be overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that perhaps some attempt should be made by the Australian Council of Trade Unions or the trades and labour councils to deal with these matters within the disputes committees of their own organisations. They should identify the roles that workmen should be performing. The trade union councils should tell employers precisely what sort of work builders labourers or AWU members should be doing. I think that such a contribution would be very helpful to the youth of Australia who are looking for jobs and have been prevented from getting them because of industrial troubles. </PARA>
<PARA> Industrial trouble caused by demarcation disputes was probably one of the reasons why the unemployment figures in July were not quite as good as they were in June. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs pointed to that in a Press statement. The statement pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA> The number of people unemployed and looking for full-time work in July 1981 was 9,700 below the level of July 1980. However, over the month there was an increase of 25,400. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless the figure was the lowest July figure recorded since the monthly labour force series commenced in 1978. </PARA>
<PARA>The Press statement quoted the Minister as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Today's figures-</PARA>
<PARA>That is 6 August-</PARA>
<PARA>indicate that there may have been a slow down in the improving trend evident in unemployment throughout the year. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, the Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that the recent wave of industrial unrest may have undermined the confidence of employers and therefore have been a factor in this slow down. It is also possible that the power blackouts in New South Wales and Victoria have affected the July figures. </PARA>
<PARA>The Press statement continued:</PARA>
<PARA> He said the estimated total of 315,100 people unemployed and looking for full-time work compared with 324,800 in July 1980 and 319,500 in July 1979. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the total picture over the period that my colleagues discussed is an improving one. It seems to be that industrial disputes are at the root of a lot of our trouble. I refer to a current demarcation dispute at Port Augusta between the Builders Labourers Federation again and the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia. It seems to me that the builders labourers are involved quite frequently in demarcation disputes. Because of the prevalence of their influence in these matters I wonder whether there is something sinister in what they are all about. Another thing we have to look at of course is the constant pressures for increased wages over and above a realistic wages figure. I recall that Clyde Cameron said on one occasion when he was discussing the subject that one worker's wage increase costs another worker his job. Until we overcome the problem of industrial strife in Australia I believe our credibility as a reliable international trading partner will continue to suffer. Of course, the result of that will be that young people looking for jobs will find it more difficult to obtain them. </PARA>
<PARA> During the winter recess I was overseas for a few days and was able to talk to industrialists, Ministers of other governments and businessmen anxious to do more trading with Australians. One industrialist, the head of a steel corporation, said to me that he would be delighted to buy 100 per cent of his raw materials from Australia. That impressed me greatly. However, he was also very quick to say that he was not prepared to commit his corporation to purchasing any more than 50 per cent of its raw materials from Australia because of the uncertainty as to whether those goods could be delivered on time or even at all. I think it is a great pity that Australia, with its abundance of natural resources and overseas customers anxiously looking to us for a supply of these materials, cannot overcome the industrial strife causing our overseas image so much damage. I believe we have to come to grips with that. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably it would be a good thing if the conciliation and arbitation system and the Conciliation and Arbitration Act itself were to be totally revised, perhaps by people who know a little more about the subject than the consultants, occasionally brought in from outside, who have no knowledge of the practicalities of their suggestions in respect of what amendments ought to be made to that Act. Perhaps it would be a good thing if people with the experience of Bob Hawke and others who know a lot about dealing with these disputes or a fellow like Polites from the Australian Council of Employers Federations and others who have been actively involved in these matters were to do such a job. It seems to me that while we continue to stand by and allow all these things to wreck the job opportunities of the young people of Australia we are all clearly being negligent. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is important that the Government pursue the course it has decided on in respect of the management of the economy. I was very pleased to see the inflation rate not so long ago fall below 9 per cent. Certainly, it will be very difficult to maintain that level but I believe we all should encourage action to see that we maintain that level of inflation. That in itself gives us some opportunity to compete overses, when we are allowed to deliver our goods. I think this will mean a tremendous amount as far as providing jobs for people throughout Australia is concerned. I think the programs the Government has decided to persist with are worth while and it is a good thing that funds are being redirected from the Community Youth Support Scheme to increase the capacity of the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training scheme, the Special Youth Employment Training Program and the school-to-work transition program to be more effective. In respect of the transition allowance a total of 16,000 young people will be assisted to attend the Education Program for Unemployed Youth, pre-vocational and pre-employment courses and pre-apprenticeship courses in specific trades which result in shortened periods of indentures. This figure represents an expansion from 8,800 people assisted in 1980-81. So the figure of 16,000 represents quite a considerable increase. An additional 1,000 longer term unemployed young people will be assisted through occupationally-orientated courses. That is an increase of 500 people on the 1980-81 figure. A total of $5.65m has been allocated for programs to allow programs, other than manpower and training programs, to persist. Mr Deputy President, I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That so much of Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Chipp from moving that the Senate requests the House of Representatives to continue funding Community Youth Support Scheme programs at least until May 1982, while a comprehensive public evaluation is undertaken, particularly in view of the Government's promise to make changes which would make the service 'run smoothly and consistently'. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, I take the opportunity, as it is the first time you have been in the chair when I have risen to speak, to congratulate you on your election and to say how personally pleased my party and I are that you occupy that prestigious position. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very conscious of the limitations placed on me in this debate and of the fact that I can speak only to the urgency of why Standing Orders should be suspended. Standing Order 448 reads:</PARA>
<PARA> In cases of urgent necessity, any Standing or Sessional Order or Orders of the Senate may be suspended on Motion, duly made and seconded, without Notice: Provided that such Motion is carried by an absolute majority of the whole number of Senators. </PARA>
<PARA>In regard to the last point I am certain that the motion will be carried by a majority of senators because of its urgency. Why is it urgent? It is urgent because in my office there are more telegrams, messages and letters from people all over Australia on this matter than on any other single aspect of the Budget. That seems to me to make a matter of extreme urgency the fact that the Senate makes a formal request to the House of Represenatives to reconsider its decision, at least until after evaluations have been made. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter is urgent also because it represents the closure of over 250 community-based support schemes. It means the retrenchment of 800 to 850 youth workers with experience in counselling, training and assisting unemployed young people. It is urgent that this matter not be delayed. The House of Representatives should be informed at the earliest possible opportunity of the Senate's concern over this matter which was raised today as a matter of public importance by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Senator Grimes) and by several other speakers. It is extremely urgent also because 25,000 regular users and a further 20,000 casual users of the service, most of them unemployed and in the age range 17 years to 20 years, will as from the cancellation of this scheme be without support. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Senate passes the motion for suspension of Standing Orders I believe it could pass this message to the House of Representatives. What effect would that have? It would mean that every Government back bencher-particularly Liberal backbenchers-would then be under pressure from the young unemployed and youth workers in their electorates to have another think on the matter and to put pressure on the Government in the party room. I refer again to the urgency of this matter because, unless that kind of pressure on the Cabinet can be mounted urgently, the matter will be lost by default. I am aware of the concern of members of the Australian Labor Party on this matter. Honourable senators should be grateful to Senator Grimes for raising it today and pointing out what the Government's action will do to the community and to the people who are especially affected by the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Further on the matter of urgency, as I note in the motion, in early June in Adelaide the Minister is reported to have given an undertaking that people on Commonwealth-funded youth support schemes need not fear coming changes in funding and operations and to have said that an announcement would be made in a couple of months about changes in guidelines for the schemes, of which there are said to be more than 250 in Australia. The matter is urgent because there has been more than a mere change in the guidelines for the schemes, which the Minister said would continue to be funded-a fact that Senator Grimes and his colleagues of the Labor Party pointed out earlier. More than the guidelines have changed; the whole scheme has been ditched. The Australian Democrats merely want the Senate to ask the House of Representatives to hold the line on the matter, at least until it can be evaluated as promised, or virtually guaranteed, by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that under the Standing Orders, even though no Bill is involved, the use of the term 'request' is acceptable. It is a device which the Senate may use in urgent cases. If my motion to suspend Standing Orders is passed one may assume that the substantive motion, that the message be sent, would also be passed. Such a message would then be sent to the House of Representatives. I can think of no single act that would be more effective in dealing with this urgent problem. I would not then care, next weekend, to be a Liberal back bencher attempting to answer criticisms from young unemployed and social workers in regard to his support of a Minister who had broken such a promise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I second the motion and in so doing, since this is the first time that I have taken the call from you, congratulate you on your election as Deputy President. I support Senator Chipp and the motion generally. The Australian Democrats have brought it forward with Standing Order No. 448 right under our noses. That Standing Order reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In cases of urgent necessity, any Standing or Sessional Order or Orders of the Senate may be suspended on Motion . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Is this the matter of urgency that we believe it to be? I say quite sincerely that it is. In Kings Cross, not very far from where I live in Sydney, we have young unemployed people literally standing in queues to get scrap food from hotel garbage bins. This is not an Asian or Third World country. If such a situation does not indicate that this is a matter of great urgency very few situations could. </PARA>
<PARA> The termination of the Community Youth Support Scheme immediately brings to thousands of people an urgent personal and social problem. The Australian Democrats believe that it is not good enough that young people continue to sleep in parks and under bridges and are short of food in a country that is as prosperous as is Australia. If ever there were circumstances in which the Standing Orders should be suspended they are present now. We have heard honourable senators debate the matter of public importance. It is great that the situation should have been brought to public attention in that way, but it would go against the grain for me and for the Australian Democrats to leave it at that, if the tremendous urgency to do something about it were allowed to fall from notice. My colleague, Senator Siddons, remarked earlier that some 25,000 people are affected. It is up to us, as members of this Parliament and of this Senate in particular, if we belive that something is wrong, to raise it with urgency to see whether something cannot be done about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, might I also add my congratulations to you upon your election as Deputy President. The Government opposes the motion to suspend Standing Orders. As I understand the position, Senator Chipp is making out an agument for urgent action in this case. I admire him for not attempting to test the Deputy President in this situation and for sticking very closely to that general proposition. However, the Budget is still to be debated in this place. We have until at least 31 October to consider the question of the Community Youth Support Scheme. Consequently, plenty of opportunities will be provided in this place for further debate on the matter and it does not seem reasonable at this stage of the game to move for urgent action as Senator Chipp has done. I reiterate that the Government opposes the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports Senator Chipp's motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. We are aware that an absolute majority of the Senate is needed to pass such a motion. To achieve that it will be necessary for honourable senators on the Government side to vote with us. I do not accept at all Senator Messner's argument that the problem does not require urgent attention. It is one of great urgency for those project officers, tutors and others who have given so much to making the Community Youth Support Scheme what it is. A few weeks ago they were acting under an assurance from the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) that funding for CYSS projects would continue. As I said earlier, some people have just taken up employment with the CYS Scheme. They did so on the basis that on several occasions, in Tasmania and in South Australia, the Minister had assured the community at large that the scheme would continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My second point is that we had been promised by both a previous Minister and the present Minister that in order to improve the scheme an evaluation would be made. I think that the words used were 'to consolidate the scheme to make it more effective'. Yet suddenly out of the blue, in the presentation of the Budget, it was announced that the scheme will be abolished. </PARA>
<PARA> Another factor is that at the moment the Appropriation Bills are before the other place and that their passage would result in the abolition of the scheme. Therefore it is only sensible that the Senate should at this point send such a request to the House of Representatives. I repeat, that House is dealing with the very legislation which will abolish the scheme. That there has been considerable disquiet among Government members who have supported CYSS and have worked on the committees that have been running its projects, has been stated publicly. Therefore, it is entirely appropriate to suspend Standing Orders to consider this matter. Therefore, the Opposition supports the motion proposed by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank the members of the Australian Labor Party, and in particular Senator Grimes, for their support. We will be pursuing the matter as far as we can today by dividing on the issue, but if we do not obtain the needed support from the Government side to which Senator Grimes has referred we will not let the matter rest. We hope that, again, acting jointly with the Australian Labor Party and Senator Harradine under Standing Order No. 449 the matter can be brought on again by way of notice. I remind Government supporters that if a notice of motion for the suspension of Standing Orders has been given an absolute majority in favour is not necessary. Had we given notice of our intention to move the motion, under Standing Order 449 the motion could be carried by a majority of voices. I wonder whether that is what the Government wants, whether it thinks it would be the best of all worlds for my motion to be defeated today for want of an absolute majority but for me to be allowed to move it again in a day or two when the Government may be defeated on a simple majority and we may be able to send a message to the House of Representatives. I thank the Senate for its indulgence.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-In respect of items Nos 4 and 5 relating to the reports on the external review and the internal review of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the papers. </PARA>
<PARA>The DSTO, which is the subject of these two reports, is a very large consumer indeed of the nation's resources. The Budget allocation for the current year is some $119m, which is over half that of the provision for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the nation's biggest research and development organisation. About 65 per cent of the budget of the DSTO, which comprises nearly 5,000 people, is accounted for by the Defence Research Centre at Salisbury in South Australia. The Materials Research Laboratories and the Aeronautical Research Laboratories are the other main components of what is a multifunctional organisation. The organisation and the efficacy of this body is the subject of these two reports. The organisational capacity and the efficacy of the organisations have been the subject of a fiercely fought controversy within the Department of Defence, a controversy which surfaced, albeit briefly, early last month with the suppression-that became public-by the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) of a speech that was proposed to be made to a defence seminar in Canberra by the chairman of one of the two committees, namely Dr Rees, the chairman of the independent external review. Apparently there was an endeavour to suppress publication of the report at least for a period in order to wrench the two reports, the external one and the internal one respectively, into harness so that the terms of their recommendations would go down roughly the same track. But that attempt manifestly did not succeed; we have before us two different reports which demonstrate real differences in their recommendations in a number of significant respects. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the internal review, chaired by Professor Fink, the Chief Defence Scientist is, as might perhaps have been anticipated, generally softer. It claims generally that the integration of the DSTO within the Department of Defence has hitherto worked quite well and there is resisted in this report any suggestion that the DSTO ought to have more of an independent existence. It does, however, identify with some precision a number of obvious soft spots in the Organisation at the moment, especially in respect of managerial matters. It does recommend that there be conducted within the Department of Defence an efficiency review to put these matters right. The main prescription relating to organisational matters arising out of the internal review is a suggestion that the Chief Defence Scientist become a member of the Defence Force Development Committee and that the functions of that Committee be expanded to accommodate the kind of role and contribution that DSTO makes and hopefully should make to defence planning. </PARA>
<PARA> The external review, by contrast, which was chaired, as I said, by Dr A. L. G. Rees, formerly the chief of the CSIRO Division of Chemical Physics, is a substantially more critical document. Among the more important points, if I might succinctly mention them, made by this external review are the following: The low level of activity in nuclear weapon defence within the DSTO, which is said to give cause for concern as to Australia's state of preparedness to withstand a nuclear attack; Australia's ability to defend itself against the use of chemical and biological agents is questioned; further, the DSTO capability to engage in long-term strategic planning will, the review says, be ultimately destroyed if the pressure continues for ad hoc solutions to short term problems as being the dominant mode of the Organisation's existence. Then it is said that the amount of research conducted by the DSTO is inadequate and is less than has been claimed by the Organisation. It is said that the engineering and scientific support within the DSTO is of variable quality. It is said that some equipment, whilst of very high quality in its day, is now largely obsolete, resulting in a markedly inferior end product. Finally, in this short litany of some of the major findings, it says the DSTO is overadministered and that there is gross inefficiency in the use of resources, particularly staff resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The main impression which emerges from the external review is that this is an organisation of enormous significance not only to Australia's defence but also to the whole of Australia's research and development future. It is, however, an organisation which is indifferent in its achievement, of low prestige and with a very low morale. The main prescription that emerges from the external review, along with a large number of more specific recommendations, is that the Organisation should become a separate statutory authority. This recommendation, like all the other really substantial recommendations in both this report and the internal review, has been followed with a response by the Minister, replying in the other place on 19 August, by way of referring these major recommendations to the Defence Review Committee which has recently been established under the chairmanship of Mr John Utz and may or may not ever get around to making a serious report in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party generally has a bias towards a departmental rather than a statutory authority mode of organisation for bodies such as this in order to maximise in particular their accountability to the government and the parliament of the day. It is that kind of bias, I suppose, which in this case would lead us to greet rather circumspectly the recommendation that it be established as a separate organisation. But we do nonetheless acknowledge the force of the theme that underlies this recommendation of the external review committee, and that is the very important theme for the DSTO of necessity to have a close relationship not only with defence research and development but also with industry generally. The DSTO is very narrowly locked into a defence role at the moment. Industry as a result is not benefiting very much at all, or very obviously, from participation in the work of DSTO, the utilisation of the products of DSTO research or any spin-off from that research. Again, it is arguable on the other side of the same coin that the quality of the defence research effort has probably not been maximised either by this separation. </PARA>
<PARA> As my colleague Mr Barry Jones has said on a number of occasions in debating this subject and related matters, most technical innovation in the defence area since the Second World War has in fact come about from lateral thinking by people working and thinking outside their area of immediate professonal expertise in an atmosphere of intellectual vitality. There is a very real doubt whether the DSTO, given the way in which it has been structured and the way in which it operates, is such an institution of intellectual vitality. In fact, I think the kind of comparison that one would draw in this instance is the kind that one might also make between the Australian National University on the one hand and the Royal Military College, Duntroon, on the other. Might I say that no solution to the problems of the DSTO will be adequate unless we-the Government and the country-squarely come to grips with the necessity to maximise its efficiency, not only in the context of the defence effort but also in the context of the national research and developmental effort. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of different organisational models suggest themselves as possible solutions to the difficulties that are being experienced by this organisation. These are organisational models other than those that are respectively supported by the internal review on the one hand and the external review on the other. For example, there may be a case for establishing alongside the existing Department of Defence a quite distinct department-perhaps it might be called the Department of Defence Science and Industry-which would incorporate the defence science function which is presently performed by DSTO. Perhaps it could undertake the procurement function of the Department of Defence and also the Australian industry participation or offset arrangements that are presently administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce, having been previously within the umbrella of the ill-fated Department of Productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not stop now to argue these questions nor does the Opposition express at this stage any very firm view as to what the proper organisational model in this respect ought to be. We simply make the point, however, that not only should these questions be referred to the Utz committee which is presently gearing itself up to produce a major report on this and all matters related to defence organisations, but also these two very important and enormously significant reports should be properly considered by an appropriate committee of this Parliament-perhaps by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, or the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence or, as an alternative, the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment. Which of those bodies-or perhaps some other one-would be the most appropriate to look at these two reports carefully and report back to the Parliament is something that perhaps can be determined over the next few days and be the subject of further debate in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I wind up on in commenting on these reports is that we need a rather more rational approach to the very important problems that have been demontrated to exist by these two reports and a less reflexively defensive approach-if I might put it that way-than has been demonstrated by the Minister for Defence, Mr Killen, who in releasing these two reports commented that the external review was 'shortsighted' and 'unbalanced' in a number of significant respects and that the conclusions of some other aspects of the reports were 'ill-considered'. The reports in question, especially the external review before us, are better than this and they deserve a more careful, a more sensitive, a more thoughtful and a more constructive response than they have so far received from the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak very briefly in relation to one aspect of the matters referred to in the two reports which are the subject matter of discussion-that is, the Independent External Review of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation and the Internal Review into Objectives and Procedures of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation-both of which have been singularly delayed in their presentation to the Parliament and for which delay there is no full and apparent explanation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some aspects of the reports relate to questions which have arisen in relation to the committee undertaking the Review of Commonwealth Functions, otherwise known as the razor gang. One body about which I understand there has been no public announcement but which I have heard is being considered as one of the organisations to be axed is the Armed Forces Food Science Establishment at Scottsdale in Tasmania. I understand that the suggestion is being made that the operation of that body should be contracted out. I wonder whether one could imagine that it could be contracted out in the same way as one could contract out functions which can be conducted in Melbourne, Sydney or somewhere else, where there may be some alternative. In Scottsdale, Tasmania, the one alternative is a particular private sector company. The functions which are fulfilled by the 10 professional scientists, the six technical officers, the two administrative staff, the one typist, the one clerical assistant, the seven food processors, the one labourer, the one cleaner and the three Army personnel are hardly, I would have thought, a matter for a major redistribution of the deployment of our research function in order to achieve the objectives of the Review of Commonwealth Functions committee. </PARA>

Because it is small does not mean it has to be placed ahead of others if such an axing is to take place. Let it be judged on its merits. That is the only point I want to make.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This report relates to a review of the function of the Student Assistance Review Tribunal, which was established under the Students Assistance Act 1973-a Labor Government initiative. The review is a part of a wider project by the Administrative Review Council to assess all Commonwealth administrative tribunals. This is a project which the Opposition fully endorses. We are pleased to note that the general assessment is that the Student Assistance Review Tribunal has worked well with informal hearings in the form of round table discussions and that the system is inexpensive for the number of decisions that it produces. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of issues are raised in the report and I would like briefly to comment on them now. The question of incorporating the Student Assistance Review Tribunal into the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is raised in the report but the majority of members of the Council consider it is inappropriate to do this at present. Some members of the Appeals Tribunal take a stronger line, believing it would be undesirable. At this stage I do not want to give a firm view on this matter on behalf of the Opposition because we would like to discuss it further, but I do say that in general terms we favour the maintenance of the Student Assistance Review Tribunal in its present form-that is, without incorporating it into the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. In saying that, I must make it clear that the Opposition is aware that the AAT has been highly praised for its decisions and its conduct of appeals before it. However, it is a highly legalistic tribunal. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague Senator Evans has pointed out that it is not meant to be but it has functioned in this way on a number of occasions. We would be concerned if the Student Assistance Review Tribunal were overtaken by legalism. So at this stage we would be pleased to see the Student Assistance Review Tribunal maintain its present informal procedures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Administrative Review Council's first recommendation is to involve presidential members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in the deciding of important cases where a precedent may be set. This is a recommendation to which we are quite sympathetic. If assistance through the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme is to become even harder to get as the Government moves towards student loans as the major source of finance for students, it may be inevitable that legalism will take over these appeals. Appellants, especially in an organised campaign, will demand more legal consistency. Of course, the informal nature of the appeals currently being conducted do lead to some inconsistency in legal decisions. If there is a concerted campaign of appealing against various TEAS decisions then perhaps it will be appropriate for presidential involvement by the AAT. As I have said, the Tribunal has been working efficiently and economically, and it has considered a large number of cases. In 1980 there were 311 decisions. Of these, 58 per cent were affirmed, 31 per cent were set aside, 9 per cent were varied in some way, one per cent were disallowed and one per cent were adjourned. So it is clear that the Tribunal is carrying out a heavy workload quite efficiently, and we welcome confirmation that this is the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Education (Mr Fife) has restated the view that student assistance legislation was beneficient legislation and not restricting or controlling legislation. This is a statement that we endorse. It is very gratifying to see that Labor legislation, which this is, is working in this desirable way. This comment of the Minister means that the benefit of the doubt is given to the student wherever doubt exists as to the correct interpretation of application or regulation. It is worth noting that whereas the Student Assistance Act itself is simple, there is an increasing number of complex regulations. In our view there is no way of avoiding this because the regulations have to cover the very wide range of choices in courses offered by tertiary institutions, as well as, of course, the ability of students to change courses and things of that kind. All of this makes the regulations attached to the Act very complicated. We think that complication is a fair price to pay in return for the wide range of choices students have available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of the recommendations are of a mostly machinery nature and I will not take the time of the Senate to comment on them. I conclude my remarks by saying that the Opposition welcomes this review and welcomes the confirmation that the Student Assistance Review Council is working satisfactorily at this stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The report of the Public Inquiry into Income Tax Zone Allowances is rather disappointing. As I understand it, there was some pressure from the Government to have the inquiry complete its task as quickly as possible. I suppose that sort of pressure is not unfamiliar in this business. Many submissions which were made to the inquiry seem to have been ignored. Serious questions in regard to legality and equality have been left unanswered. They seem to have been skimmed over. I want to refer to them in a minute. In essence, the report offers no fundamental change to a system which has clear defects. There seems to have been a clear divergence of opinion among members of the committee. Mr Slater and Professor Kerr were plainly critical of some aspects of the inquiry. They felt strongly enough to present a minority report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish briefly to allude to the history of the zone allowance. It was introduced in 1945 as part of the Government's post-war developement scheme to encourage people to live in remote areas of Australia. Two zones were established. Zone A takes in roughly half of the top of Australia, across to the Queensland border where the boundary diverges north of Cairns. Included in Zone A are Darwin, Alice Springs and Mount Isa. Zone B takes in most of the rest of Western Australia, almost all of South Australia, one third of New South Wales and the middle third of Queensland-embracing Townsville and Cairns-and most of the western third of Tasmania. No changes have been made to the boundaries since 1956. No changes have been made to the allowances since 1958. At present a taxpayer with a spouse and two school children gets these respective rebates of taxation: In Zone A, $597; in Zone B, $97. The recommendation is to increase the proportion of the allowance related to dependants from 25 per cent to 50 per cent in Zone A, and from 4 per cent to 20 per cent in Zone B. This recommendation, I should add, was accepted in last week's Budget speech. </PARA>
<PARA> Another recommendation of the inquiry is the creation of a special category for people living more than 250 kilometres from a town of fewer than 2,500 people. People in that category will get a rebate of $750 plus the dependants rebate for their zone. I would have thought this proposal had a lot to commend it. Towns with more than 25,000 people in Zone A would move to Zone B and such towns in Zone B would lose the allowance altogether. This would mean that Darwin and Mt Isa would move from Zone A to Zone B, and Townsville and Cairns would lose the allowance completely. The Treasurer, Mr Howard, has yet to say whether these recommendations will be adopted. It is a pity, perhaps that the committee did not consider getting away from the present system altogether. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that a system of grants would serve more obvious purposes. It would, firstly, more closely account for the disadvantage of living in remote areas. Secondly, it would assist those most in need, overcoming the inequality of tax rebates which favour those on higher incomes. Thirdly, a system of allowances or grants of the kind I mentioned could be more easily controlled. It would not be open to legal challenge as the present system is, and these legal aspects are important. The constitutional validity of zone allowances seems to be doubtful, because they would seem to discriminate between States or parts of States. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sure. I was about to say that the Treasury does not seem to be able to give a definite answer on this question, and the Attorney-General's Department told the inquiry that it could not give an assurance that the zone allowance provisions were sound. That was the burden of its evidence to the inquiry. Obviously I do not want to be involved in answering the honourable senator's question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The changes recommended by the inquiry, of course, might invite a taxpayer to mount a challenge which could bring down the zone systen altogether. That is an important consideration having regard to the legal issues which I have mentioned. What I believe is needed is a proper study of the cost of living in remote areas, which could be done with a detailed examination by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to find out which communities suffer most. Compensation could begin at the point determined. Drawing arbitrary lines on a map almost certainly already excludes many areas of need. We believe that the Government should proceed quickly to carry out this examination and bring some order into the situation. This report of the committee, valuable as it is in the absence of much detailed examination of the zone allowance system, cannot be the last word on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a curious report from Australia Post. In some ways it might be regarded as a success story for the Government. To the Government, with a stated commitment to downgrading Australia's public enterprises, it must come as something of a triumph of Government policy to learn that Australia Post, one of Australia's great public enterprises, has recorded its first loss ever, its first loss since its creation in 1975. The loss for the period of this report was $12m. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, Australia Post has always sought to operate at close to break-even point. Last year the Australian Postal Commission made an operating surplus of $11.7m. As the report notes, if that figure of $11.7m is taken into account, then over the two years 1979-80 and 1980-81 Australia Post did in fact break even. The unfortunate thing about that is that Australia Post cannot offset this year's loss against last year's gain because last year the Government took Australia Post's profits away from it in repayment of a loan. Australia Post had intended to continue to pay interest on that loan because, like a number of other public enterprises under attack from this Government, it has been starved of capital funds. Not only is the Government winding down the availability of credit for Government enterprises, such as Australia Post, and infrastructure programs, but here we can see it also taking money away from such instrumentalities when they are least able to afford it. This is what Australia Post said in its report about the Government forcing it to disgorge its entire operating profit for 1979-80:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission had contemplated having this unappropriated surplus available to provide part of the funds required to finance expenditure on fixed assets in 1981-82 and 1982-83. The loss of these funds, together with the run down of current assets due to the operating deficit in 1980-81-which has wiped out the surplus from which the payment is deemed to be made-has reduced considerably the Commission's internal financing capability. </PARA>
<PARA>To add insult to injury, the Commonwealth has raised interest repayments on outstanding loans from the Commonwealth, thus starving Australia Post for capital even further. The result of all this is that Australia Post is forced to abandon substantial elements of its capital works program and/or to finance other capital programs by increasing postal charges. Australia Post has already increased its charges. Standard postage is to rise by 9 per cent. Priority paid surcharge will rise by 43 per cent. Registered publications postage rates will rise by an average of 23 per cent, imposing a burden on all those small, voluntary organisations and others who use that service. Christmas card postage rates will rise by 20 per cent this year. Private box levies, which particularly affect people in the country, will increase by 15 per cent. All these charges will go up as a result of Government policy in relation to the capital requirements of Australia Post. </PARA>
<PARA> The report indicates that if this process of capital squeezing of Australia Post continues then the pressures thus generated, when coupled with rising wage bills, will make further losses inevitable unless charges are further increased. The report contains a strong hint that, even on current estimates, charges may have to be raised. General postage charges may have to be increased by a further 4 per cent or registered publications charges by between 50 per cent and 80 per cent. As the Australia Post news release comments, the other effect Government policies have had is to 'reduce considerably the Commission's internal financing capability'. That means running down Australia Post's capital program, which in turn means two things. Firstly, Australia Post, like Telecom Australia and a number of other statutory authorities, redirects the profits it generates on profitable city routes towards the less profitable areas in the country. Any running down of internal financing directly prejudices country areas because the funds are simply unavailable to cross-subsidise country deliveries. In the last financial year Australia Post subsidised country services by approximately $20m. It costs, I think, in excess of $1.50 to deliver a letter in many outback towns in Australia, a service which used to be provided for 22c. That is the sort of thing to which the subsidy Australia Post has been paying out of its profits goes. People in remote areas would be wise to have regard to the effects and results which will emanate from the publication of this report. The winding down of country postal services is already in evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> The other danger of reduced internal financing is that programs which will cost more in the short term but which will contribute to efficiency in the long term cannot go ahead. What we are seeing here is the classic political trade-off, where something is done for short term political gain which in the long term will prejudice not only the country generally but the remote areas in particular. Capital projects which have previously been approved-presumably because the principals of efficient management so dictate-are now postponed, sometimes for a few years, sometimes indefinitely. If we look at the Budget Papers we can see that capital expenditure across the board is where this Government has saved most of its money. That is because politically it is the easiest option for the Government to take. It takes a few years before undercapitalisation of an organisation such as Australia Post becomes apparent. </PARA>
<PARA> What I find bizarre about this process of government is that there has been no report in respect of Australia Post such as the McKinzie report which inquired into the capital requirements of Telecom. That report was published in June last year and, despite questions by me and others, has not been released by the Federal Government. It is absolutely absurd that the public and the Parliament are not allowed to see a report which was initiated by the Government, into the capital requirements of our largest employer organisation, Telecom, which has enormous capitalisation. Why are we not allowed to see it? We are not allowed to see it because by implication, it is critical of Government financial policies. The same sort of situation applies to Australia Post. </PARA>
<PARA> If I might give the Senate a parallel, some decades ago, the Victorian Government tried to fool the people of that State by saving money on rolling stock for the Victorian Railways. The result is very visible today and it may well mean the end of the Victorian Government. In Victoria it is called the red rattler syndrome-referring to the Victorian Railways. That is, there is a steady process of undercapitalisation for short term political savings, resulting in long term disaster to an organisation such as the Victorian Railways. This Fraser Government has the red rattler syndrome in relation to Telecom and Australia Post. It is ushering in a new era of public administration in Australia, where public investment is shunned and private investment is imagined to be uniquely productive. This Government is bringing the red rattler syndrome to Australia Post, Telecom, and the Australian Broadcasting Commission, as well as to other public instrumentalities. </PARA>
<PARA> The results of the Government's actions will be to push up charges and depress the standard of service, particularly in the country. In the meantime, the Government continues to talk. Just a few months ago the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair), the responsible Minister-or should I say in this case the irresponsible Minister-commented on the program of decentralisation of the mail network in New South Wales. He spoke of it in glowing terms and said that the mail network should be decentralised in New South Wales. Particularly, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe there are clear indications that it (the decentralisation program) is bringing a great improvement to the efficiency with which mail is handled and delivered, both within, and to and from the State. </PARA>
<PARA>That is typical of the Government-now you see it, now you don't. Two months ago Mr Sinclair was praising the process of decentralisation of mail delivery in New South Wales. The Australian Postal Commission said:</PARA>
<PARA> Proposed investment in fixed assets in 1981-82 has been reduced, in line with government policy to contain public sector spending, to $37 million. This is barely consistent with maintaining satisfactory progress in 1981-82 in decentralising the mail network in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is saying that in the merry month of May it was a good thing to decentralise the postal service in New South Wales. Now that is to be jeopardised as a result of a change in Government policy, not because it is a bad investment of funds. Both Mr Sinclair and the Australian Postal Commissioners believe it to be a very good investment of funds as it will bring employment and increased business activity to the provincial centres of New South Wales. That is to be put in jeopardy because this Government's commitment to the private sector and short term political expediency is greater that its commitment to the efficient management of all sections of the Australian economy, which of course includes organisations such as Telecom and Australia Post. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This report is a valuable discussion of aspects of science policy. It is a scholarly and painstaking document such as we have come to expect from the distinguished body of scientists on the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science, men of considerable attainment and experience. After mentioning several areas which the report discusses, I would like to comment on two rather curious things about this report. Firstly, the valuable part of the report is that it does develop a set of national goals which, I note, includes 'social cohesion'. This is referred to on page 12 of the report and it was the subject of an amendment in the Senate some time ago when ANZAAS was being set up. It also refers to 'provision for peaceful change in policies and institutions'. These are social considerations which are important when they come from a body of scientists such as ASTEC. We hope that the views expressed in this report in relation to social values and social issues will penetrate into the Government's actions on industrial relations and elsewhere but particularly in relation to the development of a national science policy. I note that the report also endorses community health as a concept of importance in the Council's deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is something of an indictment on the Government, and perhaps on all of us as parliamentarians, that ASTEC has first to define national goals before it can look at how research may aid them. On the latter question, on page 13 of the report some important matters are listed. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Improve understanding of the ecological relationships between soils and agricultural and pastoral activities. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Understand the impact of human activity on the indigenous fauna, flora and natural ecosystems, . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Such matters include conservation, soil erosion, the River Murray, et cetera. The report talks about how we should 'achieve more cost-effective use of health care services and systems, including the application of new technologies'. We do not have time to debate this report tonight but I commend it to the Senate as a report which is a very serious document and which should be discussed at considerable length. I think everything ASTEC says about these issues is right but of course there will be differences of emphasis and agreement about them. These issues which I have mentioned are to do of course with social science but for some reason this Government has always opposed ASTEC's involvement in the area of social sciences. There are no social scientists on ASTEC except for one political scientist. Indeed, Sir Geoffrey Badger says in his letter of transmittal, which is referred to on page iii of the report, that ASTEC has to consult with outside authorities on social science issues. Of course ASTEC should so consult but it should itself be better equipped to deal with science in the environment of consideration of social science issues as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I applaud these remarks on the social science areas and express the wish that ASTEC should be broader, as was suggested in the Senate some years ago. The report illustrates the silliness of the present arrangement. The policy of the Opposition is to provide for this but also to provide for discussion of social scientists in the context of ASTEC. We so moved when the legislation was before the Senate. Some three years later the Australian Science and Technology Council says that it should be structured effectively in this way. That is the first curious thing about the report. It demonstrates in this indirect way the inadequacy of the science policy structure in Australia. I shed at least a crocodile tear for our former colleague, Senator Puplick, who was very concerned about these matters. The quality of the debate and discussion on this matter would have been improved by his presence because of his very keen interest in the ramifications of science policy. </PARA>

If the deliberations are sound and thoughtful one wonders why it is that there are no recommendations. Is it that the word has got out from this Government that it does not want authoritative statements which can be used to embarrass it? That assumption would carry with it the implication that most members of the community are totally illiterate which is, hopefully, probably doubtful. The treatment by this Government of the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry Into Domestic Air Fares, for example, may be a warning to independently minded members of inquiries about the nature of the recommendations they should make. In this report ASTEC mildly says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . there is a need for a real increase in the funds to maintain the vigour and productivity of excellent basic research and scholarship in Australia, . . . </PARA>
<PARA>But that is about all it says. People of the stature of ASTEC members should be asked and encouraged to make recommendations because that is what these bodies are for. They should be public property making public recommendations which should be publicly debated in this Parliament. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I find myself in a strange position because I just accused the Australian Science and Technology Council of not being courageous enough to make recommendations in its last report but it has made them in this report. Perhaps its members met on a different day and screwed their courage to the sticking place when they were confronted with marine science. The main recommendation in this report is that $3m be provided through the Australian Marine Sciences and Technologies Advisory Committee funding advisory panel for research and development in the marine sciences. It is said that money is what it all hinges on, so we can test the Government's seriousness about marine science by looking at what was allocated. If we study Appropriation Bill (No. 1) in this Budget we can see that the amount is $2.3m-a shortfall of 25 per cent on what was recommended by ASTEC. </PARA>
<PARA> The second observation I make about the report is that again it is a very good one worthy of much discussion as far as it goes. The Australian Marine Services and Technology Advisory Committee and the Australian Science and Technology Council are to report on research on a regular basis. But what do we do with the research of a body such as this? I believe there should be a very substantial research budget for an organisation of this kind but we need new industries in Australia based on our 200-mile economic zone. We need to feed the research and survey information into an industry which can use it to our economic benefit by creating permanent jobs. We therefore need to look at Government and private industry co-operation for Australia's fishing industry.</PARA>
<PARA> The discussion of industry policy in Australia for the last few years has been characterised by wailing and lack of imagination. I am talking about sections of manufacturing industry, not the Government. There has been a lot of wailing about various government policies in relation to manufacturing industry and very little imaginative thought about the areas in which manufacturing and resource development might take place in Australia. As I have said, we need to look very carefully at the whole question of government and private industry co-operation over the 200-mile limit in respect of the fishing industry and also mineral developments in that 200-mile zone off the shore of Australia, which is the largest island in the world and which has the largest contiguous zone under its control. </PARA>
<PARA> I just want to add that one can only get a clue about the resources available in the 200-mile economic zone if one looks at the habits of Taiwanese and Japanese fishermen who are prepared to come thousands of miles in order to exploit those resources at minimal cost in terms of royalties paid to Australia. If AMSTAC is to do this sort of research, if sums of $3m are to be appropriated for this kind of research, a lot of that research should surely be applied in terms of Australian industries or the potential for the further development of Australian industries within the 200-mile economic zone. That seems to me to be the important point which comes out of this report. I seek to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President,</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer, in his Budget speech, indicated that a separate statement would be made on the 1981/82 overseas aid program. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that the Government's decisions on aid be placed in the wider context of the Government's policies towards the Third World. Our policies towards the Third World take account of the three levels at which we must consider these relations-the global, regional and national levels. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, the most pressing global issue is the problem of reconciling the interests and established practices of the industrialised countries of the North and the demands for a greater political and economic role by the developing countries of the South. Australia does not fit either description very easily although we tend to be identified with the industrialised countries. However, this does not make the issue any less important to us. There is a particular need to consider the relevance of the issues which are involved in the North/South dialogue at a time when Australia is about to host a meeting which will bring together significant members of both groupings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting will be attended by some 40 heads of government of a range of countries at all stages of development. It will be the most important meeting yet held in Australia and one which has a wider international importance extending beyond the Commonwealth itself. This is because of the time of the meeting, its agenda and the atmosphere in which it will be conducted. At Melbourne developed and developing nations can consider the issues without being bound by the institutional groupings which so often characterise and impede progress in other forums. </PARA>
<PARA> The Melbourne meeting will have as a central theme and an essential part of its agenda the present state of the North/South dialogue and the question of how to move ahead. Its timing is particularly significant. It follows the Ottawa Summit of the industrialised countries and the recent meetings of Foreign Ministers in Mexico to prepare for the North/South Summit to be held there in October shortly after CHOGM. The meetings held so far in Ottawa and Mexico have established important common ground between developed and developing countries and each has represented a step forward towards a revival of the North/South dialogue. It is the Government's hope that the Melbourne meeting will make further positive progress. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's interest in relations between developed and developing countries is of long standing and reflects our geographic situation and our political, strategic and economic interests. Nor should there be any doubt about the importance attached to the North/South dailogue by both the developed and developing country members of the Commonwealth. Honourable Senators will be aware that emissaries have been sent to all Commonwealth countries to find out from Heads of Government what they believe ought to be discussed at the Melbourne meeting. The emissaries have since reported back to the Government and these reports reveal there is a clear consensus on the urgency of North/South issues and the need for progress. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe the CHOGM should give a positive signal to the Mexico Summit. We expect it will and that the seven Commonweath heads of government who will go to Mexico will take with them a clear message and perception of how progress can be made. </PARA>
<PARA> Although there are doubts about how to proceed, it is apparent that there is a need for a new process of global discussions between developed and developing countries. The foundation for these discussions, the so-called global negotiations, has been laid in the United Nations. A further effort to create a favourable climate will be made at CHOGM. </PARA>
<PARA> The issues for the world community to consider have been refined into four headings: food and agriculture, trade flows, energy, and international financial questions, in particular the debt problems of developing countries. We expect CHOGM to focus attention on these issues and to identify practical measures and arrangements to improve the situation in each of them. </PARA>
<PARA>Food and Agriculture The problems of world food security are immensely complex. Too often these problems are seen only in terms of famines and crises. However, the harsh reality is the need to deal with the permanent problem through the creation of adequate global food security arrangements and elimination of persistent food shortages. The increasing gap between food demand and supply in many developing countries, especially in Africa, has been aggravated by population pressure and the progressive destruction of agricultural land by cutting down trees, over-cropping and over-grazing in the search for food and firewood. </PARA>
<PARA> The statistics may seem abstract, but the impact on human lives and the development process is dramatic and continuing. Some 500 million of the world's population suffer from chronic malnutrition and hundreds of millions more suffer periodic and debilitating food deficiencies brought about often by the fact that they simply do not have enough money to buy food. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite encouraging harvest predictions for the next 12 months the overall global situation gives no cause for optimism-</PARA>
<PARA> World food production declined on a per capita basis over the two previous years and world carry-over stocks of cereals are at their lowest level since 1975-76, although there is some prospect of an improvement this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Food aid is still running well behind targets set by FAO. </PARA>
<PARA>Against this sombre background, and fully aware of the vital part which agricultural and rural development must play in providing a base for economic development, Australia will increase its own efforts, and encourage those of others, including the work of the Commonwealth Secretariat and the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation. We will do this in two ways. First, through addressing the short term problem of food shortages in developing countries by the provision of food aid. Second, we will help tackle the long term problem-that of helping developing countries to meet more of their own food needs in the future. Developing countries need to encourage increased food production by their own farmers. We shall assist countries to develop and implement effective food strategies, by strengthening agricultural research, technology and training facilities; and by playing a full part in international efforts to improve global food security. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition we shall add our support to combating protectionism in the agricultural sector. That protectionism has severely damaged the economies of many developing countries, as well as our own by reducing their foreign exchange earnings and employment opportunities and inhibiting efficient agricultural production. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be increased emphasis on food security measures in this year's aid program with some $106m being provided for these activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Further gains in agricultural production in developing countries depend to a significant degree on advances in basis agricultural research. Australia has a proven ability to contribute in this area. We are already supporting such research both bilaterally and internationally, through our contributions to the Consultative Group on International Rice Research, for bodies such as the International Agricultural Research Institute in the Philippines. However, we have resources within Australia-in CSIRO, the Universities and State bodies which can and must be tapped to a greater extent than is now the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has therefore decided to establish an Agricultural Research Centre in Australia concerned with the needs of developing countries. The new centre, which will be known as the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR), will be established as a small statutory body responsible to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The centre will not engage in research itself. It will be charged with contracting research work to existing Australian institutions in the field of agriculture and related disciplines for the benefit of developing countries and its principal aim will be to contribute to the solution of agricultural problems in these countries. Research work will be carried out in developing countries as appropriate. Opportunities will be sought to involve research and extension workers from developing countries. To ensure the effectiveness of the new centre, a high level of advisory council representative of the Australian, developing country and international scientific communities will be established to set the research priorities of the new centre and review the progress of research programs undertaken. In addition, the centre will be served by a small secretariat of high professional quality. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided that a trust fund should be set up for the centre and that the initial commitment should be $25 million over four years. Expenditure during its first year is expected to be $1 million. </PARA>
<PARA> $2.1 million has also been set aside for food security measures intended to assist the development of secure production, marketing and distribution facilities in the food economies of some of our principal aid recipients. This assistance will be in addition to our existing country programs and will be provided by a mix of commodity aid and technical assistance, as well as support for relevant programs developed by international bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> Food aid also can play an important role in improving food security in low income food-deficient countries. A significant increase-from $87 million in 1980-81 to $100 million in 1981-82-has been included for the food aid program, which has an immediate impact for the poor and hungry in developing countries. There are a number of innovations in this food aid program, including: the payment of freight on an increased portion of food aid in recognition of increasing freight costs; provision of 80,000 tonnes of freight-paid grain to Africa to be provided on a bilateral basis but channelled through the World Food Program; and a contribution of at least 45,000 tonnes of the International Emergency Food Reserve which will be used to help overcome unexpected and sudden food shortages. </PARA>
<PARA>EnergyThe world economy generally, and non-oil developing countries in particular, have experienced considerable difficulty in adjusting to the second oil price shock of 1979-80. Overall, the oil bill as a proportion of GNP for non-oil developing countries nearly doubled. For some individual countries in this group, a substantial portion of their export earnings is needed simply to meet the cost of imported oil. This obviously restricts the economic development of these countries and, in turn, their opportunity to expand economic relations with developed countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The debt burden has created a critical situation for most oil importing developing countries. Even those which can borrow money in the commercial markets face serious uncertainties in planning their future. </PARA>
<PARA> The primary responsibility for developing energy must always rest with national governments. However, the Government recognises that international efforts need to be made to tackle the global energy problem and the particular problems of non-oil producing developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> For its part Australia has been active in promoting regional initiatives designed to assist developing countries in their attempts to reduce dependence on imported oil. We fund the Commonwealth Regional Renewable Energy Resources Information Service (CRRERIS) and other activities established under the CHOGRM Energy Group. We have been active in promoting and have recently organised discussion on increased coal utilisation for ASEAN countries. Australia funded an energy planning workshop in Papua New Guinea in July for some twenty developing countries in the region and was a major contributor to the ESCAP Secretariat's study into the particular energy problems of the ESCAP region. There is, in addition, an increasing 'energy focus' in Australia's bilateral development assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Urgent measures are required to assist developing countries reduce dependence on imported oil through increased oil exploration, conservation, substitution and development of alternate energy sources. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal issues relate to oil supply and price, conservation and the nature of financial assets exchanged for oil. These are primarily matters between OPEC countries and the major Western industrial and financial countries. However, CHOGM will provide an opportunity to consider measures to alleviate the special problems of developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> We support establishment of the proposed World Bank Energy Affiliate as a fund to develop new sources of oil and to promote the use of alternative energy sources. Australia believes however that increased energy lending by the World Bank to assist developing countries reduce dependence on imported oil should not have to await establishment of the proposed Affiliate. Australia welcomes therefore the recent announcement by the World Bank that it will increase and diversify its energy lending in 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth can take effective steps to assist developing countries in other ways. Initiatives which Australia is prepared to propose include extension throughout the Commonwealth of the types of services provided by the Commonwealth Regional Renewable Energy Resources Information Service, which collects and disseminates information throughout the region and which will also provide an advisory service for member countries. Australia would be willing to collaborate in providing advice on establishing similar services in other regions of the Commonwealth and in assisting with training personnel in energy planning. </PARA>
<PARA> We shall also work in international bodies to strengthen the flow of investment in oil and energy exploration and development by encouraging the participation of private enterprise, particularly in developing countries where there has been a significant falling off in such activity. Private investment can be an extremely important source of development finance. At the same time, it may not satisfy all requirements and a significant role is likely to remain for development finance from official sources. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also participating actively in the United Nations Conference which is presently taking place in Nairobi on New and Renewable Sources of Energy. The Minister for Industry and Commerce led the Australian delegation, pointed to Australia's own extensive experience in seeking to develop alternative energy sources and announced that Australia would allocate an additional $1 million for energy assistance following the Conference. </PARA>
<PARA>Trade</PARA>
<PARA>In the area of trade and commodities, the environment for world trade is deteriorating. The developed countries continue to face high levels of inflation and unemployment. Protectionist pressures have been mounting in major trading countries and protectionist measures are now applied to sectors which account for nearly thirty per cent of world trade. </PARA>
<PARA> Increased opportunities for trade, however, offer the most promising avenues for many developing countries for greater prosperity. The greatest degree of economic growth among developing countries has been achieved by those which have focused on export strategies. </PARA>
<PARA> For its part, Australia has taken substantial steps to improve access for an increasing range of imports from developing countries. On a per capita basis, Australia is a major importer of manufactured goods from developing countries. For example, Australia imports more textile and clothing products from developing countries than any other developed country on a per capita basis. The concessional arrangements which we offer developing countries through such arrangements as PATCRA and SPARTECA are helpful and, as the Foreign Minister found at the recent South Pacific Forum, valued highly. These agreements are complemented by actively promoting the products of developing countries in the Australia market. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's recent announcement that it would call for a report within six months from the IAC on the general question of tariff protection is a practical demonstration of its willingness to have Australia's own protection arrangements carefully examined. It should be noted that this timetable is well ahead of the original schedule for the enquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an additional national interest in seeking to make best use of our domestic resources. Some structural adjustment of our own industries may be involved. To avoid unacceptable social and economic costs, this process must be gradual. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of steps could be taken by the Commonwealth to improve global trading conditions and assist developing countries with their particular problems. It could call on the meeting of GATT Trade Ministers in 1982 to consider issues which have an impact on the trade of developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> We would hope that the Melbourne meeting would urge a wider signature and ratification of the Common Fund and call for more pledges to its Second Account. </PARA>
<PARA>International Financial Questions</PARA>
<PARA>The debt of developing countries has grown considerably during the 1970's, even when allowance is made for inflation. To a significant degree, this increase in indebtedness has been caused by oil price rises in 1973-74 and 1979-80 and added to recently by steep rises in international interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The trends indicate that developing countries will face more serious debt management problems in the future-particularly those developing economies which are experiencing dynamic growth and therefore need capital as well as some low income countries having difficulty in paying for the rising costs of imports, especially oil. </PARA>
<PARA> The international financial institutions have expanded and adapted to changed economic circumstances and responded to some of the needs of developing countries. The International Monetary Fund has played an expanded role in recycling oil surpluses to developing countries and the IBRD has stepped up its activities in lending to developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also an urgent need for those countries themselves to adjust their national policies so as to improve their economic performance and their balance of payments situation. </PARA>
<PARA> On specific measures, Australia would support increased IMF capacity to assist in financing and the adjustment of large external deficits. It is important that nations act quickly to provide their contributions to the World Bank's resources. Australia supports consideration being given to a higher ratio of lending by the World Bank in relation to its capital resources. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of these issues will be considered at the forthcoming meeting of the Commonwealth Finance Ministers where Australia will seek to play an active and positive part. </PARA>
<PARA>AidThe Foreign Minister spoke of the issues facing the world community under the four headings of food and agriculture, trade flows, energy and international financial questions. Many of the practical actions which Australia has taken in these areas involve us in significant expenditures under our overseas aid program. </PARA>
<PARA> Overseas aid is itself an important element of the North/South dialogue. The actions of developed countries on this issue of the transfer of resources to developing countries are seen by the Third World as a measure of our commitment to the achievement of real progress in the North/South dialogue. </PARA>
<PARA> The world community will benefit if all its members can share the resources and conditions necessary for a decent standard of living. Hundreds of millions of people in developing countries are deprived of such basic necessities as adequate shelter, nutrition, health and education. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there is a substantial element of self-interest for Australia in promoting higher standards of living and political stability in developing countries, particularly in neighbouring ones. </PARA>
<PARA> As a democratic Western society in the Southern Hemisphere Australia more than most aid donors has a real and direct interest in supporting the development efforts of Third World countries. </PARA>
<PARA> As there is greater economic advancement in developing countries, so trading opportunities for Australia will expand. Many Australian companies already benefit from commercial opportunities flowing directly from the aid program. Often Australian expertise is a necessary requirement for the efficient use of Australian aid funds, particularly for agricultural development projects. </PARA>
<PARA> Aid can also serve long-term foreign policy interests. The Soviet Union has shown by its past actions that it will willingly exploit situations of poverty and hunger, but the amount of genuine development aid provided by the Soviet Union to recipient countries is small-both absolutely and in comparison with the military equipment they provide. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in this context that aid which offers practical assistance to development can help achieve foreign policy objectives. This is not to suggest using aid as some sort of lever or bribe in an attempt to buy short-term political advantage. Nevertheless, aid must provide a basis for mutual understanding which can only grow if donors show an appreciation of the legitimate developmental goals and aspirations of the recipient. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this year's Budget makes provision for expenditure of $662.3 million on official development assistance in 1981-82. This represents an increase of $104 million over actual expenditure in the last financial year. Of the total amount, $663.7 million will be used for direct expenditure on aid activities by the Australia Development Assistance Bureau within the Department of Foreign Affairs, $15.4 million by the Treasury while the balance is accounted for by development-related activities undertaken by other Government Departments and instrumentalities. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase of over $100 million over our 1980-81 aid expenditure level is evidence of our acceptance of aid as a key element in the North-South debate. It will mean that the proportion of Australia's Gross National Product actually spent as official development assistance will rise from 0.43 per cent in 1980-81 to 0.45 per cent in 1981-82. On the basis of comparing aid with GNP, Australia is ranked in the middle of the 16 major Western aid donors, although the quality and terms of our aid are better than those of most other donors. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the aid program does involve significant expenditures and hence benefits at home. Examples include the supply of Australian grain and other foodstuffs as food aid and the purchase of a range of Australian goods and services. We intend to maintain these features of the program and indeed to look for further ways in which to develop mutually beneficial aid flows. </PARA>
<PARA> Paralleling the Government's decision to provide an increase in the level of the aid program, efforts to ensure that the increased funding is used in the most effective way possible will be continued. Of course, existing obligations to our near neighbours and to international organisations and development bodies account for a large portion of this amount. In fact, almost 90 per cent of the total amount will be directed to maintaining ongoing programs. There has nevertheless been considerable scope to introduce further initiatives within the program and to expand existing programs. Some of the most important of these have already been mentioned in the context of food and agriculture and energy. </PARA>
<PARA> Mention should also be made of the aid program's major components and to elaborate on some of the initiatives included within it. Further details are set out in Budget Paper No. 8. </PARA>
<PARA>Assistance to Papua New GuineaAs in previous years, Papua New Guinea will be the major single recipient, with $254 million being allocated for that country in 1981-82. this amount includes the first budget-support grant from within the new five-year PNG-Australia aid agreement announced in September 1980. The purpose of this agreement, which is of great importance to PNG, is to provide that country with a long-term framework within which to plan its future development. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bilateral Projects ProgramAbout $145 million has been allocated for project and technical assistance activities in a large number of countries, principally in South-East Asia and the Pacific. In both these regions, we have major long-term commitments to provide assistance. While there is a good deal of emphasis within the ASEAN program upon large scale projects, the program to the South Pacific region includes a large number of small projects and different forms of aid designed to meet the needs of thse small island states. In total, there will be about a $5 million increase in the level of bilateral aid to the South Pacific this year. In addition there will be a substantial increase to our support for regional activities in the South Pacific-these will be referred to later in this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> To keep pace with the changing requirements of the South Pacific new forms of aid have been introduced over recent years. One particular form of assistance which will be given increasing prominence in 1981-82 is the funding of joint ventures in the region. $1 million has been set aside to provide grants for the purchase of island equity in joint ventures with Australian companies. It is anticipated that the economies of the South Pacific countries will benefit from this income and employment creation. </PARA>
<PARA>TrainingSome 3,300 overseas students and trainees will be sponsored by the Australian Government in 1981-82. This is a significant increase on 1980-81 numbers and reflects the increased emphasis that recipient countries are placing on their human resources and the high level of goodwill generated by the program. Within the training program, for which $24 million has been provided, it is proposed to increase English language training opportunities and to give further emphasis to training senior administrators. Additional support will also be provided for training within developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Support for Non-Government OrganisationsThe Foreign Minister expresses his appreciation of the important work being undertaken by Australian non-government bodies. They have a special role to play in serving some of the areas of most serious need in developing countries and operating in a way, and often on a scale, more effectively than the official Government program. An expression of the Government's support is reflected in the decision to make donations tax deductible to the major bodies involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Assistance for these organisations will rise from $2.9 million in 1980-81 to $ 5.2 million in 1981-82. Within this amount, a new scheme known as the Australian Executive Service Overseas Program will be funded. This scheme, which makes use of the skills of the Australian Business Community, is being introduced on a trial basis in 1981-82 with the support of the Confederation of Australian Industry. A specific allocation of $400,000 is earmarked for NGO projects in the South Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA>Multilateral AidTotal multilateral assistance will amount to $142 million in 1981-82; an increase of $41 million on expenditure in 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure of $11.6 million for capital increases in the resources of the World Bank and its private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation is included in the program. A $3.6 million contribution is also provided to the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation (CFTC) to meet priority technical assistance needs of developing Commonwealth countries. This represents a substantial increase over the previous levels and reflects the confidence of the government in the CFTC as a means of assisting the development efforts of developing Commonwealth members. </PARA>
<PARA> Increases will be made in our pledges to the UN Development Program, UNICEF, UN Relief and Works Agency, UN High Commissioner for Refugees and UN Fund for Population Activities. The increases, which amount to approximately $4.3 million, reflect the Government's support for the special role which these bodies can play in providing development assistance at the global level. Contributions to the UN Industrial Development Fund and the UN Research Institute for Social Development will also be made for the first time in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA>Regional Co-operationAustralia is particularly keen to support regional co-operation efforts. Perhaps the leading success story in this area has been the degree of co-operation developed in the ASEAN region. Part of Australia's response has been the development of the ASEAN-Australia Economic Co-operation program. The program which is jointly funded by Australia and ASEAN was established in 1974. It supports projects and activities designed and implemented by ASEAN. A major benefit of the program has been the degree of co-operation and collaboration among research and technical personnel in the ASEAN countries. This has stimulated research and development activities, technology transfer and mutual assistance. $7.5 million has been made available for the program by Australia in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, within the South Pacific we are increasing our support for regional co-operation through contributions to a number of activities, including the Pacific Forum Line, seabed research and the University of the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA>Refugees and Emergency ReliefOver the last 12 months, there have been further tragic increases in the number of refugees throughout the world, including East Africa, Kampuchea and Afghanistan. </PARA>
<PARA> To alleviate the extreme hardships which these people face, Australia will continue to support international appeals and provide emergency aid, mainly in the form of food. One example of this is the Government's recent decision to provide significant amounts of wheat, high protein milk biscuits and sugar for Afghan refugees in Pakistan. </PARA>
<PARA> An amount of $8.5m has been set aside to meet our obligations to special international appeals. $2m of this amount is already committed to fulfil a commitment announced in April this year at the International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa. </PARA>
<PARA>Aid and the Private SectorThe Government is actively promoting the involvement of the Australian private sector in the aid program. Thus some 64 projects worth $60m are now being handled by private consultants. Attempts are being made to tap the skills of Australian companies in other ways. One example, in the South Pacific, is our support of joint ventures between Australian firms and island partners. </PARA>
<PARA> Another response has been the introduction of a scheme specifically for ASEAN countries known as the Development Import Finance Facility. The idea of the scheme is to reduce the cost to ASEAN governments of importing capital goods and services from Australia for development purposes to match the export finance terms of other developed countries. By offering a grant to support such transactions the Australian Government aims to enable recipient countries to purchase needed capital goods and services on better terms than are available under existing concessional finance. </PARA>
<PARA>ConclusionMr President, it is no exaggeration to state that the relationship between the developed and developing countries is now at a crucial stage. A great deal more is at stake than economic and commercial advantage. Important political and strategic considerations are involved. It is essential that the Western democratic nations show they can respond to this situation, to the opportunities as well as problems which are posed. </PARA>
<PARA> The USSR has demonstrated both its unwillingness and its inability to provide the assistance which the Third World needs if the great mass of humanity is to achieve the prosperity it seeks. The USSR cannot provide the markets, capital, technology, the flexibility of adjustment which has made the West the dynamic force in international development. </PARA>
<PARA> The USSR may offer arms, ideology and disruption but they bring chaos not prosperity. The USSR has always stood aside from the North/South debate seeking to hide is inability to make a positive contribution behind out-dated, empty arguments about the responsibility of former colonial powers. </PARA>
<PARA> We in the West, the developed democracies, can show our ability to respond to a new challenge, to bring about a new period of growth and prosperity. We cannot do this by seeking to exclude the developing countries or isolate ourselves from them. Nor can we ignore them and their problems. We still have time and the opportunity to find a solution within the existing international framework. It would be misleading to suggest that any solution will be arrived at easily-without a long process of negotiation and reconciliation. The effort must be made because the alternative of economic Darwinism-of the extinction of the weakest or the survival of only the most powerful-is not acceptable nor is it in Australia's interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia, as host, has a unique opportunity at CHOGM to give the North/South dialogue a new impetus. We must make the most of that opportunity. The Government expects that all honourable senators will support this objective and that we will achieve bipartisan agreement about what has to be done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A leading article in the Canberra Times of 21 August entitled 'The Politics of Caring' contains a comment about various statements which have been made by the Government in relation to foreign aid. The article says this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister seems to believe that the people of this country do not care enough to make him put their money where his mouth has been. He may be right. On June 4 he admitted to Parliament that the cuts in foreign aid by several countries had 'sharpened the North-South debate between the wealthy and poorer countries. It is one of the matters which cast doubts on the credibility of wealthier countries, about their real intentions'. That was an honest abservation. </PARA>
<PARA>The leading article in the Canberra Times continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, not all the wealthier countries have been as mean as Australia, the United States (0.27 per cent), Britain (0.34 per cent),-</PARA>
<PARA>This is the percentage of gross domestic product</PARA>
<PARA> Japan (0.32 per cent), New Zealand (0.32 per cent) and Italy (0.17 per cent).</PARA>
<PARA>The countries which have not been as mean include:</PARA>
<PARA> The Netherlands . . . 0.99 per cent, Norway 0.82 per cent, Sweden 0.76 per cent and Denmark 0.72 per cent. So, given the democratic will of an informed and interested electorate, it can be done. The rich do not have to be selfish, if they are well educated and well led. </PARA>
<PARA>I have made this comment in the Senate before. I made the comment the other day in the course of a debate on industrial relations when I simply said that the countries with the least number of man hours per thousand lost per annum as a result of industrial disputes are the countries of Holland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Austria and Switzerland. In relation to this question of capacity to give foreign aid to underdeveloped countries where the Australian record has been sad and getting worse, the countries of Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark lead the field. They exceed the recommended level of foreign aid suggested by the United Nations. Strangely enough all those countries have social democratic governments and are very stable societies with little unemployment, little industrial trouble and a capacity for being 'well led', to which the Canberra Times article referred, to assist with foreign aid programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Sadly on this matter of foreign aid and the North-South dialogue the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has been caught posturing again both on humanitarian grounds and on strategic grounds. In his speech to the University of South Carolina given on 8 July this year the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> Edmund Burke said it better when he observed, in the process of cautioning Britain on its treatment of the American colonies, 'that discontent will increase with misery; and that there are critical moments in the fortunes of all states, when they who are unable to contribute to your prosperity may be strong enough to complete your ruin.' Today, all the Western countries need to heed that advice. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Prime Minister said in the comfortable halls of the University of South Carolina. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Evans" NAMEID="VD4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans interjected 'pompous nonsense'. That is true but it is pragmatic, sensible, hard-headed pompous nonsense. The next paragraph is less so. Later the Prime Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . despite its poor overall record in providing aid to developing countries, the Soviet Union can exploit tensions in relations between the West and the Third World. Given the unprecedented military strength it has at present, the Soviet Union is likely to make a particular effort in this respect during the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA>I quoted from that speech because people who advocate foreign aid are sometimes regarded, in the terminology of British politicians and, I think, the terminology of the Liberal Party now, as wets-people who are not practical and hard-headed. In his University of South Carolina speech the Prime Minister was saying: 'this is tough, Wannon style November 1975, real politics'. You have to be very careful of the Russians so we ought to give more foreign aid. You have to be very careful of the words of Edmund Burke uttered years ago at the time of the colonisation of America to look after poor countries otherwise they will get after you and eat you in turn, as it were.' So at the University of South Carolina the Prime Minister was offering hard, realpolitik advice on how to deal with the commos, as he no doubt would have put it. At other times when he is discussing foreign aid, when Professor Owen Harries is writing the words for him, he puts it in different terms about the importance of aid to underdeveloped countries. I will come to that matter in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Prime Minister was at the University of South Carolina the permanent head of the Treasury in Australia was saying something different. In a letter to Professor Owen Harries-it is addressed to 'Dear Owen' and refers to the Prime Minister's speech on the Third World and the West-Mr John Stone, the Secretary to the Treasury, said:</PARA>
<PARA> At some stage, moreover, some developing countries are going to be so impolite as to ask Australia to put its policies where its mouth is. At that time, unless we can show more 'political will' than has been evident until now (for example, in regard to the dismantling of our high-protection regime) the Australian emperor--</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Prime Minister-</PARA>
<PARA>is going to appear remarkably unclothed. </PARA>
<PARA>That comment was elaborated on by the Secretary to the Treasury who turned out to be no slouch in the prose department. As I said, this was elaborated on to some extent in the letter which he wrote to Professor Owen Harries. So there is a yawning gap, as it were, between rhetoric in South Carolina and performance when it comes to Budgets in Australia. I think the important thing is to consider the realities of our situation here and what we have done in the past few years in relation to foreign aid. I remind the Senate that Professor Harries drew attention-I think it was a year or so ago in the report written by Professor Harries on Australia and the Third World-to the decline in Australian aid to underdeveloped countries since the Fraser Government came to power. What he pleaded for in that report on Australia and the Third World was what he called the reversal of the trend in relation to development aid under the Fraser Government-the trend which had developed since this Government came to power. </PARA>
<PARA> I will say something about the realities of the Australian performance in relation to the subject of aid to underdeveloped countries. One comment was made on 27 May this year by the Australian Roman Catholic bishops who urged the Federal Government at a conference on that date 'to increase overseas aid contributions by what amounts to at least $50m each year until 1985'. The report of that statement by the bishops continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The bishops, . . . voted unanimously for a motion calling on the Government to spend 0.7 per cent of the gross national product on overseas aid by 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the goals set by the Brandt Commission on economic relations between rich and poor countries. The Fraser Government committed Australia five years ago to 0.7 per cent of GNP as its desired level of foreign aid. </PARA>
<PARA> But the allocation has fallen from 0.56 per cent in 1974-75 to 0.46 per cent in 1976-77 and 0.43 per cent this year. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, for 1981. That is an interesting promise which is sometimes lost sight of in the great welter of abandoned promises of 1975 relating to wage indexation, Medibank, standards of living, the Prices Justification Tribunal and all those things which were the subject of promises by the present Fraser Government before it came to power and which, of course, have been drawn increasingly to the attention of the Australian people as the distribution of wealth in Australia changes from day to day, under this Government, in favour of the wealthier section of the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Senator Baume, like all parliamentarians-wealthy people in Australia, let us not forget-belonging I would think to the top 2 per cent of income earners. However, it is of the 98 per cent that I speak. The question of overseas aid has, in a sense, been lost sight of amid that welter of promises because there are not in Australia enough people who are personally aggrieved, except as a matter of concience, by declining development aid as compared with the numbers of people who are personally aggrieved by changes in the health insurance systems, higher taxation, lower pensions and the like. Such things personally aggrieve people in our society. A decline in our performance regarding overseas aid does not personally aggrieve people to the same extent, but the fact is that to the shame of this country that promise was broken with all the others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Brandt report on international development issues was published in February 1980, but neither the Prime Minister despite his rhetoric overseas nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) made any significant public comment about it untill early this year, some 12 months later. An article by Mr John Langmore which was published in Lobby draws attention to that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> One might also ask what has happened to the Australian Development Assistance Bureau, which has been the subject of some discussions in the Canberra Times. In an article which appeared on 23 August the following appeared:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Budget papers show that the Government has decided on a decrease of nearly 9 per cent in the staffing of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau, the body which administers the aid program. </PARA>
<PARA> The average employment numbers of ADAB will fall from 481 last financial year to 439 in 1982. The heaviest cut will be in the policy, training and organisations division, which will fall from 356 to 313. </PARA>
<PARA>I just draw attention to the contrast between the rhetoric of the Fraser Government when the Prime Minister is overseas and its performance when he is in Australia in relation to aid for underdeveloped countries. That performance is illustrated by the cuts in the Australian Development Assistance Bureau and the actual decline in funds made available. There is an awful, yawning gulf between the heavy rhetoric of the Prime Minister overseas at the University of South Carolina and what the Government actually does. It is that matter that we want particularly to draw to the attention of the Senate and to the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the generally dreary Budget scene, as seen from almost every point of view, it is a pleasure for the Australian Democrats to be able to praise the Government for making a small but responsible initial effort in the matter of foreign aid. We hope that eventually Australia will reach the stage where it will hold the place that it should in the world. As one of the wealthier countries Australia should be one of the major donor nations. The effort needed to reach that stage will be a large one. We have not moved very far along that path but at least we can say that we have made a small beginning. It is said that the longest journey begins with a single step and certainly the Australian Democrats look forward to the Government increasing its foreign aid again in real terms next year. There will then be no Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting or anything of the sort and if the Government continues to increase foreign aid we will all be able to say that it is levelling and has taken a permanent step in the right direction; that the trend evident in recent years, which has been a disgrace to this country, has been reversed. I repeat, let us hope that happens and that next year Australia's effort comes closer to those of the world's more compassionate, enlightened and indeed civilised nations, which give close to one per cent of their gross domestic product in foreign aid. That proportion is virtually twice what Australia now gives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This year Australia's foreign aid has increased by 18 per cent. That sounds great. However, in considering this increase one must allow for an erosion of values by double figure inflation. I think we are all agreed that that is so. It takes a lot of shine off the 18 per cent increase. Also, the rise is not particularly great. It takes us from 0.43 per cent of GDP to 0.5 per cent, which is hardly enough to make major headlines. We can contrast that with the contribution of the Netherlands which, in 1970, gave slightly less in percentage terms of its gross doemestic product than did Australia. In that year we gave 0.62 per cent and the Netherlands gave 0.61 per cent. The Netherlands now gives 0.99 per cent and Denmark, Norway and Sweden-which are civilised and enlightened countries, with prosperous socieities-are all ahead of us in that regard. Australia is now down at the lower end of the scale. It is also interesting to note that the United Kingdom gives in foreign aid 0.34 per cent of its GDP and that the United States gives 0.27 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, Australia's foreign aid includes its grants to Papua New Guinea which reflect, I suggest, a high degree of self-interest and a national obligation to a former colony. If we deduct them from the total, our foreign aid will be seen to be amongst the lowest in the world. Thus, our cause for self-congratulation is perhaps not as great as one might imagine. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is in a very special situation in regard to overseas aid. I refer to our location in the world. In our region of Asia a thousand million people are suffering or deprived and confronted with the most pressing problems. I suggest that their eventual fate and degree of prosperity are linked with our own. I think particularly of Indonesia, a country which is thought to be oil rich and which has a 6 per cent growth in GDP annually, yet even Indonesia has enormous problems in regard to starvation, malnutrition, education and disease. We heard recently that certain foreign aid had been devoted to the providing of clinics for Indonesian generals who suffered from heart attacks. That may be a reasonable thing to do but it almost makes one believe that we ought to attach some strings to our aid to these countries so that it will be spent on the poorer sections and not directed to the urbanised, perhaps English-speaking, section which so many from Western countries find so easy to get on and communicate with. I believe that we tend to lose touch with the people who really need help. We must watch that very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button quoted from an editorial in the Canberra Times of 21 August which was entitled 'The politics of caring'. I, too, was delighted to see that editorial. It was an indication at least that one newspaper in Australia thought it an issue worth raising; that we should consider our attitudes, our view of the world, and indeed our reputation in the world. I hope that the honourable senator will forgive me if he has already quoted the following passage, but in any event, it is worth repeating:</PARA>
<PARA> The economic problems of one rich country, like Australia, are not the responsibility of other, poorer countries. They should not be expected to suffer because of Australian problems, especially when what they are given, in any case, is so tiny a part of Australia's means. But, then they have no votes for Australian politicans, and generally, their international pressure is slight just because their people are poor and their governments vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that the Canberra Times has a point there, one that of all people we in this chamber should take into consideration. In this context, it is a stark and ugly fact that the world is spending $600 billion each year on arms. Whilst the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) has been critical of the Soviet attitude on providing aid to lesser developed countries, it should be pointed out that, according to the figures, the Western world supplies more arms to those countries than does the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. I am looking at figures for 1976, in which it was estimated that the USSR supplied the less developed countries with $14 billion in arms whereas the United States of America supplied them with $20 billion in arms. Of course, this does not take into account arms supplies from other Western countries such as Britain, France or the Netherlands. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of foreign aid has a strong implication for our foreign policy generally. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has fully supported President Reagan who, the Australian Democrats believe, is sending up the temperature in super-power relations. In doing so, for whatever reasons-I am not disputing his reasons at the moment-he is contributing to a massive and continuing diversion of resources into the arms race and away from aid which is desperately needed. The inevitable consequence is a total waste when we could be seeking to reduce tensions and free more funds for aid programs. This release of tensions is the solution the world really needs. Indeed, it represents the only possible way in which foreign aid efforts could feasibly deal with the vast problems of the world, the enormous increasing disparity between the poor and the rich nations. </PARA>
<PARA> The world is becoming a worse and worse place, in which life expectancy is falling and in which ancient, persistent, debilitating and eventually killing diseases such as malaria, which 20 years ago it was hoped we would eliminate, are again on the increase. The world situation is becoming worse. It is a fact that millions of people, mostly babies and young children, die every year from starvation and the diseases associated with malnutrition. These things have been said so often that, as with road accident statistics, after a while they appear to be cliches. It is tragic that this should be the case. Perhaps it makes it all the more necessary that from time to time they should be brought back into the focus of our attention. Again, I applaud the Canberra Times for its editorial. At least it has raised this issue, which it knows is not an easy one to raise as it is natural and human to want to shy away from unpalatable facts. The real tragedy is that the facts do not and will not go away. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I conclude my remarks on this paper by urging the Government to reconsider the effect it is having on world tensions. We do not want the Government to make dramatic changes. We do not want it to go to President Reagan and say: 'Throw away all your arms.' We are looking for something small but significant. If we do our best to strive, in our own small way as a middle power, for global attitudes that will allow less to be spent on arms we will meet the point that has been made so many times, that only very small decreases in world spending on arms will provide the means to improve vastly the lives of hundreds of millions of people and indeed will preserve life itself for millions more. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I inform the Senate that I have received a report from the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies on the social impact of uranium mining on Northern Territory Aboriginals for the six-month period ending 31 March 1981. I now present that report and seek leave to make a statement concerning some of the issues raised in it. At the end of the statement I shall move that the Senate take note of the statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The present report comes in seven parts and it is about twice as long as the previous report. It deals with a great range of topics, on some of which I wish to comment. First, I note that the Institute project team is continuing its wide ranging studies of the social environment in the Alligator Rivers Region. When the material relating to this environment has been collected and properly processed, it will provide a comprehensive picture of the social situation of Aboriginal society in the region. This picture will enable the responsible bodies to gauge the rate and nature of the changes that are taking place in the social environment and to take appropriate steps to confine as much as possible any adverse changes and to enhance as much as possible any positive ones. In pursuing this objective the propect team is gathering base line data on a number of topics, including the history of the Alligator Rivers Region and its people, the range of laws affecting people in the region from 1863 to the present, Aboriginal diet, Aboriginal languages used in the region, the ecology of the region, and the changing social cultural patterns in the region. The project team has also conducted population censuses in the region and compiled community profiles for Oenpelli and a number of neighbouring communities. In accordance with its commission for operating in the region, the project team has also brought to notice a number of contemporary developments in the region that are affecting the social environment of Aboriginals there. Honourable senators should be aware that, in considering and acting upon these comments by the project team, I also have the benefit of advice from officers of my own Department in the region, as well as reports from other Commonwealth and Territory departments. I also have the benefit of some first-hand observation of the situation and of my consultation with Aboriginal representatives from the region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One issue that the project team raises relates to the low level of Aboriginal employment in mining and allied operations in the region. I certainly have no intention of inveigling Aboriginals into employment that they do not want; but I am interested in ensuring that employment opportunities are opened for Aboriginals to the extent that they do want jobs, and that training opportunities are available to enable them to take up the opportunities in employment. There are, in fact, moves in hand to expand both training and employment facilities for Aboriginals. The Department of Employment and Youth Affairs is already conducting training programs for Aboriginals, and that Department is to engage in a full appraisal of employment opportunities in the region. Other moves include work oriented adult education programs for Aboriginals and a training and employment program by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service for Aboriginal rangers. But I am not satisfied that government and industry alike are unable to do more in this direction and I hope that, by the time I present the next Institute report, I will be able to detail to honourable senators further substantive progress in the fields of employment and training. </PARA>
<PARA> In its last report, the project team highlighted what it saw as a serious deficiency in the levels of Aboriginal involvement in the management of the Kakadu National Park. In the present report, the project team recognises that the Gagudju Association serves as a point of consultation and notes that two Aboriginal women are among the most recent intake of trainee rangers. Apart from having Aboriginals on the park staff, the ANPWS engages in consultation with interested Aboriginal bodies on management matters. Honourable senators should also note that the Northern Land Council is represented on the park advisory committee, and that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has sought the advice of the same Council-an all-Aboriginal body-to assist him in the selection of the prime ministerial nominee to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I now wish to turn to the subject of alcohol-related problems mentioned by the project team, as well as by other bodies whose reports I have received. It is important to give this problem adequate attention, but at the same time not to exaggerate its prevalence or effect. The project team notes:</PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that the mining operation at Nabarlek has not created this situation. </PARA>
<PARA>The project team also notes that the company operating at Nabarlek, Queensland Mines Ltd, polices beer sales with great vigour. These views are supported by other bodies operating in the region. The Northern Territory police, for example, noted that drink related offences were occurring prior to uranium mining commencing and that they had not increased significantly since then. Nevertheless, I am concerned at the fact, reported by the Institute, that the past six months have seen a number of traffic deaths attributable to alcohol in the region. The problem associated with alcohol consumption is being dealt with at several levels. The standing committee on the social impact-on which both government and Aboriginal bodies are represented-is looking at ways of dealing with the matter, and the Aboriginal organisations in the region are themselves taking steps to control the problem by acquiring existing outlets, with Commonwealth financial assistance, and by imposing sale and consumption restrictions at these outlets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Institute report refers to administrative problems that are still being faced by local Aboriginals. In part, these problems are related to the lack of administrative structures for the handling of income from the Ranger and Nabarlek projects. When I tabled the last report by the Institute, I referred to progress that had been made in this matter through the establishment of a new Aboriginal organisation, the Gagudju Association, for the express purpose of receiving, administering, and disbursing cash income from the Ranger project. This Association has proved to be of great assistance in overcoming some of the administrative problems associated with the Ranger payments. In the half year period covered by the Institute report, my Department has seconded an officer to the Gagudju Association, at its request, to assist it in its administrative and financial dealings. At the same time, work has progressed in the establishment of another organisation, tentatively called the West Arnhem Organisation, which will serve the same functions as the Gagudju Association but in relation to income from the Nabarlek project. The administrative and financial problems previously experienced by Aboriginals in the region have also been mitigated, in the period covered by the Institute report, through the upgrading of banking facilities at Oenpelli. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will note references in the Institute's report to what the Institute sees as an inadequate level of consultation with, and information flow to, local Aboriginals on the developments that are taking place in the region. It is my view that there can always be room for improvement in this particular aspect. I believe, however-and the project team notes-that there has already been a significant and general improvment in this field of endeavour in the period under review. Efforts are being made to consult with Aboriginals in the region and to keep them fully informed of new and forthcoming developments by a number of bodies operating in the region. Officers of my Department, who are stationed in the region, provide Aboriginals with video film and sound cassette material on these developments. My Department has also prepared and distributed to the Northern Land Council and to other interested parties, a simplified version of the legislation affecting Aboriginals in the region. The Commonwealth Department of Home Affairs and Environment has prepared and distributed its own simplified material relating to the environmental impacts of the Koongarra project and of the Jabiluka project. Similarly, explanatory material prepared especially for Aboriginals in the region has been prepared by Noranda Australia Ltd and by Pancontinental Mining Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> But it is not only by publications and audio and visual facilities that we are approaching the task of consultation and information for Aboriginals. On an initiative by my Department, there have been monthly meetings of the Ranger Liaison Commission which has representation from the NLC and from Energy Resources of Australia Ltd. At the same time, the Department of the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory has re-established a Cross-cultural Communications Section with a view to improving communications between the Northern Territory Government and the local Aboriginal community. Most importantly, the Northern Land Council and local Aboriginal communities are well represented on the Standing Committee on the Social Impact, which is the main executive and co-ordinating body involving Territory and Commonwealth governments and Aboriginals in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the main, though not all, problems referred to by the Institute. I am heartened by the overall assessment of the project team when it states:</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of Western perceptions, the physical impact of the two existing mining projects has been less calamitous than many people had feared. The monitoring activities of the Supervising Scientist offer assurances that there have been no contamination or other gross disturbances of the environment. And, to date, no significant disturbance to land or sites outside of mining areas has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>At the same time, I note that the project team is not satisfied that enough has been done to fulfil the aim enunciated in the Ranger Enquiry Second Report, 1977, which recommended that 'There should be a deliberate and comprehensive programme to minimise adverse social effects and to assist them in coping with . . . stresses . . . and in taking advantage of any benefits accruing to them'. The report ends with the recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA> That all future mining and exploration be subject to appropriate Aboriginal concurrence, and that before any such approval is given, the Aborigines concerned be briefed fully as to all the implications that could possibly be foreseen. </PARA>
<PARA>As to the briefing, I am confident that a better than adequate amount of information on developments and their implications is already reaching the Aboriginal community concerned. And as to the concurrence, this is already embodied in legislation that governs mining activities in the Alligator Rivers Region. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition welcomes the appearance of this report to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) on the Social Impact of Uranium Mining on Northern Territory Aboriginals. We recognise the initiative in having the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies carry out this monitoring work to be very important and unique, I think, in terms of documenting social change for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. I welcome the Minister's statement on the report although it does seem to me that at this stage the Minister is perhaps putting too favourable an interpretation on what the report has to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the matter of Aboriginal unemployment, as the Minister has pointed out, the report comments on the low level of Aboriginal employment in mining and allied operations and strengthens the Opposition's claim that little benefit has flowed or will flow to Aboriginal people through employment in the uranium industry. The Opposition welcomes the Minister's statement that the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs is to engage in a full appraisal of employment opportunities for Aboriginals in the region. However, the Minister's comments on inveigling Aboriginals into employment they do not wish seem somewhat misplaced. The report puts forward several hypotheses to explain the low level of Aboriginal employment such as: That mining companies have not really tried hard to employ Aboriginals; that mines represent unpleasant social situations dominated by non-Aboriginals and therefore Aboriginals avoid such situations despite financial inducement; and most importantly, that Aboriginals are unwilling to accept menial employment on their own land. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth re-stating the figures from the last social impact report of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies which revealed that a total of only 12 Aboriginals are employed at Ranger and Nabarlek-11 in bush regeneration programs and one as an office worker. Unless the Minister and the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs in their appraisal of the situation tackle the underlying problems identified by the AIAS team the situation will not improve. The report states on page 87 that a low level of Aboriginal employment in the uranium mining industry is likely to remain 'unless there is some radical rethinking which goes beyond the provision of labouring jobs and vague training schemes'. I can only strongly endorse that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister in his speech also commented on the training and employment being provided for Aboriginals by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service in the Kakadu National Park. The Opposition is delighted by the successful implementation of Aboriginal employment programs in the Kakadu National Park and especially by the employment of two women trainees. However, this, I must point out, is in no way a consequence of uranium mining. I find curious the Minister's comment that he hopes to be able to report further substantive progress in employment and training at the presentation of the next AIAS report because reports to date clearly indicate that there has been no substantive progress so far. </PARA>
<PARA> On the role of Aboriginals in executive decision making in the Kakadu National Park, the report suggested that whilst consultation on technical aspects of park management was occurring, the role of Aboriginals in making policy decisions about the park was minimal. That is a situation which is most unsatisfactory to the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Another cause for very serious concern by the Federal Opposition is the impact of alcohol on the communities in the Kakadu region. The Minister, whilst not wishing to exaggerate the prevalence or effect of this problem, notes the report's observation that the mining operation at Nabarlek has not created the situation. That is quite true. However, the report makes clear that the quite drastic health and social problems created by the introduction of alcohol into Aboriginal communities are directly attributable to the changes mining has brought with it, such as more vehicles, improved roads, increasing numbers of business and social trips to Darwin and access to more ready cash. I must make it quite clear that I am not suggesting Aboriginals should not have these things. However, it needs to be clearly recognised that their rapid introduction by the establishment of mining in the area has greatly escalated the problem of Aboriginal alcohol abuse. Consequences during the past six months include the first three road deaths on the Oenpelli-Nabarlek road. The report indicates little, if any, progress on effective means of dealing with the problem of alcohol abuse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs interjects that they are not on their own in having that problem. We in this chamber are well aware of that matter because we have addressed ourselves to it constantly, but we are discussing a particular report and a particular community. I simply stress that although it cannot be argued that mining causes the alcohol problem it is certainly clear to me from my reading of the report that the changes that mining brings with it certainly aggravate the alcohol problem. That is something we must face up to and take into account. On the matter of administrative structures for the handling of income from mining developments, here the Institute does have some progress to report. While problems still exist, the formation of the Gagadju Association and the provision of banking facilities at Oenpelli are reported to have greatly assisted in overcoming difficulties experienced previously in connection with Ranger. The Opposition is certainly glad to hear this and welcomes the proposal for the formation of a West Arnhem organisation to assist with the handling of income from Nabarlek.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the matter of adequate consultation and information flow to Aboriginals within the Kakadu region, the Opposition notes the Institute's concern that there is inadequate consultation with local Aboriginals. However, the Minister's response raises the possibility of a situation where Aboriginals are bombarded with glossy publications, films and cassettes-some of them from mining companies-which could stress one point of view, for example, the material benefits of mining, at the expense of another point of view, that is, the social costs of mining. I stress that I have not seen the material in question and raise this point only because there did not appear to be a clear definition in the Minister's statement as to the distinction between propaganda and consultation. I think that the Institute's emphasis is on more consultation and particularly on more time spent by mining companies and bureaucrats listening to Aboriginal people-not the reverse. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 19 the report comments on the inadequate resources available to the Institute's project. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The resources available to the Project are very meagre in comparison with those available to the Supervising Scientist, or, for that matter, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in the Alligator Rivers region. Yet the dimensions of the task confronting the Project are in no way less extensive. The Project must either attempt to reduce its scope or seek additional resources. </PARA>
<PARA>I recommend that additional resources be made available. On the matter of physical impact, I was somewhat taken aback that the Minister would stand up before the Senate this evening and say that he was heartened by the report's assessment that there had been 'no contamination or other gross disturbance of the environment'. That is from page 86 of the report. I remind the Senate and the Minister that the revelations over recent days of a leak of radioactive water from the run-off pond at the Nabarlek mine into nearby creeks have horrifying implications for the Aboriginal people who hunt on, fish and take water from these creeks. Allegations of insufficient monitoring of levels of radioactivity and of an attempted cover-up by the company involved make the situation even more disturbing. It appears that, but for the probing of the Northern Territory member for Arnhem, Mr Bob Collins, the leak which occurred in March may never have come to light. </PARA>
<PARA> The information raises some pertinent questions for Aboriginal people in the Kakadu region. How many other leaks may have taken place and have been concealed by those with a vested interest in uranium mining? How many future leaks are likely? What deleterious effects is this leak likely to have on the health of people in the Nabarlek region? I believe the Minister would be derelict in his duty if he did not immediately instigate an investigation into the possible effects on the health of the Aboriginal people concerned. I urge him to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I must say that we welcome the report. We welcome this monitoring function which is obviously being carried out with great competence by the Institute. We endorse the Government's decision to have this monitoring considered over a period. However, I hope that the Minister will pay some attention to the points that I have raised, particularly with regard to employment, training and the alcohol problem. The value of these reports is not only in making information available to the Senate and to Australia generally about what is happening in the Northern Territory but also in providing the data on which policies to remedy the various deficiencies can be formulated. I hope that that will in fact be the long term effect of the reports which are presented to us. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Norfolk Island Act 1979 to provide for the appointment of a Chief Judge of the Supreme Court of Norfolk Island. </PARA>
<PARA> Sub-section 52 (2) of the Act provides that the Supreme Court of Norfolk Island shall consist of a Judge or Judges appointed in accordance with the Act. Present appointments to the Court are Mr Justice Dunphy and Mr Justice Evatt. </PARA>
<PARA> It is consistent with the state of constitutional development of Norfolk Island to bring the constitution of the Court into line with the Supreme Courts of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory by providing for a Chief Judge. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity is also being taken to provide that future appointees as Judges of the Norfolk Island Supreme Court shall retire from that Court at age 70 whether or not they are at present obliged to retire at that age from another Court. This is consistent with Government policy on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also desirable to make it clear in the legislation, as was the original intention of Section 53 of the Act, that a Judge of the Supreme Court of Norfolk Island ceases to be a Judge of the Court if he ceases to be a Judge of another Court created by the Parliament. This provision, like the retirement at age 70 provision, will not apply to Judges currently appointed to the Norfolk Island Supreme Court. </PARA>

<PARA>Senators will be aware that the Export Development Grants Board, established under the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974 is responsible for the administration of that Act and the Export Expansion Grants Act 1978.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity to speak to these money Bills. Firstly, as a fellow South Australian I offer to you, Mr President, my congratulations on your election as President of the Senate. I hope that you carry on in the same fine traditions as your predecessor who was also a fellow South Australian. Because of the shortage of time on the last day of the last session of this Parliament, I, among many other senators, was unable to take part in the valedictory speeches. I was unable to pay tribute to some of my colleagues, particularly Senator Cavanagh and Senator Bishop who were South Australian senators from my own party. I intend to take a few moments of the Senate's time to do so now. I want to place on record my deep gratitude to both these people in my own party who rose from the ranks of the workers in South Australia to be elected to the Senate and who went on to become Ministers of the Crown. They served this country and the Parliament with great distinction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I well remember just 10 years ago when I first came into the Senate that Senator Cavanagh was able to teach me a very good lesson which I have not forgotten. That lesson was that one should always be prepared in this place to stand up for the rights of the underdog. I think Senator Cavanagh is on record as having done that on a great many occasions. I can also remember that as a new senator I was a little verbal, I suppose in the wrong places, and I got myself into trouble. It was Senator Cavanagh who came to my rescue. I always appreciated that. I want to place on record a fine tribute to both of these gentlemen, who are now under the title of 'Mr' in private life, for the service they rendered to the Commonwealth as Ministers and to the electorates of South Australia. I will be referring to Senator Cavanagh in some other remarks I want to make later on in my speech about a different subject. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to place on record also my thanks to former Senator Sir Condor Laucke. I did not have the opportunity to pass any remarks about him in the Senate but I did write to him congratulating him on his allowing dress reform in the Senate. That is something for which I had been pushing in the Senate for a great number of years. Some honourable senators who were in this place will remember that three senators-namely, Senator Keeffe, our ex-Whip Senator Poyser and I-tried to go right to the extreme in dress reform many years ago when we wore shorts into the Senate. That did not last long. Due to circumstances we did not try that again because we were afraid of what might have happened to the then incumbent of the chair. A member of our own party had been elected to the presidency and we did not want to embarrass him. However, I was able to go part of the way towards bringing about some dress reform in the Senate when former Senator Sir Condor Laucke, in his wisdom, took no objection to senators appearing in this place without the encumbrance of lassoos around their necks, namely, neckties. I have expressed to him my appreciation by way of letter and I now want to place on record that, not having to be trussed up in a necktie, I feel much more comfortable when I go out of this place at night. I do not suffer with as many headaches as I did when I used to wear a necktie in this place. I want to place on public record my gratitude to former Senator Sir Condor Laucke for allowing that to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to place on record also my gratitude to former Senator Sir Condor Laucke in his capacity as President for always granting a person an audience if someone went to him with problems which affected the staff of this Parliament. Former Senator Sir Condor Laucke is renowned for having been a very good employer of labour in his own private business, and he carried that through to the Senate. He was aways prepared to listen to and try to put right the grievances of members of parliament, and particularly Senate staff and people employed in the dining room. I say again that I am grateful to him for always lending an ear to the problems of others. I hope that our current President, Senator Young, will be as amenable as former Senator Sir Cordon Laucke was. I was going to congratulate my colleague Senator McClelland on his election as Deputy President, but he did not remain long in the chair so I will have to leave that for another day.</PARA>
<PARA> The other matter to which I want to refer has received a lot of publicity in the Press in the last few days. I refer to the biography which has been written by a couple of people in Adelaide. It is a biography entitled 'Oliphant'. I would not have mentioned this matter in the Senate, but I happened to get a mention in last Thursday's Adelaide News. It appears to me as though somebody has leaked a letter written by me to Governor Oliphant. To get the matter into proper perspective I wish to quote from the Adelaide News of last week. An article by Tony Baker in the Adelaide News of Thursday, 20 August says, in part, that Cockburn and Henderson revealed that the Governor was getting advice from another source that might have angered the Government; that is, the Dunstan Labor Government in South Australia. The article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> They quote a memo from his private secretary, then Mr Dick Henderson, saying: 'The State Government's tendencies to regard Government House as a subsidiary of the Premier's Department must, I believe, be strongly resisted. </PARA>
<PARA>That was said in last Thursday's Adelaide News. It is attributed to Mr Dick Henderson, who was Governor Oliphant's secretary. I will now refer to the Australian of Thursday, 8 August 1974, which quotes what Mr Henderson said. The article mentions Sir Mark, so I will use that term although honourable senators will be aware that I never use titles. However, to put the matter into its proper perspective I have to quote the article correctly. The policy of the Australian Labor Party is that it does not believe in imperial titles. I never use them- Hansard knows that-unless I stress the fact when I am quoting from an article. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>Some MPs also believe Sir Mark has been rebuffed by the Government in seeking a person with military background to succeed his private secretary, Mr Richard Henderson. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Henderson, a former army captain, yesterday discounted suggestions that Sir Mark was having difficulties with the Premier, Mr Dunstan. </PARA>
<PARA> 'There have been occasions when the Governor, not sure what the Government reaction would be to action he intended, has advised his ministers. On every occasion they have told him to do what he believed was best. There has been no interference at all.'</PARA>
<PARA>That article appeared in the Australian on 8 August 1974. It was attributed to Mr Henderson, the Governor's private secretary, and it stated that there was no interference from the Dunstan Government or its Ministers. Yet here we find Tony Baker writing an article in the Adelaide News of last Thursday in which he said that in fact there were some problems. Following on what I have just read, that article states:</PARA>
<PARA>Then there was the row with two Labor Senators, Mr Cavanagh, then Aboriginal Affairs Minister, and Mr McLaren. </PARA>
<PARA> Invited to a Queen's Birthday reception at Government House, they objected to black tie or full evening dress. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Mark personally wrote back objecting to their objections. 'Courtesy and human dignity are important aspects of life,' he said in part. </PARA>
<PARA>In today's Advertiser at page 8 we find remarks attributed to the ex-Governor in the launching of his book yesterday. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>In interviews after the launching Sir Mark agreed raising the possibility of Mr Dunstan's leaking the letters could appear to be 'mud slinging'. </PARA>
<PARA>I am one who agrees with that. I do not know why he raised that at all. The article further states:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Yes, it is, but it was told to me and, like those letters, it was part of the story,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> He had no idea of the source of the letter and thought it 'extremely unlikely' it could have come from one of his former staff members. </PARA>
<PARA>What I am interested to know is who gave the letter which I wrote to the Governor and the one which he wrote to me to Mr Cockburn to refer to in his book. To put the record straight, so that nobody in the community in Australia will be left in any doubt as to what the contents of both of those letters were, I will read them to the Senate. Many people must be wondering, having seen part of my letter to the Governor-I do not know what Senator Cavanagh wrote-appearing in last Thursday's Adelaide News. I read first the invitation which I received. It is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>IN HONOUR OF THE BIRTHDAY OF HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN</PARA>
<PARA>His Excellency The Governor and Lady Oliphant</PARA>
<PARA>request the pleasure of the company of</PARA>
<PARA>Senator and Mrs G. T. McLaren</PARA>
<PARA>at a Reception</PARA>
<PARA>on Wednesday, 19th June, 1974, at 8.30 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA>Full Evening Dress, Dinner Jacket or Uniform The Answer is Requested Decorations to the Aide De Camp  Carriages 10.00 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA>Please bring this card with you</PARA>
<PARA>I replied to the aide-de-camp on 27 May, just a day or two after I received that letter. I wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>The Aide-De-Camp,</PARA>
<PARA>His Excellency. The Governor,</PARA>
<PARA>Sir Mark Oliphant,</PARA>
<PARA>Government House,</PARA>
<PARA>North Terrace,</PARA>
<PARA>Adelaide, S.A. 5000</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir, Thank you for the invitation to attend the reception on Wednesday June 19th in Honour of the Birthday of Her Majesty the Queen. </PARA>
<PARA> As an elected representative of the average Australian Citizen, I regret that owing to the mode of dress stipulated on the invitation I will be unable to attend. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA>Geoff McLaren  ALP Senator for S.A.</PARA>
<PARA>Under date of 30 May 1974, I received the following letter:</PARA>
<PARA>Government House, Adelaide, South Australia 30th May, 1974.</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator McLaren,</PARA>
<PARA> I am surprised that you have refused our invitation to be present at the Queen's Birthday Reception because of the dress signified as appropriate for the occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> You will be interested to know that not a single person, other than you and Senator Cavanagh, has objected, although the list of citizens attending covers the whole spectrum of people in South Australia. Many have been invited through more than 20 local mayors. I have made a point of issuing invitations to dinners and other formal occasions to officials of the trade unions, and have found that they and their wives, like so many other ordinary citizens, are glad of an opportunity to dress up. When Prince Philip was staying here, the Secretary of the Trades and Labour Council wore a dinner jacket, and his wife a long frock. It is significant, also, that the invitations to a dinner given by the Labour Government of this State in honour of the Premier of Penang, specified that dinner jackets were to be worn. </PARA>
<PARA> I have endeavoured in every possible way to bring the office of Governor into closer contact with the people, in accordance with the wishes of the State Government. I have never refused to see any sane citizen who sought an interview, I have received officials of hundreds of citizen's organizations, have visited schools, homes for disadvantaged children and old people, hospitals, local councils throughout the State, St. John's Ambulance Brigades, and so on. My wife and I have received numberless debutantes at balls, have attended innumerable dinners organized by service clubs and citizen's groups, and have been present at church services of every denomination. We have made special efforts to support the Adelaide Festival of Arts, and cultural activities generally. I have spoken to more conferences and gatherings than I care to remember, refusing only those which it is impossible for me to accept. In the course of these duties, I must have welcomed at Government House over ten thousand citizens of the State, in all walks of life, and I have never found one who did not express pleasure and gratitude for having been invited here. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, therefore, most disappointing to be slapped in the face by two South Australian Senators. </PARA>
<PARA> We have ascertained that invitations to the Queen's Birthday Reception and to certain other formal occasions at Government House, Canberra, where ladies are present, specify full evening dress, i.e. white tie and tails. Moreover, your Prime Minister observes these formalities meticulously, as does the Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, and always will be, functions at which certain ceremonial and formal obligations are in order. I imagine that you would not wish to do away with all the formalities of the proceedings of Parliament, of the courts of law, of religious services, of the Anzac Day acts of homage to those who lost their lives in defence of their country. Nor could you abolish the rules which govern conduct in sports or on the race-course, on the roads, on sea or in the air. Courtesy and human dignity are important aspects of life. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government has conferred on Her Majesty the title ''Queen of Australia'', and this she has accepted. She opened the last session of the Parliament of Australia. While there is a Queen (or King) of Australia, she should be accorded at least the respect given the President of the United States, U.S.S.R., or any other republic. The one occasion in the year when we pay our respect to her is at the reception at Government House in honour of her birthday. No-one who attends this or any other function dressed decently in a lounge suit or short frock has ever been discriminated against in any way, but in acknowledgement of the fact that it is a formal occasion, at which most men and women will expect to wear formal clothes, a black tie is suggested on the invitation. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,  Mark Oliphant Governor. Senator G. McLaren,</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament of Australia-The Senate,</PARA>
<PARA>6 Third Street,</PARA>
<PARA>Murray Bridge,</PARA>
<PARA>S.A. 5253. </PARA>
<PARA> On 4 June 1974 I replied to the Governor in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>4/6/1974 His Excellency, The Governor,</PARA>
<PARA>Sir Mark Oliphant,</PARA>
<PARA>Government House,</PARA>
<PARA>North Terrace,</PARA>
<PARA>Adelaide, S.A. 5000</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for your letter of May 30th in which you express surprise at my refusal to accept your invitation to be present at the Queens Birthday Reception because of the dress signified on the invitation. </PARA>
<PARA> My refusal was in no way intended as a slap in the face as you have stated, in fact since your appointment to the position of Governor of South Australia I have frequently defended the way in which you have brought your office into closer contact with the people. </PARA>
<PARA> I have admired the manner in which you have been outspoken on many issues, and was indeed proud to march behind you in the Moratorium in Adelaide in protest against the Vietnam war. </PARA>
<PARA> I would point out that I protested to the Prime Minister's Department on the occasion of the Reception in Kings Hall following the Opening of the Parliament by Her Majesty the Queen of Australia, because invited guests were required to 'Dress up'. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I agree that there are many people who are glad of the opportunity to dress up I am also painfully aware that there are many more who cannot afford the necessities of life, and it is the people in this category who are my greatest concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I would hope that the people who have been responsible for electing me to serve them in the Senate would not judge me as lacking in Courtesy and Human Dignity because of my refusal to be attired in either a Dinner Suit of Dress Suit when I attend public functions as their representative. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I remain an elected servant of the Australian people I will continue in my efforts to break down the antiquated barriers of protocol which were deliberately designed to perpetuate 'Colonialism'. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,  Geoff McLaren A.L.P. Senator for South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>That was my reply to the then Governor of South Australia, Governor Oliphant. I would not have mentioned this matter in public had somebody not leaked these letters to these two characters who have written this biography entitled Oliphant. The Life and Times of Sir Mark Oliphant. I have no time for one of the authors, Cockburn. He interfered in the poultry industry in South Australia when I was very active in the industry. He wrote a few articles which did not do the industry any good. He also castigated the Dunstan Labor Government over the Salisbury affair. He is one of these people who like to stir the pot. I often wonder whether he was always right. He likes to attract an audience. Somebody has given him those letters. Mark Oliphant dropped a little remark that they might have been leaked by Don Dunstan. Then he had second thoughts about that. I think it was Cockburn who said yesterday that it was not anyone from Dunstan's office or anyone associated with Dunstan who leaked them. I certainly did not leak them, but I have made them public now. </PARA>
<PARA> The people can judge for themselves whether I was correct in refusing an invitation to dress up in a monkey suit and attend a reception at Government House in Adelaide. I use those words because they were the words used by the Governor, according to some of my colleagues, who had to present him with the Address-in-Reply. I think one of my colleagues was in a safari suit. The other, like myself, probably did not have a tie on, but I think he was suitably dresed for the climate we live in. I understand that they were told that if the Governor had to be attired in a monkey suit, he did not see why they should not be attired in the same sort of rig. That is the decision they took. I took my decision, and I stick by it. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, dressing up in monkey suits, claw-hammer coats and bullet-proof shirts, looking like a cockroach with a headache, and strutting around in all this finery is a hangover from the old colonial days. A lot of people in the community still like to get around done up like that. They do not represent ordinary, decent Australians. They have such large egos that I guarantee if they went to buy hats they would not be able to buy any big enough to put on top of their skulls. All they want are the fripperies and fineries. They have no concern at all for the people in need in this country. They could not care less about them. I pointed out to Governor Oliphant that that was my concern and that I sought election to the Parliament to try to do something for the ordinary person-and he referred to me also when he said that he thought ordinary people liked to dress up. I take no umbrage at that. I am an ordinary person and I have never tried to put myself forward as being anything else. I have always believed that I represent ordinary people, and I am proud to do so. If Governor Oliphant would like to advise me or one of the authors of the book as to who leaked those letters, I would be pleased to debate the matter with him. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall one other instance when I had to stick up for Mark Oliphant. Unfortunately, I do not have the Adelaide Advertiser with me, but I well recall many letters to the editor when Don Dunstan appointed Mark Oliphant as Governor. Many of the letters came from the blue rinse set in Adelaide, publicly stating that, because of the character of Mark Oliphant and his outspokenness, they would not accept invitations to garden parties at Government House. That is what they thought of him. On many occasions I stood up in public and defended him because I thought at least he brought something to the office and would earn his keep. I have always said, and I still believe, that the position of Governor of a State is an unnecessary financial burden on the taxpayer and that the sooner it is done away with the better. We could get back to using people such as the Chief Secretary, who could easily do the job the Governor does. </PARA>
<PARA> I think I have managed to get off my chest my concern that some person, for a bit of cheap publicity, saw fit to leak a confidential letter between myself and the Governor of South Australia, probably to sell a few more issues of the book. I am very pleased that I have been able to take the opportunity to let the general public know the full contents of the correspondence between myself and Governor Oliphant. Members of the public will have no doubts about what was in the correspondence. They can read it in Hansard. If the Press picks up the matter and reports it, the public can read about it in full tomorrow. Those are the types of tricks that some authors use to sell books and get some cheap publicity. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator Durack</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The daily fees paid to counsel in the proceedings known as the social security conspiracy case vary according to the time spend by each counsel on the case. Three counsel are paid at an hourly rate of $36.50 per hour up to a daily maximum of $292.00 per day. When one of these counsel is required to assist Senior Counsel in Court it has been agreed that he may charge $425.00 for a period in Court in excess of 3 hours on any one day and $212.50 for a period in Court of less than 3 hours on any one day. One Counsel is paid at the rate of $43.75 per hour up to a maximum of $437.50 per day. Daily limits of $710.00, $885.00 and $1,070.00 have been agreed in relation to the other three counsel in the case.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Information concerning these payments has previously been made available to Senate Estimates Committee 'B' (Hansard, Supplementary Information September 1979, pages 807-8, Hansard, Supplementary Information April 1980, page 474, Hansard 3 September 1980, page 373) and to Senate Estimates Committee 'A' (Hansard, 27 April 1981, page 17).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Mr Rofe, Q.C. and Mr J. R. T. Wood, Q.C. were briefed on behalf of the Commonwealth, Commonwealth officers or statutory corporations during 1979 and 1980 in matters other than the proceedings known as the Social Security Conspiracy Case. I have answered questions concerning Mr Rofe previously-see House of Representatives questions No. 3603 (Hansard 22 November 1979, pages 3451-2), No. 5459 (Hansard 19 August 1980, page 401) and No. 287 (Hansard 10 March 1981, page 625). In the absence of a clear definition of the reasons why information concerning that amounts paid to Mr J. R. T. Wood, Q.C. in respect of these other matters is sought and as the information has not been previously disclosed, the publication of the information would be inappropriate (Senate Hansard 16 September 1980 at pages 1109-1120). I understand that Mr Wood has also been briefed in a number if matters against the Commonwealth and Commonwealth authorities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The environmental condition of the Finniss River and Rum Jungle regions is detailed in a report prepared by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission (AAEC) in September 1975 (Report AAEC/E365: Rum Jungle Environmental Studies). This report was based on extensive environmental studies undertaken by the AAEC and the then Department of the Northern Territory in the period 1973-1975. I understand that current environmental conditions remain as described in that report.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) I am advised that the Commonwealth Government provided in the 1980-81 Budget $200,000 to enable work to commence on a rehabilitation program for the Rum Jungle area including $140,000 for detailed site investigations.</PARA>
<PARA> Following an approach by the Chief Minister, Northern Territory, to the Prime Minister, the Commonwealth Government accepted in principle that the Territory should take responsibility for conducting the work. The Northern Territory Government has established an internal working party which is to prepare a report for that Government so that the Commonwealth can be advised of the standards to which rehabilitation is to be undertaken, the measures which are to be adopted, firm estimated costs and the time frame for undertaking the program. Commonwealth Department and Australian Atomic Energy Commission officers are providing information to the working party. Upon receipt of the report, the Commonwealth will then be in a position to consider the question of the level of funding.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) I am advised that there were no Aboriginal groups living in the area taken up by the Rum Jungle operation immediately before the operation commenced, that forced evacuation did not take place and compensation was not an issue.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Second Report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry made recommendations which dealt directly with the impact of the Ranger operation on the regional environment, including the drainage system likely to be affected by mining operations. These recommendations were accepted by the Government. 'Environmental Requirements for the Ranger Project' derived from the above recommendations have been included in Northern Territory legislation, in the mining authority and in the agreement between the Commonwealth and the Northern Land Council under which mining operations on the Ranger project are proceeding. A similar set of 'Environmental Requirements' apply to the Nabarlek Project.</PARA>
<PARA> No decision has yet been taken on the development of either the Koongarra or the Jabiluka deposits. Development approval for these projects would be considered by the Government only after the satisfactory completion of the necessary environmental procedures, compliance with the Government's foreign investment guidelines and the conclusion of satisfactory arrangements with the Aboriginal people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 14 May 1981 (Hansard, page 1968) Senator McIntosh asked the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is it a fact that a considerable part of the work of the environmental division of the Department of Home Affairs and Environment has been devoted, firstly, to assessing environmental impact statements for proposed uranium mines such as Jabiluka and, secondly, to provide Commonwealth leadership in setting up codes of practice for the uranium industry Australia-wide? Is the division to be reduced in size as a result of the razor gang decision to let the States control nuclear activities? Does the Minister agree on the need for an expert national body, analogous to the National Health and Medical Research Council, which could set nuclear standards?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The work of those parts of the Environment Division of the Department of Home Affairs and Environment which are concerned with the assessment of environmental impact statements and the development of uniform codes of practice will not be reduced as a consequence of the Government's decision that responsibility for the regulation and control of nuclear activities in Australia will be implemented as far as possible by the States and the Northern Territory, with the Commonwealth maintaining a co-ordinating role. This decision confirms the Government's policy that implementation of codes of practice should in general be the responsibility of State and Northern Territory governments. The Commonwealth Government will continue to assess environmentally significant uranium mining proposals for which Commonwealth decisions are required under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act and to develop codes of practice under the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act in close consultation with the States and the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of uranium mining operations in the Alligator Rivers Region, the Supervising Scientist continues to carry out his functions as laid down in the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act, including 'to devise and develop, and to promote and assist in the devising and development of . . . standards, practices and procedures in relation to uranium mining operations in the region for the protection of, or in so far as those standards practices and procedures affect, the environment in the region . . .'.</PARA>
<PARA> The implementation of radiation protection standards in Australia is the responsibility of Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory Governments. The Radiation Health Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH and MRC) recommends radiation protection standards in relation to human health aspects of radiation protection. This committee includes representatives from relevant Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory bodies. Nuclear codes of practice, developed under the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act on a co-operative basis by Commonwealth and State Governments, take into account the NH and MRC recommendations on radiation protection standards wherever appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> Since expert advice on radiation protection standards is already available to Government through the Radiation Health Committee there is no requirement to establish a new body for the setting of such standards.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 29 May 1981 (Hansard, page 2338) Senator Watson asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for the Capital Territory a question, without notice, seeking information regarding firearms legislation in the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for the Capital Territory has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that the Federal Government is only directly concerned with firearms control legislation in the Australian Capital Territory. The existing legislation controlling firearms in the Australian Capital Territory, the Gun Licence Ordinance 1937, was last amended in 1979. New legislation is proposed which will cover both firearms and certain other dangerous weapons and which will tighten controls considerably. Details of the legislation are still under discussion between officers of the Department of the Capital Territory and the Australian Federal Police. However, it is envisaged that the possession of firearms will be restricted to licensed persons, that all firearms will be required to be registered and that restrictions, beyond those in the existing legislation, will apply to the use of firearms in the Territory.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 11 June 1981 (Hansard, page 3024) Senator McLaren asked the Minister for Finance the following question, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question which is directed to the Minister for Finance, refers to Statutory Rule No. 127 gazetted on 30 May 1980 which authorised increases in export expansion grant payments to meat exporters for the years 1977-78 and 1978-79. Will the Minister for Finance confirm the estimates of the Department of Primary Industry that these increases were at a cost of some $20m? I further ask: For what reason were higher incentive payments authorised 11 months after meat ceased to be an eligible product for export grants? Why have the full details of the increases, such as the names of the recipients of this amount of money, never been publicly announced?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Trade and Resources, to whom the question was referred, has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Primary Industry has advised that it is unable to identify any basis for attributing to that Department the estimate of $20m referred to in the question. Statutory Rule No. 127 confers no benefits other than those intended at the time the legislation was enacted in 1978. The names of all recipients of export incentive grants made during a financial year are detailed in the Annual Report of the Export Development Grants Board for that year.</PARA>
