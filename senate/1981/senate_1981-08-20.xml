<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of the Northern Territory of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> The level of home ownership in Australia is falling as increasing costs, particularly interest rates on housing loans, continue to rise. High interest rates and the increasing difficulties in obtaining housing loan finance have combined to jeopardise the prospects for home ownership of many Australians.</PARA>
<PARA> Firm and positive action must be taken by the Federal Government to reduce interest rates on housing loans.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will initiate policies to lower interest rates on home loans and promote greater availability of finance for housing.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth do humbly pray that the Commonwealth government:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Uphold the principle that the seeds and cuttings of plants are a public resource and a common heritage to all and that accordingly seeds should be freely available to all, freely multipliable, able to be sold, exchanged, exported and imported by anyone who wishes. This is seen as a matter of national food security.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Recognize that plant breeding is a highly co-operative venture often involving private enterprise at the very last stages after basic seed collection, storage, and research has been publicly funded.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. In view of the aforementioned paragraphs, recognise that any system giving 'property' or ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises is inappropriate and unjust.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Recognise that legislation establishing plant patenting schemes overseas has had serious adverse effects namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) a slowing-down of scientific information exchange and exchanges in basic plant breeding materials, that is, germ plasm,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) subordination and/or curtailment of public breeding programs,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) farmer unrest at seed prices,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) monopoly control of seed production and sales has passed into the hands of giant petrochemical and drug corporations also marketing crop chemicals,</PARA>
<PARA> (v) increased uniformity of crop varieties leading to a vulnerability to pest and disease attack.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Reject any proposal to legislate for any system such as the drafted Plant Variety Rights Act, which gives exclusive ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I suppose the Minister's attention has been drawn to the evidence given by Mr Rupert Murdoch at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal that the person who leaked the contents of last year's Budget to Mr Laurie Oakes was a senior Cabinet Minister. In order to allay conjecture about the identity of this Minister, I ask the Minister whether he will be good enough to indicate which persons had copies of the document in their possession three days before the presentation of the Budget last year.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did read such a statement. In my view, if anybody, any citizen of this country, has substantive evidence that a Minister of the Crown leaked a document, he has an absolute responsibility to come forward and identify that person. Let me simply say that to make a generalised statement is just not good enough because that is painting with the widest brush. I believe that if anybody has such evidence he has a duty to bring it forward. As I understand it, the Treasurer has made a statement on this matter. I want to make it perfectly clear that in my judgment and the community's judgment the Treasurer is a man of immaculate integrity and does not go in for these kinds of activities. I accept that there were no such basic leaks. The onus is on those who allege to come forward and prove this situation. It could have come from a Government Printing Office copy. It could have come from a thousand different sources.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That must be one of the most remarkable distortions that could be made. It is a form of double somersault. I made no such allegations. I simply said that there were a number of possibilities by which the Budget could have come into people's hands. Indeed, because the Budget was denied to outside hands widely this time, one will notice that not only was there no leaking but also there was a mass of misinformation, and all the Jeremiahs failed in that regard. I do not know whether the Government would be willing to release the results of the police investigation. I will direct that request to the proper authorities. I repeat that, if any person has any information as to who was the person, whatever the status of that person, who leaked the document, he has a very serious responsibility to come forward and tell us. If that person is not willing to do that he should make no such assertions. That, indeed, is a coward's castle.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Treasurer, but since it concerns the Budget it might also be of some concern to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Did the Minister notice a report on the Australian Broadcasting Commission's AM program this morning to the effect that in Britain cigarette smoking had been reduced by 10 per cent in the past six months as a result of heavy increases in excise, and that that 10 per cent reduction was said to be the equivalent of two million people giving up smoking? What reasons can the Government give us for exempting Australian tobacco products completely from additional taxation in the Budget, while at the same time choosing a callous and unfair imposition of new sales taxes on family necessities such as footwear, clothing and furniture?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; A number of options were considered when forming the Budget and making decisions on what items would be subjected to sales tax or to increased sales tax. I did hear the comment on the AM program this morning with regard to the reduction in smoking, or the apparent reduction in smoking, in Britain, as I understand it, after an increase in sales tax or excise in that country. I think there are those who sometimes challenge the cause or the effect of some decisions taken by government with regard to smoking. Certainly anti-smoking campaigners claim that much of their work has had an effect, quite regardless of the price that might be involved. However, in deciding on the items that were to be subjected to tax, the Government took into account a number of considerations. In this Budget there is no increase in excise or tax on cigarettes or alcohol. The items that were mentioned in the Budget were those that were considered to be appropriate. In some cases they were chosen because there were anomalies in the taxing of similar goods and in others there was a conscious decision to include them in an indirect tax base.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome Senator Ryan's question. The Senate will be aware that, following concerns expressed a year and a half ago, my predecessor invited Mr Rowland, Q.C., to produce a document relating to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act and some problems which may exist in relation to that Act. That document has now been public for 9 or 10 months-I think I tabled it in this place-and it has been the subject of discussion. It is true that some of the administration of land rights matters rests with the Commonwealth, through the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, and some rests with the Northern Territory. It is true that some aspects of the Act have been of concern to the Northern Territory Government and to interests in the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is not generally known is that discussions have been going on for some six months or so between the Northern Territory Government, the Commonwealth Government and the three land councils-the Tiwi Land Council, the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council-as to how this matter should be approached. During this time it has been possible to identify the issues and to work towards the production of a document-presumably an agreed document-which may identify what would be satisfactory to all the parties involved. It would be desirable to make some provision throughout the Northern Territory for excision areas for what are called gibb communities. Senators Kilgariff and Robertson will know what the gibb communities are. They are communities which cannot make a claim under the land rights Act but still need living areas on pastoral properties. At the same time, it is desirable that we examine some of the areas of the land rights Act which give rise to concern. Already there have been three full formal meetings between the Northern Territory Government, the land councils and the Commonwealth Government. A further meeting is planned.</PARA>

I acknowledge his interest in the River Murray system, a matter which is of very great interest to all responsible South Australians. I say emphatically that the report in the Adelaide Advertiser is totally incorrect. The funds for salinity control in all three States-South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales-will be made available as they have in the past. As honourable senators will know from their perusal of the Budget Papers, funds for the overall National Water Resources Program will be increased significantly to $35m this year. The practice is that when the quantum is determined each of the States is invited to make its submissions concerning priorities for particular purposes. These are then examined. That will be done this year also. Then the precise amounts to be devoted to salinity control will be considered. South Australian senators may be assured that South Australia's needs will be borne in mind when that is done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I comment also that in the near future there will be discussions between the Premiers concerned, the Prime Minister and me on the overall River Murray system. Of course, the greatest continuous solution of the problem would be something that we do not have in Australia, and that is continuity of rainfall. The rainfall in recent weeks has filled the Hume Reservoir and created there a need for some spillage. The filling of the Dartmouth Dam storage also is under way, and that will bring long term benefit. A big flush is moving down the River Murray. The mouth of the Murray is now open. For the early and middle future the threat is not as real, although that is not to be taken in any way to be any kind of reason for not proceeding for the future. We will be looking in particular at means of bringing about new kinds of irrigation practices along the Murray, particularly in Victoria, so that the salt table is not lifted and we do not have deep water flooding.</PARA>
<PARA> All of the discussions are taking place. The key to it all is as a start the signing of the new River Murray Waters Agreement which will give to the River Murray Commission responsibility not only for quantity control but also for quality control. As soon as that is done a great advance will be made. The problem in respect of Adelaide is one of turbidity, not salinity. That is a matter for filtration. Steps to correct this problem are progressing. This Government has provided a very large amount of funds for this project, the first stage of which is nearing completion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable senators may know, recently I attended and was privileged to chair the International Energy Agency meeting of consumer countries. I then had the responsibility, as Chairman, of undertaking discussions with the leaders of OPEC including Sheik Yamani. Therefore, the substance of what Senator Kilgariff is saying and what is being reported in the Press has some immediacy in my mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to his first point, the Australian import parity price is currently based on the Saudi Arabian light market crude price of $US32 a barrel. This results in a price for Bass Strait oil of some $30.79. While there have been some price reductions in the spot market and some discounts reported on higher priced oil sold by other countries, the Saudi Arabian market price has not been reduced. Current discussions in OPEC do not suggest that this price will be reduced. In fact, reports suggest that in seeking price unification Saudi Arabia may be considering a modest increase in the market price to perhaps $US34 a barrel. Sheik Yamani indicated to me his desire to seek to get agreement by other OPEC countries to bring down their prices from $US38-$US39 a barrel to about $US34. If this were done Saudi Arabia would consider moving upwards to $US34 so that that would create stability in the world oil price.</PARA>
<PARA> If that occurs the Government will give consideration to any necessary adjustment to the Australian import parity price in the usual way. Consistent with previous practice, any adjustment in the Australian price would apply from 1 January 1982. However, the outcome of the OPEC discussions is not clear at this stage. I would not like to speculate further on possible pricing adjustments. These pricing developments reflect changed circumstances in the world oil market. During 1981 the world oil market has changed from a tightness and a potential shortfall to a temporary surplus. I stress the word 'temporary'. The major improvement in the Western world's oil supply and demand balance has resulted from falling demand, reflecting energy conservation and fuel switching. At the same time Saudi Arabia has had a high daily output of about some 10 million barrels. Iraq and Iran have produced more oil than they had thought they would. Nevertheless, one should not take the world situation of temporary surplus as other than short term. Oil is being used at twice the rate at which it is being produced. There will be a shortage-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I understand that the proportion of housing loans approved by building societies in the 1979-80 year was about 27 per cent of total loans approved. Figures that I have relating to the period from December 1980 to June 1981 show that the total deposit intake of permanent building societies was $165m. We can contrast this with the intake during the same period a year earlier, where the figure was $855m. The average for that period during the past few years had been something around $670m. Another interesting factor that was found in a study conducted recently, which related to the claim that trying to hold down interest rates was of assistance to those seeking loans, was that it did not just fail to help those who were trying to get a housing loan but also resulted in their being disadvantaged financially in other ways. For instance, low income earners were worse off because low income households, particularly those in the older age groups, were the ones which had a very high proportion of their assets in savings accounts. On the other hand, the households in the highest income group had the greatest proportion of loans from institutions charging the lowest interest rates. In answer to Senator Walters's question, I think we have to recognise the market forces that exist when people are seeking loans of this nature. The figure I gave in relation to 1979-80, of about 27 per cent of loans being in that category, is possibly one that is relevant in the more recent year.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to Senator Foreman, if he has not received it already, I will ensure that the supplementary statement from the Budget which related to the conversion of Government vehicles to liquified petroleum gas is made available to him. The announcement made in the Budget was that some 3,000 Commonwealth Government vehicles a year, both from Government departments and statutory authorities, will be converted to LPG. Over the next 3 years 9,000 conversions will be made, which will be a very significant number and will be a pace setter for Australia. That decision was announced in the Budget and we will proceed to implement it. Australia Post, the Australian Telecommunications Commission and other authorities will be asked to be in the forefront of this experiment. We will ask State governments and local governments to follow suit. Institutions such as Telecom Australia are actively interested in energy conservation and are using solar methods.

Work on the electric motor is being undertaken by the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council and other research bodies. I look forward to their results.

Let me make it perfectly clear to the Senate and to the world at large that to state that the Government cannot do something because it does not have a mandate is of the magnitude, if I may be pardoned for using the word, of insanity. Demonstrably, a Budget is a secret document. Information on tactics and areas for raising revenue and information on Budget policies are withheld until the Budget's release. To say that a government must have a mandate for both its revenue raising and its new policies is demonstrably to say that the Budget is a public document known to all before its release. It is a fact that throughout history there has been no attempt by the Labor Party to foreshadow in its policy speeches what it would do by way of revenue raising in its Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I simply say that over the weeks ahead there will be an attempt to create an anxiety neurosis. Might I draw upon the words of the Leader of the Opposition in another place. He said that there would be some huffing and puffing for the next few days. There will be some huffing and puffing on this matter. But let me also make it clear that this Government will get its Budget through. The Government has a mandate to govern this country. The Government has a clear mandate to bring down a Budget and have it passed. Whether the Labor Party's words of the past were hollow or were matters of principle is a matter for history to decide. But the fact is that nobody could knock back a money Bill after stating that as a matter of principle he would not knock back a Supply Bill; nor could he justifiably knock it back on the basis that a government had not stated its intention in its policy speech. That is nonsense. In my judgment the public of Australia should realise that for the next few weeks we are to be held in an anxiety neurosis, which I reject. The public of Australia ought to reject the huffing and puffing of all those who sit opposite in this place.</PARA>

Hence, those staff-24 were involved in Hobart-could and would have been fully and gainfully employed on normal duties involving, for example, preparing taped program material for the coming week as well as maintenance and so on, for the vast majority of their shifts.

That is very important. It was an interim offer without prejudice to what else might be offered.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry: Is he aware of reports that it has now been confirmed that cartons of meat purporting to contain beef, and seized in Australia, do contain horsemeat and that these cartons originated from the Profreeze company's works for export as beef to the United States of America? Does the Minister agree that if this substitution is on the scale alleged-namely, that after 40 cartons of beef passed inspection at the Profreeze works records were then falsified so that 400 cartons, including those with the horsemeat, were dispatched from the factory-a large number of people would have had to be involved and that it is possible that people other than company personnel would have co-operated in this criminal fraud? I note that on 17 August the Minister for Primary Industry stated that the Bureau of Animal Health and the Australian Federal Police are investigating the situation as a matter of priority. However, in view of the importance of the United States market to Australian beef producers, particularly producers in Queensland who are overwhelmingly dependent on the United States export trade, and in view of the potentially disastrous consequences for meat producers, processors, exporters and industry employees, there must be no room for doubt in the future as to the thoroughness of investigations. All involved must be prosecuted and must face the consequences of this sabotage of our beef industry. In short, not only must justice be done but also it must be seen to be done. Therefore, would the Minister agree to propose to the Government that a judicial inquiry be instituted so that all allegations and information can be publicly presented and no doubts can be cast in the future as to the integrity of Australia's meat industry as a whole?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government would certainly agree with the assertion in Senator Martin's question that the issue is one of great importance to Australia because of the volume of our meat exports to the United States of America, particularly our beef exports. It is a matter of great importance to the honourable senator's home State of Queensland and to other States with substantial beef cattle herds and beef export industries. I do not think there would be any doubt in the minds of those in the United States Administration, in the minds of the people of Australia or in the minds of people in this Parliament as to how seriously the matter has been taken by the Government. The Minister for Primary Industry has, of course, kept the public and the Parliament well informed as to what action is being taken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In response to the specific points raised by the honourable senator, my advice from the Minister for Primary Industry is that it is confirmed that the United States Department of Agriculture has detected horsemeat in boneless beef. Ostensibly that consignment was produced at Establishment 140C in Richmond, Victoria. That is a finding which can only be to the detriment of Australia's beef export industry. It is perhaps worth mentioning that this is a unique occurrence. Never before has a substitution of this nature been reported or suspected. As the honourable Senator indicated in her question, both the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Bureau of Animal Health are investigating all aspects of the finding and are arranging for samples of Establishment 140C products still in Australia to be examined for the presence of horsemeat. I understand that that examination is continuing with a view to determining the extent of the problem which we have and with a view to determining just who has been involved.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator suggests that the matter would best be dealt with by way of a judicial inquiry. That is a matter on which, I think, the Government would defer consideration until the normal investigative processes have been used. I do not think generally it would be thought desirable to start that sort of investigation at the level of a judicial inquiry when the normal processes of law enforcement and inquiry are probably quite adequate to do the task which has to be done. Because of the importance of the matter I stress the points which have been made by the Minister in public statements over recent days. In particular I stress that the Commonwealth will take the strongest possible action if illegal activity is found to be involved in the shipment of horsemeat to the United States. Action will be taken to protect Australia's reputation and, indeed, to protect not only the interests of our marketers and exporters but also the interests of our clients who purchase our goods.</PARA>

I do not mind being described as a man of principle by anyone, even by Simon Nasht on the PM program, even by Paddy McGuinness in the Australian Financial Review, even indeed by Senator Teague. But I do resist the suggestion that I am in some way a soloist in that all of my colleagues in the Australian Labor Party are not equally men and women of principle.The reality is that we are all men and women of principle and have foreshadowed in our statements a thoroughly principled course of action in relation both to this Budget and, more particularly, to the associated package of sales tax Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The relevant distinction that we have been talking our way through, and applying in the statements that have been made by various spokesmen on our behalf is that between-as was foreshadowed by Senator Button in his question this morning-on the one hand Bills which are crucial to the survival of a government, are matters of life and death so far as the existence of a government is concerned and, on the other, those which do not satisfy that description. In the former category are undoubtedly those major supply and appropriation Bills-Supply Bill (No. 1) and Supply Bill (No. 2) in the earlier part of the year and Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No. 2) in the latter part of the year-upon which the continued existence of a government undoubtedly depends. Perhaps also in that category of packages of Bills that are absolutely essential to a government's existence are some major taxing Bills, for example, Bills to establish the whole system of personal income tax, which accounts for 50 per cent or more of a government's revenue. In the latter category are included those lesser money Bills which impose fees or fines or make particular appropriations of perhaps a few hundred thousand or even a few million dollars for some particular purpose, or Bills which impose taxes, generally speaking, and do not satisfy the description of being measures which are essential to the survival of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The sales tax legislation which is in issue and which has been the subject of statements by Labor Party spokesmen is undoubtedly in the latter category of lesser money Bills which cannot be regarded on any analysis as essential to the survival of a government. That can be demonstrated in a number of ways. Let me just offer one. I invite the honourable senators to consider the pure arithmetic of it. What is involved in this financial year is half a billion dollars as compared with a total revenue side of the Budget of $40 billion. </PARA>

<PARA> I am not making a long speech; I am simply explaining what is crucial. It is crucial to the explanation and it is crucial to the distinction that needs to be made and understood that whenever I or anyone else has used those kinds of expressions in all the debates that have taken place since 1974 and 1975 we have been using them in the context of the events of 1974 and 1975 when what was in issue was a particular category of Bills-namely, in 1974 the Supply Bills and in 1975 Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No. 2) which were on any view crucial to the continued survival, the continued existence of the Government of the day. That was the context in which that discussion has always taken place; that is the context in which I and others have used those expressions. The relevant issue then as now is whether or not the money Bills, the Budget Bills-whatever sort of Bills are in question-are relevant to the survival of a government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Labor Party proposes to continue to debate the issue of public funding for political parties because it believes it is an essential ingredient in the whole process of our electoral system. The basis of any genuine democracy should be that at least every citizen shall have equal rights, equal access to resources, the right to speak, write and assemble in pursuit of issues seen by the citizen to be important. It is therefore incumbent upon us as part of the Parliament and as democrats to establish whether in the practice of parliamentary democracy groups, citizens and parties have that essential equity in the whole process of politics. I believe no one can say that there is not a bias against small parties and a disadvantage against the Labor Party in the process of elections today. No one can say that there is not a bias against and a disadvantage to the ALP in the way in which elections are funded. No one can deny that the present electoral system is weighted in favour of the conservative forces and the conservative parties and that there is a vital and pressing need to extend the democratic process to equalise opportunities for all citizens, groups and parties to have access to the means of modern day communications such as the Press, radio, television, postage, resources and so on. Of course, this is not presently the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is well known that the conservative parties, in particular the Liberal and National Country parties, have access to large undisclosed funds. It is well known that the same Liberal and National Country parties resist any suggestion that they should be accountable to the electors, the Parliament or its nominee for the large donations that are made to them. Of course, it is well known that these same parties used their numbers in the Senate in 1974-75 to defeat legislation that would have equalised the opportunities of all citizens, representing a genuine segment of political opinion in our society, to reject the Australian Labor Party's proposals for public funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales Labor Government has, of course, proceeded to introduce a number of important changes to the electoral processes in that State. Firstly, it has enshrined the vital principle of every vote having equal value; the principle of one vote one value is now in the New South Wales Constitution. Secondly, it has legislated to establish public funding for political parties. In doing this the Wran Government has seen the need to extend further the democratic process. It recognises the evolution of ideas that has been a characteristic of the electoral system in our country. I will stress this matter of evolution for a moment. One of the greatest strengths of our system of parliament has been its ability to adapt to changing conditions and a changing society. A major change that our parliamentary system has to adapt to today is the rapid development of our methods of communications. I add that these are methods which cost a pretty penny, for in today's electoral battles only those who are able to use the means of communication effectively will be in the running. But the Liberal and National Country parties seem not to be interested in this essential change. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us never forget that it was the conservatives, the predecessors of honourable senators opposite, who fought tooth and nail against the introduction of universal male suffrage back in 1832. It was the conservatives, the predecessors of today's Liberal and National Country parties, who fought in this Parliament in 1928 against universal adult suffrage. It is the modern day conservatives who are still fighting the principle of one vote one value which is so much a basic principle of democracy and as such an integral part of the ALP's own policies. It is the modern day conservatives in Canberra and Macquarie Street, Sydney, who resist hysterically and consistently any suggestion for the establishment of equity in funding political campaigns for the election of parliament. No one can deny the impact of advertising. No one can deny the impact of propaganda or the bias existing in certain sections of the media any more than anyone can deny the growing monopolisation of the media by one particular financial group in our country. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look therefore to how we can equalise and democratise the contest by removing the disadvantages of the minorities in presenting their case; by removing the advantages that clearly come to those who can pound the electors with their viewpoint solely because they have access to what can be considered almost unlimited funds. Why are these Liberal and National Country parties so vehement in their opposition to public funding for political parties, commensurate of course with the degree of political support? Surely a party claiming to be democratic, incorruptible and fair has no grounds to object to fairness, equality and accountability. Surely such a party should be sympathetic to changes that have been widely accepted in so many other parliamentary democracies such as West Germany, Sweden and Austria and in most of the countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development-countries which Senator Carrick and his colleagues so constantly refer to, ignoring the fact, as my colleague Senator Sibraa will detail later, that those countries have adopted this principle. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last session we were treated to some exhibitions of hypocrisy and hysteria from members of the Liberal Party of Australia. We heard the pathetic bleatings of Senator Carrick on the state of Liberal Party funds as being 'lean and poor'. If that is the case it could only be because their funds are spent as fast as they come in. Then we were granted the spectacle of the Government running scared over the prospect of the Wran Government's public funding legislation in New South Wales. The fact is that this will prove to be so successful and acceptable that it will stand as a beacon for the eventual introduction of such schemes throughout the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what has happened recently regarding the problem faced by Mr McDonald, the leader of the Liberal Party in New South Wales, and his posturing over Senator Chipp's exposure of funds for his election campaign. He repudiates public funds yet he accepted $7,000 from a gambling night that was run in his electorate, the means to gamble being supplied by casinos in that State. He prefers this sort of funding of elections to public funding and accountability. The bankruptcy of this reponse, if not the bank accounts, was displayed in the debate which took place in New South Wales by the hollowness of the arguments and the depths of the emotional barrel that was scraped. Today I wish to look at those responses and put them in their proper perspective. By so doing I conclusively present the case for the public financial support of political parties. </PARA>
<PARA> A great deal is talked about principles and the principles of democracy. It seems to me that the essence of our democracy must be fairness, justice and the application of a fair go to all. The application of that essence involves the rule of the majority, the recognition of the rights of the minorities, the fundamental freedoms of speech, association and beliefs, and incorporates such diverse concepts as the right to work and the sovereignty of parliament. It embraces the existence of political associations which we know as political parties, and goes further by requiring their existence for the continued working health of our institutions. Whether they be major or minor parties, close to our beliefs or anathema to them, they are essential to our democracy.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no breach of principles in the institutionalising of our system's support, both rhetorical and real, for political association. On the contrary, it is an indication that at last we recognise the crucial place that they hold in our political life. It is a measure of the importance which we attach to our democratic ideals how much we are prepared to defend and support these political associations. I doubt whether there is one honourable senator on either side of the chamber who would deny that political parties are a basic requirement for the efficient functioning of our parliamentary system. Is it fair that one side is able to gather in far greater sums for its work than the other simply because it is the side which is supported by big business, millionaires or multi-nationals? Is it fair that the resources, in money terms, available to the parties which ensure that media moguls and transport tycoons can continue to print money at will, should swamp the resources of the parties which represent the underprivileged and the disadvantaged whose ability to flex financial muscle is obviously negative?</PARA>
<PARA> If it were a test of a political party's viability that it can attract adequate financial support, then it could only be on the basis of the supporters' ability to give. It will always remain, to me and other members of the Australian Labor Party, a moving experience to remember, as part of the indignation in 1975, the $1 and $2 donations and the pension cheques that flowed into our coffers in great quantities. That money was pitted against the collective might of certain Press barons, the corporate sector, the conservative establishment and other powerful forces. Is that just, fair or democratic? One of the most irksome arguments which has entered this debate is that relating to taxpayers' funds being used for purposes for which they have intense revulsion, ignoring the fact that the proposition of the Labor Party in respect of public funding is to make available from public funds an amount proportionate to the amount of support given in terms of votes to the political party concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, it is the feigned naivety and the sanctimonious posturing of people who put forward this argument against this equity that is so infuriating. These are the same people who introduced us to the word 'hypothecate', a word which was dreamt up by the Treasurer (Mr Howard), who is as adept at sophistry as they are at sycophancy. These are the people who have no hesitation in diverting enormous sums from the pockets of pacifists into armaments, in pouring millions of dollars from the supporters of public schools into private education and in encouraging the development of uranium enrichment in the face of deep-seated and genuine opposition to nuclear energy. Such people know full well that it is the task of governments to make decisions, show leadership and direct public funds in accordance with their policies. This does not suit the conservatives. It does not stop them from crying 'undemocratic' when it suits them. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Government seems keen, at the moment, on the answer 'not right now', the question may well be asked: 'Why not now?'. The fact is that campaigning costs hare reached astronomical levels with the universality of television advertising and its attendant costs, and with the general maturing of the electorate with respect to advertising and propaganda. The recurring debts of political parties, especially those which are dependent upon the donations of ordinary citizens, have become all too common in the wake of elections. This is something which should be of deep concern to all democrats. The fairness of our system, such as it is, cannot survive on this basis. Inequality in our voting system has to be eliminated. The equal access to information and the communicating of information is one important ingredient to that end. If the Liberal Party's bank balance is in much the same state as Senator Carrick suggests, then the problem is widespread and the solution more urgent. I do not call upon Senator Carrick to join with us on this matter as a mere rhetorical device. Already some members of the Liberal Party have recognised the problem and have spoken publicly in support of the proposal mentioned. Ex-Premier Hamer of Victoria, whose brother sits in this place, is on record as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Public funding is obviously the fair and just way of allowing voters to scrutinise the policy of the parties. The danger of receiving private support from businessmen is that it can lead to allegations of abuse and favours in return for cash. </PARA>
<PARA>He should well know of the many scandals that took place in that State about speculation associated with land development. The claim that the Liberal Party insulates its parliamentarians from such pressures by not telling them of the identity of donors is a lot of hogwash. It is the same ruse as the well-known 'arms-length deal' in the business world and has much the same effect. We are aware that overseas corporations have funded political parties in Japan, Italy and many other countries. The National Country Party does not even bother to make any such disclaimer. It is quite blatant with its fund raising. It is quite happy to accept public funding by encouraging companies to make large donations to be written off as advertising so that the taxpayer foots the bill. That happens particularly in Queensland. The Leaders of the National Country Party see no impropriety in suggesting that businesses should make donations as 'very essential for the protection of their commercial future'. That is a phrase from the party's statement. Honourable senators will be excused for hearing echoes of breaking glass and gunfire in those words. Having moved into the protection racket, can we now expect the National Party in Queensland to try the numbers game or bootleg liquor?</PARA>
<PARA> The potential for corruption in our present situation is immense. It has been ably recognised by the former Secretary of the Victorian Liberal Party and political scientist, Leo Hawkins, who has described it as a 'cancer in our system' and who has accused politicians of being slow to face up to it. It is no good honourable members of the Government parties saying that they have no knowledge about it when they know that large sums of money are flowing into their political parties for the machine to spend as they wish in order to put their propaganda before the electors. They cannot stand apart from the fact that they have a responsibility to ensure that there is some equity in this system and that favours are not required as a result of donations. My colleague the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) intimated, when he took part in a debate on the matter in the House of Representatives in May of this year, how one large donor to the Australian Labor Party who financially assisted us in 1972 subsequently wanted his price of flesh. When that was not forthcoming the donor turned against our political party. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the remarks of Mr Leo Hawkins, the former Secretary of the Liberal Party. He has given figures for the 1979 Victorian State election showing that for media exposure alone the Liberal and National parties spent $385,600 compared with the ALP's $114,200. That means that the Liberal and National Country parties spent well over three times the amount spent by the Australian Labor Party. Is that not a matter of concern? Senator Mason tabulated figures for the 1980 Federal elections which showed that the Liberal-National Country Party coalition spent $1,757,000 to the Labor Party's $936,000 on radio and television advertising alone. </PARA>
<PARA> The extent of the Government's outspending of the Australian Labor Party in newspaper and television advertisements during the last week of the campaign is more difficult to gauge, but those of us who want to do so can remember the intensity of that campaign and can imagine the cost. At present one full page advertisement in the Sydney Morning Herald costs $7,000. One minute of prime time on television costs $1,000. On every radio station and television station and in every newspaper in Australia the Liberal and National Country parties expounded their point of view to the detriment of any other point of view. I have ignored the value of the Packer-Murdoch editorial support, which can never be gauged or ascertained. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to another matter of principle-the secret ballot-that has been evoked. It has been claimed by the Treasurer that the disclosure of donations to political parties breaches the traditions of secrecy and privacy. That is simply arrant nonsense. A vote for a political party is one thing and it obviously should remain anonymous. An individual citizen deserves the protection of the law from the personal intimidation that accompanied political campaigning in the days before the introduction of the secret ballot. An individual citizen still need not be concerned about the publication of identity when that person is contributing reasonable amounts to a party or candidate which he or she supports. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not kid ourselves. There is a gaping difference between that sort of donation and the massive corporate and personal support of the powers which control huge amounts of finance. It is that latter sort of donation which must come under public scrutiny. There is a direct relationship between the magnitude of financial support given to a party and the potential for patronage or corruption. Who would claim that a supporter's contribution of $10 or $20 would command the attention of a Minister of the Crown? But who would deny that a corporation providing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of support would command some response and respect from the beneficiaries? It is not simply a matter of honesty that is at stake, although that is important; it is a matter of letting the people know what they are voting for and who the candidates are. It is also a matter of political reality, of converging pressures and inevitable responses. As such, there is no earthly reason why the Parliament cannot legislate for an orderly exposure of such forces as they affect public policy and decision making. Herein lies a right, if honourable senators want one; it is the right of an ordinary citizen to know what powerful forces are at work influencing the people who are responsible for directing their lives, no matter how vicariously. </PARA>
<PARA> Having accepted in principle the case for public funding of political parties and for public disclosure of major donations, there remains the matter of the method of applying it in practice. The Wran Government has taken the courageous step of implementing such funding principles in its State and the indications are that, although there has been a survey suggesting the unpopularity of that step, there is now evidence of an acceptance of it by the electors of New South Wales. There is no doubt that, in the elections that will take place with public funding in New South Wales in the next few months, the Wran Government's courageous step to place election funding beyond any suggestion of corruption so that it can be a matter of public accountability will ensure that that Government will be returned. This Government, however, refuses to grasp the nettle. We condemn it for that. We suggest it should reconvene the Harders Inquiry into Disclosure of Electoral Expenditure with a brief to investigate and report on a method of public funding and public disclosure as an important and necessary progression towards an equitable electoral system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The present system of financing our electoral system is one of voluntary contributions to parties by the members and supporters of those parties. We are being asked today to look at the proposition that public funding for political parties is an essential part of any democratic electoral system. Rather than being an essential part of any democratic electoral system, public funding, involving as it does compulsory contributions by taxpayers to parties and to candidates, impairs the freedom of individuals. Public funding is in direct opposition to any democratic electoral system. Citizens should not be compelled through taxation to contribute to the funds of a political party which they do not support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not clear whether the Australian Labor Party, in proposing the motion and in putting forward the idea, wants to do away with all voluntary contributions to political parties, or whether in fact the Labor Party is advocating a system of compulsory funding in addition to funds already voluntarily donated-or involuntarily donated, for example, by trade union members or anyone else. The Labor Party already receives very large contributions from its trade union supporters. It would be nice to know, in the context of this argument, whether the Labor Party is proposing that it do without that kind of funding in consequence of the public funding which it seeks. I mention here that, even if the Australian Labor Party is advocating a system of public funding in addition to voluntary support, the effect of its accompanying controls, such as the disclosure of sources of contributions, would be to discourage voluntary contributions to other parties. </PARA>
<PARA> If public funds are to be made available, they must be used only to supplement, not to replace, private voluntary contributions to parties and candidates. In no circumstances should there be any denial of the right of individuals and groups in society to support the parties and candidates of their choice, whether that support is in the form of their time, their effort or their money. This is an essential form of political participation and expression. Voluntary citizen participation is a key element of democracy. I am reminded of the famous funeral speech of Pericles when Thucydides put words to this effect in his mouth: 'We do not think that a person who takes no part in politics is minding his own business; we think he has no business here at all'. Already we compel our citizens to participate by enrolling and by voting. Many people quite properly would feel some resentment if they were compelled also to participate by financing the campaigns of politicians, especially those whose policies they would not willingly support or those whose policies they find offensive. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal advantage of voluntary funding rests on the fact that most people prefer voluntary to compulsory activity and they prefer persuasion to coercion, not just on the matter of funding election campaigns but in many areas of social activity. Even those who prefer compulsion to coercion are rarely willing to argue publicly a case for compulsion. An Australia-wide Gallup poll published in the Melbourne Sun News-Pictorial last year showed that 70 per cent of people interviewed were opposed to the public funding of election campaigns. I am aware that last Tuesday the Canberra Times reported that a new poll, compiled by political analysts at the University of Sydney, maintains that the percentage of people opposed to public funding of election campaigns is about 40 per cent. I am not aware whether that was a nation-wide poll but the 40 per cent result of the poll shows that it is a sizeable minority opposed to public funding of political parties. </PARA>
<PARA> Our present system of voluntary funding has many positive features. It has features which are important to our democratic system, not the least of which is the political freedom I have already referred to-the freedom to participate in or to remain aloof from what political parties do. Voluntary funding is an important form of participation in the political process. In fact the reduced need of parties for private contributions could adversely affect the participation of citizens in political parties and their activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party depends upon the responses of its members and its supporters to assess the merits of its policies. The participation of those members and supporters in terms of voluntary contribution of time, effort and ideas, as well as money, is the best barometer between elections of our political and parliamentary performance. When support is not forthcoming from our party members, our leaders and our policy makers receive an important management message. For all political parties, this is one of the vital, positive functions of voluntary funding. By contrast, public funding would have a very harmful effect on the parties, the structure of the parties, and on politics generally. It would entrench party leadership. It would alienate party leaders, certainly in terms of their answerability, their accountability, from their party members and supporters. It would isolate them from the advice and the ideas they can receive from their supporters. With the assurance of available public funds the parties would become unresponsive, the party hierarchies would become unresponsive, and the feedback that is an essential part of the cultivation of voluntary participation would be lost. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sydney Morning Herald, on 10 November 1979, set out what it saw as seven arguments against public funding of political parties. It stated that public funding would:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) outrage voters who have strong moral objections to the philosophy and policies of a particular party;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) entrench existing parties to the detriment of new and small parties;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) weaken the links between politicians and the rank-and-file party members;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) not necessarily prevent the continued use of privately raised, devious moneys;</PARA>
<PARA> (5) encourage more frequent elections;</PARA>
<PARA>The Herald makes some observations about its view of that-</PARA>
<PARA> (6) lead to onerous bureaucratic controls over parties;</PARA>
<PARA> (7) open up election finance to the future manipulation of successive governments. </PARA>
<PARA>Public funding would not eliminate inequalities in the electoral process. In many ways it would aggravate the most undemocratic of them. It would, for example, magnify the very considerable advantages that government and incumbents have now over Oppositions and over new challengers. This would be especially so if subsidies were accompanied by limits on campaign spending. It is nonsense for the Labor Party to argue that public funding guarantees equality of parties, and that it is an essential component of a democratic electoral system. Public funding merely lifts the floor of financial advantage without guaranteeing any kind of genuine equality between the combatants. I note that in New South Wales the proposal put forward by Mr Wran indicates that many minority groups will not get any funding at all, that to qualify for funding in New South Wales a candidate will have to get about 10 per cent of the vote in a lower House seat. How many times can Independents, small parties, or the Australian Democrats look to 10 per cent of the vote in a lower House seat? Not all that often. Under the New South Wales arrangements they may miss out on all chance of finance, certainly in relation to lower House elections. </PARA>
<PARA> The dysfunctional qualities of public subsidies for political parties would be further exacerbated by such unnecessary controls as the forced disclosure of voluntary contributions. Disclusure forces up party costs. It produces more complex administration. Disclosure discourages contributions. Many Australians are nervous about having to identify themselves as supporters of any political group. Many new Australians who have had unfortunate experiences overseas are particularly unwilling to identify themselves because they have faced vendettas, revenge and vengeance in the countries from which they have fled. It opens up avenues for political reprisals of the most blatant and undesirable kind. It undermines the privacy of association which is an important corollary of the secret ballot, and it really is not convincing for Senator Gietzelt to dismiss that argument out of hand as he does. </PARA>
<PARA> The disclosure of voluntary contributions has been linked with the worst forms of corruption such as the keeping of what we might call 'enemies lists' by those in power; yet such disclosure is the very thing advocated by the Australian Labor Party to accompany its proposals for public funding in New South Wales and in other areas. What is more, forced disclosure of voluntary contributions would be especially damaging to parties such as the Liberal Party of Australia that insulate the policy makers from fund raising processes. Put bluntly, we do not want to know, because want to be able to make policy independently and without any awareness of who might or might not be a party supporter. Under the disclosure provisions, we would be forced to know where the money came from. When contributions are a matter of public record, every party's bank account takes on the character of a slush fund. </PARA>
<PARA> To seek or to accept a public subsidy is a political party's admission of failure. That it should need to look to public funding is an admission that it cannot get support from those who should be attracted by the force of its ideas and its ideology. The need for public funding reflects a lack of confidence in the acceptability of the party's objectives, a lack of confidence in its policies, a lack of confidence in its performance and an unwillingness to make the necessary efforts to raise its own funds. It is an assertion by an unsuccessful and failed party, and I might observe here that the record of the Australian Labor Party in the Federal sphere has been one of almost consistent failure. It is an assertion by a failed party that it has little regard for higher priorities and social needs. </PARA>
<PARA> In New South Wales the Labor Party is to impose a special tax on people to support the Labor Party in that State and to pay off its election debts. That is what it is. The $1m that the Australian Labor Party will take from the public could be used in other ways. It could be used to pay for a hospital; it could be used to build a school; it could be used to help underprivileged people. Instead, it is to be used to pay off election debts and to fund a party that is a consistent failure in the Federal sphere. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not arguing against all public funding in all the circumstances. I recognise clearly, in spite of the general preference for voluntary rather than compulsory participation, that a case can sometimes be made for some forms of public funding. I would observe, however, that the Labor Party in New South Wales had no election mandate for using public funding. Public opinion has not been favourable to the introduction of public funding of the Labor Party. The Liberal Party has maintained consistently that no such steps should be taken in New South Wales-I am sure this applies equally across Australia-unless they are approved by a statewide referendum. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the point that we can sometimes look for public funding. Indeed, a number of Western countries have found that their political conditions warrant and suit the introduction of some kinds of subsidised politics. Overseas practice, however, is no argument itself for the necessity or the suitability of such policies in Australia. It is something of an exaggeration, moreover, to argue that public subsidies are the trend or are increasing. In Britain, for example, no government has instituted a subsidy system, and Great Britain has our kind of political system. Even the former Labor Government in that country did not implement the recommendations of a committee headed by Lord Houghton, who is a former Chairman of the Parliamentary Labor Party. Even the Labour Government did not implement those recommendations. Similarly, there has been no successful effort to extent American Federal funding programs which have had wide and unintended consequences for the political system. They have produced volumes of regulations, they have demanded constant fine tuning by law makers and they have come under repeated court challenges from both ends of the political spectrum, and they have been challenged by civil liberties groups. The Americans have made no attempt to extend what they first introduced for presidential funding. </PARA>
<PARA> In the United States funds are provided only for presidential elections, not for the elections of senators or congressmen. Even then the funds do not come from Consolidated Revenue. In the United States they come from voluntary tax credits paid into a presidential election campaign fund. The main conditions that have resulted in the introduction of public funding schemes do not exist in Australia. The conditions include voluntary voting, which we do not have. That carries with it the need to encourage participation. The conditions also include bipartisan support for funding, which does not exist in Australia. They include the existence of a degree of public support, which does not exist in Australia, and they include, most importantly, evidence of widespread corruption within the political process. </PARA>
<PARA> Political conditions in Australia do not warrant the introduction of direct cash subsidies for parties and candidates. Already there are substantial indirect subsidies to political parties and to candidates in Australia. I will list a few of these. In Australia we provide five hours free time on Australian Broadcasting Commission radio and television at the kind of cost indicated by Senator Gietzelt. We provide staff, office and travel entitlements which are maintained during election campaigns. We provide VIP aircraft for party leaders. We provide compulsory voting which removes the cost of getting the electorate out to vote. In addition, the ALP through its ties with the trade unions in the beneficiary of another indirect subsidy-it is not available to other parties-and that is the tax deductibility which is attracted by the subscriptions trade union members pay. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also a number of practical considerations involving public funding. It is difficult, if not impossible, to devise equitable formulae for allocating political subsidies. Any set of criteria, whether based upon the number of seats held in parliament, the number of votes received at a previous election or any other formula involves arbitrary discrimination against some contestants in the political arena. There is also a problem of accountability, of ensuring that parties use the funds properly. Nothing in the proposals put forward by the Labor Party so far covers this point. It has not told us how it would do this properly without establishing undesirable government control over its own activities. There is the cost of administering the scheme. The bureaucracy increases. In the United States the Federal Election Commission has a staff of 275, most of whom are accountants and lawyers. It becomes an administrative nightmare for parties and candidates. The United States law had been described in that country as the lawyers and accountants full employment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we are discussing an idea about the essentiality or otherwise of public funding-not whether it should be there as an adjunct but the assertion by the Labor Party that it is an essential part of the democratic process. The goal we seek to ensure we can achieve is that we have an electoral process which is fair, workable, equitable and free of corruption. Public funding is not an essential part of such a process. I conclude by making one observation to Senator Gietzelt. He need not think that all the descendants of the nineteenth century liberals are found on his side of politics. My grandfather was a parliamentary member of the Liberal Party in the year 1900. He was as keen and I am as keen as Senator Gietzelt or anyone else to see that we have an electoral process which is fair and free from corruption. The honourable senator will have to devise more arguments and advance more facts than he has so far advanced before we will believe that the arguments he has put up are in any way essential or necessarily helpful to Australia's political electoral system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Senator Baume raised a number of issues, some of which I will deal with during my contribution to the debate and some of which I will deal with straight away. I want to answer his remarks about the New South Wales scheme and voluntary contributions. Under the New South Wales scheme of course there will be voluntary contributions and of course there will be voluntary work done by the thousands of people who support the Australian Labor Party in that State. Senator Baume mentioned also an editorial appearing in the Sydney Morning Herald. One of the points he dwelt upon was that public funding would lead to more frequent elections. I thought that in the New South Wales Parliament there was now bipartisan support for a proposal for fixed four-year terms and that when the next election is held in New South Wales a referendum will be put to the people in respect of four-year terms. Senator Baume in his contribution referred to the political experiences of migrants and how they were suspicious of some sorts of public funding to be introduced in New South Wales. I remind Senator Baume that many people have now come to live in Australia, especially from Europe, and if the countries from which they came are still democratic today some form of public funding exists in those countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Baume mentioned also a matter that has been referred to quite a number of times recently, and that is that the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party is broke and that this whole idea is an elaborate exercise to bail the New South Wales branch out of its debts. That is not the situation. At the last conference of the New South Wales branch of our party the general secretary reported on the financial state of that branch. Our conference is open and it was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian and other media that, in fact, the New South Wales branch is not broke. Senator Baume referred to the fact also that in New South Wales the Wran Government has no mandate to bring in public funding. Some of his colleagues in the House of Representatives referred to the fact that the Wran Government should hold a referendum on public funding in New South Wales. I put it to Senator Baume that, in fact, we do have a mandate. We will have a referendum. It will be called an election. It will be on very shortly and the people of New South Wales will have an opportunity to vote on whether they want the Wran Government. I think most of us in this chamber, if not all of us, know exactly what the result will be. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall ask a number of questions. Firstly, why is this Government worried about the issue of public funding? Why have members of this Parliament and the New South Wales Opposition called public funding corrupt? What reasons have they advanced for this so-called corruption? What substantiations have there been of the allegations that have been made? There have been none at this stage. The reason this Government and the New South Wales Opposition are terrified is that under this legislation in New South Wales they will have to account for where the money comes from for their election campaign. We know that $5m or $6m came to the Government parties at the time of the last federal election and that money was completely unaccounted for. We do not know where 1c of that $5m or $6m came from. We do not know what deals were done between businesses and the Government. We do not know what favours are being bestowed on businesses as a result of those donations. According to this Government that is not corrupt. It is corrupt only if governments-they are doing this in many parts of the world-pay out of taxpayers' money amounts much smaller than that $5m or $6m to which I have referred and which are fully accountable to a government auditor. That seems to be what this Government is saying is corrupt. The Government says that that system is corrupt but that private business donations-and what might be attached to them-are not corrupt. </PARA>
<PARA> In New South Wales the charges being made at the moment are approaching hysteria because the New South Wales Opposition realises that it has missed the boat as regards obtaining public funding. The New South Wales Opposition is now faced with the situation that the Wran Government will be returned to office with an increased majority or just as big a majority as it received last time. Until recently everybody thought that was impossible. I point out to some of the Government senators that the Liberal-Country Party Opposition received 35 per cent of the vote in the last New South Wales State election and the latest gallup poll shows that it will get about that figure or perhaps even less at the election that is coming up. </PARA>
<PARA> Much to the consternation of the Liberal Party in New South Wales it realises that even though it spent thousands of dollars-as Senator Gietzelt has said, it was $7,000 a page-on advertisements in the Sydney Morning Herald trying to promote public funding as an issue, with an election to be held in the near future public funding has proved to be a complete non-issue in New South Wales. When this next State election is over I predict that the Opposition parties in New South Wales will change their attitude on public funding. We all know that the National Country Party in New South Wales was lukewarm in its opposition to funding anyway. The New South Wales Liberals-as Senator Baume would know, it is traditionally the poor branch of the Liberal Party in Australia-will be only too happy to accept some sort of public funding when the next State election is over. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the old system which operated and in which there was no public funding at all it helped to be a candidate for the Liberals as is the case in the seat of Manly. That State electorate is situated very close to where I live. The endorsed Liberal Party candidate for that seat of Manly said in an article appearing in the Sydney Morning Herald in May that his campaign costs in the State election would be in excess of $45,000. I point out that the Labor Party won the seat for the first time in history at the 1978 election and properly documented accounts show that it spent $3,449. With public funding in the campaign battle which is about to be fought in Manly I suggest that, bearing in mind the $45,000 to be spent by the Liberal candidate, the Labor Party will still be in a very bad position as regards funds but it will be more of an equal task. From what I have seen in the electorate recently, the Labor Party will continue to hold that seat. The member, Allan Stewart, is a very good member for that seat of Manly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator McClelland said, he will hold the seat. The joke is that this Government already supports some form of public funding. Senator Baume referred to it. Let us go back to the campaign for the Grayndler by-election in New South Wales. New South Wales Liberal senators-I suppose Senator Baume was one of them-used their stamps, stationery, telephones and printing to seek support for the Liberal candidate in that by-election. I had a letter from a clergyman in the area who said it was scandalous and that this was some sort of public funding. I was able to point out to him that, yes, it was some sort of public funding. Because of the time, I will not go into matters concerning the Government Information Unit. I think that body is another example of this Government using public funding. The public must know where members of parliament and parties get their donations and what amounts are involved. I question why we have to keep these aspects quiet. What are Australian political parties trying to hide-and especially what have they tried to hide in the past-in regard to donations? This issue goes back a long time. I refer to something that happened in 1932. The Sydney Morning Herald carried an interchange between W.A. Holman, the then Premier of New South Wales, and Justice Halse Rogers. The interchange took place during the royal commission into the 'tin hare' inquiry. A reprint of the article in the Australian Quarterly states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Holman, addressing the royal commission, said that party funds were one of the inevitable by-products of the party system, especially with elections becoming more and more intensive and expensive. </PARA>
<PARA>That was in 1932 in New South Wales. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>- Parties invited subscriptions to their funds, and funds were frequently given in anticipation, no doubt, of favours to come. His Honour asked, amid laughter, whether funds were not almost universally given for this reason, and not merely frequently. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Holman: Well, your Honour, I am endeavouring to be moderate. </PARA>
<PARA>What has changed in 49 years? Surely if funds are provided in secret, at a later stage a party can be compromised when a policy matter affects a donor, especially if that donor has made a large donation. At present the situation is just as it was in 1932. I want to deal now with public funding as it applies to other countries and to comparable parliamentary democracies. These countries include Sweden, Denmark, Norway, France, Japan, Holland, Israel, Belgium, Switzerland, West Germany, Italy, Canada and the United States of America. There are others. It is interesting to note that countries that have either conservative or socialist governments-it does not matter whether there has been a change of government-have retained public funding. In Sweden, for example, after years in opposition conservatives won election over the socialist government. Did they change public funding? Of course they did not. I make the point that all of the nations which presently have some form of political funding are among the most democratic in the world. All of the countries remain working parliamentary democracies and, if anything, they have become more truly democratic at a time when the number of true parliamentary democracies in the world is declining. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask Government members whether the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), when he talks to the leaders of those countries, when he meets them overseas, tells them that they and their parties were elected under corrupt systems? That is what the Prime Minister has said. He has said that public funding is a corrupt system. Does he say to Chancellor Schmidt or to Chancellor Kreisky when he meets them that he thinks they have been elected under a corrupt system? What does he say to a conservative leader such as President Reagan, who received $21m of public funds for the last election campaign in the United States? Does he say to him: 'President Reagan, I believe that you were elected under a corrupt system'? Senator Baume mentioned the United States system. He mentioned the Electoral Commission in Washington. At the Electoral Commission all the donations made to presidential candidates are open to scrutiny on payment of a very modest sum. I was able to get copies of the records of donations. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1962, President Kennedy said that some form of public funding was inevitable with the way that costs were rising then in the United States. He proposed the commission on campaign costs. That proposal was not acted upon by President Johnson but it was acted upon after Watergate. In some of the countries I mentioned a political scandal-such as that which occurred in Italy in 1974, and the one in Japan where the Prime Minister resigned-was needed to create bipartisan support for public funding or for an increase in public funding. It is interesting to look at the Watergate situation and what applied there, and at how acceptance of public funding in the United States came about. It is interesting that the amendments to the Electoral Reform Bill were passed only hours before President Nixon resigned. I ask Government members whether they think those amendments would have been passed in an atmosphere other than that surrounding Watergate and Nixon's resignation? I had intended to compare the systems in operation in West Germany and Canada. Because of the shortage of time I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard explanations of how those two systems work. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>West Germany</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In West Germany political parties are recognised by the constitution, which of course is not the case in Australia although I personally feel that there is a strong case that they should be. State aid for political parties takes several forms of which the most important is for election campaign expenses. Payments are spaced over a period of four years, with the greater part being paid during election years. A law introduced in 1967 lays down the rules for subsidy through grants advanced for election purposes based on the performance of the parties concerned at the last election. An agreed sum is fixed for each elector according to the number of votes polled for each of the parties. This system operates in such a way that it is necessary to win seats in the lower house to qualify for aid. Any party donating over and above $6,000 must be specified by the name and address of the donor. This is the only accounting requirement by law for a political party wishing to qualify for aid. Each political grouping is also given a proportionate sum of money to maintain research facilities for its parliamentary representatives. In passing I mention that parliamentarians are also required by law to give a proportion of their salary to their party if they wish to qualify for local campaigning aid. Each party receives a subsidy for the purpose of party research and educational institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>Canada</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Canada has an Electoral system more like ours than the system in the Federal Republic of Germany. The Canadian Elections Act of 1974 introduced a system of financial aid to political parties. Candidates are partially reimbursed for election expenses if they are elected or receive more than 15% of the total votes cast in their electoral district. The extent of reimbursement is decided by ascertaining whichever is the lesser of the two amounts, namely, the amount of the candidate's expenses as stated on his or her own declaration or an amount which is the aggregate of, firstly, the postage costs of mailing an ounce or less to each elector: secondly, 8c for the first 25,000 names on the preliminary list of electors: and thirdly, 6c for every formal vote cast in excess of 25,000 electors-the National Country Party senators might take note that there is a special allowance for candidates in specified remote electorates which is why the Canadian system is of some importance in Australia where the geographical size of the electorates varies enormously, as it does in Canada. In Canada there are also tax credits for political donations up to a specified maximum which at present is the equivalent of $A435 in any one year for a donation to the political party of the donor's choice. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EJ4">Senator SIBRAA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Baume mentioned the Houghton committee report. I know it has not been acted upon but I think the Australian Democrats would be very interested in some of the recommendations in that report. In particular, Senator Chipp would find it interesting because, under the system suggested, Australian Democrats would have been eligible for a significant amount of public funding at the last election, in 1980, having established that their party had considerable electoral support at the 1977 elections. Naturally, following the 1980 result they would have been eligible for a much larger amount of money for the 1983 elections. I think also that we would have to look at a federal public funding system whereby if an Independent such as Senator Harradine received the vote that he did, he would also be eligible for public funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Already in Australia we have had minor scandals on both sides of the Parliament concerning public funding. The Labor Party was involved in the Iraqi loan affair and in recent times three Ministers of Liberal governments-Lynch, Garland and the late Eric Robinson-were involved in one way or another in minor scandals associated with election matters and the funding of election campaigns. We have to compare the small cost of public funding with some of the costs of the Fraser Government's priorities. Compare the cost of public funding with the $40m that has been spent on VIP jets. Compare it with the cost of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, conservatively estimated to be $14m. Some of the most undemocratic countries in the world will be represented at that conference. I wonder whether our Prime Minister will say to some of the military dictators and some of the rulers of one-party states when they come to CHOGM 'Your system is not corrupt', and whether he will say to the Prime Minister of Canada, who is elected under a system of public funding: 'Mr Prime Minister, we think your system is corrupt.'? I will close by quoting what Premier Wran said in New South Wales when he introduced into the New South Wales Parliament the Bill dealing with the public funding of elections. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It recognises the central role of political parties in the parliamentary system. It protects the rights of minorities and new parties. It reduces the gross disparity between the financial resources available to different parties. It removes the risk of parties selling political favours. It declares to the world that the great political parties of New South Wales are not up for sale. </PARA>
<PARA>For those reasons I support Senator Gietzelt in proposing this matter of public importance. </PARA>

I also recognise that he has views that are not much different from mine about the sort of suppression that exists there. But I still make the point that many people are here from those countries because of the system, which is all to do with public funding. An enormous amount of work has already been done on this matter. My late friend and colleague-late in a parliamentary sense-from the other place, the Honourable Kevin Cairns, certainly showed the way. He indicated to the people of Australia on a number of occasions just what the attitude of this party and the Government was to propositions for public funding. We dignify this debate by talking about public funding. To me the essence of it is more simply expressed when we say that an attempt is being made to plunder the people's money to secure political permanence for those who advocate these things. I acknowledge the debt we owe to Kevin Cairns. I think it is worth reading into today's proceedings that on two occasions Mr Cairns moved notices and on another occasion moved a Bill. The essence of his position was that he regretted the decision made in Adelaide by the Australian Labor Party in July of 1979 to promote government subsidies directly to political parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He asserted that 'the taxpayers' dollar is not to be given to political parties, whether it be the Communist Party, the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party, independent parties or the National Country Party.' At that stage there was no Australian Democrat in the House or he would have included that party too. He was of the opinion that 'such funding distorts the very nature of Australia's political organisations and their responsibilities'. </PARA>
<PARA> He declared that the House should take action to resist utterly any attempt to divert tax dollars, pension payments, family allowances or defence money for such purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say in passing that I find it quite peculiar that a party as dedicated as the Australian Labor Party professes to be to the cause of social welfare should be prepared to waste so much of the taxpayers' dollar on such suggestions as we are talking about today. I think it is worth proceeding with what Mr Cairns had to say. On another occasion in the House he said that any proposal to divert taxation or loan revenue to fund a political party--</PARA>

He is quite right to remind me that we should draw a very strong distinction between the Honourable Kevin Cairns, a former Minister in a previous Liberal Government, and Dr Jim Cairns, who was totally opposed to all of those propositions. Mr Kevin Cairns asserted that 'public funds should be used for the benefit of the Australian people and not to promote the contest for power by political parties'. He also said that 'such funding is contrary to the interest of emerging parties'. I hope that the Australian Democrats will note this. There are strong reasons why they should not support this. He continued and said that it would prolong the power of contrasting political organisations. I think it is again proper for me to thank Mr Kevin Cairns for what he did. I am certain that, with me, other people in this place wish him well in whatever he is doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was suggested to me some little time ago that I should be in favour of this proposition to come to the public trough. I previously had a fairly tough electorate. Being tough and marginal it was rather hard to get money. Of course it is attractive, when in that situation, to think that a benevolent parliament and the people should fund one's attempt at continuity. But it is quite obvious, on a matter of principle and tradition, as has existed in this country so far, that such a proposition is utterly abhorrent to me, to the party I am in and to those people who were prepared to work voluntarily and to donate their time and efforts in order to get me into the other place. I am quite sure that I speak for the average Liberal voter and the average Liberal supporter in the average Liberal electorate. I also think I speak for a lot of voters in Labor electorates too. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know that there has ever been any definite evidence to support such an assertion. Perhaps in time to come the honourable senator might like to move a substantive motion. Until he does that, I propose to take no notice of any such charges. This is the easiest place in the world to make charges about people who have no opportunity to answer for themselves. I saw it happen in the other place too. One of the things about this Parliament I have always regarded as genuinely reprehensible is the fact that people can say exactly what they like, sometimes with absolutely no evidence. A person's character and good name can be impugned and he or she has no opportunity to answer. I am not saying that we ought to deny ourselves the right to speak frankly and fairly, but I am saying that I would have expected better to come from the honourable senator than a suggestion like that. However, when politicians decide to subsidise their campaign activities they assign themselves a very high priority amongst many of the competing urgent social needs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said before, I am surprised that the Australian Labor Party should want to do this sort of thing. Neither Senator Gietzelt nor Senator Sibraa has proven or even attempted to prove that the present system of voluntary contributions to parties from their members and supporters is preferable to a system of compulsory funding from all taxpayers. They have not proved that the present political conditions in Australia warrant, or are appropriate for, subsidised politics. They have failed to prove that the numerous costs of public subsidies and the suggested accompanying controls will outweigh any likely benefits. It seems to me that unless those honourable senators can take up those questions and give very definite answers they have not got a case at all. The mere availability of subsidies and the understandable instinct of people to want to protect privacy of association, which of course would be invaded quite massively by forced disclosure and other controls, could discourage free and voluntary contributions to parties and candidates. Parties and candidates that conscientiously reject subsidies would soon be forced to join their opponents at the public trough. This is what I find so reprehensible about the whole matter. We must not overlook the positive functions of free and voluntary funding. </PARA>

<PARA> Before the luncheon recess I developed a few basic reasons why we should not comply with the suggestion of the Opposition that political parties should be publicly funded. One of the best reasons is that we already have compulsory voting. Some of the countries that were mentioned by Senator Sibraa do not. That eliminates the need of parties to spend money to get out the vote. The Australian Labor Party, instead of whingeing about not getting votes, seats and the right to govern should go to the people, raise money and adopt adequate policies-policies which are acceptable to the people of this country. That seems to me to be a far better approach, but I have given advice to the Labor Party before and it has not been taken. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always good advice and worth taking. A long time ago I suggested in another place the sort of candidate the Labor Party ought to run in my old electorate. Eventually it picked one and look what happened to me. I gave good advice in that case. Also forgotten is the fact that considerable and substantial assistance is already provided to parliamentarians. I refer to all of the publicly funded facilities that are provided. I am glad that this is not a broadcasting day. I am not sure that it is the best time to be detailing those facilities, having in mind the recent controversy about parliamentary salaries and allowances, but every honourable senator knows what facilities we have available. They are present in an elegant sufficiency to enable every one of us to have a far better chance of being selected by our parties and returned here than has someone who is starting from scratch. It seems somewhat foolish to advance arguments which eventually may lead to those privileges passing away. The Opposition is arguing about something that is quite insubstantial and quite unreal, probably something that will never come to pass. The very process of arguing strongly in that way may leave us bereft of things that we all enjoy now. The Labor Party is making a grave mistake in bringing forward a proposal that is so full of legislative pitfalls and dangers to the democratic system. That system, even though Labor supporters might not like it, at least gives them a chance. To take up this matter at a time when they are struggling and when the result of every public opinion survey taken is against it is, in my judgment, foolish.</PARA></TALK.START>

One sometimes hopes that his performance in this place could be as good, as courageous and as exquisite as his performances when wearing wicketkeeper's gloves and crouching behind the wicket as a member of the parliamentarians' cricket team. There his performance is impeccable, but I cannot say the same about his speech today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are grateful to Senator Gietzelt and the Australian Labor Party for bringing forward this extraordinarily important subject in a form which amounts to a mild criticism. I wish that it had been proposed as a matter of urgency so that we could have had a vote on it. That is the newest thing that we can do in the Senate-vote on these issues. This particular issue would not fracture the party system. I know that at least three members of the Liberal Party genuinely believe that this area ought to be more closely investigated. It is the policy of the Labor Party and of the Australian Democrats. One hopes that before this year is out a private member's Bill will be brought down, will be passed in this place and will be sent to the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA> We are discussing the proposition that public funding for political parties is an essential part of any democratic electoral system. However, this debate on political funding seems to eke out only the black and the white aspects. The proponent says that everything about it is good. The opponent, as we have just seen in the person of Senator Martyr, says there is nothing good about it whatever. After considering both sides of the question the Australian Democrats believe strongly in public funding. We do so for this central reason: How can a political party remain free and objective if it is heavily reliant on a particular benefactor? With great respect, Senator Martyr did not address himself to that question. He is both an absolutely honourable man and member of a political organisation, as indeed you are Mr President, but how can the hierarchy of your party be objective in any decision that comes before it when it has taken millions of dollars over a three-year period from unknown sources. It is emotionally and logically impossible on questions concerning mining to be objective if one has taken hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from mining companies. With great respect, I ask my colleagues on the right of the Australian Labor Party: How can you possibly be totally objective on a trade union matter or industrial disputation if the bulk of your funding comes from the trade unions?</PARA>
<PARA> That is one reason why I admire the Premier of New South Wales, a member of the Australian Labor Party who has had the courage to initiate public funding of political parties. Although the Democrats do not support him in the details of implementation, we admire very much the principle. I am persuaded that Neville Wran has shown himself to be a man who will stand up to trade unions-not all trade unions per se but those unions which every member of the Labor Party feels at times are going too far and behaving unreasonably. He has been able to take them on. After this exercise of public funding in New South Wales has been completed Neville Wran and his party will be able to be objective. They will not have to rely on any particular benefactor within the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to make a point of this, because the person that I am going to name involved himself in a recent controversy in which I was engaged. I did not name him and did not want to, but the present Leader of the Opposition in a certain State admitted that he had attended a gambling night at which several thousand dollars was raised by the use of equipment owned by criminals. I am not alleging for one moment that a cent of those funds went into that person's pocket, but several thousand dollars did go into the Liberal Party's pockets. Let us assume that the Liberal Party were to win the next election and the person in question were to become Premier of the State. Does anybody really believe that from that point on he could be objective? Would he not be in debt, at least morally or in some other way, to the criminal syndicates who take $150m profit out of illegal gambling in that State? I believe that under the present method of raising funds there is an obvious danger of political parties being put in a position of owing favours to corrupt elements in our society. The Australian Democrats have proved this.</PARA>
<PARA> We have all heard the hackneyed cliche: 'There is no such thing as a free lunch'. As honourable senators know, the Australian Democrats is the only political party that has in its constitution the rule that all substantial donations received by it will be capable of public disclosure. The result is that we are very close-perilously close-to being stone motherless broke. Do not members of this chamber realise that in the last six months we have been deluged with offers of funds, with all sorts of people coming to us and saying, 'Look, here is $50,000', 'Look, here is $20,000', or whatever? When this has happened my eyes have lit up and I have said: 'Thank you very much. You realise, of course, that any amount over $2,000 is capable of public disclosure.' They have vanished with a rapidity that would astonish even honourable senators. They do not want a bar of that. I think that indicates the sort of forces that are at work. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel very strongly about this, as do my colleagues. If we take anything under the table, if we take a $100,000 donation from the breweries, how can I then campaign, as we are doing, for a tax to be imposed on the advertising of alcohol which is the third largest killer of the human race? Where would my integrity be if I had taken $50,000 under the table from the liquor interests of this country? Yet honourable senators opposite still refuse even to contemplate the morality that is inherent in having everything above the table. Most Western democracies have now introduced some form of public funding. This practice has not been restricted to governments of any particular flavour. I compliment Senator Sibraa for giving examples of the way in which this practice has been adopted by the Social Democrats in Sweden and the Christian Democrats in Italy and West Germany. These are parties of different political persuasions. </PARA>
<PARA> Public funding would probably reduce the chances of one party telling lies about the others, as happened during the last federal election. One example is the monstrous, filthy, dirty lies that were told by the Liberal Party against the Democrats in Western Australia which resulted in that--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It cost us a seat in this chamber. Another is the monstrous lies that were told by the Liberal Party against the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales which in my view could conceivably have cost the Labor Party government-lies which were printed by certain newspapers but which were refused by honourable newspapers in this country for being palpably untrue. Two points can be made about this. The first relates to the recent infamous judgment of the High Court of Australia. I disagree with my friend and colleague Senator Gareth Evans on few occasions. However, this is one occasion on which I fiercely disagree with him. I refer to the High Court judgment from those seven venerated and venerable gentlemen who said that from now on virtually it is not essential to tell lies during election campaigns but it is highly desirable to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> It is now entirely possible for a political party with unlimited money to print those sorts of lies against an opponent. It does not have to be a penniless opponent like the Democrats; it can be a party like the Australian Labor Party which, although not penniless, does not have the kinds of resources necessary to reply with equal strength one, two or three days before an election. Such a party does not have the kinds of resources to hire the slickest, sleeziest and slimiest advertising agents it can, give them an unlimited budget drawn from some secret sources and say: 'There is $1m; go away and smear the Democrats, go away and smear this particular party'. This behaviour leaves the other party with absolutely no defence whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Martyr, who is basically and totally a fair and honourable man, believes that that kind of circumstance is one that should remain, I am confounded by the queer process of logic that brings him to that conclusion. A person might agrue-this is a respectable argument superficially-'Why should I pay my taxes to a political party? I hate all political parties and I do not want to pay my taxes to any of them'? Superficially this is a respectable argument. But the argument when refined becomes even more respectable, that is: 'Why should my taxes go to the Democrats whom I despise?' That would be a respectable argument. But there are ways out of that. Hypothecations out of Consolidated Revenue can be made on the basis of performance at the previous election which essentially would mean that overall the situation would be the same. There is another device where a taxpayer can make an option on his income tax return, such as, 'I hereby authorise the Treasury to allot 0.1 per cent of my taxes to the Australian Labor Party'. Such an option could be made in respect of the Liberal Party, the Country Party or the Democrats. </PARA>

But my answer is that the Australian taxpayer is already paying for a basic proportion of the money going to political parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Big money has been offered to me as Leader of the Australian Democrats. When I have said, 'Well, yes, subject to public disclosure', they have run a mile. On occasions they have said: 'Look, what about giving us $100,000 worth of your advertising; what about giving us $50,000 worth of your printing bills; we will pay that'. Then their eyes gleam and they say: 'That is even better still; we can write that off against tax'. God knows how much is being written off in that way. They say: 'You would not be the first political party to have accepted that'. That must mean that billions of dollars of taxpayers' money is not being collected because payments to political parties are being claimed under the subterfuge of advertising or printing expenses. We hope that in the next three years the Senate will become a little more bipartisan over a problem such as this which essentially when it is all boiled down is not one of pure party politics. It is a problem of justice for the political parties of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If necessary I will seek leave to have the whole article incorporated. But I do not think I have quoted it out of context. We are discussing the fact that public funding for political parties is an essential part of any democratic electoral system. That is interesting because there is no mention of individual candidates. There is no mention of people such as Senator Harradine or myself. We have been in that situation in years gone by. We had to find our own way to raise finance to get into this House. I will say at this stage that I have never had any money given to me towards funding any election campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> People in this country do not have a very high opinion of politicians already. Rightly or wrongly they see us as people who do not work very hard, who are highly paid and try whenever we can to get our grubby little paws into the tills. We all know that many politicians in this place, in the three days they are here, work long hours-I say too many hours for the good of their health. I think Parliament should have enough sense to choose reasonable sitting hours. I hope before long we will not be held here at night captive to those bells but will start our day at a sensible time and end it at a sensible time, as most people around this country do. But that is another matter. </PARA>
<PARA> We do seem to the public to be highly paid. On top of that we have phones, secretaries and cars and all those things such as overnight accommodation, many of which are still available to us during election time. The Australian Labor Party, following a line it has taken for years, is asking for more. It is trying to have the taxpayer pay for the political party. Already in New South Wales we have seen Mr Wran pass public financing legislation for his election, something that most probably will benefit the Labor Party more than other parties in the election-which I expect will be announced any day. I seek leave to have incorporation in Hansard an article from the Australian that relates to funding in New South Wales. I have shown the article to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner), who is at the table, and to the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The article read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>DESTROYING LIBERTY TO PAY POLITICAL PARTIES</PARA>
<PARA> The concept of using public money to finance the campaigns of political parties is repugnant and undemocratic enough: repugnant because politicians are already feather-bedded to an inordinate degree with high salaries, astonishingly generous superannuation and many other perks; and undemocratic because such funding favors major parties while destroying the chances of independents and parties struggling to become established. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Big Brother measures contained in the New South Wales Election Funding Bill, introduced into the NSW Legislative Assembly by the Premier, Mr Wran, will startle-even frighten-most people and cause great worry among those already seriously perturbed about continued erosion of civil liberties. Mr Wran described the bill as 'a pioneering measure for Australia'-implying it will be copied by other States. It is to be hoped not. It must not. </PARA>
<PARA> The bill should not become law in its present form. Indeed, it is extremely unlikely that voters want public funding of political parties to become law in any form. If Mr Wran believes they do, let him lay the bill aside and put the question of public funding to the voters at a referendum in conjunction with the next State election. He can then, democratically (which would be welcome) test public feeling. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirement that any donation to a political party of $1,000 or more must be disclosed, as must any donation to a candidate of $200 or more, will be offensive to many people. It expresses, in blunt terms, the authoritarian belief that a person's private property is not his, to dispose of as he wishes. His wishes must be subject to the censorship of the State. This is the approach of both fascism and communism. </PARA>
<PARA> But the measures contained in the NSW bill to police that requirement and other sections of the bill are horrifying in their scope. Section 110 will give inspectors appointed under the bill power to enter 'at any reasonable time, and place' where they believe records or bankers' books are kept relating to the funding of election campaigns. It also, according to Mr Wran's explanation to Parliament, makes it an offence for any person to obstruct an inspector . . . and 'any person who makes a false declaration or who fails to make a declaration shall be guilty of an offence.'</PARA>
<PARA> This means that State inspectors can arrive at, say, the private home of an honorary worker for a candidate in an election, demand entrance and search that home as they see fit. They can also enter any bank which they believe is keeping an election account and demand to see that account-and the accounts of anybody or any firm they think may have made a donation. Mr Wran did not say if the inspectors would be wearing jackboots. They should be. </PARA>
<PARA> The powers of the inspectors do not end there. In a complete switch of the concept of justice which requires the State to prove a case against someone it believes has infringed its laws, the inspectors can require the suspect to make a statement to convict himself-if he is, in fact, guilty. If he refuses to make such a statement, or refuses in it to provide evidence of his guilt, he faces a penalty up to $10,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, the victim of this draconian law must-if he has given, say, $250 of his own money to a local candidate-admit he has breached the Electoral Funding Act if he has not disclosed the gift and have that admission used in evidence against him or face a $10,000 fine for having refused to provide evidence of his so-called guilt. </PARA>
<PARA> The NSW president of the Council for Civil Liberties, Mr Malcolm Ramage, has described Section 110 as 'most offensive', a 'serious erosion of civil liberties', and a reversal of the traditional basis of law, adding: 'The banks should also be interested in this-with one sweep of the pen it makes nonsense of banking law and the principle of confidentiality.'</PARA>
<PARA> Everybody should be interested in this-in every State . . . because there is no doubt political parties in all States will be watching the progress of Mr Wran's essay in authoritarianism. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make it quite clear that not only am I against such expenditure in New South Wales but also I believe politicians get too much assistance at election time. I have already said that we get the use of telephones, copying machines, secretaries and travel and things of that kind which are paid for from the public purse. Just a few years ago none of these facilities would have been available. There has been a gradual and insidious encroachment to assist those already in office. I make it clear that I do not like the use of VIP aircraft by party leaders or others during election campaigns. I suspect that once again my disapproval will fall on deaf ears. I think that when the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) spoke he hit the nail on the head when he said that Australians want a voluntary system of party support. That is what I believe. Perhaps my good friend Senator Missen would not always agree. I remember seeing an article by him in which he took the attitude that party costs should be met by the taxpayers, not only election expenses but also other party expenses.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T7">Senator TOWNLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have great difficulty in accepting that line, even though in that article, just to be fair to the honourable senator, I think he pointed out that nearly all parliamentary democracies have some form of public financing. I think the honourable senator pointed out two examples in that article of how money can be both collected and distributed. I am sure the honourable senator will not take affront when I say that he is once again against the stream of public opinion. It is always courageous I think to run against the stream of public opinion. If the honourable senator looks at the survey taken towards the end of last year he will see that three times as many people are against public financing of political parties as are for it. I would love to be the organiser of the 'No' campaign for a referendum on public funding of election campaigns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps when we look at any legislation before this House we should ask ourselves who is benefiting. In the case of federal financing of parties, we need first of all to look at where money, mainly for campaigns, comes from. Basically the money is coming in one way or another from the public. Many individuals contribute to the party of their dreams in one way or another and give an amount of money to that party or individual candidate. I believe that is the way it should be in any democracy. A person interested in a candidate or party can democratically contribute at any time and do so in a democratic way; that is, in a secret way. In other words, people can vote with their money. When the public or taxpayers begin to contribute to the political party obviously party supporters will fall away. I think the Minister made this point. Therefore, we reach the situation where a politician would be much less responsive to the thoughts of the party which in most cases have enabled the politician to get into this place. I do not think that is good for democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not like the idea of interference by bureaucracy or by those who distribute the funds to the party. Obviously, with public financing there will be some type of interference. If the funding were to individuals those individuals would perhaps be in a very difficult situation. I think another point is important. I do not think that members of parliament should know where their money is coming from. It puts them in a very difficult situation. I think financing parties helps to enshrine the status quo. Usually a person or party weould have to achieve a certain percentage of the poll before receiving any assistance under any legislation that i know of. Why any and every individual who stands for election should not be assisted-if we are indeed to have assistance-is beyond me. Equal treatment for everybody in a democracy is important. When it comes to something as basic as an election, the law should certainly apply equally to all. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said that it is difficult to devise acceptable formulae that do not protect sitting members. I might be cynical enough to ask: Which sitting member would vote for something if he did not think that he would benefit from it? In that matter at least I think Senator Gietzelt is consistent. In this place he is consistently asking for alterations to methods of conducting elections, to electoral Acts. Usually he calls this 'reform'. That seems to be the Labor Party's favourite word when it comes to electoral matters. It wants to reform everything. Whenever it wants to change the system to its own benefit, not necessarily to the benefit of the elector, it says it wants to reform the system. </PARA>
<PARA> Today again we have s en another attempt to reform the system for allocation of money that parties get from the public, to reform the bank balances of parties and to reform the whole situation to the benefit of such parties. If that is what a reformist does I am certainly not one. We have only to look at overseas experience to see that if a system like this is started it becomes very difficult and very expensive to account. A lot of the money in overseas countries given to political parties is spent purely on accounting. Senator Chipp mentioned that in some countries people can contribute via a tax form to the party of their choice. As already pointed out that makes it very difficult for an individual candidate. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we all know that in the United States funds are provided for presidential elections but not for election of members or senators. Even with the election of the President it is a voluntary scheme. Our Senate follows closely the example of the United States Senate and our House of Representatives that of the House of Commons. In neither the United States nor England is public assistance given for the running of political parties. The Minister made the point that even though the Labor Party had been in power in England it had not chosen to dip its hand into the public purse to help to run the party. As I have said, I have run a few election campaigns and I have not had a penny for it. I think that it is time we put at rest once and for all these attempts to pounce on the public purse. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the disclosure of donations and limiting of donations bring with them a tremendous number of difficulties. If a candidate knows where his financial support comes from then he may be, or is, placed under some pressure that he would not otherwise be under. Also it leaves supporters in a situation where they can be discriminated against by a party that they do not support. It can easily look as if a government is responding to an interest of a contributor even if it is not, which would make politicians subject to even more public cynicism. I believe we have dealt with this problem for long enough. Obviously the public does not want to be forced into this area of funding of political parties. It does seem morally wrong to force public expenditure upon the parties when it is quite obvious the public does not want this to occur. This is one Australian Labor Party reform that we do not need. It is certainly in no way essential, as was suggested in the discussion of the matter of public importance which Senator Gietzelt brought before us today. I move:</PARA>

<PARA> (3) That, wherever occurring in the Standing Orders, the term ''Chairman of Committees'' or ''Chairman'', when referring to the office of the Chairman of Committees of the Whole, be amended to read ''Deputy-President (Procedure)''. </PARA>
<PARA>Basically the motion seeks to separate functions and to create a new position in the Senate. Of course, it is desirable that we should decide whether we will have these two positions before we proceed to the appointment of people to fill them. This matter has been given a great deal of consideration by a number of people in the Senate, particularly the chairmen of the various standing committees, for more than a year. What is proposed, in brief, is that in future there should be two positions: Firstly, a position of Deputy President (Procedure), to perform the duties which are now basically performed by the Chairman of Committees; and, secondly, a position appropriate to the fact that the Senate has developed a committee system during the last 10 years that must continue to develop. We must see that the future of the committee system is organised so that it does not develop in a haphazard way. The appointed person would hold the position of Deputy President (Committees). This is a completely separate position for the performance of new functions which are not being per- formed at present by any officer, or particularly, by any elected person, in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the matter has received fairly long consideration. The present situation has developed over a number of years. There has been a very considerable increase in the number of committees that the Senate operates. The Senate is well known not only in this country but also in many other countries for the extent to which in 10 or 11 years it has developed a committee system. I believe that is something of which we can be proud. It is important to realise the changes that took place between 1970 and 1980. In 1970 eight staff were employed within the secretariat of Senate committees. Indeed at that time there were only two standing committees and five Estimates committees. Since that time further developments have taken place. There are now eight standing committees, which cover the whole range of the policy issues that come up within the area of the Senate, and six Estimates committees. As at 30 March 1980 there were 49 full time staff servicing the committees. Consequently this is a very active group, and it is important that there ought to be supervision of the effectiveness of that group of employees of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that restrictions have been placed on the size of the staff of the Senate. We know that complaints have been made about this. This has been one of the subjects of consideration by the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing which was chaired by Senator Don Jessop. This Committee reported during the parliamentary recess. One of the problems has been that we have inadequate levels of staff. We understand that there may be a lack of balance as to how that staff is being employed. At the moment no elected member of the Senate has the primary responsibility of seeing how the Senate committee system is operating. We have a Chairman of Committees but, in a sense, that is a misnomer. He is the Chairman of the Senate when the Senate is meeting as Committee of the Whole, but he is not in any sense a chairman of the Senate's committees, nor does he have close knowledge of the operations of those committees. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last year or so a practice has developed whereby the chairmen of the standing committees of the Senate have met, initially on an informal basis and then with some regularity, with the knowledge of the President of the Senate. Matters are constantly reported to the President and as a result we have discussed problems which have arisen in that area. But still the arrangement is comparable to a headless monster. It involves just an informal group of chairmen. Clearly there is a need for someone to whom that group can report and someone who, in return, can assist the chairmen with their problems concerning their committees and staff. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had not only that group of chairmen of committees but also a group of management consultants which were appointed by the President to investigate the efficiency of Senate operations, not only in respect of its committees but also other aspects. Copies of its report have been made available to many honourable senators, including the chairmen, and I think to the leaders of the political parties represented in the Senate. What comes forward clearly from that report is that at this time the Senate committee system is not as fully developed as we would like it to be. There are obvious deficiencies in respect of the referral to Senate standing committees by the Senate, of annual reports of government departments, statutory authorities and other instrumentalities. Unfortunately, evidence discloses that only something like 78 of the 455 reports concerned have been reported on by the respective committees. </PARA>
<PARA> It surely is important that we report more thoroughly to the Senate on documents which are placed on our tables and which, mainly because of lack of staff, are not being dealt with by committees. Clearly, supervision is needed in this area. Suggestions have been made by the management consultants that, among other things, the staffing of committees should be placed under supervision; that a senior clerk of committees should have responsibility in that respect so that he knows whether the committees are working effectively. However, that alone would not be enough. We need a member of the Senate to have responsibility in that area. We in this chamber place great emphasis on our committee system, and rightly so. That is all the more reason for an officer of the Senate to have the job of reporting to this chamber and to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> If we do as Senator Jessop's committee recommended and establish a separate committee to inquire into the financing of the Parliament, if we are to obtain to some extent independence of the Executive Government in determining the financial needs of the Senate, obviously such an officer of the Senate, who would be aware of the needs of the Senate committees, would be a most important officer in terms of advising such a committee as well as in terms of his other functions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate chairmen of committees met and, on 18 August 1980, they reported to Government senators at a party meeting. Copies of that report have been made available to the various political parties represented in this chamber. I propose to read the rcommendations the chairmen made in their report because they are basic to the motion I moved. Paragraph 10 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) That it be acknowledged that the Senate Committee System needs to continue to develop and that some proposals from the Management Consultants could place that development at risk. That in any event the system must not lose its dynamism. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that fact. The Senate committees spend a lot of time examining issues. They proceed throughout the country, bringing this Parliament closer to the people. They obtain ideas and they report them to this chamber. There is a great danger that if their recommendations do not gain ready acceptance or helpful acceptance from the Government we might find a decline in the importance of the Senate committee system. Therefore, it must not lose its dynamism. There is a need for an officer who can emphasise and concentrate on that area. Paragraph 10 (b) of the recommendations stated:</PARA>
<PARA> That although there has been considerable discussion relating to the Senate Committee System over recent years there has been relatively little follow through and therefore relatively little progress-for instance, the matter of some permanent staffing for, or the re-organisation of the role of Estimates Committees has still not been determined; further, the Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committees have, after 10 years, still not developed their Legislative role. </PARA>
<PARA>It is most important that we get past that situation. The House of Representatives has developed legislative committees-not many, but some. The Senate has the ready-made and properly named legislative and general purpose committees. They are standing committees of the Senate. Yet we have not yet got around to determining how Bills will be referred to those committees, which Bills will be referred or what the procedures will be. Our legislative role in that sense is very inchoate. It is not fully developed. Once again, there is a need for an officer to concentrate on the proper development of that role. The third recommendation of the chairmen of committees was:</PARA>
<PARA> That cohesive direction needs to be given to the Senate Committee System in relation to its organisation, administration, operation and effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>I started with that point. I made it clear that we must have more cohesiveness in order to get the best benefit out of the staff we have. We must have proper systems for promotion and we must know what directions the committees are able to take. The fourth recommendation was:</PARA>
<PARA> That subject to the direction of the Senate the Senate Chairman can and should provide that cohesive direction. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph (e) of the recommendations-this comes to the very kernel of this motion- recommends:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate should create a new position of Deputy President (Committees). That this Deputy-President should chair the meetings of the Senate Chairmen and, subject to the President, have the administrative responsibility for the Senate's Committee System and Secretariat. The Deputy-President (Committees) should have equal status with the 'Chairman of Committees' whose functions are, in fact, primarily related to the Chamber. That the present office of Chairman of Committees be changed to Deputy-President (Procedures). </PARA>
<PARA> The Chairmen do not regard the naming of the officers as vital and acknowledge that other Titles could be regarded as preferable. </PARA>
<PARA>We have thrown around other names and suggestions but it seems that this is the most clear way in which we can define the two different tasks, which should be kept separate and which should not really overlap. The next recommendation made by the Senate chairmen was:</PARA>
<PARA> That further consideration be given to the question of the development of a system for proposed legislation being referred to Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committees or otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA>They went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> That future consideration be given to the proposal for abolishing the Estimates Committees and combining their function with that of the Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committees. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not go into that at the moment but it is a matter that needs to be considered. We must consider whether it is more effective to have the two committees working separately or whether these things can be covered by one committee. Again I stress that an officer could guide the chairmen and the Senate by obtaining all the facts on that subject. The next recommendation in the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> That we note that a Select Committee is considering the proposal for a Parliamentary budget and the Senate Chairmen will be interested to consider the findings. </PARA>
<PARA>The next point states:</PARA>
<PARA> That there should, consistent with the creation of the office of Deputy President (Committees) be a Senate Clerk Assistant (Committees) to administer the Senate committee system. </PARA>
<PARA>There is an obvious corollary for that: There needs to be someone whose primary responsibility is to co-ordinate with the staff. The last recommendation states:</PARA>
<PARA> That the foregoing be implemented forthwith and that further proposed developments be put forward by the Senate Chairmen to the Senate Party Room during this session. </PARA>
<PARA>Nearly a year has gone by since that report. It has taken some time and I think it is high time now that we were in a position to elect officers from this Senate. We should take up those recommendations, which I believe are sensible ones. It is important to realise that the proposed new officer will not be somebody who will overlap with or interfere with the job which is being done now by the Chairman of Committees who, under the new title of Deputy President (Procedure), will retain his existing responsibility in the chamber. The new officer will have responsibility for the prestige and development of our system as it operates outside the chamber, for what we do under the committee system. I urge senators from all parties to recognise that this is an important point in the history of this system. We must not let the committee system drift at this stage. Our intention in putting forward this proposal is to avoid that. I do not go into the question in detail. I know that advice has been obtained as to what might be the salary for this office. That would be a matter for the President and the Remuneration Tribunal to determine, based on the number of responsibilities which the President gives altogether to the new officer. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not go into the precise terms of the motion because I think it will be seen that they follow logically in changing the Standing Orders to accommodate these two separate positions. It should be borne in mind that we have developed up to a certain stage a committee system which is worthily recognised as one of the best and most positive achievements of the Senate and which is regarded as an example in the democratic world. But I think we must go ahead with it at this stage, realising that it needs a certain amount of co-ordination and an officer, whom we would call Deputy President (Committees). He would help in the supervision of those committees and in the presentation of their reports to this chamber. Therefore, with the greatest of sincerity I urge members of the Senate to support this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to Senator Jessop in a moment. The fact of the matter is that if the Government had adopted the proper procedures in relation to this question, if it had been so concerned about this historical moment in the history of the Senate, it would have consulted with the Opposition and the Australian Democrats in some detail and at some length, explaining the nature of the proposal. But let us look at what has happened. I am a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Standing Orders. Let us look at what happened at the meeting of the Standing Orders Committee on Monday, 1 December 1980, which I think, was the first time I ever heard of this proposition. Under the heading in paragraph 5 'Appointment of Deputy President', the minutes state:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee discussed a proposal for the appointment of two Deputy-Presidents. </PARA>
<PARA>I might interpolate that the discussion was pretty brief. The minutes continue:</PARA>
<PARA> It was agreed that the matter be further considered at the next meeting. </PARA>
<PARA>There has been no such meeting. To pop this matter in here today without that meeting having taken place is, in my view, quite extraordinary. But it is quite clear to us on the Opposition side that the Government has not even made up its mind about this important issue; that there is no great burning conviction amongst all the members of the Government parties about it. If there is, how is one to understand the report of the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing which was brought down by Senator Missen in the Senate only yesterday. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Missen" NAMEID="YL7">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry. That is a point of substance equal only to the one raised only a moment ago by the honourable senator. That Committee which brought down a report yesterday seems to use terminology passing strange, very much akin to the terminology which is being used in relation to the Missen proposition. At pages 21 and 22 of that report the Committee discusses what the work of a Senate appropriations and staffing committee would be. The report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a first step, it is recommended that the Senate establish a Standing Committee to be known as the Senate Appropriations and Staffing Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed that the Committee would be chaired by the President and would comprise 6 other members-the Leader of the Government in the Senate to represent the Executive, and two other Government Senators, and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and two other Senators not being members of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a perfectly proper suggestion if we are talking about the management of the business of the Senate and the management of the committees of the Senate. The report then goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The Standing Committee would be charged with the responsibility for the consideration of the proposed estimates for the Senate and the consideration of staffing proposals affecting the Senate and its Committees. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 6.10 states:</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to staffing, the Committee would examine proposals seeking to vary the organisational structure of the Senate and its Committees, and staffing and recruitment policies and make recommendations to the President. It would report to the Senate on any matter it considered necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it would be bordering on the bizarre for this procedure which Senator Missen has introduced to proceed today without a consideration of and debate on that report and an understanding amongst honourable senators as to what it means. What that report recommends is a bipartisan approach to the management of the Senate committees, their staffing and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be said that the report does not mean what I have just said at all. Senator Jessop may well jump and say: 'That is an entirely different issue'. Perhaps the new Deputy President will perform some different function. If that be so, then it is a matter which should properly be discussed in the context of this report and in the context of the motion moved by Senator Missen. But that facility, that courtesy, has not been accorded to senators generally. We are not going to embark upon a course which may create a new little cabal of Government chairmen of committees, with a supremo sitting at the head of the table, which discusses the staffing and the financing of the committees, as well as the terms of reference of the committees, how they relate to one another and whether they overlap. We will not be parties to supporting a nice little cosy golden handshake cabal like that without having a much better understanding of the whole proposition than we have been allowed to gain to date or without being given the courtesy of being able to discuss and debate the matter in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposal by-passes the Standing Orders Committee. In fact it ignores a decision of the Standing Orders Committee, which was that this matter should be discussed in that Committee before, in the normal course of events, going into the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the time I have been in the Parliament this is the first time an attempt has been made to change Standing Orders by bringing in a motion of this nature and having it considered by the Senate in this fashion. Quite obviously no opportunity is to be given to the Senate to consider these very important amendments to Standing Orders in the usual way. What is the usual way? The usual way is that the Senate Standing Committee on Standing Orders gives consideration to proposals for amendments to Standing Orders. When its report comes to the Senate-to my knowledge there has been no deviation from this practice-invariably it is considered by the Senate in the Committee of the Whole. In other words, members of the Senate need not feel obliged to restrict their comments in their opening speech but can exchange points of view across the chamber in the Committee of the Whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will come to some of the points in the proposition and point out precisely where such consideration would improve the document that is before us. The first time I knew of this proposition was approximately two weeks ago. Mr President, as you and other honourable senators know, having read in the Press of the decision of the Government parties to proceed with a move to establish two Deputy Presidents, I was not prepared to vote in respect of even one of those positions until such time as I knew the functions of both of them if both positions were to be established. The Senate, without dissent, agreed to that proposition on Tuesday of this week. From what Senator Missen has said we still do not know precisely what are to be the functions and ultimately the responsibilities of the new position of Deputy President (Committees). All we are told in the proposition is that under new Standing Order 28A that office holder will perform such duties and exercise such authority as the President may determine. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, I raise this matter with you, Mr President. I am not a lawyer but my view is that you would not have the ability to delegate your authority to such a person because under the Public Service Act you have the ultimate authority in respect of the employees in your Department. From what Senator Missen has said we are given to understand-if we are to give credence to what Senator Missen has said and I see no reason why we should not-that the main purpose is to corral 49 staff at the Canberra Hotel. I assume that other matters would be involved. Senator Missen did mention that there are areas of overlap in respect of committee references and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> I will deal with the first point first. Mr President, under the Public Service Act you have authority over those persons in your Department. With respect, you as President of this chamber will be receiving $20,000-odd more than the rest of us to assist you in performing your functions as President of the Senate. You have a relatively small Department compared with other departments. Your Department consists of something like 170 people. Of course, you have to be in the chamber but Standing Orders recognise that your duties will take you out of the chamber. On your own warrant you have the power to appoint, as you have done, at least two Temporary Chairmen of Committees to look after the procedures in this chamber. That enables you to do what Ministers are able to do, and that is to look after your Department. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that your departmental responsibilities are not as onerous as those of some other Ministers in the Government who have to attend to the Parliament and who have under their authority thousands of public servants throughout the length and breadth of this country. We are being asked to appoint another Deputy President to do what essentially is your job, sir, or the job of the Chairman of Committees. What does the Chairman of Committees do for his extra $8,000? Let us look at what the Chairman of Committees is supposed to be doing. I feel that it is not very good for the Government which is talking about tightening the belt--</PARA>

The way in which this matter has come before this chamber does not enable us to have that exchange of views across the chamber which we are normally able to have when considering changes in Standing Orders. We are not in the Committee of the Whole at present. If we were we would be pointing to some of the oddities in this proposal, including the oddity which occurs in proposed new Standing Order 30A which talks about what happens should both the President and Deputy President (Committees) be unavoidably absent. It states that the senior Chairman of Committees shall perform the duties. Who is the senior Chairman of Committees? How is he defined? What commitees is he the senior Chairman of? What is meant by senior? Does it mean the oldest or the longest serving chairman? The proposed new Standing Order goes on to state:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the senior Chairman of Committees shall perform the duties and exercise the authority of President in relation to the Standing, Select and Estimates Committees of the Senate and the Joint Committees . . . , for that day only, and the appointment so made shall be notified to the Senate by the Deputy-President (Procedure). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the honourable senator had better get back to the drawing board. There are quite a number of these problems and the honourable senator should look at them. I have dealt with the first point; that you, sir, have authority over your relatively small department. The second point relates to the question of the overlapping of references to particular committees. Of course, our function is to ensure in the initial stages, after establishing a select committee or making a reference to a standing committee, that we do not draft the terms with any overlap. That is our responsibility. We do not need a new Deputy President to do that. Also, it is wise at times for the chairmen to get together but in my view they ought to be got together under your presidency because you have the ultimate responsibility and it is to you, ultimately, that questions go. For example, at the moment I understand it is you who determine whether outside consultants are to be appointed to assist the committees in their work. It is you and you alone. If there is any matter for concern, it ought to go to you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree with what Senator Button has said. This matter should have gone through the Standing Orders Committee so that all of these wrinkles could have been ironed out. It has not done so; Government senators have decided to bring this proposal to us in a most extraordinary fashion, in a fashion in which such a matter, from my experience in the Senate, has never been brought to us before. Always a recommendation has been brought down from the Standing Orders Committee and we have then discussed it as a Committee of the Whole so that due debate and cross-fertilisation of ideas could proceed. It should not be done in this fashion, trying to roll it through the Senate in the way that is being attempted today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank Senator Missen for his continual concern for the effectiveness of the committees of this chamber. As the Australian Democrats have previously indicated, we do not necessarily disagree in principle with the creation of the position of an extra deputy president. However, having listened to arguments from honourable senators on both sides over the last two days, we are not persuaded that the establishment of such a position is at the moment necessary or desirable. We believe that any proposal which is put forward for the creation of a new position in this chamber-certainly one of such importance as that of a presiding officer-should have an extemely convincing case attached to it. We do not believe that such a case has been presented and therefore it would be wrong of this chamber to appropriate public moneys for expenditure on such a position. The Government has often talked about the need for restraint. We believe this may be another case in which restraint should be exercised. To have three presiding officers in a chamber of 64 members would probably make us unique in the Western world and certainly would overload the administrative element at the top.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the major concerns circulated involves the staff of the committees. They are part of the Department of the Senate and, as Senator Harradine has clearly pointed out, come under the control of the President of the Senate. Therefore, they are directly under the control of a senator who fulfils the task of the President. If the Government feels that the load on the President of the Senate is excessive, adequate assistance can be given by the person holding the position of Chairman of Committees. The Chairman of Committees performs the duties and exercises the authority of the President in his absence, and takes the chair whenever requested to do so by the President. Standing Order 28 also specifies that the Chairman of Committees shall take the chair in the Committee whenever the Senate resolves itself into a Committee of the Whole. Relief from these duties, if they are too onerous, is provided by the panel of temporary chairmen appointed to give such relief. The Parliamentary Presiding Officers Act 1965 provides, in essence, that if the Presiding Officer dies, is absent from the Commonwealth or is incapable by reason of illness of exercising any powers or functions under the law of the Commonwealth, the Chairman of Committee shall, for the purpose of the exercise of such powers, be deemed to be the presidng officer. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, it seems that, as has been traditionally established, under Standing Orders, it is highly appropriate that the control of the staff of the committees of the Senate should fall readily under the control of the Chairman of Committees. It seems to us that the efficiency of the committee system will not be necessarily increased by the appointment of a third person. The appropriation of moneys has not been sufficiently argued for. Therefore, we do not see that it would be inappropriate for those additional responsibilities put forward by Senator Missen to be formally referred to the Chairman of Committees and carried out by him. In conclusion, we hope that we may proceed as soon as possible to the election of this chamber's Chairman of Committees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make a few comments in this debate. I suggest that Senator Macklin is not fully aware of the importance of the committee system in the Senate or of the thrust behind the proposition before us. I believe it is a very important matter. If we are to persist with the committee system it is important that there be some restructuring of the staffing arrangements and the administration generally to give full effect to it. I object very strongly to Senator Button's allegation that this is a 'Rae report'. That is quite untrue. Senator Rae happened to be the spokesman for the committee of Senate standing commitee chairmen. I had a considerable input into that report and other honourable senators contributed in a similar way. It was up to Senator Rae to put the proposition to the Government party room to get approval for the proposition that flowed from many weeks of discussions in the interest and spirit of helping the Senate committee system and helping this chamber, including the new members from the Australian Democrats, to become more effective. I am very pleased to say that Senator Mason is on my committee and has contributed a tremendous amount to it. I am looking forward to continuing the co-operation that has always existed on our committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the great things about the Senate is that we can submerge personalities in our committee system. We can offer to the government of the day constructive criticism about what it ought to be doing in certain policy matters. I believe that is one of the challenges we can meet here, and so be quite effective. I am happy to offer to a government criticism, constructive as it always is, in regard to what course it should be taking in regard to formulating policy for the future. The committee system lends us that capacity because we go out among the public, we have public hearings and we call evidence from interested people throughout the community on the subject before us. Having sifted through that evidence and having made a judgment on what the electorate at large wants, we present in this chamber, I am very pleased to say in regard to my committee, unanimous, tripartite, tripartisan recommendations. That is important to remember. I, for one, believe it is in that sort of spirit that the Senate should recognise the need to retain adequate staff. That is the reason behind my first recommendation to the Senate chairmen. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggested that this sort of structure would be good because in the past, as committee chairmen and as members of committees, we have found that we have lost staff because an adequate career structure has not been provided in this Senate to ensure that the experienced officers who advise and help us with our work are retained. Time and again we see that a senior, very experienced, intelligent officer is attracted outside, either into private enterprise or into government departments. Therefore the Senate loses and the committee system loses as well. It is in that spirit that we have come forward with a proposition that was accepted by the Government parties. </PARA>
<PARA> It is untrue to say that the Opposition was not aware of that report because I know for a fact that copies of it were distributed for the information of the Opposition towards the end of last year, certainly before the Parliament rose. In February this year copies were made avialable for distribution to anyone else who cared to examine the recommendations. I am surprised to learn that Senator Harradine says he was only made aware of this report two weeks ago. I think that is incredible because these reports were distributed about this Parliament like confetti. Knowing how one or two documents can be leaked and how everyone in Australia seems to find out about that, it amazes me that 70 or 80 reports floating around would not attract the attention of interested senators. </PARA>

I know that the Australian Democrats are interested in the committee system. I have proof of that by the active work Senator Mason has done on my Committee. I would have thought that the Leader of the Opposition would have been above the sort of unfair allegation he made in suggesting that this proposal was conceived and contrived by Senator Peter Rae. That is totally untrue. I believe it is totally reprehensible on his part to suggest such a thing because a lot of us on the Senate Chairmen's Committee we are talking about had an input. I suggest that if we do not have the numbers to deal with this now, the Standing Orders Committee, through you, Mr President, be called together as a matter of urgency and that the matter be discussed. Then we can come back into this place and vote on it and, I hope, attract the full support of this chamber. It is a progressive move designed to make the committee system in this place far more effective. It is effective now but I believe that we need to provide this career structure. We need to have a Deputy President (Committees) and a Deputy Clerk (Committees). The Deputy Clerk (Committees) would be responsible to the Clerk of the Senate, as the Deputy President (Committees) would be responsible to the President. We need to provide the opportunity for a career structure in this place so that we can retain effective members of the staff to advise us and to make sure our representations through this chamber and our recommendations to the government of the day are taken notice of. I ask the new senators and the more experienced Australian Democrats here to have regard to that point. I know that the Australian Labor Party, which purported to be at the forefront of the establishment of this system, will agree with what I have said and will recognise the importance of it at the appropriate time.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Jessop tells us that a report on a possible extra Chairman of Committees and Deputy President has been around for several months. A report was around, but it was a very brief one containing a very scanty outline of what was in mind. I think it was presented to senators at the end of last year.

<PARA> In relation to staffing, the Committee would examine proposals seeking to vary the organisational structure of the Senate and its Committees, and staffing and recruitment policies and make recommendations to the President. It would report to the Senate on any matter it considered necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the way to do it. The result of the honourable senator's proposal will be a committee of chairmen of committees of this Senate, who will all be government senators, and a new Deputy President who will almost certainly be a government senator. That is not a bipartisan approach. I believe that that is not the way to go about the procedure. As Senator Harradine and others have pointed out, we already have a Chairman of Committees and a President in this place. We do not have a very big staff. It would seem to us that adequate powers and conditions exist for both those people to conduct the procedures that the honourable senator wants this new office to take over. Therefore, I suggest, rather than as Senator Jessop suggested-that if he does not have the numbers to get this proposition through today we should put it off for another week and see whether we can get the numbers-we should vote on it now and get on and elect a Chairman of Commitees in this place, which we should have done two days ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Missen has already put forward substantial arguments for this proposal. In response, very clear arguments have been put forward by the Opposition, by the Australian Democrats and, in particular, by Senator Harradine as to the inadequacy of the proposition as far as they are concerned. An objection being raised is that this matter is being rushed. It has not been referred to the Senate Standing Orders Committee and earlier documents in one form or another were not sufficiently circulated on an informal basis. I am of a mind to move that this matter be now referred to the Standing Orders Committee, but I do not do so at this stage. I understand that such was the form of words of the procedural motion moved by Senator Harradine on Tuesday that we would not be able to proceed to the election of the Chairman of Committees if this matter was referred to the Standing Orders Committee. I think it is appropriate that we elect a Chairman of Committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to see the Senate consider this matter again but only after the report has been sufficiently circulated for discussion and after the Standing Orders Committee has considered it and the objections that have been raised, largely on procedural grounds, in the debate this afternoon have been taken into account. I return to the very real merits of Senator Missen's original argument. My only regret is that, because of these procedural aspects, which, frankly, do lie at the feet of Government supporters, there has not been a sufficient unanimity of view in the Senate today to enable this matter properly to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> The only reflection that I wish to make, as one Government senator, is that the rush this week has come about almost entirely because of the quite proper procedural motion put down by Senator Harradine, and that before we consider electing the Chairman of Committees the Senate ought to know how many Deputy Presidents are to be proposed. That is a quite proper suggestion. If that had not been moved I do not believe that this matter would have been so quickly, as it were, rushed on to the Senate business paper. That is the error of judgment, if you like, the reason, as I see it for Government members rushing ahead. I do not see it as any intended discourtesy to other honourable senators. In such an important matter it is necessary that all honourable senators of all parties and views be able to give it full consideration. Therefore, as one Government senator, I believe that there has been an error of judgment in regard to timing. It is one which is innocent and easily explainable. I hope that the substantial reasons that Senator Missen has put forward can be revived by the matter, in due course, being reintroduced and referred to the appropriate Standing Orders Committee. </PARA>

That is reflected in the unanimous reports that have been brought down and in the agreements reached on them. It has been reflected in this chamber in the much better temper and standard of debate on these matters. Let us not forget that the committee system has achieved something in the last 10 years, or that very easily it could slip away and become something of an irrelevance in this whole parliamentary setup. I fear that we may be on that route if we do not do something now to try to get over the present hump and try to ensure that we have control of the development of the committee system and make the most effective use of the staff.

The Presiding Officers do not include the proposed new Deputy Chairman (Committees). He would not preside in this chamber and would have no responsibility in that regard. His responsibility would be outside the chamber and with the committees. But the honourable senator says: 'It is not raised and it was not dealt with'. I think it should have been raised more vigorously in the last Parliament with the Standing Orders Committee. I agree with that and criticism can be made on that score.

We now have to elect officers of the Senate. Therefore I think we ought to try to be a little less conservative.

<PARA>Senator Harradine wanted spelt out in some detail exactly what the Deputy President should do. To do that would be most foolish. If in fact we spelt out his duties and if other things developed in the course of this Parliament he would be stuck with what was determined.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not come to that point. I ask the honourable senator just to wait. I will deal first with another point raised by the honourable senator. The honourable senator tried to suggest that the proposed Standing Order did not spell out or give an idea of what the President should do and that it was inadequate. It is not inadequate. The President is fully competent to and capable of giving directions as to where his authority shall end and where it might be extended. The proposed Standing Order sufficiently sets out a purpose which would make very clear what the new officer should do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me come immediately to the point mentioned by Senator Harradine. The honourable senator says that the President should do all this. The honourable senator made some snide remark about the President receiving an extra $28,000 or something. He said that therefore the President should do all these things, that he has the ultimate responsibility. Of course he has the ultimate responsibility. But this does not mean that he has the responsibility for doing everything around the place, nor does it mean he could possibly act in that way. Any officer, whether it be the President or someone else, who cannot delegate, is not competently doing his duty. Of course, the President cannot preside over all meetings of the Chairmen. He cannot do all the things that are necessary. He cannot supervise what is going on in the secretariat and so fourth. It is wrong to suggest that the President should be expected to do that. Senator Harradine went on to say that the President should get one of the chairmen to carry out these duties. Because the Chairmen have to preside in this place they could not perform them either. Therefore I suggest that the honourable senator's so-called criticism of the Standing Order is pettyfogging. There are in fact no wrinkles on this proposal which has been drawn up with the great assistance of the Clerks. I think it competently provides for what is proposed. </PARA>

<PARA> Finally, as Senator Grimes said, he has known about this proposal since the end of last year. I do not know whether the honourable senator has made any criticism of the terms of this proposal. However, he makes the point that the report of Senator Jessop's Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing, of which I was a member, is somehow inconsistent with what is proposed today. It is not. Of course, if that Committee's recommendations about staffing, separating the appropriations and getting control back in the Parliament for these appropriations are adopted I expect that the Deputy President-Committees will be a member of that proposed committee if it is appointed. It would be very desirable for him to be on that committee so that he could advise. I said that in the course of my first speech. So there is nothing inconsistent whatsoever between that report which came in during the recess and the recommendations which we put before the Senate today. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether the proposal wins today is not perhaps the question. It may be that unless some members of the Senate do have a second thought about this it may lose. I say to honourable members that I believe they will do a very damaging blow to the future development of the committee system if they reject this proposal because the reasons for rejection have been specious. I can understand that there has been some ruffling of feathers for which, if honourable senators like, I will make an apology. But I suggest that the overall proposal will improve the Senate committee system and it is therefore worthy of support. I urge honourable senators to vote for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, at the outset I congratulate you on your election to the high office of President of the Senate. I have congratulated you privately but this is the first opportunity I have had to do so publicly. Despite our great political differences you and I should be able to work fairly well together in the interests of the Senate, because I recall that in the days when I was a Minister in the Labor Government for a time you were my shadow Minister. We knocked a few rough spots off one another in those days, so from here on in the body politic in the administration of the Senate, I hope, will be pretty smooth. I am very conscious of the great honour that has been bestowed upon me, firstly by my colleagues of the Labor movement by choosing me as their candidate for the position of Chairman of Committees of the Senate, and secondly by a majority of honourable senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must admit that for the last two or three days I have felt a bit like that character Hanrahan but now I feel as if I am somewhat like Cazaly. However, all members of the Australian Labor Party believe in democracy and in the system of parliamentary government. We believe in parliamentary democracy and in free, frank and open political debate. For some time this Parliament has been under great stress and subject to many strains and public criticisms in that many citizens of Australia have regarded the Parliament as a rubber stamp in the hands of the Executive. I hope that in my new role in this place I will be able to join with you, Mr President, and the rest of our colleagues, in re-establishing the credibility of Parliament and its supremacy over the Executive. Whilst at all times I will remain a loyal member of the Australian Labor Party, I hope to be able to work in liaison with all honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate Senator Scott on the run that he made. Despite our political differences he and I are very good friends. In this Parliament we represent a great State. He and I have been elected by the people of that State to represent them in the forthcoming six years. I thank all honourable senators for their support, congratulations and best wishes. I sincerely trust that I will carry out the job to their satisfaction. In having their support and best wishes I hope I will have their patience and understanding also. </PARA>

Although I have lost this ballot, I am happy that the winner is Senator Douglas McClelland. I have known Senator McClelland for many years and although he does not share my political philosophy, nor I his, I regard him as a friend. I am sure that his very long service in the Senate will serve him well. I am sure that he will serve the Senate well and retain the dignity and constructive nature of the Senate in the days, weeks and, I guess, years that lie ahead. I should thank my colleagues in the coalition for their support. I had the privilege and honour to be Deputy President of the Senate in 1978-79. I had the support of my colleagues then and, I believe, the support of the Opposition. I appreciate the support of my coalition colleagues on this occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am proud to call him a personal friend, and I have done so for some time. He has the balance of judgment, the dignity and the fairmindedness to make a first class Chairman of Committees. In addition, he has an excellent knowledge of the Standing Orders. I digress for a moment to pay as high a tribute as I can to the loser. I also have had an enormous regard for Senator Scott over the years. The reason my congratulations go to Senator McClelland has nothing whatever to do with the character of Senator Scott and the kind of person he is.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate you, Mr President, as so many others have done, on your election to the high office of President of the Senate. I am sure that you will carry out your job in an excellent way. On this occasion I address myself to three major areas of the communications network, namely, television, telephone and broadcasting services, which are in dire need of upgrading and strengthening in Queensland. The State that I represent is enormous, stretching some 2,400 kilometres from Brisbane to the islands of the Torres Strait beyond Cape York and westward more than 1,600 kilometres out to Birdsville and beyond. That gives honourable senators an idea of the large area of land I am talking about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Furthermore, the population of Queensland is increasing at the enormous rate of 2.29 per cent a year compared with a 1.34 per cent increase for Australia as a whole. In fact, last year more than 50,000 people came to Queensland to settle, many from Victoria and New South Wales. With such distances to contend with and with an ever-increasing population, one can see that Queensland is an exceptional State with exceptional needs when it comes to adequate communication services. Whilst it is true that telephone and other communications needs in many areas of Australia are inadequate or unsatisfactory, the problem is particularly acute in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> As fellow senators will be aware, over the past 10 or so years I have travelled extensively in the State of Queensland. No matter where I go or to whom I talk, the problem of inadequate and, in some cases, non-existent telephone services is always a major worry. In fact, during the recent parliamentary recess I spent three weeks making an extensive tour of the south-western, western, northern and north-western areas of Queensland where I met with people and talked to them about their problems. For people living outside the major metropolitan and provincial areas, the telephone is very often the only means of communication with the outside world, so to speak. Yet in these rural areas there is still discrimination against families who need and want telephone services. Present charges by the Australian Telecommunications Commission for erecting the required telephone lines amount to approximately $160 a half kilometre. This makes it financially impossible for some people even to consider having the telephone connected. In addition to that, a special rental charge of $380 for those outside the free entitlement area places an unfair burden on those people already disadvantaged by distance. Surely some of the excessive profits made by Telecom each year could be devoted to making a standard installation charge and also a standard call charge available to every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> We must not forget that people living and working in remote areas of Australia are involved in industries which earn a huge slice of export income for all Australians each year, thus contributing towards a high standard of living, which most Australians enjoy-a standard which includes a telephone for an annual rental of $120 for businesses or $85 for private use. Surely, then, the time has come for a complete overhaul and updating of telephone installation policy, aimed at setting a standard installation fee and yearly rental for all subscribers, regardless of residence. After all, postage stamps cost the same, no matter what the cost of delivering the letter might be. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only the people of rural Queensland who are suffering from inadequate telephone services. The Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast areas of Queensland, which are experiencing phenomenal growth rates, are growing in telephone demand much more quickly than any other areas in the nation. The system is so overloaded in both of these areas, for example, that many businesses and indeed some private subscribers do not even attempt to make outgoing calls during the first few hours of each work-day because of the almost continual engaged signals received. Impossible as it may sound, instances have been given to me of school classes going without teachers because, though the stand-by teacher was in the house and near the phone all day, the phone did not ring. Indeed, the principal making the calls for assistance simply could not get through. </PARA>
<PARA> Other Telecom charges which should be looked at include those levied as overtime charges on business houses which move their services and request weekend or holiday work. I know of one business house in Brisbane which was charged $3,200 for work done on Anzac Day, when practically all of the work had been completed during normal work-hours before that day. This transfer led to a task force of eight men being employed on Anzac Day. Furthermore, the work was not correctly done and more technicians had to visit the office and fix the system during the Monday, at great inconvenience to the business, not to mention, of course, the added cost. Surely in an age of space shuttle programs, men on the moon and incredible computer feats, it is not too much to ask that taxpaying Australians have access to adequate telephone services. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the problems of television and broadcasting services in Queensland. I have received many representations from people, not only in Queensland but also all over Australia, expressing concern at the poor quality of television services available to those Australians who do not happen to live in the golden triangle of Sydney-Melbourne-Canberra or in other capital or major provincial cities. Indeed, for many, there will be no television at all until the satellite program gears up further. I will talk about that shortly. However, for some the service is at best marginal because of the low power of the translator or repeater stations which have been erected. Some complaints have been made that specific area needs were not taken into consideration sufficiently when the height of the towers and the powers of the transmitters were decided. Other complaints centre on the poor quality of Australian broadcasting-television and radio-especially where the Australian Broadcasting Commission is the only service available, which is the situation in much of western Queensland. Whilst I applaud the ABC for its achievements in the field of television programs and in much radio broadcasting, I do feel that the lack of drama and features on ABC Radio 3 in particular is a matter of concern to many rural dwellers. At a time when in Britain and Europe drama and features are considered to be an essential part of radio programming, not only from the point of view of the listeners but also from the point of view of the writing and acting professions, the ABC is allowing a reduction in these programs. What little drama the ABC does have to offer it denies to country people by not broadcasting it through ABC Radio 3. </PARA>
<PARA> The ABC, I know, has claimed that cutbacks in government funding are responsible for the continuing reduction in drama and features and the continuing denial to rural people of what some have called intelligent radio. Thus, this week's announcement by Treasurer John Howard that the ABC will receive $234m in this financial year, which is an increase of 22.6 per cent on last year including $12.1m for the Commission as host broadcaster for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane and $16m to meet employer superannuation liabilities, is timely, and will certainly be welcomed by the ABC and by rural dwellers. Further, the $9.7m which has been allocated to improve and extend the national broadcasting and television service network, including facilities used for Radio Australia, will be a great help in improving those very services to country areas about which I have just spoken. </PARA>
<PARA> However, even with this increase in funds, it will still be a question of priorities in programming, deciding in which areas the ABC feels the greatest needs are. It seems to me that there must be a rearrangement of priorities so that what money there is will be utilised to the best advantage of all people. For most people living outside the capital cities, particularly in areas where there is no television, the ABC radio is their lifeline to any form of news, fine music and drama. There are no professional theatres in these places-no professional orchestras-such as people living in the city and provincial areas are able to enjoy and take so much for granted. What the ABC does not provide, people living in remote country areas simply do not get. It is to be hoped that the introduction of the Intelsat IV satellite system, which forms the basis for a comprehensive program to bring television to remote areas throughout Queensland and Australia, will help to alleviate some of the communication frustrations experienced by western Queenslanders. This program has already enabled approximately 50 remote locations to receive television services during the 1980-81 period, and a further 20 stations throughout Australia will be established in 1981-82. The recent launching of broadcasting stations at Bedourie, Birdsville, Injune, Tambo and Quilpie indeed heralded the start of a new era in communications for remote areas of Queensland. I look forward to seeing similar operations begin broadcasting from other isolated centres in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> During the last session of this Parliament we also saw the launching of the Hills Telesat satellite receiving system, which is, I believe, the first commercial system to improve outback television reception. This system is capable of receiving signals from Intelsat IV and enables a large area right across Australia to receive colour television. Hopefully the introduction of satellite communications will also open up the way for the much-needed improved telephone communications. I suppose one could say that with the introduction of the Government's program remote areas of the State are now only a satellite's throw away from the rest of the world. Indeed, I certainly hope so. I am proud to speak on behalf of the people of the remote areas of Queensland when I ask the Government to consider the facts and to work towards ensuring that these basic needs, which most of us would take for granted, are met. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few remarks on transport and communications. Firstly I want to reply to what Senator Bjelke-Petersen has been saying about telephone charges.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It must have been yesterday when she asked a question about the matter. She made no mention of the fact that the country charges ought to be reduced to the charges which now apply in the cities. Senator Bjelke-Petersen is saying that they should be equalised. Of course, this Government will not reduce any charges, as we all know. The Government may take up her suggestion and before we know where we are all the people in this country who live in the city will be paying the same as people who live in the country for a telephone connection. I remind Senator Bjelke-Petersen of the pork barrelling that went on in Queensland prior to the Australian Labor Party coming into government in 1972 when Lionel Bowen, the member for Kingsford-Smith, became the Postmaster-General. When he went through all the dockets in the Postmaster-General's Department he found that a great many telephone connections were being made in Country Party electorates in Queensland which was costing the Australian taxpayer in the vicinity of $25,000 a connection.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a fact. I have seen the dockets. It is no use Senator Bjelke-Petersen saying 'no' because I saw the dockets when I was on a committee. That is what the Australian taxpayer was having to pay under a Liberal-Country Party Government. The present Federal Government is wagged by the National Country Party, as it calls itself. As soon as the Country Party falls into disrepute with the electors it changes its name. As I have said in this place on many occasions I am proud to be a member of a political party which has never had to change its name because it has fallen into disrepute with the electors. We are pleased to fly under the flag of the Labor Party come what may, but this is not the case with the people who sit opposite. We can go right back into history: Every time there was a problem and the name of that party fell into disfavour the party changed its political name and tried to hoodwink the people into thinking its whole policy had changed. The policy is the same but the name has changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is something like what has happened with the Australian National Railways Commission to which I will refer shortly. That matter involved another enormous waste of public money. I remind Senator Bjelke-Petersen that Queenslanders are very well to the fore when it comes to pork barrelling for their own supporters but not when it comes to the general public who live in Queensland. I hope that Senator Bjelke-Petersen did not mean what she was inferring, that is, that city people should have to pay the same charges for telephone connections as country people pay. We know that the revenue gained by Telecom Australia from the city connections and the business people is far in excess of what it gains from country people. I am a country member; I live in the country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am not asking for my charges to be reduced at all because I think if the honourable senator follows through the philosophy of her party she will find that it is that the user pays. Why does the honourable senator want the people who live in country towns to subsidise some of the very few people who have to live in the far-flung areas? I have had to work and live in far-flung areas for the greater part of my life. There are certain compensations for those who live in country areas, particularly for primary producers. I was a primary producer. I know of all the concessions that are given to primary producers by way of the Australian Taxation Office. They are not as badly treated as Senator Bjelke-Petersen would have us believe. A booklet is put out by the Taxation Office which shows all the ways people can get remissions on their taxes if they are legitimate primary producers, and, believe you me, they are used to the full. So primary producers are not as badly done by as Senator Bjelke-Petersen would have us believe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I return to the matter I really want to talk about, and that is the railway system in Australia. I have spoken about it before. I refer to the enormous waste of money by the Australian National Railways Commision. It expended $409,000 recently just to drop the word 'Railways' from the name Australian National Railways. It used always to be known as the Australian National Railways. If I telephone the Australian National Railways what is the answer I receive from the receptionist at head office? She says: 'Australian National'. I then ask the girl on the switch: 'Australian National what? Is it the Australian national health scheme or the Australian national dental scheme?' The girl then has to say: 'It's you again, Senator'. She says that I should speak to Dr Williams because he is the man responsible. I have said to her on many occasions: 'I am not blaming you. It is not your fault'. I have raised the matter many times in the Parliament and Dr Williams has not been drawn into writing to me to point out where I am wrong and he is right. No doubt he reads my remarks; they would be given to him by the Department of Transport. He would have read every word I have said in severe criticism of him. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also presented many petitions in this Parliament from many residents and past users of the railways in South Australia complaining about the policy of the ANR in curtailing country rail services and, in particular, increasing rail freights for the delivery of small parcels to country areas. It has got to the stage now where people who operate small businesses in the country cannot afford to trade with the railways. It is cheaper to send their parcels by post. The Australian Postal Commission has a contract with the railways. It charges the user less than what the railways charge, and because of its contract rates it sends all articles in a canvas bag on the railways. So the railways are still carting the articles. The Postal Commission is taking business away from the railways. If people do not send articles by post they are blackmailed by small carriers. </PARA>
<PARA> I had an instance of a businessman in my town who had a small parcel sent from Melbourne. He asked for it to be sent by rail but because the railways will not take small parcels as they want articles to be sent in container lots the parcel was sent by road. It went to Melbourne through Murray Bridge at a certain price and was sent with another carrier back to Murray Bridge. The freight cost the man more than the articles he had bought. How did he get out of that situation? He then had to add that freight price onto the cost of the articles before he sold it just to break even, which made the item cost much more than people would pay in the metropolitan areas. Of course, country people do not buy from the small country business people. They go to the metropolitan areas and buy from the supermarkets. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the policy of this Government on transport and, in particular, railways. That is what the Government is doing to small business in the country areas, particularly in South Australia. That is where I have the concrete evidence of this happening. The Government puts itself up to be a government which supports the well-being of small business but it is doing its very best to kill it and hand over everything to big business. We all know what will happen in the not too distant future when small businesses, particularly those in major country towns and smaller country towns, will have to close because they cannot make a profit. When the supermarkets have no competition they will not offer cut rate prices and prices will rise to their maximum. Who will suffer? It will be the consumer. Apart from suffering from the cost of rail freight they will suffer again when this sales tax is sneaked in from 1 January. The people who live in country areas in particular are being penalised by a government which always puts itself up to be a government which supports country people. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Messner gave me an answer to a question I asked about what it cost the Australian National Railways Commission to change its name from Australian National Railways to Australian National. It has not even started to work yet. I have looked through the explanatory notes for the estimates of the Department of Transport for this year. I find that they still refer on seven pages to Australian National Railways. Some hundreds of thousands, even millions, of dollars are being expended. The Railways Commission gave $409,000 to a public consultancy company-no doubt a good friend of the Government-just to change its name and to change the colour of the railway wagons and locomotives. They now have green and gold on them. As I said before, that has not attracted any more patronage; patrons are being turned away from the railways. </PARA>
<PARA> I have explained before what the Australian National Railways Commission is doing to its wonderful passenger service, the Indian Pacific, which runs between Perth and Sydney, right across Australia. Because of its stupid booking arrangements, many times it runs dead cars and people are told they cannot have a seat. But after talking to other people who have travelled on the train they wanted to travel on, they find there was an empty car. I explained that in detail here before we rose for the winter recess. I had incorporated in Hansard a letter from a person who runs the British Broadcasting Corporation program in London entitled Railways of the World. In that letter he said that because of the way in which Australian National Railways conducts is booking service he might have to put a rider on a film the BBC had made which will be shown in Australia recommending that people do not try to get a seat on that train. As I have said before, I have travelled on railways in various parts of the world and it is my belief that the Indian Pacific service is second to none. The train ought to be full on every night that it runs, from east to west and from west to east. There is no excuse for all those cars on that train not being full. If more people want to ride on it extra cars should be put on. The policy of this Government is to channel as much business as possible into the hands of private enterprise because it is private enterprise that supports this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Senator Robertson and I travelled back from Western Australia on the train in February of this year and we had a discussion with the staff. We were told that if they do not have enough passengers on the return trip, because of their stupid booking system, they return with a dead car and the people who might have gone over on the train to service the car come back as staff on 60 per cent of their wages. They just sit there doing nothing but receive 60 per cent of their wages. Yet people have been told that they cannot get a seat on the train. The last time I spoke on railways I asked the Government to do something about it. I understand that Senator Messner was going to inquire and let me know the result. I have not had time to look that up in Hansard. At this time I have had no response from Senator Messner as to whether the booking arrangements for the Indian Pacific are to be changed so that train can run full every time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another matter to which I wish to refer received a lot of publicity prior to the last election. This Government said it would fund the electrification of the railway system between Sydney and Melbourne. We hear nothing about it now because it was just an empty election promise. It fooled the people into thinking they would get an electrified system between Sydney and Melbourne. Articles have been written about it. I have a copy of quite a large article here but I do not have time to read it. I remind honourable senators that they can obtain a copy from the Parliamentary Library. They will be astounded by all the wonderful promises made about the electrification of the Sydney to Melbourne rail link. Nothing has been done about it and I very much doubt whether anything ever will be done. </PARA>
<PARA> The other project about which the Government has made great play is the railway line from Alice Springs to Darwin. I think it was mentioned in the Budget Speech and there is now a small amount of money available for a study on the construction of that line. If the Government does not have a better booking arrangement for passengers it might as well not construct it. I am very doubtful whether this line will be constructed during this Government's term of office. It is famous for uprooting the line there when it came into office-the Larrimah-Darwin link. In Darwin now one can see rusty wagons lying all over the place. Many have been freighted to Port Lincoln where they are being renovated for use on the Eyre Peninsula railway line. That shows the Government's policy on railways. </PARA>
<PARA> Another report under discussion today deals with the sea transport of live sheep. We all know that this has come back into the news to a great extent in the last few months because of the closure of many of the abattoirs in the country areas of Australia. The Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union lays a lot of the blame on the export of live sheep from Australia. Jobs are being exported. In Murray Bridge in South Australia, where I live-this probably does not relate to the export of live sheep-a week ago the whole beef chain closed down. We now have a situation in Murray Bridge where half the work force that was employed at the local abattoirs is out of work. Those people will have to go on the dole; there is no work to be got there. In Portland, Borthwicks, a major sheep slaughtering enterprise, has closed down. On top of that this Government is upping energy charges after making false promises to the Alcoa company on cheap electricity. Now it cannot deliver and the charges have been increased by 20 per cent. Those of us who watched television last night saw that the town of Portland in Victoria, where I lived for many years, is in a state of utter confusion. If Alcoa pulls out, coupled with the loss of Borthwicks export abattoirs, the town will be in dire straits. </PARA>
<PARA> All over the country we find that abattoirs, particularly those that in the main have slaughtered sheep, do not have the sheep now because they are being exported live. Recently a huge sheep liner was docked in Port Adelaide because it had engine trouble. The crew could not get it going to move it away from the dock. What were they doing with the dead sheep? They were thrown overboard and were washed up on the foreshore around Adelaide. They were not even split open so the fish could eat them. The shippers had to bring in another ship to trans-ship the sheep away from the wharf because under quarantine regulations they were not allowed to unload them. Rightly so. This Government needs to have a further look at what is going on with the live sheep export business in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The report deals mainly with the humane treatment of live sheep. It gives death rates and weight losses from the time they are loaded at any of the Australian ports to the time they are unloaded in the Middle East. All of that data is there. No inquiry has yet been held by the Government into what effect live sheep exports are having on the employment of our own people. I say again that it is time this Government stood back and had a close look at what is happening in this country, particularly in the rural areas. The export of live sheep affects the livelihoods of many people employed in slaughterhouses. I guess it will come about that next year, after the flush season we are having, the farmers who now claim they are making a lot of money out of the export of live sheep will have built up their sheep numbers because of increased lambing and the good season. They will have all these live sheep, but what will they do with them? What will the people from Kuwait say then? There will be no fantastic prices. When there is a glut on the market we get back to the old philosophy of the people who sit opposite. Their cardinal policy is observance of the law of supply and demand. We will find an oversupply of sheep. They will be given away as they were before. </PARA>
<PARA> I can well remember when one could not sell a lamb because there was a glut. It is possible that this will happen in the next 12 to 18 months. Then the farmers who have been advocating the continuation of exporting of live sheep will find, because they will not be able to sell their product and because of the huge financial commitments they will have through the increased interest rates on everything that they want to purchase, that they are in financial trouble. They will come to the Government to ask for financial assistance. When they ask the Government for financial assistance they are asking the average taxpayer to help subsidise them. Of course, again that is the policy of the National Country Party. It makes no secret of that. It says that profits should be capitalised and losses should be socialised. That is very good when one can get away with it. I can assure the people who sit opposite that the day of that policy is fast coming to an end. I know Senator Button and probably Senator Teague are waiting to speak and time is getting on. I hope that the Government will take notice of my complaint about the bookings on the Indian Pacific line and that it will see that something is done. I hope also it will have another good look at whether the huge amount of $409,000 spent to drop the word 'Railways' from the title 'Australian National Railways' was warranted. I will be pursuing that matter when it comes before the Estimates committees. I will want some answers because I can find no explanation for that expenditure in the Explanatory Notes that honourable senators have been provided with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to deal first of all with the item relating to Telecom Australia, largely because the matter was raised by Senator Bjelke-Petersen. I shall make only a few points. Firstly, the Government has announced an inquiry into Telecom. We still do not know the terms of reference of that inquiry or who will conduct it. Senator Bjelke-Petersen had a lot of traditional complaints about the provision of telephone services in rural areas. In some respects they are perfectly valid complaints. We, as a political party, are concerned to see that government services are delivered equally to people whether they live in the country or in the city. There are some very real difficulties in the delivery of telephone services to remote areas of this vast continent. If my recollection is correct, last year Telecom installed some 10 or 11 telephone services at Birdsville at a cost of some $36,000 a service. That was done because Telecom was able to finance that sort of operation out of its profits, particularly out of those it makes from the profitable trunk routes around the eastern seaboard of Australia. I hope that Senator Bjelke-Petersen realises that last year Telecom devoted some $220m of its profits to substituting the country or rural network which provides telephone services. I think it is very important that members of the Government parties, like Senator Bjelke-Petersen, determine what their attitudes are to this question of so-called cross subsidisation of country telephone services by appropriation from the profitable area of Telecom's operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last year McKinsey and Co. Inc. was requested to investigate Telecom's capital requirements. It is now nearly 12 months-I hope I am not wrong-since the report of the McKinsey inquiry into Telecom was requested. In spite of questions asked by me, which have never been answered, as to when it will be released, it has not been released to us. It has not been released because it is said to recommend greater capitalisation for Telecom and that Telecom should have access to greater loan funds in order that it might increase its capitalisation. The report made the point that there was a need for increased capital to be made available to Telecom for the sorts of reasons I have suggested. It is absurd that an instrumentality such as Telecom, which has a public investment of some $10 billion and which employs some 80,000 people-I think that figure is correct-an organisation like that which is a matter of great public concern, should have a report about its financing commissioned and made available to the Government but not made available to this Parliament for consideration. I think it is outrageous for any government which introduces so-called freedom of information legislation yet does not allow the Parliament to consider the question of the capital needs, based on expert information, of an enormous organisation like Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA> I again call on Senators Carrick and Durack to use their influence as Ministers in the Government to see that the McKinsey report on Telecom is made available to this Parliament. Telecom is a big public instrumentality and a report on its capital requirements, which have been the subject of an expert report available to the Australian Financial Review is not available to this Parliament. We need to know more about Telecom's requirements because we want to know how it will relate also to the satellite authority. We are appalled, in a sense, that Telecom lacks both a chairman and a managing director. It has lacked a chairman for some 12 months, I think, since the forced retirement of Mr Bob Somervaille and it now lacks a managing director since the forced retirement of Mr Jack Curtis, who retired a month or so ago at the time of the Telecom industrial dispute. So this vast organisation has been left leaderless and the Parliament cannot debate in an informed way its capital requirements because of the unavailability of this report. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bjelke-Petersen complains about the slow delivery of telephone services by Telecom and so on. All these issues of cross-subsidisation, of the importance of the profitability of the profitable section of Telecom, of Telecom's capital requirements and of the management of Telecom by the chairman and the general manager, have to be considered as fundamental issues for this Parliament in that sort of debate. Until Senator Bjelke-Petersen is prepared to consider those issues, it is not much good coming here and making complaints about what may, in a sense, be described as relatively minor problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say something about the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (Australia) report. This report takes us up to 31 March 1980, so it is very seriously out of date. Since then we have had the related issues of the OTC, which I shall briefly enumerate. The Overseas Telecommunications Commission is now the designated interim operating authority for the proposed domestic satellite. We would like to know what has happened to the proposal for a company to operate the satellite. From rumours and from Press reports we know that an interdepartmental committee has been looking at the question of the structure of the company to operate the satellite. We know that various consortia, such as BTS, have been pressing for equity in the satellite. We know that potential small users of the satellite have expressed dissatisfaction with the arrangements that have been made. We know that the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) is said to be proposing a listed company under stock exchange procedures but we do not know who will control that company and what limitations will be imposed on shareholdings. The private sector wants to have a hand in assessing tenders for the satellite. We have had no definite statement from the Minister on any of these matters. We still do not know what services will be available for outback users from the proposed satellite. This was one of the prinicipal justifications for going ahead with a satellite when the proposal was announced. </PARA>
<PARA> Serious questions are raised here. For instance, if private companies are to be both part owners of the satellite and buyers of space on it, or users of it, how will we, this Parliament and the Government, ensure that there is no conflict of interests in matters such as pricing policy? How is the satellite to be managed, both technically and financially, in relation to the terrestrial system of Telecom, to which I referred a minute or two ago? How is the satellite to be related to the profitable areas of Telecom's work as well as to the eastern seaboard trunk routes which are profitable for Telecom by terrestrial means? It is important that these questions should be answered if an intelligent debate is to take place on these issues?</PARA>
<PARA> Another point I make is that persistent rumours are being spread around the television industry that there is to be a second HACBSS satellite-Homestead and Community Broadcasting Satellite System. This would be commercial and therefore of considerable interest to those already broadcasting, namely, regional television operators. No statement has been put forward relating to the possibility of a second HACBSS satellite. All these issues remain in doubt while the Government apparently carries on some desultory negotiations behind closed doors about these matters of vital importance to the future of telecommunications in this country and of vital importance to thousands upon thousands of users, and particularly to the four million users who live outside the big metropolitan cities of Australia on whose behalf Senator Bjelke-Petersen was presumably purporting to speak. Those are a few of the questions which arise from the report of the Overseas Telecommunications Commission, out of date as it is, and from the report relating to Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make one or two observations about the report of the Special Broadcasting Service. The report does not justify the existence of that organisation, concerning which there is a lot of discontent. What are some of the reasons? One goes back to the basic philosophical assumptions underlying its creation. The real question is as to the social philosophy which activates its underlying policy, how it is to be implemented, what is to be its structure and who is to control it. In regard to the underlying social philosophy I would argue that we should avoid paternalism concerning the functions of a body such as the Special Broadcasting Service. We should accept that ethnic communities have a right to control their own affairs. The Fraser Government does not accept that fact. The present arrangements represent basically an attempt to make it look as if a liberal approach to ethnic and multicultural broadcasting is being adopted but that at the same time, the service is being kept under tight control. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the recognition of ethnic communities is important in relation to acknowledging that we are a multicultural community. Therefore multicultural values should pervade all broadcasting and not be compartmentalised into 'ethnic broadcasting' as a separate and distinct aspect of it. The recent report of the Dix Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in a sense made this point in drawing attention to the defects of the Commission. One of the major points made was that the ABC did not really cater for regional communities as it ought to, that it had a British cultural look and that it ignored the fact that the composition of Australian society was multicultural. That is a very real and valid criticism of the Commission. I would argue that in philosophical terms the notion of multiculturalism should pervade all broadcasting in Australia and not be just slotted aside into a separate section called ethnic broadcasting, as seems to have happened to date. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy of the Opposition on these matters flows from those philosophical assumptions. In 1979 the Labor Party adopted as its policy that it would abolish the Special Broadcasting Service and develop ethnic broadcasting as a facility controlled by the ethnic communities themselves, with government funding arrangements which would be administered by existing organs of government. This is still essentially our policy. The abolition of the SBS would not mean the cessation of government funding for ethnic broadcasting programs. There are many other ways in which it could be provided. The SBS is an unnecessary bureaucratic creation. There may have been some justification for it when it was set up, but there is none now. It arose after ethnic radio had been hawked about during the 1976-78 period. It is now incumbent upon the Government to tell the Parliament its intentions regarding the future of ethnic radio and how ethnic communities are to be given greater control of their own affairs; also the future of Channel 0-28. Clearly there is room for some sort of rationalisation in using that channel for multicultural or public television purposes, or perhaps for other news services-those of the ABC, for example. For too long now the Government has turned a blind eye, in a sense, and put complete faith in the Petro Georgiou-Galbally line in relation to ethnic broadcasting-even to the extent now of giving the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs almost half a million dollars, amongst other things, to report on itself. While these sorts of things happen there is I believe considerable rank and file dissatisfaction in ethnic communities about the state of ethnic media in Australia and ethnic broadcasting in particular. I have referred to the report of the Special Broadcasting Service to show that we must be very cautious about the social assumptions which underly the work of that body and about exercising paternalism in the matter. We should be careful to try to ensure that the notion of multicultural broadcasting is diffused throughout the Australian broadcasting system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It could be but I would regard the expression 'multicultural' as much broader for purposes of broadcasting. However, I take the honourable senator's point. The use of the term 'multilingual' has much to be said for it in the context of the diffusion of ethnic broadcasting availability throughout Australia. Unhappily, we have an unbalanced division of the whole broadcasting system as between commercial broadcasting and the public sector, one which makes it very difficult to develop the notion of diffusion throughout the commercial sector. That section is not particularly interested in it. Anyone who has spoken to the proprietors of commercial television stations on the issue will understand what I mean. As they would put it, it does not rate very highly with them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish now to make one or two observations about the report of the Dix committee inquiry which was welcomed by the Opposition as opening an important window of light, as it were, on the problems of the national broadcasting service of this country. What is important is that for a long time the ABC has clearly been in difficulties. There have been dire threats of further cuts in funds. The first indication of that recently was the threat of a cut of 10 per cent in real terms in this financial year. That was followed by a considerable outcry and the Government had to back down on the issue, but in many respects the ABC is still in a parlous state. Many things prevent the ABC from carrying out its charter effectively. I do not propose to go into all of them. I simply say that since this Government came to power the allocation of funds for the Commission has fallen by 22 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall what was said by the first Chairman of the ABC who was appointed by the Fraser Government, Sir Henry Bland, in 1976. Sadly, Sir Henry got himself into a lot of controversy over the film Alvin Purple, or some such matter which, in retrospect, seems to have been a silly thing to go out on in a blaze of glory. In the wisdom of hindsight, and looking back at his career through the mist of retrospectivity, it is very sad that he did not remain Chairman of the Commission. Although he was a volatile personality, he was a very capable and distinguished public servant. In the middle of 1976 he said that the funding of the Commission had been cut to the bone; that there was no room to manoeuvre financially. Since those words were uttered by Sir Henry Bland, the funding allocation for the Commission made by this Government has decreased by 22 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The staff of the Australian Broadcasting Commission has been reduced by 1,400 people. Twenty per cent of its staff has disappeared in five years. The ABC has been forced to carry over millions of dollars in debts each year and this year the figure was about $7m. That is a disgrace for a national broadcasting service and it is a disgrace for a government which has responsibility for the national broadcasting service. Uncertainty now remains about whether the Australian Broadcasting Commission will be forced to reduce its staff by a further 2 per cent this year. That is one of the proposals of the now increasingly ludicrous razor gang. If those cuts are insisted on it is said it will mean the end of the Four Corners program, a reduction in the news services, especially to regional areas, a reduction in the number of overseas correspondents and the closure of television operations in major regional centres. These cuts, it seems, will become inevitable. So the final staff ceiling of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is a crucial question. When is the Government going to make clear to the staff of the ABC what is the true position?</PARA>
<PARA> While this tragic situation of the Australian Broadcasting Commission exists, the Government continues to ponder the report by the Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission-the Dix Committee. There, of course, has been no response to it as yet and I do not criticise the Government for that. It is unfortunate in a sense that this matter has come on for debate today because I am not making a response in what I am saying now to everything the Dix Committee says. It would be impossible to do so. There is no time for a point by point examination of the Dix Committee's proposals. However, one or two things can be said at this stage. The Dix Committee inquiry was pretty exhaustive. It embraced careful studies of the ABC's audience, its administrative structure, technical services and even its method of accounting. The latter may be a particularly welcome examination. The Dix Committee said that the central problem of the ABC was the state of its management. Dix and his colleagues clearly saw some shortcomings in this area.</PARA>
<PARA> The dilemma which the Dix Committee faced was how to overcome these shortcomings in an organisation such as the ABC which appeared to be suffering from certain hardening of the arteries, if I can use that expression. The solution adopted by the Dix committee was to opt for a new group to be known as the national broadcasting organisation which would give policy decision making to a new group of five to seven people who would be responsible for the more detailed and expert management of the national broadcasting service. I think the proposals about restructuring the administration and management of the ABC have much to commend them. I am not entirely convinced that all of the consultative committees and so on which the Dix Committee recommended would not perhaps be a little cumbersome. But that is a matter about which I am open to persuasion. </PARA>
<PARA> I have some worries about the Dix report and I think I should identify them pretty early on. The first of those is the proposal for corporate underwriting or sponsorship of programs. What the Dix Committee in essence said about this was that there will be an increasing demand for resources for broadcasting everywhere, that the ABC has to look to that question and one of the ways of the ABC earning for itself additional resources would be corporate underwriting or sponsorship of programs. What I find defective in the Dix Committee's report about that is this: The Dix Committee estimated that if the ABC did go in for corporate sponsorship it would bring in some $5m. That is not a very big sum in terms of the ABC's overall budget. It seems to me that adopting that proposal would be placing at stake a fair degree of principle about the integrity of the national broadcasting service in exchange for $5m, if that is a correct estimate of revenue that would be gleaned. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, of course, there is no guarantee in the Dix Committee proposal that if the ABC were successful in financial terms with corporate sponsorship and gained an additional $5m, the Government of the day-I am not making any party criticism about this-would not say: 'Well were going to give the ABC $170m, but it has $5m from corporate sponsorship so we will give it $165m'. That, from the point of view of the ABC, is not necessarily a satisfactory arrangement. Perhaps I can just illustrate the point. I have a document which I am not able to brandish about. However, the Sun-Herald of 9 August 1981 contains an advertisement which shows Pablo Picasso in a hat-a boater I think one would call it-which presumably he wore on the French Riviera. The advertisement says:</PARA>
<PARA> IBM is proud to be associated with-</PARA>
<PARA> Picasso-A Painter's Diary. </PARA>
<PARA> Sunday Spectrum</PARA>
<PARA> ABC Television. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say that Picasso was a famous artist and that the life and works of Picasso make exciting television. It concludes by stating:</PARA>
<PARA> We hope you will be able to join us. </PARA>
<PARA> IBM</PARA>
<PARA>I do not want to single out IBM for particular attention, but I argue that the ABC has to be like Caesar's wife, if I can put it that way-above suspicion in the integrity of its programming. I am not suggesting for one moment that IBM by sponsoring a film about Picasso is going to influence necessarily the overall policies of the ABC. But I am suggesting that in one way or another, at some time or another, if Australian Broadcasting Commission journalists in their news or current affairs department unearth some scandalous conduct by IBM, it would be natural and understandable for the management of the Australian Broadcasting Commission to say: 'Well, look, you had better be very careful how you handle it because last year we got $3m from IBM'. I make it quite clear that in using this example I am not singling out IBM. What I am simply saying is that that principle concerning the integrity of the news service of a national broadcasting body such as the ABC should be preserved at all cost. The ABC should not only be seen to be independent in its operations and its news gathering and dissemination function but also it should not be open to any suspicion or to the allegation by any person of fair mind or unfair mind that the ABC was in some way negligent in its duties about reporting matters or biased in some way as a result of the fact that it receives money from corporate enterprises. So I think there should be very serious concern about that suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, one of the great sales pitches of the ABC and of any national broadcasting service such as the British Broadcasting Commission is that many people watch their programs because there is no advertising or no reference to advertising at all. Some people like that and those people in society should be catered for. The other thing I would say about corporate sponsorship is that, as Dix says in his report, it only formalises what happens already. The IBM advertisement concerning Picasso is an indication of that. It is true that because of this Government's financial stringency ABC producers have been forced to seek help from outside. But that does not mean that we of a society or a parliament should condone such a practice. A typical example is the sponsorship of bowls by Mazda. Mazda advertising is used heavily in the backdrop. Mazda has produced promotional material boasting of its use of the ABC as an advertising medium. The only danger is that sponsorship could be abused in one way or another. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of corporate underwriting or corporate sponsorship of programs on the ABC is that again an inequality is being introduced in a sense into the community because no individual or community organisation, pensioner organisation or organisation of environmentalists or consumers would be able to afford sponsorship of programs in the way that corporate capital can. I think it is desirable that that element of unfairness be avoided and that those groups, such as environmentalists or consumers, do not begin to see the ABC in some way as the creature of corporate capital. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned that I had qualifications about some aspects of the Dix report. I will mention one or two more of them. The Dix report effectively recommended the merger of news and current affairs programs, which would be effected by the appointment of one person to head both departments. The separation of the news and current affairs departments superficially might seem to be duplication. In my view it is not. The Australian Broadcasting Commission news has a deserved reputation for being comprehensive, serious and, if I might say so, dull. That is probably not a bad thing for a service which seeks to give its news objectivity. </PARA>
<PARA> Current affairs is different from news. It is more about analysis and criticism, not about breaking the news. It is about analysing and criticising the news and events and asking critical questions. If the current affairs department of the ABC were to be subsumed into the news department there would be a very real danger in my view that the bland news department approach might subsume, as it were, or stifle, the critical and analysing current affairs approach necessary in any good broadcasting service. It is better to have the service asking the hard questions without its role being confused with the day to day needs of telling the news. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspects of the Dix report which I have qualifications about is the suggestion that Australian Associated Press be used as the news gathering service for the ABC. In my view this would be entirely retrograde. There are few enough sources of news in Australia now and the AAP is increasingly the basic source of news for newspapers, commercial radio and television. The ABC remains the only independent source of news. I think the ABC should remain in that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other matters in the Dix report about which one would have qualifications. I do not want to deal with those today because we will have other opportunities. Honourable senators should seriously and lengthily weigh the implications of the Dix report. It is a report whose influence could affect not only the future of the Australian Broadcasting Commission but could also have a profound influence on the whole of the media industry in this country. I think it is absolutely essential that we consider carefully policies related to the Special Broadcasting Service, the Dix committee of inquiry and broadcasting generally and the development of the broadcasting system in the context of the Dix report. It is said that we now live in a society where information is perhaps the most valuable commodity. It is in that context that we ought continually and seriously to discuss issues relating to communication policy and the reports tabled today in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take the opportunity in the 20 minutes that remain before dinner to talk on the same two areas to which Senator Button has just referred. They are the annual report of the Special Broadcasting Service and, more importantly, the report of the Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. It was in the second to last day of the last session that the Government tabled volume 2 the Dix report, a very large, comprehensive and nevertheless very readable document. The remarks that Senator Button has just made in continuation of the speech he gave on the tabling of the report are part of the first discussion that the Dix report has had in this new session of Parliament. It is my first opportunity to add some initial comments on my own reflections on the Dix committee findings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Volume 2 is a massive report but very happily the committee of review has now published volume 1, which is a very thin and readable 34-page document. It sets out the recommendations of the Committee in summary form. More importantly it poses a very readable set of questions that it believes the Australian public is asking about the ABC. This series of about 20 questions is very frankly and carefully answered in a very helpful way. In referring to volumes 1 and 2 of the report, first I congratulate the Committee for its excellent review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and its many activities. </PARA>
<PARA> I note in passing that Professor Alex Castles- a very eminent South Australian professor of law at the University of Adelaide-was one of the members of the Committee of Review. I know he heartily took up his own involvement in the review. I think he has contributed very well to its result. By way of introduction I will refer to Senator Button's reservation, as he put it, about some of the matters discussed in the report. He referred to corporate underwriting or sponsorship of programs broadcast by the ABC, the possible amalgamation of news and current affairs services and to a dependence upon Australian Associated Press for international news gathering. I share those reservations. I have not given them the most careful consideration. It is another pointer to the fact that these matters have not been debated in the Senate and have not been sufficiently discussed. Perhaps the most appropriate time will be when the Government responds, setting out a line of action in response to the findings of the Committee. At that time such sensitive issues as these ought to be taken up. </PARA>
<PARA> However, having considered the possible commercial underwriting of some aspects of the multicultural television service I have not got a cast iron abhorrence to there being any such intrusion into the ABC. Where I have got a cast iron mind is that there should not be such involvement of commercial interests that would in any way at all jeopardise the objectivity of national broadcasting through the ABC. The three or four matters I particularly want to refer to concern a question raised in volume 1 of the report; that is whether the ABC is used by only a minority of Australians. The very happy finding of the surveys conducted by the Committee of Review is that only about 7 per cent of Australians do not at some time in any given week listen to ABC radio or watch ABC television. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, 93 per cent of listeners in Australia gain something from ABC broadcasts. Indeed, three-quarters of the population watch ABC television at least once or twice a week. It is a small group of only one in three persons who listen most days of every week to ABC radio. Whilst it has often been surmised in public discussion that the Australian Broadcasting Commission is an elite organisation or that it is the preserve of the more educated, more leisurely members of the community, the facts put a lie to that myth. The ABC is appreciated by just about everybody in Australia. I believe a very careful interest is taken by every section of the community in the kinds of reforms that the Dix Committee of Review put forward. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are deficiencies in the ABC as to the groups in the community that are not sufficiently catered for by present broadcasts. These are set out as being those people who live in country, outback and remote areas and who do not have the same access to the programs that are available in metropolitan areas. There is an urging in this report, with which I wish to associate myself, to bring the second radio service to every area of Australia progressively but in a short interval. Another area where there has been insufficient attention has been in meeting the broadcasting needs of Aboriginal communities and non-British Australians-persons whose native or family language is other than English. With respect to the Aboriginal and ethnic communities of Australia, there is a call by the Dix Committee of Review for more direct programming to meet their needs. </PARA>
<PARA> Another bias that is mentioned in the report is a cultural one. An over-emphasis is placed upon some overseas programs, particularly British, and these programs are being broadcast, mainly on television, at the expense of Australian produced programs. The amendments that were passed to the Broadcasting and Television Act last session require the commercial and national broadcasting systems to give greater attention to Australian produced material. In all of these respects, I urge the Government to respond to the findings of this Committee and to respond in such a way that the new ABC will cater for country and outback people, Aboriginal and ethnic people, and will do so without bias in relation to overseas programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the deficiencies that have been seen to exist in the Australian Broadcasting Commission have arisen because of a pattern of industrial disputes in the past within the Commission, some fall-off in staff morale and other reasons. One of the reasons that the Committee directly inquired about related to whether the performance of the Commission had declined because of a lack of resources. The Committee of Review found that, generally speaking, whilst there have not been the resources available to the ABC that some may have wished, this has been the case for many organisations in the public and private sectors in Australia. The Committee of Review concluded in a very telling way that it has not been primarily because of a lack of resources that the ABC has not lived up to all of these important initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the Committee concluded that financial restrictions and staff ceilings have provided a convenient excuse for a whole range of shortcomings in the ABC. I find this conclusion immediately plausible. I believe it ties in very well with the debate which took place in the second to last week of the last session of Parliament. On 5 June the Opposition brought forward a matter of public importance. This was only a few days before the end of the last sittings of the Parliament. It was raised at a time leading up to the preparation of the Budget and the bringing down of the Budget this week. It was at that point that rather expediently and mischievously the Opposition brought forward the charge that the Government was about to cut the resources of the ABC by 10 per cent in real terms. As a matter of alleged public importance the Opposition started to debate in this chamber. I remember participating in that debate and trying to rebut the Opposition's allegation by saying that the appropriate time to see the outcome of these matters was when the Budget was announced. I refer to that at this time because there has not been a 10 per cent cut in expenditure for the ABC. There has not been a cut at all. The mischievous allegations, which we said at the time were baseless, have no truth in them at all. A smoke screen was brought into this place quite unnecessarily by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> On Tuesday night the Budget Speech noted that $234m would be made available this financial year to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. This amount compares with a pattern of commitment in recent years. In the last financial year the Commission was allocated $215.6m. In 1979-80, the previous year, the figure was $187.8m. Progressively smaller amounts in money terms were allocated in the years before. The Budget decision of this year is in line with the pattern of the Government's commitment to ensure sufficient resources for the Australian Broadcasting Commission and its many services. It may well be argued in the light of the findings of the Dix Committee of Review that for certain purposes the Government will need to consider granting additional resources. One of the areas that has been highlighted by the Committee of Review is the need for quite large amounts of increased capital provision. This is detailed in the report. I am sure that all honourable senators will come to consider these matters carefully when the Government has made its response and when it can responsibly see what amount can be set aside over a pattern of years to meet the sound recommendations that can be proved to be in the best interests of the new ABC. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major findings of the Committee of Review was that there should be a quite different commission-a quite different managing body for the ABC. A discussion was held as to what is termed the National Broadcasting Organisation, the NBO. I have read with great interest the way this has been outlined. I am not at all estranged from the substance of the findings that are detailed in the report about the NBO, but for the life of me I cannot see why we should change the name of the peak management body in the ABC to anything other than the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Why cannot this new NBO be called simply the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the five to seven members of it be called commissioners? I strongly urge such a course upon the Government. Not only will the Australian public not be confused about a new body called the National Broadcasting Organisation but also it will see a steady transition from the old ABC of almost the past 50 years to the newly rearranged ABC still being called the Australian Broadcasting Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I now talk about the arrangements for music to which the Dix Committee, the Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, has given careful consideration. Amongst other things, the Dix Committee recommended that the two departments within the ABC which superintend music and concert arrangements be amalgamated into a new unit which will become largely independent within the ABC organisation as a whole. I concur entirely with that change. I believe that the overlapping and even competitive and duplicated functions of the existing concert department and music department can be overcome satisfactorily in the way that has been suggested, namely, that of forming the unit called 'Music Australia'. It is proposed that there be a managing director of Music Australia who will be responsible directly to the board of directors, that is, the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge not only that there be this reorganisation of structure and the injection of a new name but also that very careful consideration be given to appointing new personnel to management positions within Music Australia. It is unfortunate that amongst the general findings of the Dix Committee a criticism has been made that inertia has overcome many areas of the ABC and that a bureaucratic status quo way of thinking has eclipsed some parts of the organisation. It is my view that this situation exists in the concert department and the music department of the ABC. I hope that the new arrangements will allow the appointment of new managers, with a new style of approach, to ensure that Music Australia does not repeat the errors of the existing departments within the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the general findings of the Committee was that the ABC's record had faltered. Referring to the ABC, the Committee stated in volume 1 of its report:</PARA>
<PARA> It has not only slipped from the forefront of change but threatens to be eclipsed by it. The ABC has become slow moving, overgrown, complacent, and uncertain of the direction in which it is heading despite the efforts of many talented and dedicated people who work for it. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope this will not be a description of the management of Music Australia, even in the first years of rearrangement that will precede the independent body envisaged in the Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA> The final matters in the Dix report to which I refer are the repercussions or implications of the Committee's findings as they relate to the findings of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts which inquired into multicultural television services. In the findings of the Standing Committee a recommendation was made to the Senate that a decision on the best way to provide multicultural television in Australia be reconsidered once the findings of the Dix Committee were available. This subject will need considerable discussion now that both the reports are available to us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of us tonight want to take up the debate that we began, but only in a brief way, on 2 June, when the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts was tabled. Senator Davidson, the Chairman, was able to outline in summary fashion the findings of the Committee. I was able to speak for only a few minutes about what I regard as an excellent report, a report which can be regarded not only in the education area but also in other areas, as a very fine example of the kind of fruit that comes from the public of Australia responding to an advertisement of terms of reference for a national inquiry being undertaken by parliamentarians. Six senators from the Opposition and the Government conducted this inquiry for almost two years. We were interrupted by a couple of other references-children and television, and multicultural television-and over those two years we considered the hundreds of submissions that came in. We met in all capitals of Australia and proceeded to this report. Although it is brief, it is brief in order to be succinct and to the point and in order not to repeat the many inquiries that have proliferated over the last 10 years in the education area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For me in many ways the point of departure for this inquiry was the widespread interest by the public in the question: 'Are our secondary school sons and daughters gaining sufficient mastery of basic skills that they are in a fit position to go on and find employment? Have they got the essential skills from their education that will enable them to gain jobs satisfactorily?' The parents of many children and certainly very many employers have been very critical of the apparent standards of achievement of school leavers. Some of those criticisms are confused and misplaced; some of them arise from misunderstandings of the school system. Nevertheless it is certain that over the years there has been widespread discussion about 'back to the basics', about the three Rs, about whether or not there is a satisfactory interface between the years 10, 11 and 12 of school and first years of employment, about the whole question of youth unemployment and how we can gain increased skills for those unemployed school leavers that will suit them to go on and find jobs. In that context, one of the statements that was before the Committee was that of Professor Peter Karmel, Chairman of the Tertiary Education Commission, who in his Radford Memorial Lecture in 1979 said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is now well recognised that a proportion of young people, perhaps up to one-quarter, are ill-served by the operation of our school system in the present social context. Children who emerge from primary school without a capacity to read, number, and communicate, are so seriously handicapped in their subsequent secondary schooling that they are unlikely to be anything other than low achievers. Similarly those who leave school with poor cognitive skills and without a capacity to work with others will not compete on an equal basis in a limited job market. </PARA>
<PARA>The Chairman of the Tertiary Education Commission claimed two years ago that a quarter of the children in Australian schools are ill-served, badly served, by the schooling system. The conclusion of this report, after many submissions and examinations in all States, is that that summary is very close to the mark. Accordingly we have addressed ourselves first of all to trying to express a way of meeting the misunderstandings to which I referred earlier so that we can clear away the red herrings in public perceptions about this problem, and then to go on, if we can, to define the kinds of remedies that all together would lead to overcoming this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not good enough, if this claim by Professor Karmel is true. Why should it be that a quarter of our children are badly served in our schools? Surely if we are rational and careful in our educational decisions as a nation, whether in the Commonwealth or the States or in individual schools, we ought to be able to meet that problem and make sure that there is equal opportunity for all levels of achievers so that they may go on to have mastery of basic skills and a fair chance of employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the misunderstandings that have been discussed very widely in the public is the notion that somehow or other the education system is responsible for unemployment in the community. The Committee found, from many of the submissions made to it, that that is not true, that it is a myth. Unemployment arises in Australia currently because of economic conditions, because although there has been a massive growth in jobs, there has been an even greater growth in those who are seeking jobs. We do not have any simplistic answer to youth unemployment along the lines that in the last decade the schools have slipped in their standards and the graduates of the schools no longer have the kinds of skills they had 10 years ago that led to so many school leavers going on to employment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has there not been a scornful attitude to manual skills in some quarters of the education firmament?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is getting much closer to the mark, and I will refer to that later. Up to the middle part of this century there were very many unskilled jobs in the community. Those unskilled jobs were often filled by school leavers, in the first instance, who did not have particularly high achievements in their school records but who were able to go on to unskilled, largely manual jobs with relative ease, to learn on the job and to pick up some of the things they may have missed at school. There was a great capacity for unskilled jobs in the community. But in the last decade that sector in the work force has diminished very much. There just are not as many unskilled jobs as there were in the past. It has been the contention of educationists and others who made submissions to the Committee that the school system has always produced low achievers, but whereas in the past those low achievers-perhaps even 25 per cent-were able to find some unskilled job, that area is now so squeezed that the same 25 per cent of underachievers are unable to find employment with which they can cope.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is linked with the myth that is still widely discussed in Australia that in the past there was a golden age when everyone went to school, learnt the three Rs, received a basic education, became competent in that basic education and left school disciplined, good at writing, good at numbering and good at all the necessary skills for employment. However, the claim is that because of modern education techniques the golden age has ceased and we now have disaster in the schools. There just is not any evidence to support such a claim; it is a misconception. Because the underachiever is now more prevalent by being exposed as being unemployed it appears that there was a golden age in the past when all of these persons were catered for whereas now it appears that they are not. That is a myth. There was not a golden age. </PARA>
<PARA> If comparisons can be made in history it would be found that the earlier systems of education, whilst being very good for some people, left many children without basic skills and, moreover, children learnt by such a method that they were dependent upon an over-authoritarian teacher and they adopted learning by rote, knowledge and narrative rather than by creative thinking or by gaining concepts by the notion of understanding. </PARA>
<PARA> The findings of the Committee do not in any way reinforce this myth of a golden age. Neither do we talk constructively in the report about the three Rs or say that we should return to the three Rs. Some newspaper articles have used this caption in their greeting of this report. I believe in doing so there is a danger of oversimplifying the deeper statement we are trying to make. We are not wishing upon Australian schools a return to the three Rs. We do not want to go back to rote learning. We do not want to go back to a narrowly-based education program. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather-I think we do this more profoundly, in this report-we are calling for a broad-based education system appropriate to our decade. Within that broad-based system let us ensure that teachers have the techniques and that school curricula are so determined that all children have the chance for mastery of basic skills. As one senator on the Committee I am very happy to wear the phrase 'mastery of basic skills' but I am very reluctant to wear the phrase 'returning to the three Rs'. Therefore, we are not putting in jeopardy what enlightened educationists around Australia are saying ought to be a broadly based education program. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that these days schools are being called upon to give every kind of instruction. To some extent what was in the past taught by families and passed on by those living in the family such as questions about career guidance in many ways atrophied to a father perhaps saying to a son: 'You will be doing what I am doing'. A daughter could be told that because her aunt next door or the neighbour across the road knows about hairdressing she could be a hairdresser. In the past there has been much of that locked-in repetition in the career advice given to children by an earlier generation. Nevertheless, there was some pattern of encouragement that we might have called career advice. At the moment so many young people do not get any career advice at all. Similarly with regard to sex education, many of the Victorians were proud of the fact that sex education did not exist in any area, that it was learnt by personal experience. Not only the women's movement but also so many educationists-</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose so. So many educationists in family planning movements and in notions about responsible sex education among teenagers in schools very rightly have made some redress of this. We now require secondary schools to include in the curriculm proper sex education, information on interpersonal relationships, notions about self-awareness, personal development, orientation to the work force, which I noted before, and so on. Along with that we are wanting the children in schools to have some awareness of the community in which they live-the notion of local government, State government, even Commonwealth government, debating, presenting a speech and all the communications skills that were not taught in any way, except to very few, as little as 20 years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So the demands in these marginal or personal areas are heaped on top of all the new areas of knowledge. There is more and more physics, chemistry and mathematics to learn. So the demands upon the primary and secondary school systems in recent years indicate a much vaster series of topics and subjects for children to study and require a broadly based curriculum. We do not want to put that in jeopardy. What seems to have been lost in the last 15 years-in the next 10 minutes I will go on to talk about the reasons for this development in the last 15 years-is that whilst children in Australian schools have become increasingly involved in this broader curriculum, this good curriculum, for the most part they have suffered in terms of mastery of basic skills. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first chapter of the report we have set out these areas of disagreement and misunderstanding in the community. We have commended the six or seven pages of that first chapter for wide dissemination in the community. The material could be easily photocopied and distributed amongst a parents' group associated with a school, put in the staff room of a school or given to an industry group in order that these kinds of misunderstandings could be discussed by a small group and so, we hope, be overcome. The Committee discussed whether some kind of national conference could be called between parents, industrialists, educationists and school children but we rejected any such grandiose approach to the problem. Rather, by small groups in localised regions discussing these areas of misunderstanding, we six senators are confident that the summary we have given and the kinds of conclusions we have reached will dispel some of these misunderstandings. </PARA>
<PARA> I will be much briefer in regard to the other three chapters of the report. They define the kinds of solutions that the Committee put forward to overcome the problem. I return to the problem, that 25 per cent of Australia's school children have insufficient opportunity to gain mastery of basic skills. Perhaps they have suffered that loss in primary school and therefore have had a confused secondary schooling where they have lost self-confidence, motivation and a sense of relevance in what they are doing, and so have become all the more unable to rise to the opportunities of employment, even though now those opportunities are restricted in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I go on to discuss how we can help overcome this problem for this 25 per cent. I note that the problem extends beyond that group of people. There are lower achievements amongst school children not only in the bottom quartile of achievers in schools, by any measure; they extend almost into the middle two quartiles as well. Perhaps about three quarters of Australian school children are not able to say when they leave school that they have mastered numeracy and literacy, that they have mastered the ability to handle basic arrangements of numbers and the basic skills of communication. This is particularly evident in entrants to colleges of advanced education, and not least for teacher education and training. When entrants to some CAEs have been tested for their ability in mathematics and basic English expression or communication skills, it has been found by many colleges in recent tests that the matriculated or highest achiever students coming to them have woeful scores in these basic skills. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems for many colleges, and even for universities, is that in the first year or two of tertiary study tuition has to take account of this and the colleges or universities have to try to help those students to master the basic skills of writing and of handling numbers. This is particularly serious with regard to trainee teachers of mathematics. As all honourable senators know, all primary school teachers are called on to teach child- ren in mathematics, in the basic concepts of numbers and the handling of simple arithmetic-multiplication tables, the notion of groups of numbers and the notion of fractions. Although the remarks I have to make are not sexist because about 80 per cent of primary school teachers are women the remarks are mostly directed at women primary school teachers. I understand from the evidence the Committee received that the remarks could equally be directed at male primary school teachers. The problem is particularly focused on women because in the Australian society women are still discouraged, unfortunately, from continuing with mathematics studies during their secondary schooling. Therefore they are discriminated against for the rest of their lives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whether or not numeration is a skill directly involved in such a profession or is ancillary to it, the discouragement by parents, even by teachers, and certainly by peers, leads to girls in secondary school dropping mathematics studies and not going on to gain mastery of the concepts involved in numeration. Eighty per cent of primary school teachers, being women and having suffered that kind of discrimination and discouragement, have then somehow or other to pick up the threads of learning these basic concepts of mathematics, along with all of the other subjects that are thrust upon them, in their first year of teacher training. Many of them do not quite cope, so stagger through. Some pick up sufficient skill to become quite competent teachers. However, the feedback and the submissions to our Committee were that it is the case now that a large proportion of the graduates of teacher training institutions-particularly primary school teachers-have inadequate understanding of mathematical ideas and of the teaching of arithmetic.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a chicken and egg aspect in that because of this discouragement in secondary schools they go on as teacher trainees who are inadequate. They then do not help sufficiently those who are in primary schools. The primary school students who are not coping with numbers are easily discouraged in secondary school and this vicious circle goes on and on. I believe it is a national scandal. It is not peculiar to Australia but it is a particular problem in this country. There is a problem of similar dimension in the United States of America, I believe it is because of this fundamental discrimination against women, which we must all seek to overcome. This problem about women, in particular primary school teachers, is an illustration of the extension beyond the 25 per cent about whom I am chiefly worried. Other groups of school children suffer this disability of not mastering basic skills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee addressed itself in turn to the training of teachers. It concluded that the training of teachers is inadequate. There is an emphasis upon educating teachers rather than training them. There is an emphasis in our teacher training institutions on making sure the would-be teacher, in the time the colleges have him-for two or three years-becomes well educated, that he has a lot of knowledge about many things and that he is well read; whereas the priority must be that that person, while in the teacher training institution, be trained in the techniques of teaching. There needs to be emphasis upon method rather than substance. I am not arguing that we should teach just method and not substance. I do not want to be misinterpreted in that way, and neither does the Committee. It is vital that teacher training insitutions right across the country return to training in techniques, in methods, rather than trying to ape universities by giving broadly based arts or science courses that will just 'educate' the students enrolled. </PARA>
<PARA> Also the Committee regarded teacher selection to be inadequate. In most cases students who entered training courses were those who had gained the highest points score in their basic matriculation or year 12 exam. It is based purely on academic achievement. Insufficient consideration is given to their aptitude to be teachers-whether they are able to relate to people and whether they are good communicators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking not only about Senator Martyr, who is behind me, but also Senator Haines, a former teacher, who reminded me that she was of the earlier school of teacher trainees who were selected along these lines. Seriously, these are the sorts of qualities we all recognise in successful teachers. Whenever we go to a classroom and see the nature of the relationship the teacher has to the students, we see that there are aspects of discipline, responsibility and an ability to communicate. There seems to be an effusion of that teacher's motivation and care about the task he has, the profession of which he is a part. We believe that trainee teacher selection should be oriented more along these lines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Reference is made in our report to class sizes. We are aware that essentially it is a State matter to determine class sizes in the State school systems. Independent schools make their own determination. The important point we make is that because year 1 and year 2 in primary school are so important in establishing basic concepts in literacy and numeracy, if any classes are to be smaller they should be those in year 1 and year 2 in primary school. We similarly referred to school size and see some merit in schools not exceeding about 600 pupils. But again, that is a matter for decision by State governments. With regard to school design, we are aware that some of the open plan schools are inappropriately used and abused and lead on to some of the problems that we have indentified in this report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have not recommended that the walls go back in all circumstances, but we have recommended that all trainee teachers be trained in the techniques of teaching with walls about them or in more open space situations. My personal preference is for a more traditional classroom setting with the ability to move classes into open space areas from time to time. But we have no clear knowledge that there is included in the curriculum of trainee teachers the kinds of skills appropriate to the two different situations, or even whether they have the knowledge to distinguish between those activities which are best done in one situation or in the other. One of the obvious features of schools of the 1970s is the fact that teacher aids are more abused than used. Often teacher aids are a distraction from effective learning rather than being of some assistance. Television in schools is often used as pure entertainment, as a relief. Placing classes before the television set is an easy option for teachers.</PARA></TALK.START>

If television is to be used effectively in a school, it must be preceded in the classroom by careful orientation to the program with the television set turned off.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, we do not agree with chalk and talk and we do not believe in the 3Rs or any of the over-simplifications of the past. Rather, we want to see the mastery of basic skills. There are two areas for specialist teachers that we point to in our report. One is remediation and the other is school counselling. There is insufficient activity in these two areas in our schools. We believe that every school teacher should have some ability to be a remedial teacher. Every teacher must be able to identify the lowest achievers in the class and be able, by remediation, to help that group under his care. However, we also call for an increased number of specialist remedial teachers in Australian schools, at the primary level in particular but also in the secondary area. The problems in the primary area and the secondary area are a little different. In the primary area some children have difficulties in picking up basic concepts. Because they do not get the basic concept in the first couple of years, they can, therefore, lose out forever after. Some children have specific learning disabilities, some are deaf or are sufficiently deaf not to be able to pick up instruction. Some children are absent from school or move about the country to the detriment of their education and they miss out on something that is vital. In cases like those every teacher ought to be able to identify the need for particular remediation and every school must be able to gain the help of a specialist remediation teacher.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have been quite frank about school leadership and morale. We have noted that in some schools in Australia the principals of schools and their deputies or senior staff are deficient in carrying out their duties. They are not careful enough to inspire other teachers but rather can be quite counter-productive in their schools. We call for an assessment of such principals and senior staff who are in doubt. If the result of the assessment shows that they are inadequate or not living up to their duties, we call for them to be given every opportunity to do so and, if they do not, to leave the service. We are aware that more than half the Australian school teachers have been teaching for less than five years. Such was the enormous increase in teacher numbers during the 1970s that the median age of school teachers in Australia is about 28 or 29 years. Such was the great increase in the numbers of staff assigned to schools in the 1970s that many of the present body of teachers are young and relatively inexperienced. Many of them also went through their training at a time when the belief was to educate the would-be teacher rather than train the would-be teacher. Some of the worst deficiencies we have sought remedies for in our report are suffered most by the younger and more inexperienced teachers presently in our schools. To overcome that problem it is essential for us to have an adequate in-service training approach. We have called for the allocation of special grants to schools so that each school can establish a client relationship with a teacher training institution. Then the school can determine which teachers are in need of in-service training and what those needs are. The school can then contact a teacher training institution to define the extent of assistance needed and use the funds available to it to pay that teacher training institution for the kinds of courses it would then go on to provide. We go on in our recommendation to outline this notion of in-service training. </PARA>
<PARA> We refer as well in some detail to teaching aids, to the notion of a core curriculum such as that of the Curriculum Development Centre for Australian schools, which was published in recent months, and speak of the perennial problem of the home environment. When any educational assessor looks at a developed country-perhaps even an underdeveloped country-to examine whether there is a correlation between the higher achievers in the school system and any particular factor in the characteristics of those students, the one factor that stands out is the home environment. If a student comes from a home in which his parents encourage him in his studies, in which books are much used, in which there is encouragement to make the most of educational opportunities and discussions reinforce what happens at school, that student is most likely to be successful. So we refer, perhaps briefly and inadequately, to this perennial factor which has been found by all such surveys. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to a remedy which we think is essential and deserving of the highest priority, even if these other half dozen areas of remedy are acted upon. We need to restructure the curriculum for many secondary schools in Australia. It is unfortunate that secondary schools should cater almost exclusively for an academic curriculum. These days all children go to comprehensive schools, in which they progress through years 7, 8 and 9. There is very little division from that point on into what once were called technical schools or anything other than a comprehensive approach. Students in years 10, 11 and 12 do take a range of subjects, in quite a variety of combinations-but essentially they still lead to the year 12 examinations, the Higher School Certificate or matriculation. They are essentially geared to testing students who wish to go on to university or other tertiary studies. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only are the schools structured according to this academic bias. School teachers encourage children to stay in the race and go on to complete their year 12 examinations. Parents also encourage them, even if it is entirely inappropriate, to stay with a curriculum that is geared to academic achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> It is manifest that less than 20 per cent of Australian school leavers ever go on to colleges of advanced education or universities. I would like to think that in the next 20 years very many of them would but I believe that the present percentage who do is about 15 per cent. A further group of about 30 per cent go on to additional education through the technical and further education sections of each of the States. Therefore, less than 50 per cent of school leavers enrol, at any time in their life, in a course of study which we might call post-secondary or tertiary. Thus, it is entirely inappropriate that our comprehensive secondary school curriculum should be geared to an academic outcome for all student enrollees. </PARA>
<PARA> We have concluded that there needs to be a restructuring of the secondary school system to allow perhaps up to one-third of all students to study subjects, courses and disciplines that are more appropriate to their life outcomes in terms of employment and of coping with all the other ranges of activity that they may encounter in their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some particularly good examples of innovation to this end. I shall refer to one only. I commend to honourable senators a recent development at Port Macquarie in New South Wales. In the last five years the town's population has doubled. Thus, a couple of years ago there was a need for new educational facilities. There was at the time a State primary school, a State secondary school and an independent primary Catholic school. With the increased number of children going to those three schools an expansion in the States schools occurred and the Catholic school decided to build a completely new primary school and to use the old primary school as a vocational college for year 10 and 11 students. It happened to be across the road from the high school and a very innovative curriculum and procedure both in regard to the appointment of teachers and the acquisition of equipment was established. The activities of the school were geared to the kinds of employment opportunities available in the Port Macquarie area. The school took as enrollees students from the lower half of achievers in year 9 in Port Macquarie and surrounding areas. So in years 10 and 11, at this vocational school, the authorities concentrated on those who had very little likelihood of going on to post-secondary academic training. </PARA>
<PARA> To visit that school is a very enlightening and wonderful experience in that the students are self-aware, motivated and, to return to my theme, seem to be mastering basic skills. If they had continued in the secondary school across the road they would have been turned off, would have suffered a reduction in self-confidence and would have lacked motivation. Instead, they were involved in activities in which they could develop and reinforce their literacy and numeracy skills. At the end of the first year of operation of the vocational college every one of the graduates went on to obtain employment in the local area. Again, at the end of the second year of operation every graduate obtained employment. It has been such a success that parents in the area now queue up to have their children enrolled for this quite alternative curriculum. That is the kind of opportunity that I believe ought to be available to all children throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not exactly calling for a return to the old technical high school, which was an alternative to the high schools of the past. Nor do I want entirely to get away from the notion of a comprehensive approach to secondary education, but I believe that within comprehensive secondary schools there should be a sector that will be somewhat like an improved version of the old technical school, one in which manual and design skills are in the forefront of the curriculum-subjects about which a mastery of basic skills can be built. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I have been happy to note that the Press, State Ministers in a number of instances, and many teachers, educationists, representatives of industry and parents have shown a great deal of interest in this Senate report. I hope that we will see from that interest the kind of discussion and decision making around Australia which will lead to these remedies being implemented. I believe the Commonwealth Government should take full account of the report, as it has with all such Senate standing committee reports. Through the Australian Education Council it should require a response from State Ministers as to their views and activities that have flowed from the findings of this report. There is no way that we as senators can call to account State Ministers who are responsible to their own State parliaments. But I believe through the Australian Education Council we can look to the Commonwealth Minister for Education to respond to every aspect of this report even though the majority of it will require action by State Ministers and by the principals and staff of independent schools. Therefore, I anticipate that in due course-I hope within six months-we will see a full itemised response to this report on preparation for the work force. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too will direct my attention to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts on preparation for the work force which has been so comprehensively dealt with by my colleague Senator Teague. When the inquiry was announced the reaction of some people throughout the community was: 'Well, surely not another inquiry in this area'. We have had the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Education, Training and Employment-the Williams Report-we have had the Karmel investigation and so on. We found that 65 papers and reports have resulted from inquiries conducted into this vital area throughout the last few years. The fact that our inquiry was welcomed by most of the people we spoke to is reinforced by the interest shown in the inquiry, the number of submissions that were put forward and the number of witnesses that came before us. It shows that there still is a good deal of concern within the community about the ability of the schools to prepare students for the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It might be worth while reading from the introductory remarks to the report by the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Gordon Davidson, on why he saw this inquiry as being a little different from all of those that had taken place. I quote from his comments on page 2 of the report. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this inquiry has been to examine the effectiveness of Australian schools in preparing young people for the world of work with special attention to what schools are achieving in providing young people with an adequate mastery in the fundamentals of literacy and numeracy. We have, therefore, set ourselves the task of cutting through this thicket of information and focusing attention on what we believe are important issues that have a bearing on these terms of reference. We also intend to identify and comment on the areas of conflict and confusion which we referred to earlier, since it is these areas that tend to cloud the real problems that confront educationalists. </PARA>
<PARA>The bipartisan approach which we had to this report encouraged me to have some discussion today with Senator Teague. We decided to break up the discussion on the report into various areas. Senator Teague was to speak to the background of the report, the conduct of the inquiry and the problems faced by that 25 per cent of the community who leave school some way educationally disadvantaged. I say the words 'educationally disadvantaged' slowly because this term appears in the report. Senator Teague, with his usual enthusiasm, has run a little beyond what he was going to talk about. Nevertheless, I found his remarks very comprehensive. He showed that he has a grasp of the subject which was the topic of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> I am going to look very briefly-it will be briefly-at some ways in which the schools and the community could assist in this area. I am going to look briefly also at the selection of training and teachers. I am going to look at those two areas because I understand our colleague Senator Haines will also have some comments to make on the subject. Let us look first at some of those things which the school can do in this area of changing the present situation. When I speak of the school I perhaps should say 'system' because the school in some way includes the community in which it is placed. Of course, it reacts to the community as the community reacts to it. I include also in this system the department which serves the school. I do not want to enter into a debate at this stage on whether schools should or should not be autonomous. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we accept that traditionally the government-that is the State government-has accepted the responsibility given by the parents, or perhaps one might say taken from the parents. But certainly the parents have accepted that the State government has some responsibilities. I do not think it matters. The comments I want to make in my very brief remarks will apply regardless of whether we talk about the school being autonomous, making its own decisions, reacting to the community, having its counsel and so on or whether we are talking about a school system which is part of the more traditional concept with the Minister being ultimately responsible and exercising his responsibility through the hierarchy of a department. I am going to direct my comments even more narrowly than that. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall refer to some of the ways in which secondary schools could assist, because that is the area we looked at very closely. I make these remarks about what schools and communities and some others might do because I have to make the point that I am despairing of the assistance that might come from the Federal Government. We have not had a great deal of reaction to what was a compehensive report. We have not had any indication from the present Government that it is prepared to enter this field and financially or otherwise do the sorts of things that Senator Teague was talking about, namely, taking the initiative or providing financial assistance. I will come back to that point in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to define education, but surely it includes a number of areas such as the changing of attitudes and the creation of appropriate learning experience situations. I am not going to lecture on education. Senator Teague has done an admirable job in this respect and my own expertise has been left far behind. But surely schools must firstly ascertain the needs within the community and then devise ways to meet those needs. I do not want to pre-empt any sort of investigation that might be carried out but need, as indicated by Senator Teague, surely does not mean university entrance for 100 per cent of our students. I used to feel that 10 per cent of students went on to university. Senator Teague put the figure a little higher-perhaps 15 per cent or a little more. Nevertheless, the bulk of students who go through secondary schools are not going towards a university education. In many cases they are not going to a college of advanced education either. They are going to some other form of education. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose we have had a sort of traditional academic approach for two reasons. The first is that teachers themselves are academically oriented. They come through the system. Many teachers never leave school. They go through primary school, secondary school, university or some sort of training institution and go back to school. They never go into the outside world and they are to a degree academically oriented and, like Mr Chips and others, see the academic orientation as being the goal of education. I am afraid it must be said also that we have had this traditional approach because basically it is easier. It is much easier to teach this sort of traditional education because the kids who cannot cope with it are simply labelled as dumb and are off-loaded. </PARA>
<PARA> The rationalisation has been put forward quite often that everyone must have the same opportunities. Sure, but that does not mean the same sort of education. I put the point strongly that the majority of students who pass through our secondary schools need a different sort of education than that which is academically oriented. I think this must be ascertained by a study of the needs. We must identify the needs of the students. We must go into the community, we must go to the employers, we must go to the parents and we must go to the students themselves to find out what their needs really are. This can be done only by co-operation between all sectors of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is most unfortunate that I have to report that our inquiry clearly revealed that this sort of co-operation does not exist at present. There is not a movement between the employer and the school, not a great deal between the parent and the school and certainly not between the broader community, which also has a set of needs, and the school. Some work has been done, I must admit that; but a lot more needs to be done. When we spoke to the people at the schools they said that the employers would not tell them what their needs were. This may not be well received, but I suggest that most employers do not know what their needs are. They do not really know what they want the kids to be able to do when they come to them from school. They cannot pin down the sorts of skills they want. I think this is possibly because over the years employers have had a very high standard of student coming to them. The student has been able to adapt to the employer and to learn the skills of the trade. On the other hand, of course, the employers say that the schools do not ask them about their needs. I say that we need co-operation and that we need the schools and the employers to get together. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that employer organisations ought to take it as a project right across Australia to try to establish some dialogue between the schools and the organisations and the people they represent, to find out what the needs are so that these can be transferred to the schools and programs can be devised to meet those needs. I make the further point that the education departments have a responsibility in this area. I take up the point that Senator Teague made, namely, that the Australian Education Council has some responsibility. The Federal Government, of course, should be initiating this. I will come back to this later. When these needs have been established, by whatever means-whether by project, by the department initiating it or by the schools becoming motivated to go and find out themselves-we must devise appropriate learning experiences, or 'ways of teaching', in the old phraseology. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point very strongly-this is a point that so many people seem to overlook-that different students learn in different ways. I go back to the old Australian Council for Educational Research publication which stated that each student is different, each one has different needs. Not a great deal was said about the different sorts of learning experiences that ought to be set up to meet the needs of students. I point out that for some students the activity of the learning experience is more important than the content. In other words, the way in which students are taught is more important. I do not like the word 'teach'. I think that we ought to talk about creating a situation where students learn. We do not teach students; we create a situation where students learn. We do not pour it into them like doses of medicine. A situation is created of which the student is able to take advantage and in which he can learn. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to establish needs. Having established those needs, we should set up the appropriate learning experience situations or the ways in which the students can learn. In brief, I ask that needs be established and that there be the provision of the appropriate learning experiences. I make the point that it does not cost any more. We do not need any additional money to do this. It can be done and it has been done. I will cite one example from my own experience: Way back in 1954 this sort of thing was done in Western Australia with the old Higher School Certificate courses. So, this has been done before. It simply requires organisation, and, of course, effective teachers. I will come to the matter of effective teachers in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> First, I want to take up a point raised by Senator Teague. He mentioned one of the vocational colleges visited by the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts. Certainly it was a very effective learning institution. But I make the point very strongly that these sorts of institutions should not be necessary. The work done in these institutions ought to be done in the secondary schools. I am very strongly of the view that we should not say that the school is not doing this work and we ought to set up some other institution. We ought to say to the secondary school that has been given the responsibility to do this job 'You are not doing it. Get on with the job and do it', and not provide an alternative. By all means let us see this college as an interim measure because this job has to be done. We should say 'Let us deal with that group of students who have missed out in the secondary school'; but for goodness sake let us see the prime job as revising our secondary schools so that they will be doing the job for which they were set up; that is, catering for the needs of all students who go there, not 10, 15 or 20 per cent of students who will go on to universities or colleges of advanced education. </PARA>
<PARA> I will deal briefly with the subject of teachers. Quite a deal has been said in the report about this and I draw the attention of honourable senators to the recommendations made. To me, as one who was in the teaching service for quite a number of years, one of the most disturbing aspects of the inquiry was the complaints we got from parents, students, lecturers in colleges of advanced education and employers about the inability of teachers to teach, the lack of interest shown by teachers in their students, and the teachers' lack of awareness of the needs of their students and, for that matter, of the outside world. Of course, there is much generalisation. Without any hesitation I say that in a lot of schools a lot of good work is being done. We have some outstanding teachers. Many of the complaints that were made were not justified. But unfortunately enough specific examples were given and there was enough indication from employers and parents for this to be of great concern to someone such as myself and, of course, to the other senators serving on the Committee. I had a special interest because I had been involved in teaching for so many years. </PARA>
<PARA> I call on the departments of education to train teachers. I know that there will be much argument from former colleagues of mine, from the Teachers Federation and from academics about the choice of words here. Education of teachers is important, but the teachers must be able to create meaningful learning experience situations; in other words, they must be able to teach. The only way to get teachers is to train them. I know that I will be labelled as old fashioned, but as far as I am concerned teachers ought to be able to carry out the work of their chosen vocation. We ask doctors to be able to do certain things in medicine, we ask carpenters to be able to do certain things in their trade and we ask mechanics to be able to do their things. I am quite happy for honourable senators to say: 'Let us have educated technicians'. I am quite happy with the educated technicians. But let us have technicians and, of course, let us reject elitist comments about technicians. There is nothing wonderful about being in a profession. There is no difference between being in a profession and being in a trade. One does the job that hopefully one is able to do best, where one can achieve some satisfaction and where one can contribute. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that some aspects of the profession are too specialised for every teacher to have the skills. For example, I do not think that every teacher needs to be an expert in curricula. I believe that the education departments or the schools, whoever has the responsibility, ought to be able to provide this expertise and to work with teachers and help them create curricula. For goodness sake, do not let us clutter up the teacher's training time or education time, call it what you like-I prefer 'training time'-with training that person to be expert in curricula development. Not all teachers will want to do this and not all will have the skills or the potential to develop those skills. Again, teachers should be provided with programming assistance, and they should be provided with help in remediation. Of course, all teachers ought to be able to carry out remedial education, but it is a specialised job. Do not let us spend a lot of time making every teacher an expert in remediation. Let us develop experts and develop teachers who are able to follow the advice given to them by the experts and to carry out the jobs themselves. Again I say that this is the responsibility of the school or the department, whichever is the organising core. The teacher has his or her job of relating to the child and implementing school or department policy. I would be happy to elaborate that theme here or elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> The selection of teachers is important. During the inquiry some scathing comments were made about the situation that existed previously. A lecturer from a college of advanced education spoke of the years of the late 1940s and early 1950s-incidentally, that is the time at which I was recruited as a teacher-when one only had to be 'warm and vertical'. The comments were made in a very scathing manner. I wonder whether the alternative might be to be cold and academic. Surely it is more important to be warm. Obviously a balance is needed. Surely it is not too difficult to say that we ought to be selecting those people who want to teach. </PARA>
<PARA> In many cases teachers take on teaching as a second or third choice and because there is nothing else available. Teachers have said to me: 'I selected teaching because of the short hours during the day and the 12 weeks holiday a year'. One can imagine how effective those people were as teachers. Surely the applicant also must like working with children. Yet it is amazing how many teachers said in the course of our inquiry that they did not like children and found it difficult to relate to them; it is almost like a sailor who does not like the sea. If one intends to spend one's entire life working with children one must like children. At the risk of again being called old fashioned, may I say that we want to see some dedication to teaching. I say that without any apology. We need dedicated teachers. We need dedicated people in other areas, but we are talking about education. Of course we need intelligent people. Would it be meaningless to say that we want the best possible people we can get who have an interest in children? Surely it is not beyond the competence of our psychologists and guidance people to devise techniques for the selection of teachers. Let us not have any more scathing comments about people who are simply 'warm and vertical'. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I believe there are four things that ought to happen. Firstly, the Federal Government should take the initiative in two areas-through the Australian Education Council and by asking the State Ministers to look at this problem. We should devise ways of using our present resources-no additional money is necessary-to have different techniques. We should use what we have more effectively. We should be getting more value for the educational dollar, which is also the title of a book that is on my shelf. There is a lot of good sense in that sort of thing. The second responsibility which the Federal Government has is to make finance available to be put through the Schools Commission for innovative programs and so on. I do not have to develop that theme. I make the point again that schools themselves can now do something at no additional cost. Departments and colleges of advanced education can do something, at no extra cost, simply by reallocating resources. Finally, the wide community-the parents, the employers and all of those who have a responsibility in this area-also should accept the challenge and respond to it. I remember a comment made some years ago. Someone who was trying to make a smart remark said: 'Education is too important to be left to teachers'. I do not accept that but I think the thought behind it is something to consider. We ought to accept that the community has a responsibility. The teachers are not the only ones involved. It is a total community responsibility from the grass roots level through to the Federal Government. I, like other members of the Committee, hope that all of those groups will respond to the challenge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before turning my attention to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts, I would like the Senate to note that the remarks by the Australian Democrats on this matter were originally intended to have been left to my colleague Senator Michael Macklin whose qualifications, as some honourable senators may be aware, are eminently suitable to the task. Unfortunately, a death in his immediate family called him home to Brisbane late this afternoon. It is a credit to him, I might add, that he stayed on in the Senate as late as he did. It is an even greater credit to him that he spoke in this chamber within half an hour of hearing of his mother's death. It is extrordinary that he spoke as well as he did under those circumstances. I think it is appropriate for me to make that point now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts is a particular favourite of mine. It was a committee on which I sat as an ex-officio member in 1978 when it was conducting its inquiry into the effect of television on children. I was not able to be an official member of the Committee then but I did take part in its inquiry and deliberations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator. I enjoyed it. I regret that I have less time now than I had in those days to participate in what I consider to be an extremely valuable and indeed vital element of Senate procedure and one which probably contributes more to the Federal Houses of Parliament than any other. I say that with absolutely no bias whatsoever, Mr Acting Deputy President! The inquiry which we are discussing tonight is a report entitled 'Preparation for the Workforce'. It is an inquiry into the effectiveness of Australian schools in preparing young people for the work force and places particular emphasis on literacy and numeracy. Senator Robertson referred early in his speech to the number of inquiries which have been made into various aspects of the education system and the number of reports that have come from them. It seems to me that at the moment the scoreboard reads 'reports 65-action nil'. I look forward to the day when that scoreboard changes substantially. Nowhere is the lack of action more evident than in South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased to be able to say that I am one of the principals behind an increasing demand in South Australia for an inquiry into the Public Examinations Board of South Australia, which many of us who have been involved in the teaching profession, as have Senator Robertson and Senator Teague, are greatly disturbed by. We feel that the PEB in South Australia has perpetrated nothing less than a giant con trick on parents, students and on the community at large in its attitude to the method of marking, scaling and grading of students who undertake year 12 or the matriculation examination in that State. It argues from the theory that the average IQ of students or people in general does not vary from year to year. Therefore, in any matriculation examination the same percentage of students ought to pass each subject. That seems to me to be a rather quaint corollary because surely the quality of teaching, the sorts of elements within the education system, should have some effect on what students know and on their ability to answer the questions that are posed to them in the only public examination-that is, the only non-internal examination-held in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme that has been devised, I am sure, confuses even members of the Board. In effect what the Board does is take a mark, put it through a computer and multiply it by some conversion factor so that it comes out differently and, in most cases, higher. Last year, for instance, a student who received a mark of 17 per cent in the matriculation mathematics examination was in fact given a mark of 52 after the grading and scaling procedure had been used. That student was led to believe, as were his parents and so would be his future employer, that his ability at mathematics-I suggest to Senator Teague that I am assuming wrongly that the student was a male; but possibly I am not wrong-was greater than it actually was. </PARA>
<PARA> It pleases me that this report paid extreme attention to the elements of literacy and numeracy and the factors affecting them. Early in the report it was noted that attitudes of parents, of the teaching profession and of the community generally are important in the education system, in the way students see the education system and in the way in which society sees it. The report drew the conclusion that often those attitudes of parents, the teaching profession and the community generally are unrealistic. It came to the very accurate secondary conclusion that those attitudes are basically inconsistent.</PARA>
<PARA> Most of us who have been in the teaching profession, whether as skilled technicians or as some sort of esoteric elite, will say that parents in particular have rather strange ideas of the capabilities of their offspring. Their ideas of the capabilities are either too high or too low, either way most teachers can not win. It has been my misfortune to have in my classes young lads whose only aim in life has been to become motor mechancis and whose parents aim for them to become surgeons general. The reverse, of course, is also the case but that is more predominant with regard to girls. Far too high a percentage of parents of girls are still of the belief that if girls do shorthand and typing they will always get a job. Of course, that is fallacious. It is becoming more and more fallacious. The situation is becoming tragic for a large number of girls in the education system at the moment who are being ill-prepared for the employment world for which they are heading. </PARA>
<PARA> The inconsistency between attitudes of various sections of the community causes problems in coming to conclusions of the sort contained in this report because they tend to muddy the water in an area in which a clear view is essential if we are to solve any of the very evident problems inherent in the education system at present. Indeed, there are many problems of literacy and numeracy. I share with Senator Teague his determination not necessarily to go back to the old 3Rs system, to the old chalk and talk system. We do not look on education simply as something that we pour inside a series of students' ears and expect that to make them capable of carrying on in later life as adults in the work force or in society generally. That will not be the case at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, however, the conclusion remains that students are becoming less and less literate and practically non-numerate. Of course, this is not to say-Senator Teague pointed this out too-that the changes in the education system and the consequent changes in the sorts of things that young people these days know are necessarily all bad. In many ways these young people are more self-assured and more aware of social issues than we were at their age. That is a very good thing. In many ways, too, they are more flexible than we were because they are more self-assured and more aware. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in other ways they are much less flexible. To begin with, they have absolutely no conception of their own limitations and ability. Unfortunately, this is a situation which has occurred because, through the education system, they have not been trained in any sort of analysis-self-analysis in particular-or trained to accept any form of criticism, constructive or destructive. It has been a myth-I say myth advisedly-in the last decade or so in the education system-certainly in South Australia and for all I know in other States as well-that to correct a student's work would in some way diminish that student; that one must not interrupt a student's creative flow to point out that the sentence he has just written does not make sense, that his essay has no beginning, much less a middle or an end. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the information of those honourable senators, I will briefly elucidate. Bernstein argues that people fit into a number of coded areas for communication skills. Scientific jargon is one such system. The codes are rather esoteric and are limited to rather small 'in' groups of people. Beyond that, there is a non-restricted code; that is general language used by most people within the cultural group. Clearly, the drug sub-culture has its own restricted code; one has to be a member of the sub-culture to be aware of the jargon used. A restricted code serves a purpose. It gives people within the group a certain sense of identity. I suppose the Masonic lodges would be an example.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not being at all critical of the use of restricted codes. The trouble comes when the codes become so restricted that only those within the group can understand them and when those within the group cannot make themselves understood to the wider group. Scientists have their own jargon. Lawyers are even worse, but they do somehow, sometimes, manage to come down to the level of us ordinary mortals. However, often-this is happening more and more-we find students who are simply unable to communicate at all outside the very restricted area of the school environment. They have been subjected to teachers who have read their work and said: 'I understand what the student is getting at; therefore I will mark it on that basis'. The teacher considers it irrelevant that the student sitting next door may not have the faintest clue what the first student is going on about. That kind of attitude from teachers is doing, and has done, a grave disservice to many in our student population. A specific case in point occurred in the 1979 public examination for matriculation English. The second paper is the literacy paper. I will explain for Senator Chipp's benefit that in South Australia--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Chipp" NAMEID="3V4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why are you giving me a bad time?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chipp was the first person I saw. The situation in South Australia is slightly different from other States in that we have two English papers and all students who do English have to do both papers. The first paper is the literature paper and it accounts for something like 75 per cent of the marks. The second paper is the literacy paper and it accounts for 25 per cent of the marks. The first paper really demonstrates only the capabilities of the teacher. A good teacher can tell any class of students all they need to know about Tess of the d'Urbevilles so that they can answer any question they are likely to get on it at the end of the year. The second paper consists of one or more unseen passages of prose which students are asked to read, to think about and then to discuss in an intelligent manner. They are very rarely difficult. In 1979, the two passages were, firstly, a newspaper report, and secondly, the transcript of a school broadcast by Colin Thiele. As any good journalist would tell us, they pitch most of their articles to an average reading age of about twelve. Colin Thiele's report was directed at lower secondary high school students. The average mark gained by students that year was five and a half out of thirteen. Not only could they not read it accurately but they had no hope of communicating accurately what they had read. To me that was an absolute tragedy. It was made worse by the fact that through the machinations of the PEB this effect was masked under the scale and grading system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This inability of students to communicate will cause enormous problems when they move from the limited sphere of the school environment to the broader world. As the report pointed out, this inability to communicate is aggravated by an excessive reliance in many schools on the electronic media, a situation which is further aggravated by the student's own reliance on television and other elements in the electronic media outside school hours. It must be patently apparent to most people that the fewer senses one uses, the less one derives from a situation. Television viewing teaches most students that if they do not hear something on the television they can usually work out what happened by looking at it. If they turn their heads away to look at something else, they catch the general gist from what they hear. They are not taught to rely in any way at all on a combined set of senses. They are certainly not taught to rely in any sense on their imagination. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, as the report points out, many of the teaching aids provided in schools have an excessively American oriented influence. This of course is a bad thing too because it destroys Australian culture. I pointed out in 1978 in a question that I asked of the then Minister for Education that teacher training was suffering from the vast numbers of educational psychology text books in the libraries of colleges of advanced education which emanated from United States or British based authors-countries whose social system bears very little real relation to our own when it comes to educational psychology. We do not have the sort of class structure that Britain does. We do not have the sorts of racial problems to contend with in the classroom that the United States and Britain have. The reliance on overseas based technological aids can only be a further damaging influence on the system. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to say a word or two about something that Senator Teague raised in his extremely comprehensive discussion of this report, and that is women mathematics teachers. It is an unfortunate fact of life that women, or girls really, are discouraged actively by both their parents and the school from embarking on science or mathematics oriented subjects or courses. They are discouraged from this by parents and schools because society generally does not encourage it. This is, as Senator Teague pointed out, reflected in the fact that very few female teachers are conversant in any way with mathematics courses. They therefore serve only to reinforce to their female students and their male students that mathematics and the sciences are outside the normal province of most women. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, it perpetuates the fallacy. There is no reason at all why women cannot be as competent in figuring as are men. I am therefore forced to say that I am somewhat disappointed in the report-I would ask Senator Teague to correct me if I am wrong in this-in that it did not recommend a positive encouragement for a change in this attitude. The Committee skirted about it in its section on the teaching profession. It looked at the primary teachers' inadequate understanding of mathematics. It looked at the problem of young married teachers, almost entirely from the point of women, but it did not front up adequately, it seems to me, to the fact that we need to positively encourage young girls and women to take their full place in all courses available within educational institutions. In that way, and only in that way, will preparation for the work force, which is the title of this report, be at all relevant to something like 51 per cent of the population.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I spoke very briefly on this matter when the report entitled 'Alternatives to Petroleum Based Fuels: Government Response' was tabled on 2 June. I want to add just a few comments. The thrust of the report by the Committee and the Government's response to it, of course, is concerned with fuel conservation and alternatives to liquid fuels. I will make two observations about the existing Government policy on liquid fuel conservation. One observation is that, as everyone would have known without any doubt, in the long term the policy of pricing liquid fuels at higher prices would ultimately have some effect on consumption, and it has been shown that it has already had some effect on consumption. In fact, the import parity pricing policy of the Government is more a revenue raising policy that a fuel conservation policy. In addition, since it was first imposed in 1978 it has had the highly undesirable side effect of substantially lifting the inflation rate. If the Government were concerned solely with the use of the price mechanism as a fuel conservation policy it would have been possible to achieve that objective while having a neutral effect on inflation if commensurate reductions in other areas of indirect taxation had accompanied the introduction of the import parity pricing for crude oil.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point, although relatively small in terms of potential fuel savings, is important insofar as it demonstrates the spotty nature of the Government's commitment to a fuel conservation policy. Each week some thousand empty seats are available on Qantas Airways Ltd aircraft in both directions operating between Perth and the eastern States. As a result of long-standing Government policy reconfirmed for a minimum period of eight years only two months ago, that ludicrous situation will continue. Apart from the potential to offer interstate air travel to Western Australians at very much lower rates if the Government were to deregulate the industry at least to this extent, there is also the potential for saving 250,000 litres of aircraft fuel each week if those empty Qantas seats were to be occupied and the services provided by the domestic operators reduced accordingly. I will comment briefly on several of the specific recommendations made by the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources and/or on the Government's response to them. Recommendation 9 of the Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA> LPG be made eligible for the rural freight subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's response reads:</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the subsidies already announced for household and traditional commercial and decentralised industrial LPG users, it is not considered appropriate to act on this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA>Given that the main thrust of the Committee's report was concerned with fuel-this is the case with all reports concerned with petroleum fuels-there are two inadequacies or obfuscations in that Government response. Firstly, the subsidy provided for liquefied petroleum gas at the moment is most significant. Indeed, the only area in which the subsidy is at all relevant is LPG used for industrial purposes and, in particular, for crude space heating-the crudest of all possible purposes. No subsidy is paid on LPG used for automotive fuel. As a result of administered pricing LPG is made available for automotive fuel at lower prices than it is made available for some other purposes. However, no explicit freight subsidy is paid on LPG. Whether it ought to be is, in my opinion, a matter for legitimate debate. Indeed, whether a freight subsidy ought to be paid on any type of petroleum fuel is a matter for legitimate dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> The stated objective of the Government policy is to compensate people for the disadvantages of living in remote areas. That policy continues a long-standing and irrational tradition in Australian policy making, that tradition being that where there is a professed desire to compensate people for the high costs of living in particular areas or any other form of disability, the all too common and irrational response of Australian Governments has been to subsidise the commodities bought by those people instead of applying the far more logical, obvious and cost-effective mechanism of subsidising those peoples' incomes if they are thought to be particularly disadvantaged. I note that this view was endorsed in somewhat stronger language by the Liberal Party member of the House of Representatives for Moore, Mr Hyde, in the Australian on 11 August. Speaking on the fuel freight subsidy he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The fuel freight subsidy flies in the face of the Government's import parity pricing policy and is an incentive to waste a scare resource. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously there are significant differences of opinion within the Government parties on that matter. I observe in passing that reason and common sense are on the side of the honourable member for Moore and not on the side of the official Government policy. Recommendation 18 refers to shale oil and, specificially, to the Rundle project, although the Government response and the Committee report referred in particular to the environmental aspects of the Rundle shale oil proposal. Since that Committee's report was published the environmental implications of that proposal have become somewhat more hypothetical because the proposal, at least for the present, has failed-and by 'the present' I mean at least for the rest of this decade-on purely economic grounds, notwithstanding the gallant attempt by the Minister for National Development and Energy, Senator Carrick, to talk up the shares over a period of 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 19 to recommendation 22A inclusive are concerned with the production of liquid fuels from vegetative sources and from crop production. The Committee recommended that there be a continuation of research into this area of alternative fuels. Whilst it would be prudent in the long term selectively to breed plants which may have some potential for liquid fuel production, this whole area of alternative fuels produced from vegetative sources is one which has spawned a great deal of woolly thinking, some of which has been exhibited in the Parliament from time to time and a great deal more of which has been exhibited outside the Parliament. The plain fact is that, given present plants and present technology, liquid fuel produced from these sources is not price competitive at present prices, by a factor of 20c to 30c a litre, with local fuel produced from crude oil from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. World oil prices would have to double at least before these alternative sources became cost competitive with present technology. </PARA>
<PARA> A particularly woolly proposition in this area has recently been canvassed by the Western Australian Government. The Premier, Sir Charles Court-who was the prime architect of the Ord River scheme, which has to this date absorbed more than two hundred million present value dollars in public investment for no public return-made a very disturbing announcement earlier this month that before the end of 1981 it would be announced that a sugar production enterprise on the Ord River scheme entailing an investment of an additional $200m would be entered into. The Premier added that it had not been decided at this stage whether the project would produce crystal sugar or ethanol. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the fact that two hundred million present value dollars of public capital has already been sunk into the project and is irretrievable, it is possible that at the Ord River crystal sugar could be produced which is cost competitive with any increased crystal sugar production in Queensland. The question of ethanol production is in an entirely different category. A Bureau of Agricultural Economics study almost two years ago showed that before ethanol could be price competitive with alternative liquid fuels, cane would have to be available at about half the going price for sugar cane for export. Moreover, if significant quantities of ethanol were to be produced in the remote Kimberleys area, it would be necessary to ship it south or, at the very least, north-east to Darwin before a market for that volume of production could be found. The cost of doing that would add enormously to the production cost of the ethanol. If the Western Australian Government is seriously considering investing-or, more accurately, wasting-an additional $200m on sugar production in the Ord River for the production of ethanol it has abandoned, forsaken, any remaining credibility which it may have had in the area of rational economic management. Unfortunately, given the whole sorry history of the Ord River scheme and in particular of the Premier's irrational commitment to it, the possibility of the Government embarking on a major ethanol producing project in the Ord River area cannot be entirely dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA> As a final comment, I observe that Sir Charles Court is extremely lucky to have escaped from the private sector into the public sector almost 30 years ago, because nobody with such a record of managerial blunders of the magnitude which he has had, and nobody who manifested the same level of managerial incompetence that Sir Charles Court has manifested in respect of the Ord River scheme, had he remained in the private sector could possibly have remained solvent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, as this is the first speech I have made since you assumed your high office, I take the opportunity to wish you a successful term of office. The report from the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment on Australian marine science is unique in that it is the product of the brains of three component parties of this Senate. In addition to Senators Jessop, Townley and MacGibbon, from the socialists Senator Melzer and I were on the Committee. The Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Mason, was also a member. Time is not on our side in regard to this report. We had a very fine debate in this place some time ago about whale protection. Again we had a cross-fertilisation of ideas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we assumed the responsibility of the 200-mile off-shore zone, as I said earlier, we did not want to be in a position where we were over-liberal-I use that word not in the political sense-in the way we extended the franchise to foreign nations to have their trawlers operating within our 200-mile zone. One or two misguided Latin American governments found, to their cost, that their fishing grounds were virtually eliminated in such a situation. I would not like to see that develop here. I know we are regarded as a relatively fat cat nation in terms of the living standards of some Asian countries, and there will be growing agitation to let more and more foreign trawlers come in. I would not like to see us in the defensive position in which the United Kingdom was placed during the cod war with Iceland. As with all issues, there are two points of view. I know the recommendations that the Committee made provided for an updating of modern marine research so that, among other things, if we had the misfortune to have some other nation complain to the United Nations that we were a little narrow in the administration of our fishing resources we would want to have the technical data to refute it and not be in a defensive position. My prime contribution is in relation to page 52 of the report, where the Committee's recommendation states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the declaration of the 200n.m. Australian Fishing Zone should be accompanied by research into the fauna of this zone, especially mammals, and how they can be adequately protected from the over-exploitation of their foodstocks. </PARA>
<PARA>From our possessions in the Antarctic we know of the problem concerning krill. Its utilisation to feed the growing populations of certain portions of the globe has to be reconciled with the protection of the habitat and needs of mammals, including whales and dolphins. It is an area that has to be monitored very closely. To me the vision splendid conjured up in my mind is that the 200-mile zone will give protection to mammals. Anyone who has seen films, documentaries or books on the subject would feel proud that in this Australian Parliament we achieved a bipartisan policy that set the pace, even in deliberations of the International Whaling Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that there has been a further advance in relation to the protection of some varieties of whales does not ignore the fact that two major powers, Japan and the Soviet Union, have reservations about the restrictions on hunting sperm whales. I know the Sydney Press, and doubtless interstate newspapers, have indicated that some Australians have endeavoured to expose any breaches or cribbings by these two countries. Apart from those countries, maverick pilot whalers endeavour to breach the conventions. I know it is difficult to get a unanimous decision. I have always been one of those who believe in gradualism, as long as we are getting something all the time. Canada is letting its membership of the Commission lapse. I know both the countries that I have mentioned could argue, to a point, about food stocks. I believe there will have to be tremendous vigilance, although marine mammals probably have some particular inbuilt mechanism in their makeup which will allow them to learn quickly where these protection zones are. Australia lacks effective coastguard services and our Navy is not large, and there will be a profit incentive for these maverick trawlers. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point that the Government will very quickly take on board some of the recommendations that have been the product of a tri-partite approach. I say that because I can remember attending a hearing last year dealing with the estimates of the Department of Home Affairs and Environment. I think Senator Puplick was involved in the dialogue too. We raised the matter of the beaching of whales on some parts of the Australian coastline. I know it is very difficult to control this. I do not say that it is like the lemmings in reverse but, conversely, there has been some success with some salvage operations in the United States of America and Norway. I think it is an area in which the Marine Division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation should be encouraged to do a lot more. There is no question about that. </PARA>
<PARA> We had evidence from outstanding people like Dr Ling, the curator of the South Australian museum, one of the foremost authorities on seals. He has had extensive experience in North America, including Canada and Greenland. We are very fortunate to have people like him. We also heard evidence from Dr Guiler from Tasmania, another man whose reputation in the fauna and conservation field is beyond question. These people felt that we had to be extremely vigilant. I know that in some fishing areas there has been a lot of clamouring about seals being serious competitors. Actually, the evidence to the Committee was to the contrary. We heard in other evidence that we are losing certain squid trawling to Japanese interests. The question is whether the fairy penguin and the fur seal could be affected by this trawling. Extensive evidence was given-I think Senator Peter Rae would appreciate this-by Victorian and Tasmanian conservation groups which was not refuted by anyone. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I am making is that a very well co-ordinated effort has to be made by the States and the Commonwealth to block any poaching. The other great danger is oil spills. What happens if we have tanker disasters of the magnitude of the Torrey Canyon disaster or the Oceanic Grandeur disaster? It is true that successive governments have tightened up the Navigation Act and certain compensation laws. Honourable senators have probably noted that some odd things happen with these Liberian registered tankers. On investigating one recent mishap in the Atlantic Ocean it was discovered that the officer of the watch had written away to a correspondence school and received a document which stated that he was a first officer. He bought this document for $51 in New York. These are the sorts of situations that have to be faced. I believe it is stupid to say they will not occur. </PARA>
<PARA> Without getting too political or ideological on the matter, we did get evidence from some of the oil companies. I am not altogether satisfied that some of the research carried out by Esso-BHP is put at the disposal of Australia as a nation. I think that over a number of years the information is fed back but I have always had a feeling about where the benefits of the research go. Does it go to the board room first or to the Australian Government's specialised services? These are the things we have to face up to.</PARA>
<PARA> This is a report which is extremely comprehensive in its recommendations. I have not noticed that the Budget contains a lot of hope as far as the implementaion of these recommendations is concerned. When we reach the Estimates committee stage we may be able to get information about the finer points in the recent International Whaling Conference report. </PARA>
<PARA> To wind up I would say that we probably have five years at best to implement an effective monitoring system for the conservation of our fishing resources and effective protection of our mammals. I would hope that during the Estimates committee hearings, if we cannot get a statement from the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson), we will be able to debate these issues. Quite frankly, I am one of those people who believe that when poaching or transgressions occur it is not a question of flogging people with feathers. Recently an Indonesian vessel as well as one Taiwanese trawler breached our fishing rights. We are certainly not as tough as we ought to be. More punitive measures ought to be taken. I simply repeat that I hope that when we get on to the Estimates we will receive an IWC report which we can relate to the recommendations made in this excellent report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My purpose in speaking tonight on the motion for the adjournment is to ask the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner), who represents the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt), to make a clear statement to the Senate about the superannuation provisions for Trans Australia Airlines staff. I do not, of course, expect the Minister to make such a statement this evening but I trust that he will be able to do so in the near future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When, earlier this year, the Government decided to repeal the Australian National Airlines Act and transfer TAA's operations to a public company, many TAA staff members became justifiably concerned about their security. At the time I was approached by a number of staff members and subsequently asked two questions which had been raised by some of them. On 7 April I asked the following question on notice:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Will Trans-Australia Airlines' staff be given first option to purchase shares in a TAA public company, should they become available. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Will the superannuation entitlement of TAA staff be affected. </PARA>
<PARA>The answer that I received did not properly address itself to the two questions that I had asked. Whilst this is regrettable, it is not unusual in this Parliament for Ministers to be deliberately evasive. Senator Messner reported that the Minister for Transport had provided the following answer to my two questions:</PARA>
<PARA> The Parliament recently passed legislation to repeal the Australian National Airlines Act and transfer TAA's operations to a public company. Provisions included the transfer of all staff on the same terms and conditions on which they were employed by the Commission. All the shares in the new company will initially be held by the Government. The Government has also decided to commission private consultants to examine the practicality of selling some or all of the shares in TAA including how this might be done in light of the Government's domestic aviation policies. The consultant's report is expected to be completed within 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA>Really, that answer means nothing. It does not say whether or not TAA staff would be able to obtain some equity in the company for which they work. All that it reveals in relation to the share issue is that some unknown consultants are to report to the Government on how some or all of the shares in TAA are to be sold. As well, the question of the superannuation entitlement of TAA staff was not specifically answered. One could infer from the answer that their rights would not be affected. In part the answer said:</PARA>
<PARA> Provisions included the transfer of all staff on the same terms and conditions on which they were employed by the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>But if one were to infer from that part of the answer that the superannuation entitlements of staff would not be affected, one would certainly come to the wrong conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been given some information about a new superannuation scheme which has been offered to TAA employees. Even so, I do not properly understand the vagaries of the new scheme. This is not surprising, as many staff members also feel confused. One employee remarked to me that the staff no longer spoke about football during their lunch break; that all conversation related to the new superannuation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am asking the Minister to do is bring down in the Parliament a statement outlining the full details of the new TAA superannuation scheme. In particular, I would expect these points to be covered: What were the basic details of the superannuation scheme covering TAA employees prior to TAA becoming a public company and what are the basic details of the current scheme? What benefits were available for employees under the old scheme and what are the benefits under the current scheme? Do TAA employees of long standing have to transfer totally to the new scheme? If they do, how are their prior superannuation payments to be taken into account in determining benefits for employees? If they do not have to transfer, does it mean that they will stay totally within their old scheme, or will they become members of two separate schemes? Are there different superannuation schemes for different levels of staff? How will TAA save money out of the new proposals and how much does it expect to save? What is the role of the Australian Mutual Provident Society in TAA's superannuation plan? Were companies other than the AMP Society also allowed to submit plans about how they could become part of the scheme? Is the chairman of TAA, Sir Robert Law-Smith, also a director of the AMP society? If he is, does there seem to be some conflict of interest in the AMP Society's becoming involved with TAA? Were any funds contributed by TAA employees for superannuation purposes used to help pay for TAA's Airbuses? If so, what are the details of this financial exercise? If the Minister for Transport chooses not to make the information available for his colleague in this chamber, I urge officers within the Minister's Department to take these questions on notice because it may be pertinent to pursue them in depth at the forthcoming meetings of the Senate Estimates committees. </PARA>

I notice that a couple of mine have appeared in Hansard. But one, the most important, is not there. I wonder why. On 2 June I directed a question to Senator Carrick. I asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In what years, if any, has South Australia not received its proper entitlement under the River Murray Waters Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked that question for a specific purpose. Statements had been made in South Australia by Mr Arnold, the Minister of Water Resources, accusing the New South Wales Government of thieving water from South Australia. I was very pleased when I got the answer to that question but very displeased that it was not published in today's Hansard. Senator Carrick's answer proves that Mr Arnold was drawing a long bow when he claimed that New South Wales was thieving South Australia's water. The answer reveals that only once since the signing of the River Murray Waters Agreement has South Australia not received its water entitlement. That was in 1944-45. I seek leave to have that answer incorporated in today's Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA> In what years, if any, has South Australia not received its proper entitlement under the River Murray Waters Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable Senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Information from the River Murray Commission indicates that annual flow to South Australia has only once, in 1944-45, been less than that to which that State is entitled under the River Murray Waters Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> During the severe drought in 1944 and 1945, the water passed to South Australia amounted to 938,000 megalitres, some 608,000 megalitres less than South Australia's annual entitlement at that time. However, the volume actually available to South Australia in 1944-45 was 1,272,000 megalitres, some 274,000 megalitres less than entitlement, as South Australia decided to hold back 334,000 megalitres in reserve in Lake Victoria in case of a continuation of the drought into the following season. </PARA>

<PARA> Is the Minister aware that, apparently without reason, some cottage owners on Garden Island, now better known as HMAS STIRLING have been asked to quit by 30 June 1981 while others are being allowed to stay until September this year? Will the Minister give the reasons for the difference or, better still, will he make all the notices to quit uniform to September this year?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The new armament depot at Garden Island, Western Australia, is scheduled to open early in October 1981. For safety reasons, all cottages on Garden Island must be removed by then, and notices have been served directing that they be removed by 30 September 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> A small number of cottages in the Luscombe Bay area will be removed by an earlier date in order to complete the armament depot and a demolition and burning area by the planned date.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 11 June 1981 (Hansard, page 2034) Senator Mulvihill asked me, as Minister representing the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By way of preface, I refer to the recent statement by the Government deploring the escalation of violence between Iraq and Israel. Whilst we accept that what has been said is largely correct, why was there no comment about the acquisition of nuclear facilities by a Middle East power. Surely it is a threat to world peace. Why did the Government not say so in its statement.</PARA>
<PARA> The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Many countries see benefits in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and acquire nuclear facilities to realise these benefits. The acquisition of a nuclear facility by a country does not in itself constitute a threat to peace provided that the facility is used exclusively for peaceful non-explosive purposes, for example, in the production of electricity.</PARA>
<PARA> To provide assurances that the nuclear facilities of countries are used exclusively for peaceful purposes, Australia has long advocated that all non-nuclear weapon states, whether in the Middle East or elsewhere, should become parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Under the NPT non-nuclear weapon states accept obligations not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices and to place all of their nuclear installations under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (5) Most of Australia's bilateral air services agreements provide for fares on a particular route to/from Australia to be jointly approved by Australia and the other country concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the practice followed for many years has been that international airlines consult and agree on fares which are then recommended to relevant governments for approval. The very large majority of air fares on routes to/from Australia have been and continue to be set in this way.</PARA>
<PARA> Improved procedures became necessary in recent times when airlines began to incur frequent and often large cost increases, particularly in relation to fuel requirements. Streamlined procedures for formulating and approving fare increases were developed among airlines and have been endorsed by many countries, including Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> In the period while airlines were formulating the new procedures, there were some delays in lodgment of fare increase applications by airlines and subsequent approval of these by governments.</PARA>
<PARA> Comprehensive details are not readily available, but it is believed the total time that elapsed between airlines incurring higher costs and applying for compensating fare increases, exceeded the time taken to process and approve their applications for fare adjustments.</PARA>
<PARA> Each application by Qantas for fare increases is considered on the basis of supporting information provided by the Company.</PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister for Transport has previously indicated there have been a large number of different fare increase applications lodged with the Department of Transport in the period from 1 January 1979 to 31 December 1980. These have related to both specific routes and groups of routes. The most important of these have been the six general fare increase applications lodged by Qantas on behalf of other carriers and associated with the substantial increases in fuel costs. The proposed and actual effectiveness dates of fare increases in relation to the fuel cost increases over this period are as follows:</PARA>

<PARA> (1) I am advised that the then Minister for Post and Telecommunications met with the representatives from Shires in the north-eastern wheatbelt area of Western Australia on 4 August 1977 to discuss the question of funding extensions to the national television services in the area. However, as far as I am able to ascertain the discussions were based on the concept of a single wide coverage national television service centered in the Becubbin area, rather than a group of translators. At that time a series of commercial translators was being proposed for the Eastern wheatbelt area.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. A commercial translator station to serve Merredin was constructed late in 1980 and ran on a test basis for several weeks. Difficulties experienced in providing an adequate input signal from the parent station VEW-8 Kalgoorlie to the translator prevented the licensee from commissioning the service. The licensee is currently negotiating with Telecom Australia for the provision of microwave link facilities to provide the program to Merredin and the other proposed translators.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) On the basis of the impending availability of the link facilities, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has directed the licensee to commence the services by the following dates:</PARA>
<PARA> Merredin-no later than 30 September 1981</PARA>
<PARA> Baandee-no later than 30 November 1981</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Under the health grants arrangements to apply in 1981-82, as incorporated in the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981, each State except South Australia and Tasmania will receive 10 per cent more than the amount payable to it in respect of 1980-81 under the hospital cost sharing arrangements, less 60 per cent of the amount of revenue which it is assessed by the Commonwealth as being capable of raising in 1981-82 at certain levels of charges. Under this arrangement it is estimated that Queensland would experience a proportionately larger reduction in health grants in 1981-82 than any other State. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Government agreed to provide, for 1981-82 only, a $16m grant to help 'cushion' the changes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Telecom has programmed funds for improvements in the trunk area of the network in 1981-84 which represents a significant increase in expenditure over that of past years. The new trunk switching and transmission equipment is designed to increase the trunk network capacity and to reduce network congestion and bring about an improvement in grade of service to the customer. The program includes major expenditure on main route systems, extensions to capital city trunk exchanges, minor switching centres and the provision of additional short distance trunks at many points throughout the network. Local problems will remain as it will take some two years before a standard grade of service can be re-established generally.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. Demand for Telecom services has been running at very high levels over the past two years and this trend is expected to continue. Special attention is being given to high growth areas including those mentioned in the question.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) My Department has reservations about the role of acupuncture in medicine and about the manner in which it is being practised. Nevertheless, because of its widespread use, acupuncture rendered by a legally qualified medical practitioner is recognised as a legitimate medical service for the purposes of payment of medical benefits. This form of treatment is not discriminated against by the Department. In fact a new item (Item 980) was introduced into the Medical Benefits Schedule on 1 April 1981 specifically to cover this service.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The fee for Item 980 has been set at the level of a standard surgery consultation by a general practitioner which is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> New South Wales-$11.20</PARA>
<PARA> Victoria-$9.90</PARA>
<PARA> Queensland-$9.90</PARA>
<PARA> South Australia-$9.90</PARA>
<PARA> Western Australia-$9.90</PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania-$10.40</PARA>
<PARA> The reason for equating the fee for this service to that of a standard consultation was that a review of recent literature indicated that the effect from acupuncture does not depend on a lengthy attendance by the practitioner.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. It is expected that this action will tend to overcome the abuse of the previous medical benefits arrangements where it had been found that some medical practitioners had been providing treatment to more than one patient at the one time and where there had been frequent charging for acupuncture treatment under prolonged consultation items when the practitioner had not been in constant attendance with the patient for the times specified in those items.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. The benefit is paid in arrears in the sense that the care provided in a fortnight precedes the relevant payment.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. Following an amendment to the National Health Act (effective as from 4 September 1980) the benefit is calculated and paid on a fortnightly instalment basis. However, the legislation makes provision for the Permanent Head of my Department to direct, at his discretion, that a pro-rata payment (calculated on a daily basis) will apply, in individual cases, in lieu of the fortnightly instalment arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) If the period of absence falls entirely within a fortnightly pay period the carer would (other than in certain exceptional circumstances) receive a full fortnight's benefit payment. However, if the period of absence extends from one fortnightly pay period into the next fortnightly pay period, the carer would normally receive a full fortnightly pay period for the first fortnight but would not be paid for the remaining days of care in the second fortnight. In these circumstances benefit entitlement would recommence from the beginning of the next succeeding full fortnight of care.</PARA>
<PARA> In effect, where a period of absence extends from one fortnightly pay period into the next fortnightly pay period, the carer stands to gain payment in the first fortnight for days on which care was not provided but to lose payment in the second fortnight for the days on which care was in fact provided (following the patient's return).</PARA>
<PARA> The exceptions to these arrangements relate to the exercise of the discretionary pro-rata payment provision. The pro-rata provision would normally be exercised in circumstances where, by reason of regular breaks in continuity of care, the normal fortnightly instalment arrangements act to either maximise or minimise payment of the benefit to an extent considered inordinate.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The reason for non-payment in certain circumstances, for individual days on which care is provided, is in the nature of the benefit being basically a fortnightly, rather than a daily benefit. It will be seen that, under the arrangements for payment of the benefit by fortnightly instalment, beneficiaries overall are in a break even situation although, individually, they may stand to gain or lose some days' benefit throughout their period of eligibility.</PARA>
<PARA> Should the honourable senator have a particular case in mind he may wish to provide me with further details in order that the question of exercising the discretionary pro-rata payment provision, to the carer's benefit, may be examined.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In early preliminary planning for an Australian satellite system the orbital position of the satellite was postulated to be 128 degrees (above the equator, approximately in line with the Western Australian/South Australian border). As planning firmed, a position at about 160 degrees E was preferred and this was the basis for the Request for Tender (RFT) for the satellite system issued in October 1980. The selection of this orbital position was supported by two overseas satellite system consultants engaged to evaluate the RFT documentation prior to release.</PARA>
<PARA> From the more easterly position Australia (and Western Australia) 'looks' smaller so that the signal transmitted from 160 degrees E can be concentrated into a smaller beam. As a result the strength of signals received in Western Australia under clear sky conditions will be increased by some 35 per cent (and by 17 per cent in the eastern states) compared with signals from a satellite positioned at 128 degrees E. Despite any increased signal attentuation by path loss and rain, there will nevertheless be a net gain in signal strength received in Western Australia. Moreover, the signal strength received in Western Australia will be comparable with that received in eastern states, which would not have been the case with a satellite at 128 degrees E.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Request for Tender called for coverage of the Australian mainland, Tasmania and certain offshore territories. It also asked for information concerning the possibility of providing coverage for Papua New Guinea should this be required. The possibility of providing services to South Pacific countries was investigated during the preliminary design phase. It was decided, on the grounds of increased cost and diminished services to Australians, that it would not be practicable to provide coverage for South Pacific countries in the first generation Australian satellite system, but these needs would be considered in planning for later generation systems.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The national communications satellite system is designed to provide communications services within Australia. International communications are provided by OTC (A) through the INTELSAT satellite system.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Shortfalls of suitably qualified Telecom technical staff have been experienced in two States, New South Wales and Queensland, during 1980-81. In New South Wales actual levels were up to 90 below plan but the shortfalls had been largely overcome by the end of the year as a result of concerted recruitment and training efforts. In the case of Queensland there were shortages in the order of 180 during the first two quarters but there was a downward adjustment of staffing levels at mid-year owing to demand levels, whilst still very strong, being lower than initially predicted.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The main reason for the shortfalls has been the unprecedented level of demand in New South Wales and Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There has been some increase in the usage of overtime as a result of the shortfalls outlined above but it is impossible to quantify precisely what proportion of overtime expenditure is attributable to this factor. In view of the fact that the shortfalls have occurred despite all possible recruitment and training initiatives it would not have been possible to reduce overtime payments by employing additional technical staff.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The exchange network has not been depleted as a result of the shortfalls in Technical staff experienced in New South Wales and Queensland. The initial impact of any shortfalls in Technical staff would be in the new customer services area rather than in the exchange network area. Unprecedented demand can also affect the exchange equipment installation programme when equipment ordering programmes take a short time to catch up with actual requirements. This can also result in delays in the provision of new customer services.</PARA>

<PARA> I draw the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Transport to the letter in the opening part of Volume 1 of the Holcroft report. The third paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA> In your initial meeting with us in June 1980, you emphasised that you had been assured by both airlines that the inquiry could expect to receive their full and willing co-operation and that the same could be expected from your own Department.</PARA>
<PARA> The next paragraph stated that the Department of Transport was unhelpful and that the Bureau of Transport economics failed to make a submission. What disciplinary action is the Government proposing to take against this lack of performance by its two bodies?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The letter in Volume 1 of the Holcroft report to which the senator referred expressed the view that the committee found it unhelpful that the Department of Transport's submission was not received until 10 December 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> The committee also mentioned in the letter that the Bureau of Transport Economics did not make a submission to the inquiry. The question of assistance to the Holcroft inquiry was a matter which the Bureau itself decided. The BTE has advised that the possibility of a submission was canvassed with both members and the Secretary of the inquiry on separate occasions. Inquiry members were told that a submission would only be made if the BTE was convinced that its work would significantly contribute to the inquiry's task. In the event, the BTE executive was not convinced this was the case and decided not to make a submission.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the BTE did hold wide ranging discussions with the inquiry and its staff. In addition, two BTE officers joined the inquiry staff on secondment.</PARA>
<PARA> Officers of both the Department and the BTE co-operated with the inquiry and its staff whenever asked. Both bodies responded to all requests made of them by the inquiry as soon as was possible within available resources. The Government believes that in its acceptance of the broad principles contained in the Holcroft report's recommendations comments brought against it on this matter have been effectively countered.</PARA>

<PARA> No doubt the Minister representing the Treasurer is aware that in some countries a personal income tax return is required to be submitted only once in every two years. The income tax paid in the second year is based upon the tax paid in the first year and an adjustment is made when the next return is submitted. No doubt the Minister is well aware that Switzerland is one such country. It is a country whose economy and inflation rate Australia could well attempt to copy. Will the Minister therefore ask the Treasurer to consider implementing a similar system in Australia with a view to the obvious economies it would bring within the Australian Taxation Office?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> A system of submitting personal income tax returns on a biennial basis would contrast markedly with our taxation system which, in common with those of most Western countries, requires tax to be paid on income in the year in which that income is derived.</PARA>
<PARA> A biennial lodgment system would give rise to complications in the well established arrangements for the completion, lodgement and processing of income tax returns, and the assessment and collection of income tax and would involve a substantial first year cost to the revenue.

<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> Yes, my attention was drawn to the article headed 'Scandal over Police Seizure of Doctors' Files' in the issue of the Bulletin of 17 March 1981. The Commonwealth Crimes Act empowers the Australian Federal Police (AFP) to obtain and execute search warrants for the purposes of obtaining evidentiary material. The arrangements under the Act apply in respect of material and records relevant to any suspected fraud involving Commonwealth moneys, including those arising under the Health Insurance Act.</PARA>
<PARA> No-one wishes to cause any increased worry or suffering for patients, and the issue has been the subject of a number of separate Government considerations. When documents have been seized the AFP are very conscious of the need to maintain confidentiality and security of those documents.</PARA>
<PARA> The procedures followed by the AFP were set out in the answer provided by the Minister for Administrative Services to Question No. 172 asked by Senator Colston (Hansard, 25 February 1981, page 142):</PARA>
<PARA> 'I am informed that the Australian Federal Police are not empowered to confiscate medical records; but by virtue of a search warrant issued vide Section 10 of the Crimes Act 1914, they are empowered to seize records which may be of evidentiary value relating to the commission of an offence.

<PARA> (a) and (b) I am informed that in view of the confidential nature of the doctor/patient relationship, the following specific instructions relating to seized medical records have been issued to all members of the Force.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) All records seized are to be marked and entered as an exhibit and stored in safe storage.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) All records will be photocopied, the photocopies being given to the doctor concerned as soon as possible. If before the supply of photocopies, a doctor urgently needed records for patient treatment, every effort is to be made to respond to the need by supplying photocopies of the required records.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A patient whose medical record has been seized may wish to seek information as to why his/her record was seized. A request for this information is to be directed through the Commissioner's office.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) All original records are to be kept in lockable cabinets.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Keys to cabinets holding the records are to be restricted to no more than two persons.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Records which are no longer required are to be returned to the doctor as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The contents of all records are to be treated with the utmost confidentiality.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Any movement of the records is to be recorded.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) A member or other person is to sign for records given into his/her possession.</PARA>
<PARA> The President of the AMA has seen the above instructions and has expressed his agreement with them.'</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services has also supplied information on discussions between the President of the Australian Medical Association, Dr L. L. Wilson, and the Commissioner of the AFP, Sir Colin Woods, on 20 August 1980 on police procedures relating to the enforcement of the Health Insurance Act. These discussions took place following representations made to the AMA by psychiatrists through the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> A joint press statement was released after the discussions. The Statement includes:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Dr Wilson and the Commissioner said: ''Both the AMA and the Australian Federal Police accept that the primary consideration is the protection of the public (in this case doctors' patients) and not that doctors should have any special privilege or protection in regard to the enforcement of the law.''</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Wilson said: ''For the first time I have had access to the internal guidelines adopted by the Police for the procedures police officers should follow if they are directed to make inquiries of a medical practitioner, which, if complied with, will help to reduce anxieties held by practising doctors.''</PARA>
<PARA> ''I have been reassured that the guidelines will be strictly adhered to and, in addition, Sir Colin has advised me that he will take careful account of the representations we made and further ensure that the confidentiality of patient records is respected and not jeopardised by Police action.''</PARA>
<PARA> ''This is our main area of concern and, in cases involving Police inquiries, there is the need for the police to recognise the importance of a doctor being able to continue to meet the needs of his patients.''</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Wilson added: ''We are not out to protect doctors from the normal processes of law if they are committing frauds and it is not the AMA's wish to hinder Police in their efforts to detect such cases.''</PARA>
<PARA> Sir Colin Woods said: ''The Australian Federal Police have agreed to look closely at the existing guidelines with a view to amplifying any points that require emphasis in our efforts to reduce-if not remove entirely-the causes for concern by the medical profession and the AMA in particular.''</PARA>
<PARA> ''It is vital that Police Officers conducting an inquiry in no way impinge upon-or are seen to make-clinical judgements.''</PARA>
<PARA> ''It is equally important that any Police enquiry should be strictly confined to specific matters and the relevant records so as to remove complaints about widespread seizures and the consequent upheaval in the doctor's practice.''</PARA>
<PARA> ''I am anxious that the police should be responsive to the needs of the profession-and those in its care-and I have invited the AMA to be represented at the next meeting of the Australian Federal Police Divisional Heads, set down for mid-October when I shall reiterate both the guidelines and the agreement reached today. I am delighted that Dr Wilson has accepted the invitation and will attend personally.''</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Wilson addressed the meeting of Federal Police Divisional Heads on 16 October. His address was reported in pages 12 and 13 of the AMA Gazette of 6 November 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> In his address, Dr Wilson reaffirmed the Association's condemnation of health insurance frauds committed by doctors. He referred to a genuine conflict of interest situation between the roles of doctors in maintaining the confidentiality of their doctor/patient relationship and those of the police in investigating frauds. He said that if the guidelines laid down by the police for handling seized patient records were strictly adhered to 'they will go a long way toward reducing the anxieties held by practising doctors.'</PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General, in referring the matter of privacy to the Australian Law Reform Commission in April 1976, included a specific request in relation to health insurance records.</PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman of the Commission, Mr Justice Kirby, said in an address to members at a conference of the General Practitioners' Society in Australia on 23 March 1981, that the 'Commission has proposed a uniform regimen, requiring normally, judicial authorisation before such powers of entry, search and seizure may be exercised.'</PARA>
<PARA> He also said:</PARA>
<PARA> 'It would appear to me to be too facile to say that a doctor's records should not be examined without his consent (or even his patient's consent), when investigating an offence alleged against the doctor or patient himself.

<PARA> In accordance with Government policy, if at some time in the future approval were given to the Jabiluka project, it is envisaged that development would proceed pursuant to the terms of a mining title granted under Northern Territory legislation. Insofar as uranium is concerned, the Commonwealth has a reserve power to ensure that, when granting a mining title, the responsible Northern Territory Minister acts on and gives effect to the advice of the relevant Commonwealth Minister. This means that the terms and conditions of any mining title granted for the Jabiluka project would be those determined by the Commonwealth in consultation with the Northern Territory Government and other organisations. These conditions would of course cover environmental rehabilitation with recourse to the supervising authorities to ensure that they are carried out.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, pursuant to the provisions of the Northern Territory Uranium Mining (Environment Control) Act, the Northern Territory Government has wide ranging powers including requirements for the lodging of securities to ensure that mining operations are undertaken in a responsible manner.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not expect in this context there would be any difficulty in regard to future development at Jabiluka.</PARA>

<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) reported to the Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission (NSC) on this incident on 18 May 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> MITI's report concluded that inadequate design and construction of the storage structure as well as improper management of radioactive waste water were the main causes of the leakage, and the seriousness of the incident was compounded by human error. As a result, MITI has announced that the power company involved (JAPCO) must close its Tsuruga plant for six months and will not be permitted to resume operations until defective facilities and safety measures meet acceptable standards.</PARA>
<PARA> With respect to possible fish contamination, the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) and its Science and Technology Agency (STA) have advised the Australian Government that no fish caught in Tsuruga Bay were required to be impounded following the accident. An STA report filed on 18 May stated that neither edible fish nor sea water was contaminated by radioactivity, although an infinitesimal amount of radioactivity, well below safety standards, was detected in non-edible marine life.</PARA>

<PARA> Is the Treasurer or the Minister aware that a company calling itself United American and Australasian Film Productions Pty Ltd is widely canvassing investment partners in a film fund partnership venture which purports to give approximately a 400 per cent deduction on outlays using section 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act and states in its circulated document:</PARA>
<PARA> It is anticipated that a contribution of $10,000 this financial year will result in a deduction of not less than $37,500 and not more than $45,000.</PARA>
<PARA> Is the Minister aware that this type of proposal, which involves an arrangement precluding assignments, is disadvantaging those who are trying to work within the Government's proposed framework of a 150 per cent deduction on film outlays and is causing concern to those who are interested in investing in the viability of the Australian film industry? Will the Minister look at this type of partnership investment venture and others that are circulating when drawing up the Government's film investment legislation to see that those who want to assist in genuine investment in the Australian film industry and who want to work within the Government's guidelines as outlined at the last election are protected?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the matters referred to by the honourable senator.</PARA>
<PARA> Without commenting on the activities of particular companies or individuals, I can assure the honourable senator that care was taken in the development of the new taxation concessions for investment in Australian films to guard against their exploitation. In particular, the availability of deductions is to be limited to expenditure for which the investor is at true risk of economic loss. The concept of limiting the availability of income tax deductions to amounts actually at risk has not previously been adopted in Australia. Whether, and to what extent, it might prove appropriate to apply an 'at risk' concept across a wider range of provisions which give rise to income tax deductions is another question to which consideration would need to be given at the appropriate time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 30 April 1981 (Hansard, page 1551) Senator Lewis asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Attorney-General in his own capacity and as Minister representing the Ministers for Employment and Youth Affairs, Business and Consumer Affairs and Industrial Relations. I refer to the continued reported shortages in skilled tradesmen, particularly in the metal and engineering industries, and the effect on business of inter-union disputation and wildcat strikes. I ask: Is it not a fact that one of the consequences of such strikes has been to bankrupt many small businesses? Is it not a fact that in the case of the Newcastle State Dockyard, Evans Deakin dockyard, Brisbane, and Walkers Dockyard, Maryborough, such disputation was responsible for the closure of those yards and the loss of thousands of jobs at the yards and in supporting industries? Can the Minister say whether the militancy and disputation of certain unions has been a cause in the failure of employers to attract sufficient numbers of apprentices to make successful tradesmen? Can he tell the Senate whether it is a fact that the armed forces have no difficulty in attracting applicants of the required calibre for the same trades?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industrial Relations has provided the following answer in response to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Inter union disputation and wildcat strikes can certainly cause financial losses for small businesses. Obviously, many small businesses do not have reserves available to protect them against this type of unexpected loss. In this situation bankruptcy can often be the inevitable outcome, with its attendant loss of employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA> The Newcastle State Dockyard, Evans Deakin Dockyard, Brisbane, and Walkers Dockyard, Maryborough all ceased the building of new ships several years ago, although some ship repair, (and building of fishing boats in the case of Newcastle) is still carried out. New ship building activities became uneconomic several years ago, and a major factor was rising labour costs compared with overseas competitors. The decreasing activity in the yards has indeed led to a great drop in the numbers employed.</PARA>
<PARA> While there is no shortage of apprenticeship applicants, there is certainly a shortage of apprenticeships offered by employers to meet this demand. Employers' ability to offer apprenticeships depends to a considerable extent on their financial situation, and employers facing the problems of militant unions, and industrial action are not always in a position to make apprenticeships available.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 6 May 1981 (Hansard, page 1640), Senator Sibraa asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications. How much will it cost to change the name on stationery, buildings and vehicles of Australia Post Courier to Australia Post Express, as has been proposed following the review of Government functions? How will the taxpayer be helped by this expenditure? How will the taxpayer be helped by the allocation of Australia Post Courier's non-mail business to less efficient private operators?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australia Post Courier service, which ceased operation on 30 June 1981, provided a messenger pick-up and delivery service for letters, documents and most classes of goods. The Express Mail service which commenced operations from 1 July 1981, will carry postal items only, as part of the mail service, providing lodgment at post offices (with an optional collection service) and an express delivery.</PARA>
<PARA> Because the Express service will be quite different, operationally, from the Courier service, the new service will have different requirements for stationery, buildings and vehicles which are not comparable with those facilities used for the provision of the Courier service.</PARA>
<PARA> Identifiable costs associated with the abolition of the Courier service include the removal of the external identification signs from Courier buildings, at a cost of approximately $1,000. As the removal of Courier decals from vehicles involved only the 'peeling off' of the word Courier, a cost has not been calculated for this exercise; however any cost would be minimal. No replacement identification signs are planned either for buildings or vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA> The cost of printing new stationery will depend largely on the form the Express service takes and the use which the public makes of the service. An interim supply of new forms has been printed at a cost of $17,000.</PARA>
<PARA> The expenditure involved must be viewed in the context of the overall purpose in abolishing the Courier service. In many instances the Courier service was handling goods not normally carried by the postal service. It was therefore competing in an area which the private sector can properly service. It is to the benefit of the taxpayer that Government withdraw from inappropriate involvement in commercial activities as this enhances the opportunities for private sector activity and real growth in the Australian economy.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided me with the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The major operators were consulted and both have advised that direct flights have been introduced whenever traffic allows. Direct services between Melbourne-Brisbane; Melbourne-Coolangatta have been increased, while direct services between Tasmania-Coolangatta and Adelaide-Coolangatta have been introduced.</PARA>
<PARA> Direct Brisbane-Canberra services were introduced but were withdrawn when they failed to attract sufficient patronage. Nevertheless traffic on this route and on the Adelaide-Brisbane route is being monitored by the airlines and direct services could be expected to be introduced as soon as they became economically viable.</PARA>
<PARA> In recent years the airlines have taken positive action in the planning and construction of timetables to minimise the difficulties at Sydney as far as possible. Essentially, frequency of services to and from Sydney has been stabilised by the increased use of aircraft with larger seating capacity to match growth in originating and terminating traffic. In fact over the past two years the frequency of scheduled services between Melbourne-Sydney and Brisbane-Sydney has marginally reduced and will reduce even further with the progressive introduction of larger Airbus aircraft later this year.</PARA>

Although the British Defence Minister says that Ark Royal will be completed as planned, speculation continues about the ship being converted to serve other purposes, mothballed or even scrapped. Does the Minister not foresee a similar controversial destiny for the Australian aircraft carrier now planned, because of the increasingly obsolescent nature of this class of vessel? In what way can a single aircraft carrier adequately protect the Australian coastline while at the same time requiring considerable periods out of duty for maintenance and refit? Why is the Government persisting with plans for this largely useless vessel, at a cost of at least $700m, when that sum could provide a complete flotilla of modern attack craft, such as the United States Pegasus class vessels, which are hydrofoil vessels, which can attack at 60 miles an hour and which have the very considerable strike capability of eight 'Harpoon' missiles to each vessel?</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the radio interference caused by OHR systems. Recent reports from my Department's monitoring stations indicate that the interference is much less harmful in Australia than it is in other parts of the world. In fact, very little specific information is available that the transmissions are causing harmful interference to operating radio services in Australia, particularly to outback services.</PARA>

<PARA> The Government is aware of reports that residents of Lebanon have travelled to Damascus to enable immigration applications to be processed. The Australian Embassy in Damascus reported on 18 June that it could not identify any religious or geographic group which had not been able to travel to Damascus.Indeed, many applicants found travel to Damascus more convenient and less dangerous than to Beirut.

<PARA> I am informed that as aircraft are refurbished, the airlines, including Ansett Airlines of Australia, are using the latest materials available to reduce flammability and minimise production of smoke and toxic gases. However, at present there is no practical alternative to organic materials, either natural or synthetic, and as such it is not possible to develop a cabin interior that does not burn and produce some smoke and fumes. Other safety measures have been aimed at reducing possible ignition sources and facilitation of speedy evacuation of passengers in an emergency.</PARA>
<PARA> My advice is that the airlines are conscious of the dangers of post-crash fire and are applying the information which flowed from the CSIRO investigation.</PARA>

<PARA> In what years, if any, has South Australia not received its proper entitlement under the River Murray Waters Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Information from the River Murray Commission indicates that annual flow to South Australia has only once, in 1944-45, been less than that to which that State is entitled under the River Murray Waters Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> During the severe drought in 1944 and 1945, the water passed to South Australia amounted to 938,000 megalitres, some 608,000 megalitres less than South Australia's annual entitlement at that time. However, the volume actually available to South Australia in 1944-45 was 1,272,000 megalitres, some 274,000 megalitres less than entitlement, as South Australia decided to hold back 334,000 megalitres in reserve in Lake Victoria in case of a continuation of the drought into the following season.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 3 June 1981 (Hansard, page 2504) Senator Grimes asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Health, a question without notice concerning funding of women's refuges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's concern for the provision of services for women, such as those mentioned by the honourable senator, has been clearly evidenced by the level of funding provided for them under the Community Health Program since the Government took office. For 1981-82, the States will be provided with increased general revenue grants which will include components equal to Commonwealth expenditure on such services in 1980-81, plus 10 per cent. Thus, the States will be provided with a level of funding adequate to make allocations to maintain current levels of activity of such services.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have already announced, the Commonwealth will not be attaching any specific conditions to these increased payments to the States for 1981-82. It is therefore a matter for the States to determine their priorities in the allocation of funds to services such as those mentioned by the honourable senator and, on that basis, it is not open to me to provide any guarantee such as that sought by the honourable senator. However, the Commonwealth expects the States to allocate an appropriately high priority to services for women. Indeed, the Prime Minister has specifically requested the Premiers to allocate funds to ensure that needs in this area are met.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided me with the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Despite the claims made for the inclusion of a photograph on drivers' licences, such a requirement, which would be both costly to the licensing authority and inconvenient to the licence holder, offers no more protection against fraud than the present system which relies on comparison of signatures. Moreover the means exist to fraudulently alter photographic licences and those most likely to do this are the very ones at which the proposal is aimed.</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the survey to which the honourable senator referred. I understand it was conducted for one of the organisations concerned with the production of photographic licence materials.</PARA>
<PARA> In July 1980 the Australian Transport Advisory Council (ATAC) endorsed in principle a report entitled Guidelines for Driver Licensing and Driver Improvement Programs in Australia prepared by a special sub-committee of its Advisory Committee on Road User Performance and Traffic Codes. The sub-committee had addressed the matter of photographic drivers' licences but did not recommend their introduction.

<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Belwood Housing Estate comprises 12 houses and is situated a distance of some 3.4km road travel from the Nambucca Heads post office. Although the Estate is located within the street mail delivery boundary of that office, the 14 Aboriginal families who reside there have not been receiving deliveries of mail or telegrams.</PARA>
<PARA> Deliveries have not been provided to the Estate because one of the elders of the community indicated to the Postmaster, when approached two to three years ago about the introduction of a street mail delivery service, that the majority of residents preferred, for various reasons, to collect their mail at the post office. Since that time, residents have collected mail, and telegrams, from the post office and none has requested that mail be delivered to the Estate. Australia Post is not aware of any delays occurring to telegrams. Delays would be unlikely given the very frequent collection of mail from the post office.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no reason why a mail delivery service should not be provided to residents, if required, although at present, there are no mail boxes at any of the houses in the Estate. The Postmaster, Nambucca Heads, has contacted a member of the local Aboriginal Council, Mr Jarrett, who has undertaken:</PARA>
<PARA> to provide Australia Post with confirmation of details and addresses of all residents;</PARA>
<PARA> to ensure that house numbers are provided and displayed at each residence;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. 37-Financial Details of Medical and Hospital Funds-In accordance with section 76A of the National Health Act (section 76A was included in 1970) an annual report 'Operations of the Registered Medical and Hospital Benefits Organizations' is tabled in Parliament and provides financial details of medical and hospital funds. It is assumed that this is the document to which reference was made.</PARA>
<PARA> No. 40-Departmental calculation of an Index of health costs-My Department has not calculated any index of health costs. It has however published a number of documents relating to total health expenditures and information of this nature is included in the Director-General of Health's annual reports. In June 1980, my Department released a document which provided an analysis of Australian Health Expenditure 1974-75 to 1977-78. A further extension of this publication is in preparation. In addition, a summary of Commonwealth estimates of expenditure as provided in Parliamentary Appropriations for Health is also prepared.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. 38-The Register of Health Funds-Section 73 (2) of the National Health Act requires that two registers 'The Register of Medical Benefits Organizations' and 'The Register of Hospital Benefits Organizations' be maintained. These registers contain the name of each organization, the State or Territory to which the registration relates and the date of the registration.</PARA>
<PARA> Section 73 (4) provides that-'A register shall not be open for inspection except by a person authorized in writing by the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> The registers are not generally available because of this legislative restriction. However, any reasonable request for access would be accepted. In any event the names of all registered organizations are included in the annual report to the Parliament made under section 76A of the National Health Act.</PARA>
<PARA> It will be noted also that section 81 (1) of the National Health Act provides that the Director-General of Health shall publish in the Commonwealth Gazette a notice showing particulars of all subsisting registrations of organizations under section 73. Notification was contained in Gazette No. G2 of 13 January 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> No. 45-Report 'Care of the Aged in Australia'-December 1970-There is no restriction on the circulation of the material contained in this report and copies of it have been made available to interested parties. There are very few copies of the report currently available and, in any case, the material is now considerably dated. More recent documents include the 'Care of the Aged' report of the Social Welfare Commission (1974) and the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Care of the Aged and the Infirm which was tabled in Parliament in February 1977. Both these documents have been made available to interested parties.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. 25-Report of the 1969 Workshop on Health and Nutrition of Aborigines-It is assumed that this reference relates to 'Report of the 1969 Workshop on Health and Nutrition of Aboriginal Children'. This document was marked confidential in 1969 because it included extracts from a then unpublished thesis. Such a classification is no longer appropriate and a copy can be made available for perusal if the honourable senator so wishes. The material is, however, now dated.</PARA>
<PARA> No. 29-Manual of Composition of Proprietary Medicines-My Department does not publish a manual of composition of proprietary medicines. It does however produce a National Poisons Register Manual which contains extracts from the formulations of up to 40,000 chemical products including medicinal preparations, pesticides, agricultural chemicals and household products. This information is for use by hospitals and Poisons Information Centres in giving advice to medical practitioners actually treating cases of poisoning.</PARA>
<PARA> No. 39-Departmental surveys of medical fees-My Department conducted a number of ad hoc surveys of the fees commonly charged by doctors in the years prior to the issue of Mr Spigelman's book in 1972. The results were used in consultation with representatives of the health insurance industry to arrive at changes in the Medical Benefits Schedule. In the latter part of 1970 a continuing survey commencing with claims for the September quarter of 1970 provides for a wide range of analysis to be made including fees charged. The continuing survey also provides information needed by the Department for estimating the costs of individual medical services. It is believed that summaries of the methodology and principal results were made available as working documents for various discussions but there was no concise document which lent itself to issue as a publication in its own right. Information of the observance of common or Scheduled fees is published in the annual reports of the Director-General of Health. The information is restricted only where it may breach the confidentiality of the activities of individual health benefits organisations currently supplying the information to this Department. The information available can be examined at offices of the Department.</PARA>
<PARA> No. 41-Report on 'Geriatrics including the Frail Aged'-The paper referred to formed part of a report prepared in 1966 by a departmental working party on benefits at that time under the National Health Act. It is an out-dated report and only one copy is known to be currently in existence. Nonetheless, if the honourable senator so desires, a copy can be made available for his perusal.</PARA>
<PARA> No. 42-Report 'Nursing Homes and Care of the Aged'-There is no restriction on the release of this document which was prepared in 1966. The material is however very dated and only one copy is known to be in existence. Nonetheless, if the honourable senator so desires a copy can be made available for his perusal.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No. 43-Three 1967 reports entitled 'Nursing Homes'-My Department has no knowledge of reports entitled 'Nursing Homes' prepared in 1967. A report entitled 'Nursing Homes' was prepared in 1972 at the request of a Committee of Cabinet which met on 22nd and 23rd May 1972. That report was considered by an Ad hoc Committee of Cabinet on 30 May 1972. Being a Cabinet document the report is not available for release at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA> No. 44-Report on Nursing Homes Benefits-The document referred to was prepared in 1968 for consideration during Ministerial discussions then taking place. In the normal course of events, advice relating to Ministerial discussions of this type would not be published. These discussions were an input into the considerations which resulted in the introduction of an additional supplementary benefit for nursing home patients requiring and receiving 'intensive' nursing care, now known as 'extensive care benefit'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Aerodrome Local Ownership Plan (ALOP) is a co-operative arrangement between the Commonwealth and the licensees of various aerodromes whereby the Commonwealth provides technical advice and financial grants towards the cost of approved aerodrome maintenance and development, subject to various conditions. One of the major conditions is that the licensees keep the aerodromes open for public use. The ALOP is administered by the Department of Transport in consultation with the Department of Finance with respect to Commonwealth grant allocations. Some State Governments also make a contribution. Other agencies responsible for Commonwealth functions such as Customs, Health, Immigration, Tourism, Environment, and Construction are consulted as necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) 265 aerodromes presently participate in the ALOP-201 of these are eligible for both development and maintenance grants.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Participating aerodromes are situated in larger towns and cities as well as country areas.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The following communities with a population of 20,000 or more participate in the ALOP through the local authority indicated:</PARA>
<PARA> Toowoomba-Toowoomba City Council</PARA>
<PARA> Wollongong-Shell Harbour Municipality</PARA>
<PARA> Maroochydore-Maroochy Shire Council</PARA>

<PARA> Caloundra-Landsborough Shire Council</PARA>
<PARA> Gladstone-Gladstone-Calliope Aerodrome Board</PARA>
<PARA> Ayr-Ayr Shire Council</PARA>
<PARA> Mildura-Shire of Mildura.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth provides all funds necessary for the provision, operation, and maintenance of all essential safety services such as communications, navigation aids, air traffic control, and rescue and fire fighting services. The licensees of these aerodromes are provided with Commonwealth grants towards the costs of all approved aerodrome development and maintenance works, usually on a dollar-for-dollar basis but grants of up to 100 per cent of costs may be provided in particular circumstances. The licensees also retain all aerodrome revenues such as lease income, rents, and parking fees.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The overall costs to the Commonwealth of development and maintenance grants for ALOP aerodromes was $4.02m in 1979-80. Other costs were incurred by the Commonwealth in respect of its continuing responsibility for provision of the essential services mentioned in part (4) of my answer.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) No aerodromes presently leased or owned by the RAAF are incorporated in the ALOP or proposed for entry to the Plan. However, the RAAF is accorded free access to all licensed and Government civil aerodromes, subject only to operational limitations. Hence, the RAAF may occasionally use various aerodromes which participate in the ALOP.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The principal responsibilities of local authorities participating in the ALOP can be briefly described as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to comply with the requirements of the Air Navigation Act and Regulations,</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to own, operate and maintain the aerodrome as a licensed aerodrome open to public use and to be responsible for safety and security,</PARA>
<PARA> (c) to make available areas on the aerodrome for transport industry users such as airlines, air charter operators, aircraft fuel suppliers, on fair and reasonable terms, and to enable performance of Commonwealth responsibilities such as defence, customs, quarantine, immigration and the provision and installation of the safety services listed in part (4) of the answer, without cost,</PARA>
<PARA> (d) to protect the aerodrome clearance surfaces and to create compatible land-use zoning around the aerodrome by such actions as are within their powers,</PARA>
<PARA> (e) to design and carry out the aerodrome works for which Commonwealth grants and technical advice are approved.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) For the first 26 weeks of total incapacity for work the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971 provides for payment to an injured employee at a rate equivalent to his full pay sick leave entitlement. After that period weekly compensation of $105 is payable in respect of the employee.

By reference to movements in the Consumer Price Index (Six Capitals) between the March 1974 quarter and the March quarter 1981, the value of $43 on 1 May 1981 would have been $92.24 and the value of $57 on 1 May 1981 would have been $122.27.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Relevant Commonwealth legislation which governs the nursing home arrangements (the National Health Act 1953 and the Nursing Homes Assistance Act 1974) controls the operations of proprietors of nursing homes for the purposes of Commonwealth payments.</PARA>
<PARA> Nursing homes are commonly owned and operated by Government and Local Government authorities, non-profit religious and/or charitable bodies, private individuals or companies. The legislation refers to a 'proprietor', according to the type of nursing home concerned, as-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) public nursing homes-the authority or body of persons conducting the nursing home;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) private nursing homes-the owner of the business or undertaking carried on at the nursing home;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) voluntary non-profit nursing homes-the organisation, body or other person carrying on the nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA>For the purposes of administering the nursing home arrangements, the 'proprietor' of a nursing home must be clearly identified. However, it is not necessary for the Department to maintain details of nationality of owners of nursing homes and it is therefore not possible to provide a conclusive reply in this regard. However, Departmental records do not indicate any Australian nursing homes are owned by foreign interests.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (3) Telecom seeks payment of connection charges for telephone services at the time of application as part compensation to Telecom for the heavy expenditure incurred in establishing the necessary facilities well in advance of actual installation. Payment of fees in two parts would not be appropriate as 70% of orders are completed within 15 working days and payment of fees in advance is not requested when an application for service is deferred, that is, where service cannot be offered pending major extensions of plant and/or availability of equipment.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) $4.8m (approx).</PARA>
