<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate records its sincere regret at the death on 6 October 1981 of President Mohamed Anwar El Sadat and expresses to the people of the Arab Republic of Egypt profound regret and tenders its deep sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will be aware that the Commonwealth heads of government in Melbourne jointly extended their deep sympathy to Madam Sadat and to the Government and people of Egypt and expressed their horror at the act of outrage which took President Sadat's life. The Governor-General has also expressed his deep sadness and distress at President Sadat's death. As I mentioned earlier, the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, represented this nation at the funeral. </PARA>
<PARA> The loss of a world leader of President Sadat's stature is indeed a tragedy. Honourable senators will recall that he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978, jointly with the Prime Minister of Israel, for his efforts in bringing about the peace with Israel and the stability which has ensued. This is perhaps President Sadat's greatest monument, but his other achievements are not less significant. He took the view that the basic security of Egypt and the Middle East lay in distancing the region from wider global power struggles and to this end he sought to diminish the impact of the Soviet Union by restricting its influence within Egypt and the area as a whole. His pursuit of constructive and realistic domestic and foreign policies brought to both himself and Egypt a reputation for moderation, balance and constraint in the non-aligned world. </PARA>
<PARA> His death is a great loss for Egypt, the Middle East and the world, not least because of the senseless and brutal violence which brought it about. Since 1970 he had led his country both as an outstanding patriot and as a man of vision in relations between nations, and although this process involved an acceptance of substantial risks, both domestic and international, his capacity to devote his energies singlemindedly to this task was itself a tribute to his greatness. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1977, after 30 years of continual warfare in the Middle East, President Sadat made his historic and courageous visit to Jerusalem to address the Knesset, and thus opened the path to negotiation in the quest for peace. Then, in 1979, the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty was signed. We all hope that President Sadat's achievements will be sustained and that his vision of a lasting and comprehensive peace settlement will be realised. Such a result would be a fitting tribute and memorial to him. The world has lost a great leader, a courageous man. We all mourn his death. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to associate the Opposition with the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick). I think the assassination of President Sadat is a clear reminder to all of us of the rapidity with which change occurs in the Middle East which is still the most troubled part of the world and the area most likely to be the flashpoint for a future world war.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> President Sadat was a man of humble origins who rose to the highest office in his country and became an international statesman. We all admire his courage in breaking the emotional ties with the rest of the Arab world to seek an understanding with Israel. That was an act of bravery perhaps unequalled in recent history. Perhaps that act should have alerted us to the fact that at some time President Sadat would be at risk at the hands of an assassin. It seems that it was not so much his relationship with the Israelis that caused his untimely death but internal policies which created hostility amongst Islamic fundamentalists. I think we can all mourn his death as much for its influence on future events as for the contribution he made to seeking a new way of peace in the Middle East. On the shoulders of his successor, Mr Mubarak, falls a heavy burden. </PARA>
<PARA> Egypt's treaty with Israel in March 1979 has not brought a demonstrated peace. Economic problems have become more severe in Egypt and it will need all the help it can get from the Western world to sustain its people and ward off threats from hostile neighbours such as Libya. It will be a tragedy for Egypt if it is to be further plunged into chaos by becoming too closely associated in a military sense with the United States of America. Already it is clear that President Reagan would like to use Egypt as the springboard for his new rapid deployment force in the Middle East. That would further compromise Egypt's relationship with the rest of the Arab world and heighten tensions, already strained, with the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not perhaps a time to dwell on the implications of all these things; it is a time to mourn the death of a brave statesman. It is a sobering thought to review policies in the Middle East and the implications which arise from the tragic death of the President of Egypt. Accordingly, I associate the Opposition with the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the National Country Party I support the motion of sympathy on the occasion of the tragic death of President Sadat of Egypt. I offer the sincere sympathy of myself and of the National Country Party to the Egyptian people and also to the close relatives and friends of the late President Sadat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> President Sadat was, as I understand it, a man of peasant origin, and a great nationalist in his own Egyptian land. Indeed, he spent many years determined to divorce his country from the imperialist dominance of former years. He was a man of great dedication and concern, and he desperately and practically sought peace with Israel as a prelude to a wider and more peaceful atmosphere in the troubled Middle Eastern theatre. He sought those things with a very great measure of success. The withdrawal, continuing, from the Sinai, and the Camp David Accords are some of the fruits of the efforts of this man. It is to be fervently hoped that the initiatives that he has started will continue and that the terrorist-type assault that has caused not only the President's death but also the death of and injuries to many other people will cease and will be, in fact, banished from this world. I again offer the sympathy of my party to the Egyptian people and to the close relatives and friends of President Sadat. We have all suffered the loss of a great promoter and champion of the cause of peace in a troubled world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I associate the Australian Democrats with this motion of condolence which perhaps is one of the most important and significant condolence motions to have been moved in the Senate for some time. Mohamed Anwar Sadat became President of Egypt in 1970 at the age of 51. When he took over, on the death of Gamal Abdel Nasser, Egypt was still reeling from the effects of the 1967 war-in a low state of national morale and, under Nasser, a fairly high state of repression. Anwar Sadat was able to revive Egypt with the release of thousands of political prisoners, the expulsion of Soviet military advisers and the overhaul of the political system. In 1973 he crossed the Suez Canal to defeat Israel and indeed, whatever the rights and wrongs of that conflict, he restored Egypt's pride in itself. In 1977 he went to Jerusalem to make peace with the Israelis, a gesture which appeared to be overwhelmingly approved by the people of Egypt. As the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) has said, President Sadat was awarded, in association with Mr Begin, the Nobel Peace Prize for that tremendous initiative. When Anwar Sadat became President of Egypt in 1970 he was lightly regarded but he soon demonstrated to the world that he was a statesman of the first order. I fear that events yet to come may show us just how much he will be missed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, we as a legally elected and constituted House of Parliament can only, I suggest, consider with abhorrence the killing by violent means of a man dedicated to peace. That kind of violence, assassination, invasion and occupation of small nations and the like, I am sure all honourable senators would agree, must be resisted by all people of good will, and by all free parliaments, as often as possible and in every possible way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The meeting in Jerusalem between Prime Minister Begin and President Sadat a few years ago was a high point. For many people it was a moment of hope in an area where there had been no peace for many years. I know I speak for part of the Australian community when I say that for the Jewish community it was a moment of high hope and Mr Sadat stood very high among the Jews of the world who for many years had been involved in war in the Middle East. I would just like to say that the death last week of President Sadat shocked the Australian Jewish community very deeply. Last Thursday was Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. It was announced during the services at my synagogue that on the Friday night at the normal sabbath service there would in fact be a memorial service for President Sadat. I ask the Senate to consider that such an event might have been almost unthinkable 10 or even five years ago. I think that is a measure of what the man was and what he contributed to world peace.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death on 12 October of the Honourable Patrick John Kennelly, a Senator for the State of Victoria from 1953 to 1971, and a Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from 1956 to 1967, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>Pat Kennelly gave a lifetime of association to the Labor movement. He served for some 14 years in the Victorian Legislative Council. In the State Parliament he served as honorary Minister, Commissioner of Public Works and Minister in charge of Electrical Undertakings. He was elected to the Senate in 1953 and served for 18 years, retiring on 30 June 1971. He served on various committees including the Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications and the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review. He was Temporary Chairman of Committees from September 1968 and Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from February 1956 to February 1967. He was a trustee of the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Trust from March 1967 until his retirement. He was a member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association delegation in 1959 and a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union delegation in 1964. He leaves a widow, a son and a daughter. </PARA>
<PARA> I was not privileged to serve in the chamber with Pat Kennelly but I came to know him over the years. I came to know him as a man of total dedication to his political cause, a man who brought a skill, shrewdness of judgment and professionalism to his cause. He was a man who, with that very attractive stutter or stammer-which one dared to imitate, and one could almost hear it in this chamber-was nevertheless entirely articulate. No one was left in any doubt at all about what Pat Kennelly meant. He was a doughty opponent and yet a good friend. He was able to separate issues from personalities. He fought a very tough fight. There were few more professional in this profession of politics than Pat Kennelly. He was the very proof of the saying that all history is biography. He was very much the biography and the history of the Australian Labor Party and the Labor movement of his day. I think the Australian people have lost a good servant. I commend the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick). The career of Pat Kennelly in politics spanned more than 40 years. As the Leader of the Government has pointed out, Pat Kennelly attained a degree of articulateness in spite of a stammer which became perhaps his most notable characteristic. He joined the Australian Labor Party at the age of 15 in 1915. In 1924 at the age of 24 he tried to enter the State Parliament in Victoria but lost. He became Secretary of the Victorian branch of the Labor Party in 1930 and held that job for 16 years. In 1938 he was elected to the Victorian upper House. As the Leader of the Government said, Pat Kennelly was a Minister in the Cain Government. He was again State Secretary of the Victorian Labor Party from 1946, Federal Secretary of the Labor Party from 1946 and its full time Secretary from 1950. In 1952 he lost his preselection for the safe upper House seat of Melbourne West as a result of bitter internal squabbles in the Labor Party which were to lead to the split of 1955. However, in 1953 he was elected to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier that in spite of the stammer which has become famous he was a very effective and articulate speaker. In fact, Senator Carrick did not say so but there have been occasions in this Senate, which I believe some people will recall, when he used that stammer to excellent, if doubtful, advantage. Pat Kennelly lived all of his life in the suburb of South Melbourne. He died there and is survived by his wife and two children. I think it is fair to say that Kennelly perhaps will be one of the great legendary figures of Labor politics and possibly party politics. He is famous for such injunctions as: 'It is nice to have the logic but I prefer to have the numbers'. I recall many similar famous and colourful phrases that I heard him use. One was that, as Chairman of the Albert Park Trust, if he ever wanted any publicity in the Melbourne Herald, he would arrange to cut down a tree in the park. </PARA>
<PARA> One point that should be made about Kennelly is his very real political influence over great Labor leaders. He was extremely influential in the political life of the former Premier of Victoria, John Cain, and, in a strange way, was also something of a mentor and influence in the life of the next Labor Premier of that State, John Cain Jnr. There was a long association between those two families. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that he was also very influential in the life of the Chifley Labor Government. I recall his telling me that on one occasion Ben Chifley was very opposed to a course on which the Labor Party seemed intent upon embarking, and he walked around the gardens of Parliament House for two hours arguing with Ben Chifley about what ought to be done. Finally he said to Chifley: 'Ben, if you do not do this Reg Pollard will lose the seat of Ballaarat'. Chifley stamped his foot on the ground and said: 'All right Pat, we will do it, but I am not going to announce it'. That, in a sense, was a mark of Kennelly's influence over the Chifley Government and indeed the whole of Labor politics at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, he was a man who had a passionate loyalty-a loyalty which perhaps only people of Celtic origin might understand-to all those things in which he believed and which he valued. They included his family, his church, his political party, the Richmond Football Club, and a variety of very close friendships with particular people in politics. For my own part, I always regarded Pat Kennelly as in many ways a guiding star, a personal mentor and a friend. I strongly associate myself with the message of deep sympathy from this Senate to his wife, his daughter Joan and his son Ron. I have pleasure in commending the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

In my first few months in this chamber, in 1970, I had the pleasure of knowing Senator Kennelly, although admittedly only briefly. I became aware of his contribution, of his earnestness and of his great ability to promote the things in which he believed. I am aware now, on looking back, of his very long service in his particular political field, in an organisational capacity and as a member of both the upper House of his own State and, for no less than 18 years, of this chamber, the Senate. The late Senator Kennelly was well known for his humour, his dedication, his professionalism, and indeed, as I understand it, his great worldly knowledge and capacity to assess realities. I wish to associate my party with the expression of sincere sympathy to his widow and children.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Pat Kennelly was a member of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party and a member of the Senate from 1953 to 1971, a term of some 18 years. For nine of those years, namely from 1962 until his retirement in 1971, I had the honour of being one of his party and parliamentary colleagues. Senator Kennelly was a graduate of the university of hard knocks. He was a realist. He was a man with a sardonic sense of humour, a man who was completely dedicated to the Labor movement. He rose to the top of the party's echelons and was responsible for so many others making it also.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the great days of the Chifley Labor Government, Pat Kennelly was the General Secretary of the Australian Labor Party. He was regarded by all and sundry as the king maker. He was the old-type Labor man who had a great understanding of and a great belief in ordinary people. He believed in getting things done. According to him, in politics the way in which things could be done was for the party to get into government. That was always at the top of the mast as far as he was concerned. Pat Kennelly could never understand modern economics. He once said to me: 'My mother taught me the economics of earning a quid and spending only 19s 9d. Do that and you are always well out in front'. In his last words to the Senate on 12 May 1971 he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I have enjoyed the lifetime I have had. When one has been a member of a political party for more than 56 years, as I will have been next August, one becomes part of that party. I never wanted to come to Canberra. I could have come earlier than I did-possibly in my heyday in the Labor Party-but I did not want to come. A set of circumstances which some people in this chamber may recall forced my entry into the Commonwealth Parliament. But that is all part of the game. I defeated many, and some defeated me. I wish to thank one person who is not here; that is my wife. Without her I could not have done what I have done. Very few men succeed in life without the help and encouragement of a partner in life such as I had. I thank her for it. </PARA>
<PARA>I must say that in the years which I have had in public life I have never known a more devoted couple than Pat and Jessie Kennelly. Senator Kennelly always referred to Mrs Kennelly not with the possessive term, 'my wife', but as Mrs Kennelly. Long after he left the Senate he continued to maintain a great interest in the affairs of the Parliament, the Senate in particular, and of the people who make up the parliamentary life of this country. Quite often Pat and Mrs Kennelly could be seen in the lobbies of this Parliament. He was particularly keen to be here during the time of the Whitlam Labor Government from 1972 to 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Button has said, Pat Kennelly was a legendary figure. He will be immortalised in the folklore of the Labor movement. His life was a full life. He was a tremendous parliamentarian and a great Australian. Mr President, I am honoured that you have asked me to represent you and the Senate at his funeral on Thursday. I join the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) and the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button) in the condolence motion that has been moved. I extend my personal sympathy to his widow and to the members of his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with my colleagues in this well deserved tribute to the memory of former Senator Kennelly. I notice that my leader, Senator Button, referred to Pat Kennelly's loyalty to the Richmond Football Club. That loyalty caused him to extend his influence well beyond the State of Victoria. With the advent of poker machines New South Wales Australian rules football clubs were able to go into the market and obtain the better class Victorian players. Pat Kennelly had an assignment which he dished out to many New South Wales members. It was to get the reports and balance sheets of those clubs so that when it came to negotiations, particularly if a Richmond player was involved, behind the scenes they knew how much to negotiate to make sure that they got a reasonable signing-on fee. I do not think he worried so much if it was a Collingwood player, but if it was a Richmond player he would telephone people to make sure that the chap was getting a fair go. That was typical of the man. He found small matters in relation to which he would prevent any injustices occurring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second matter is a little different. We had what I would describe as a rort involving the Wentworth Park dog track in Sydney and its use on Sundays for soccer. A first division club had the tender. The week the club was playing away it would sublet the field at 300 per cent profit. Eventually this was detected. I pointed this out to Pat Kennelly. He said that it would not happen at Albert Park. But such is human frailty, whether it be in Victoria or New South Wales, that it had happened. He telephoned me a month later and said: 'Brother, I fixed that up. They have had to give back every bloody dollar to the third division team'. It had been paying 300 per cent more in some subletting arrangement which Pat Kennelly and the trust had been unaware of. The nicest part was that later he told me that the club that benefited was a Maltese club. When he went to mass they said: 'Mr Kennelly, we are lighting candles for you. We think you are a wonderful man'. He said: 'When you get to my age, with all the enemies I have made and all the difficulties I have had, it is good to have that support'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to associate myself with this condolence motion. I extend sincere sympathy to the widow and children of the late Senator Pat Kennelly. If Pat were here he would probably laugh heartily if he knew what I was going to say. I am probably the only member of this chamber who likes to think that he had the logic in 1955. What Pat said is dead right: We did not have the numbers. That is all I would like to say. It just seems to me that he would laugh if he were here and heard me say such a thing. All I can say is that I certainly mourn him. There were occasions in the last couple of years when we exchanged words. He always had a fatherly interest in what I was doing, even if it was from a long distance. I will certainly remember him and I will certainly pray for the eternal repose of his soul.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to contribute briefly to the debate. I join with those who have spoken previously in paying their tributes to the late Pat Kennelly. He was the Deputy Leader when I came into this chamber. Perhaps I got to know him better in the hurly-burly of outside politics when I filled the role of national president of my party over a period of years. Pat was the type of bloke with whom I could have an argument and five minutes later-he was a non-drinker-he would be prepared to have a cup of tea with me. We would laugh and talk about the discussion that had taken place. He was one of the great characters of this country and probably one of the most colourful ever to have walked the political stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope that somewhere, some time, someone writes his memoirs in order to tell us precisely the inside things which Pat knew and which he shared with very few people. He had a tendency to share his memories and experiences in a piecemeal sort of way. He would talk to one person and recall a particular incident and would probably talk to half a dozen other people about half a dozen other incidents. It will be very difficult to get all that data together. He was a bit of a bower bird. One hopes that his papers will not be destroyed and that, like Dr Evatt's, eventually they will be put together. I hope that eventually the true story of the great problems Pat Kennelly faced in the early part and then the middle part of his political career will get the publicity which is warranted. I join with those who have spoken earlier in expressing sympathy to his widow, his son and his daughter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I regret the passing of Pat Kennelly. I was surprised to hear of his death. I thought Pat Kennelly would live forever; he was that sort of a person. He seemed to be timeless in what he did and what he had to say. I remember him in particular because he often came to my defence. He was not one who believed in my political attitudes; nevertheless, he protected me when I was in trouble in this place-which was more often than not. I remember sitting on the far side of the Senate; Pat used to be at the back. When the President gave a ruling which suppressed me Pat Kennelly found a suitable way around that ruling. I was grateful for that, as were many people who were young and new members of the Opposition at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With Pat Kennelly's passing passes a substantial part of the lives of the people who knew him, because he represented the Australian Labor Party in a particular way. He defended the Labor Party at his own cost. The cost was antagonism by the church to which he was most loyal. I do not doubt now that that church understands how right Pat Kennelly was and how wrong it was during that period. In spite of that oppression he never at any time relaxed in his loyalty, either to his religion or to the party to which he belonged. For that reason I want to place on record my feelings and my expression of sympathy to his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I present the following petition from 45 citizens of Australia which is not in conformity with the Standing Orders:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>We, the undersigned, wish to express our opposition to the proposed Plant Breeders' Rights or Plant Varietal Rights Bill to be tabled at the forthcoming sitting of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the Bill is drafted in favour of plant breeders and their allied companies and to the exclusion of the interests of the wider community. For the short-term, monetary gain of a few, this Bill jeopardises the well-being of all other Australians in the following ways:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) it depletes plant stocks through rigorous uniformity of crop varieties-a situation which could give rise to national crop failure;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) it means that virtually all decisions concerning Australia's crop types and varieties is effectively handed over wholesale to monopolistic interests;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) because of the intensive use of artificial fertilisers with hybrid varieties, it promises to further strip the soil of vanishing minerals and organic plant food.</PARA>
<PARA> For the above reasons, we see the proposed Bill as imposing artificial and severely debilitating standards upon the nation's plant crops, contrary to the interests and rights of the majority of Australians. It is short-sighted and potentially devastating in its consequences.</PARA>
<PARA> We regard the Bill as undemocratic and morally reprehensible, and call upon you to voice our strongest opposition to its introduction.</PARA>

<TITLE>Education Funding</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable President and Senators in the Parliament assembled. This Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The proposal to introduce fees for higher and second degrees will mean that access to post-graduate and recurrent education will be limited to the rich. Australian research and ability to cope with technological change will suffer; this proposal must be seen as a step in the direction of the introduction of fees for all tertiary students.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The proposed introduction of a loans scheme for students will mean graduating with a heavy debt or being denied a tertiary education if loans are refused because a student is seen as a 'poor risk' (particularly affecting women and those doing non-vocational courses); only the rich will be able to get a tertiary education without course restrictions and the burden of indebtedness.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. In regard to the proposal to restrict eligibility for TEAS and the foreshadowing of reviewing TEAS levels only in the light of the availability of loans; it should be noted that any further downgrading of TEAS, which is already inadequate, can only further limit access to education.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The proposed restriction of Adult Secondary Assistance to those needing qualifications for employment will severely restrict access to a full high school education and necessary bridging education to tertiary education for those who left school early.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The proposal not to fund 30 Colleges of Advanced Education if they are not rationalised is an attack on teacher education. This attack will create teacher shortages in the mid 1980s, restrict access to education now and endanger the future quality of teaching available to Australian children.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) post-secondary tuition fees not be introduced for any courses or for any category of students;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that the TEAS scheme be extended so as to more fully meet the real financial needs of students;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) that a comprehensive loans scheme not be introduced;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer him to the fact that over the last few years it has become customary for Ministers in the Fraser Government to justify the economic policies of the Government by referring to the number of new jobs created. Is it a fact that recent figures indicate that the number of jobs being generated by the Australian economy has declined sharply in recent months and that on present indications the growth of the labour force is far outstripping job creation, causing a sharp rise in unemployment? If increased job generation was an indicator of the success of the Government's economic policies before the 1980 election, is decreased job generation now an indicator of the failure of the Government's economic policies in 1981?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The figures over quite a number of months showed some very encouraging trends indeed. They showed that there was a growth of jobs in excess of the numbers of people coming on to the job market, and I think all Australians were very happy that this was so. In particular, there has been a trend, and it has continued until now, of a decline in unemployment amongst juveniles. In the latter months the trend has shown some alterations in that it appears, for whatever reason, in the short term that this trend is not continuing at its more optimistic peak. A number of adjustments would have to be made, and I am not in a position to give them here. Incidentally, one factor was the very high incidence of industrial unrest in that period-</PARA></TALK.START>

The fact is that the Government does believe that a main task in Australia is to so encourage resource development and national development generally as to create more jobs and more job opportunities for Australians. We are very eager that we should reduce the rate of unemployment. It is true that by comparison we are doing conspicuously better than other countries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Defence to recent newspaper articles which report the removal by private collectors and aircraft restorers of two Bristol Beaufighter fuselages from Kalumburu airfield, previously known as Drysdale airfield, to Sydney. As I understand the position, the aircraft were badly damaged during the Second World War and were converted to components, which means essentially that they have been stripped of useful parts and abandoned in that remote and almost totally inaccessible part of Western Australia since 1945. I further understand that it is the intention of the group which has recovered the aircraft to restore one for static display and that it is hopeful, using other parts it has, of restoring the other to flying condition. If that is the case it will be only the second Beaufighter aircraft in the world flying today. I ask the Minister: Firstly, to whom do the aircraft belong and by what criteria do they claim legal ownership? Secondly, will the Government consider vesting ownership of the aircraft in the restoration group which has recovered them, provided they are made available on display to the Australian people?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether I can answer the specific questions that were asked at the end of Senator Crichton-Browne's question. However, I have some background information which may be of some interest. I will refer the specific questions to the Minister. The Beaufighter parts which are the subject of the question and of recent Press coverage are fuselage sections from wrecked Mark IX and Mark XI Beaufighters of United Kingdom manufacture. Their presence at Kalumburu has been known since World War II, as has the location of many other wrecks around Australia. In November 1980 Air Force Office asked the Royal Australian Air Force Darwin to undertake a survey of the wrecks at Kalumburu and to recommend which could be suitable for restoration. That survey was conducted in September 1981. The parts were removed from Kalumburu by Mr Baxter, after asking permission from the mission and the local Aborigines, and brought back to Sydney. They are currently stored near the Richmond RAAF base. Air Force Office was in contact with Mr Baxter before the media developed the story and is negotiating an agreement aimed at ensuring that after eventual restoration a Beaufighter is preserved for posterity. The RAAF will continue to offer whatever assistance it can for the restoration project, although this is likely to be limited to technical advice and the possible transport of parts on a space-available basis. However, the RAAF is certainly pleased to support this worthwhile project of restoration and hopes that there will be some mutual benefits in it. As I said, I will refer the specific questions, as to who owns the aircraft and so on, to the Minister for further answer.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of such booklets at all, nor am I aware of the advertisement in the newspaper. If Senator McIntosh lets me have that information I will pursue the matter. I am not aware that information on American defence installations in Australia which is published in America freely and accurately is not published here. If there can be evidence of that I will have it examined and responded to. My understanding was that the preservation of the actual defence secrecy of such installations was at least bipartisan. My understanding is that the Leader of the Australian Labor Party has been informed as to the nature of these installations, that he has a full understanding of their importance and that, like all good Australians, he has an understanding that one preserves the secrecy of important defence installations against the fact that the enemy can, in breach of that secrecy, weaken the defence of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

The investigations of the persons who arrived at Darwin on the vessel VT383 referred to by Senator Kilgariff are still continuing and are likely to take several more days. However, the results so far indicate that most, quite possibly all, of the persons who were on board came from Taiwan or Hong Kong and not directly from Vietnam. More information, however, is required before the Government will be in a position to decide finally on these matters and on the future of these people. However, I agree with the concern expressed by Senator Kilgariff. The Government certainly will not tolerate any overseas schemes designed to bring people into Australia illegally or indeed those who seek to come in illegally themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>

Since it is now almost six years since that invasion took place and the East Timorese people are still resisting the Indonesians, how can the Australian Government persist with the fiction that the occupation is acceptable to the East Timorese people? I ask the Minister: Does Indonesia have any historic, geographic, ethnic, cultural or indeed any other claim to East Timor? Why should East Timor not be a free and independent society able to control its own affairs? Will the Government hold, as soon as possible, a public inquiry into those aspects of Australian-Indonesian relations from 1975 onwards relating to East Timor, with a special reference to determining why Australia seems to have been committed to a policy which is rightly perceived by Indonesia as craven, abject, quivering weakness and appeasement?</PARA></TALK.START>

Australia accepts that East Timor is part of Indonesia and that matters relating to East Timor, whether they be matters of security or any other matters, are the responsibility of the Indonesian Government. At the same time I think it should be said that the position of the Australian Government regarding internationally accepted standards of human rights is well known to the Indonesian Government and to the people in Australia as well. I think the matter raised by Senator Mason is one that continually is raised. Many statements have been made in the past on the relationship between East Timor and Indonesia.

The delay is occasioned quite simply because the preparation of the legislation has proved to be more complex than I had expected and the Government naturally is concerned to have clear legislation which will be comprehensible to pensioners but which at the same time will prevent artificial schemes and not need wide discretionary powers. The Government's intention to prevent artificial schemes designed to qualify people for social security benefits to which they are not otherwise entitled should be understood. The Government, however, does not wish to inhibit normal domestic financial arrangements or investment practices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have indicated to the Senate before, the need for this sort of legislation is simply to ensure that we can meet our objective to provide more adequately for those in the community who do not have sufficient to provide for themselves. In fact, many cases are drawn to my attention of very substantial schemes being entered into to achieve the benefit of social security benefits, and that is a matter to which I am giving continuing attention. It is a matter of regret to me that the requirements of the legislation do not permit me to introduce it in this session but I will be proceeding with the development of the legislation as early as possible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, follows the question asked by Senator Walters. I ask the Minister: Is he aware of the advertisements appearing in the Press and on radio by insurance companies and finance companies in this country urging pensioners to invest their money in what are described as safe tax free and income test free investments to avoid the legislation which these companies say was to be introduced by Senator Chaney by 1 November? If he is aware of these schemes and the urgings of people to join these artificial schemes, is there to be any provision in the new legislation to take into account schemes which are operating now or which will be instituted before he introduces his legislation next autumn to avoid having a situation where there are two classes of pensioners in this country-one class of people who were able to join before the Minister and the Government were able to make up their minds on what they were going to do and another group who will be caught up in the new legislation after the autumn session?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that there are advertisements for schemes to enable people to avoid the operation of the income test. As I have made it clear on prior occasions, that was precisely why the Government wished to see the test strengthened. I suppose our failure to move over a matter of months in this area can be compared fairly favourably to the failure of the previous Labor Government to move at all in the field of tax avoidance, notwithstanding that there were many well known schemes in that area. It is one of the great curiosities that the previous government failed to do anything in this area, as against the present Government's frequent measures which are aimed to prevent that sort of thing occurring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to the matters for which I am responsible, I simply point out to the Senate that the way that people can organise their affairs is, of course, almost endless in its variety. It is a matter of having legislation which will catch the artificial and yet at the same time leave untouched the normal domestic arrangements of the great mass of pensioners who do not enter into such schemes. Until I have legislation which I am satisfied will not be in any sense punitive to those pensioners who are simply carrying on their normal domestic affairs and who are not entering into artificial and contrived schemes, I would not propose to introduce such legislation into this Parliament. I have a very strong view that it is desirable that these schemes should be stopped but anyone with any experience would know that, as against having that intention, having the legislation in the precise form which can ensure it is not avoided is a slightly more difficult task. I have just indicated to the Senate that that task is one which I will not have completed within these current sittings.</PARA>

I can give him some information on it and I will seek the balance of the reply from the Minister responsible. The Northern Prawn Fishery has had limited entry since 1 January 1977. My information is that at present 292 boats are entitled to operate in that fishery. I do not know how many of those have actually obtained a licence since the limitation was imposed. That is a matter on which I will seek clarification.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The industry is undergoing some change because, as the honourable senator would know better than most, the Northern Prawn Fishery is in a very remote area and operating conditions are not easy. The economic factors are such that operators are tending to replace small boats with modern boats approximately 21 metres in length. The cost of these boats is such that they are out of reach financially of some, if not all, of the independent operators. The company ownership of boats is therefore increasing. Apparently about half of the current fleet is company-owned. The advice I have is that there is no evidence that companies have colluded on the price of products and that all the available evidence suggests that there is active competition between companies for the product from fishermen. The suggestion in the question asked by the honourable senator was that there is a cartel. If he has some information or evidence to the contrary the Minister would no doubt be interested to hear about it. He might care to provide the Minister with any information he has. I think there are one or two elements-in particular the question asking how many licences have recently been issued-about which I will have to seek further information.</PARA>

Therefore, I realise that it is a little difficult always to follow whatever the opinion poll might indicate.

I did not see the poll which said that 62 per cent of the people polled support protection of the domestic economy. I think the honourable senator would be aware that one of the very important factors which the Government takes into account when considering questions of tariff protection is that of employment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no real relationship between the existence of a national secretariat and the kinds of outcomes which are needed for Aboriginal people to obtain equality before the law. In speeches I gave earlier this year and in speeches which my predecessors have given, attention has been drawn to the kind of disadvantage to which Aboriginals are subjected in terms of their legal experience. Nothing that Mr Clifford said in his address is news to us. It is because of that kind of experience and that situation that we have been involved in a number of initiatives. In fact, I think we encouraged the Institute of Criminology to take a greater interest in Aboriginal experiences before the law in the hope that it could make constructive suggestions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is because of that kind of experience that we have steadily increased our commitment. For example, this financial year the commitment to Aboriginal legal services goes up 20 per cent. The Government is aware of the problem and is aware of the need for Aboriginals to have legal services which are accessible to them and to which they feel they can respond. We have been involved in a major way in funding legal services. Last year 75,000 cases were dealt with through Aboriginal legal services. They operate 11 legal services out of 42 offices across Australia. I just wish that Senator Ryan would draw attention to that network when she asks this kind of question. Of course we are aware of the figures and of course that is why the Government responds in the active way that it does.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today Senator Missen directed a question on East Timor to Senator Scott, as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs to two recent media reports which have dealt with the further pacification of East Timorese by the arrival of another 8,000 Indonesian troops. These reports also cover the effects that conscription and imprisonment are having on present and future food production and supply in the land. One such article states that East Timor's pro-Indonesian local government has described police and army atrocities in the province, including murder and torture, in a secret report to President Suharto. Is the Minister in a position to comment on the reliability of these reports and whether they are given credence? If so, having in mind Australia's close ties with the people of East Timor and their close proximity to Darwin, living a scant 400 miles north, will the Government again use its good offices to endeavour to bring peace to the island and bring about rehabilitation of its people?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I understand that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is aware of reports of what does appear to be a relatively extensive security operation in East Timor. Some reports also claim that this operation will result in a famine in East Timor owing to disruption to crop planting prior to the rainy season. Fretelin guerrilla remnants are reported to be still hostile towards the authorities in East Timor. As Senator Kilgariff mentioned, the chairman of a Senate committee was asked a question on this matter. Also, in answer to a question asked earlier this afternoon I said that Australia accepts that East Timor is part of Indonesia. Following the matters raised by Senator Kilgariff I would have to state again that matters relating to security are the responsibility of the Indonesian Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government, of course, has very high standards with regard to human rights. I think our standards are well known internationally and to the Indonesian Government. I understand that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has not seen the alleged report from the Regional People's Representative Assembly in Dili claiming serious violations of human rights in East Timor. He is not in a position to comment on the authenticity of that report. I can state on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he has asked the Australian Ambassador in Jakarta to seek the reaction of Indonesian authorities to these and other allegations which seem to be about at this time.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government would be most concerned if there were to be another famine in East Timor. Australia has provided relief assistance of $5.5m for East Timor since September 1975. I think that this demonstrates its willingness to play a major part in alleviating humanitarian problems there. The Australian embassy in Jakarta is continuing to watch the situation and is reporting to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I will refer the suggestion made in Senator Kilgariff's question to the Minister to see whether the Minister considers any further action appropriate. In view of the interest in the Senate on this matter, I will see that the Senate is advised if there is any further information.</PARA>

It is a matter which concerns primarily the Minister for Administrative Services at Commonwealth level and State police Ministers. However, I can inform the Senate that the topic of national firearms control is being considered by the Australian Police Ministers Council. At its meeting in Sydney in May this year the Council decided that action should be taken to ban the importation and possession of automatic and semi-automatic military-type firearms. I understand that action has already been taken by the Commonwealth to ban the importation of weapons of this kind. The States have been asked to take action to prohibit the possession of these weapons. I am also informed that the Police Ministers Council asked that a review of Commonwealth and State firearms legislation be undertaken to see whether some common approach to firearms management is possible. I might add, as I think I have said in answer to previous questions in the Senate on this subject, that this matter was raised some time ago by my predecessor with the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General but very little came of the consideration at that time to get uniform control.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 15 September last Senator Bonner asked me a question on an article which appeared in the Australian Financial Review relating to a report by the Bank of America on energy in Australia. I indicated in my response that I would get some supplementary information. I have a brief amount of supplementary information which I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> As foreshadowed in my comments to the Senate, the report is generally bullish about Australia's energy prospects and comments on a number of energy policy issues. However, the report misinterprets the Australian position on a number of policy matters, and is deficient in that it appears to disregard almost totally the rights and roles of the States in the formulation and administration of resource development and energy policies. The Press article referred to by Senator Bonner appears to misquote at least some of the views expressed in the Bank of America report. Specifically the Financial Review states that the report said 'Australia's adoption of import parity pricing for oil will lead only to a misallocation of resources unless corrected'. I would point out to the Senate that what the Bank of America report actually said was that import parity pricing for oil only would result in a misallocation of resources, i.e., 'world' prices for oil but low domestic prices for gas and electricity would result in excess demand for, and a rapid depletion of reserves of, other energy resources especially natural gas.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian crude oil prices are set at import parity prices so as to reflect the real value of that resource and to avoid the wasteful use of the resource. The benefits of the policy have been spelled out at length, and are generally recognised. If other energy resources were priced too low relative to oil then there could be 'excessive' substitution. I have said on earlier occasions that gas prices should be low enough to encourage substitution away from oil but high enough to encourage new exploration and development. Generally, new gas contracts are being written at prices which conform to that broad principle. As senators would be aware, that pricing issue is one for the States and for the private sector. Similarly, the issue of electricity pricing is mainly a matter for the States.</PARA>
<PARA> The report suggests a need for a comprehensive energy plan. This ignores the fact that Australia has a 'free market' economy. Fundamental to the Government's energy policy is the use of the market framework. As has been stated on many occasions, we do not consider that it is the Government's role to dictate the precise future path along which energy producers and consumers should move. The Commonwealth does, of course, have a comprehensive energy policy as distinct from an 'energy plan'-which is both well known and which has been well received. As a result of that policy, first spelled out fully in 1979, Australia now has the prospect of continued high levels of self-sufficiency in liquid fuels for at least the rest of the decade and hopefully beyond that. The policy has also given impetus and support to the general development of Australia's energy resources whether for domestic use or for the export market.</PARA>

I have received an answer from the Minister for Primary Industry as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suspended the registration of these establishments subsequent to a further finding of horsemeat in product shipped from Establishment No. 622, Jason Meats Pty Ltd of the Melbourne suburb of Abbotsford. This action was necessary to assure meat importing countries that the situation in Victoria-were the problem seemed to be centred-was under control. It was necessary to demonstrate that action was adequate to ensure substitution was no longer possible.</PARA>
<PARA> The way was open, by compliance with the new controls, for resumption of export activities with minimum delay. In fact 28 of the establishments affected have already done so and had their suspension notices removed.</PARA>
<PARA> The security and control conditions which applied initially to the Victorian independent boning rooms were rapidly imposed on all other independent boning rooms through Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The management of the suspended establishments in the majority of cases were quick to respond to the new requirements and consequently the effect on enployment would have been minimal. Without the prompt and firm action taken by the Government, it is certain that a far more serious reaction against Australian meat exports generally would have resulted.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) in the House of Representatives two or three weeks ago made a statement announcing inquiries into telecommunications and postal services in Australia. The first matter was a result of the so-called razor gang report. In the course of that report the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) announced that a major review would be undertaken of the activities of the Australian Telecommunications Commission to determine the extent to which the services it offered might be more effectively provided by the private sector. There was also at the time of the so-called Review of Commonwealth Functions a decision to conduct a review into the services of Australia Post and particularly to examine the scope, as it was put, for reducing or eliminating the monopoly powers of the Australian Postal Commission. Both of these inquiries are under way. The terms of reference have been announced. The terms of reference are consistent with the statements made at the time of the so-called razor gang report. In the statement we are now dealing with the Minister put it in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> An issue to be considered is the extent to which private enterprise involvement in those areas of Telecom's activities now protected from competition could result in a more efficient and economic service to the public. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to deal first with the question of the proposed inquiry into Telecom because in the Minister's words it is concerned with seeing how it can be made a more efficient and economic service to the public. The solution, adopted as a matter of ideological preference by the Government, is one of deciding that Telecom could be made more efficient and provide a more economic service to the public as a result of the intrusion of private enterprise into areas of Telecom's traditional work. Of course in ideological terms the whole case for involvement of private enterprise in telecommunications work in Australia has been orchestrated for some time both by the hardliners in the Government, the Frasers as distinct from the Peacock type faction. As I have said, that philosophy has been long articulated and the whole scene has been orchestrated by this Government in relation to the proposal for this inquiry. The Government says that it is concerned and believes that private enterprise can provide better services in a variety of areas than can public enterprises. The Government says that the way to cure alleged deficiencies in Telecom is to provide private enterprise competition in its most profitable areas. </PARA>

I am surprised Senator Lewis does not wear dark glasses when he goes to these places and talks about himself in that vein. I take it that Senator Lewis, as a backwoodsman of the Liberal Party, one of those who came into this place on the coat-tails of the Prime Minister and one of those who will go out on the same coat-tails when the revolution in the Liberal Party is finally consummated, is one of those people who are concerned about, in the Minister's words, the efficient and economic services of Telecom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One thing which happened and which illustrates that there is concern about the efficient and economic services of Telecom was the presentation to the Minister for Communications in June last year of a report by the McKinsey organisation on the Capital and Policy Requirements for the 1980s of Telecom Australia. That report is very concerned about the efficiency of Telecom. In essence, if I may summarise, that report says that by international standards Telecom is an efficient provider of telecommunications services. But it says-presumably the Government wanted the organisation to say this-that those communications services could be provided by Telecom better than they have been provided in the past. The report was not uncritical of Telecom, of its attitude to the provision of new services and of its attitude to indicating the services which it makes available to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> I will move on to the thrust of the report. Senator Lewis has now lost interest. He has a great distaste for taking medicine as distinct from taking lumps of sugar handed out to him in the division of Wannon. I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) whether he would be good enough to have a look at the McKinsey report on the capital and planning requirements for Telecom which I now table. I recommend this document for careful reading by those Government senators who, unlike Senator Lewis, might be described as literate. If someone would care to read it to him he would find that the McKinsey organisation recommends an 8 per cent increase in capital moneys available for investment by Telecom in new equipment and so on so that by the year 1990 the increase in the capital available to Telecom will be some $75m. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the basic recommendation which the McKinsey report makes. The words which recur again and again in the McKinsey report are the same words as the Minister for Communications used in his statement-efficiency and productivity. What that report is saying is that at a time when there was the greatest backlog in the last two decades in meeting the needs of applicants for new telephone services in Australia with delays of up to 12 months when in fact there was the lowest demand for new telephone services this Government has adopted a policy towards Telecom which has led to inefficiency insofar as Telecom can be described as inefficient in the words of the McKinsey report-I emphasise for the benefit of Senator Lewis that that is in the words of the McKinsey report-and has resulted in a decline in efficiency and productivity in Telecom. Those are the findings of a report commissioned by this Government in conjunction with Telecom and made available to the Government in June last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom, as honourable senators will know, I think, is the largest employer in Australia, a capital intensive funded organisation, with a considerable profit level, and a very large enterprise by any standards. I would have thought that it was an organisation to which the Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, might have applied the words which he used in his address when speaking at the National Press Club two years ago. The Prime Minister made the point that the Liberal Party believes in public debate about issues of public importance and he said there can be no real public debate unless information is available. So the Liberal Party under Malcolm Fraser believes in the publication of information about great national instrumentalities such as Telecom. But it does not believe that when it comes to this report. The words of the Prime Minister remind me of these words in Hamlet:</PARA>
<PARA> My words fly up, my thoughts remain below. Words without thoughts never to heaven go. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind Senator Lewis that the words of the Prime Minister are words without thoughts because when it comes to the hard thoughts about publishing a report which is critical of this Government for the miserly policies which it has adopted towards Telecom and which have led to inefficiency and a comparative lack of productivity, the Government is strangely reticent about it. Of course, the point is that since the report was given to the Government-no action has been taken on it-the capital requirements of Telecom have increased and the capital available to Telecom has declined. There has been a 16 per cent decline in capital available to Telecom since this Government came to power. This is quite contrary to the recommendations of the McKinsey report. Every time any Liberal member of this Senate answers a letter from a constituent as to why he cannot get a new phone service, if that honourable senator has read the McKinsey report and answers that question honestly, he will say: 'There is the biggest delay in the provision of new phone services in Australia in two decades because of this Government's policies; the policies of the Government to which I belong'. That is how Government senators will answer letters from constituents asking why phone services have been delayed. That is the essence of what the McKinsey report is saying. </PARA>
<PARA> Just look at what has happened since the McKinsey report was made available to this Government which believes, as it says, in public discussion about important national issues. The interest rate paid by Telecom on existing loans has been raised. Telecom's borrowing capacity has been more strictly limited than ever. As I said earlier, the delays in connecting new telephone services have grown steadily. At the end of this financial year 112,000 Australians will be waiting for phone installations-15,000 more than last year, although there is a projected drop in demand. Some people are now waiting a year for telephone installations. If Senator Lewis likes to study the figures when he goes to Ballarat he will know that many people are waiting for telephones there. I wonder what answer he gives them there. I know what answer he gives them in the Ballarat Courier. Perhaps he can dress it up a bit after he has read the McKinsey report. </PARA>
<PARA> There are long delays in people getting calls through, especially in Queensland and northern New South Wales. Often people have to wait hours just to get a dial tone on the telephone services in those areas. Last financial year Telecom was able to satisfy only 82 per cent of applicants for new phones. Next year it is estimated that the figure will fall to 79 per cent. Telecom has made it clear that government interference with its policies actually caused the Telecom price rises earlier this year. Look what else happened to Telecom, a great national enterprise, at the hands of a government which allegedly believes in business efficiency and which, sticking on its ideological blinkers, says that private enterprise is inherently more efficient than public enterprise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;'Hear, hear' bleats Senator Martyr from Western Australia. We are talking about telephones basically and not sheep dips or something which excites the honourable senator's attention. Let us look at what has happened to Telecom at the hands of this Government which says it believes in business efficiency. Telecom is the largest business in Australia. The term of the last Chairman of Telecom, Mr Bob Somervaille, expired some 15 months ago. Mr Somervaille, the Chairman of Telecom, a corporate lawyer from Sydney, was not reappointed and no replacement has been appointed to the chairmanship of Telecom at the hands of this Government for 15 months. There have been all sorts of rumours striking terror into the hearts of anybody engaged in telecommunications in Australia, such as the story that Mr Staley might be appointed chairman. But no appointment has been made for 15 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The General Manager of Australia's largest business, Mr Jack Curtis, retired after the Government's crude handling of the pay negotiations with Telecom employees a few months ago. Mr Curtis, the General Manager, has not been replaced by this Government. On 29 June, after the announcement that there would be a public inquiry into Telecom but before the appointment of the committee, the Minister for Communications announced that parts of the main communications network might be sold. This pre-empted the inquiry, which is the third inquiry into Telecom since 1979. So much for the Government of all efficiencies. Of course, sale of the profitable parts of Telecom will mean the end of its cross-subsidisation policy, a policy which I would have thought would bring joy to the hearts of Senator Lewis's rural constituents. Under this policy Telecom has used its high profits from eastern seaboard traffic to subsidise country services, last year amounting to $230m. The end of this could mean that country subscribers pay an extra $200 a year rental merely for having a phone on. I remind the Senate of the cost of new phone connections in remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The other important thing to remember about Telecom is that it is a great supporter of Australian manufacturing industry. As a matter of policy 80 per cent of Telecom equipment is Australian made. This is a policy which this Government decided a month ago to do away with. So much for its concern about Australian manufacturing industry. In an answer, which I got today, to a question to the Minister for Communications he said that last year Telecom purchased 90 per cent of its equipment from Australian manufacturing industry. It is not just the employees of Telecom and the thousands of subscribers, or potential subscribers who are waiting for new telephone services throughout Australia, who are concerned about this issue; it is a substantial section of Australian manufacturing industry in the electronic area which supplies Telecom with equipment. These are the matters which have to be faced up to in looking at the continuation of services provided by great public enterprises such as Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no point in considering the future of Telecom if the Government, in a craven and cowardly way, is going to hide the findings of a report such as the McKinsey, as it has done for 15 months, and if it is going to act quite contrary to the recommendations of that report so that less efficiency and less productivity results. Of course, what we have here are grounds for suspicion that in order to fulfil its bizarre and neanderthal ideological commitments to private enterprise at any price, this Government has embarked on a deliberate course of weakening the efficiency and productivity of Telecom, weakening its capacity to carry on its services. It has done this deliberately in order to encourage public dissatisfaction with the telecommunications system in this country so that the powerful donors to the Liberal Party, associated with certain companies can gain Telecom's more profitable work. It has done that as part of a deliberate course of action. There are only two choices. Either it is a deliberate course of action to damage Telecom because of the circumstances I have suggested or it is an example of gross incompetence by a government which says it has a commitment to efficiency. They are the only two options. There are no other options available to the Fraser Government in terms of explaining the course of conduct upon which it has embarked in relation to Telecom and its attitude to the publication of the McKinsey report. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very serious indictment of this Government. It is a matter which has not been debated in this Parliament. It will be debated but it has not been debated in this Parliament to date, as I said, because of the secrecy of the Government and its forked tongue about its commitment to free information and free exchange of ideas and yet its total secrecy in relation to the affairs of a great public enterprise such as Telecom. Those are matters with which this Senate has to be concerned. We are, of course, not opposed to the establishment of such inquiries, insofar as one cannot oppose legitimate inquiries. We are opposed to the assumptions which underlie these inquiries, assumptions which have fallen glibly from the mouth of the Minister concerned in relation to both matters and also, of course, from that collection of chartered accountants and drop-outs from small business which constituted the so-called razor gang or ministerial inquiry into Commonwealth Government functions. </PARA>
<PARA> The glib ideology which has fallen from those people is the basis upon which these inquiries have been set up. A government which sets up inquiries of this kind, when it has failed to act on the report of the last important inquiry, the McKinsey inquiry into Telecom, is one which is governing by inquiry rather than by action, which is condoning inefficiency, and which is encouraging lack of productivity in its own enterprises and, indeed, in the largest enterprise this country has. </PARA>
<PARA> We will be happy to debate these issues in the Senate if anyone on the Government side wants us to do so, but I do not believe that many Government supporters understand the issues. That is a tragedy for Australia and for this Parliament. That is why I have moved that the Senate take note of this paper. </PARA>

<PARA>That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend this statement by the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) to all Queenslanders for early reading. A statement that one would have expected would lead to an explanation and solution of the problems that Queenslanders, especially those who reside in Brisbane, now face, proves to be nothing more than an explanation without a solution. Because of a shortage of air traffic controllers, the Brisbane Airport is now closed at 9 p.m. That curfew has been imposed because, in a major airport of Australia in one of the major cities of Australia, there are not sufficient air traffic controllers to allow the continuation of air traffic until 10.30 p.m. or 11 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding what the Minister has said in his statement, considerable chaos exists for those who travel from the south to Brisbane on any night of the week. The airlines, in an attempt to have their craft land before 9 o'clock, have to reschedule flights to Sydney. It is a considerable inconvenience to people in Sydney to find that some flights have been cancelled and that they must wait to be re-booked on other flights in order to conform with the curfew. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement exposes the fact that the Department of Transport has been negligent. On a brief reading of the statement no other conclusion can be reached than that, for a period, the Department of Transport did not anticipate the needs of Australian aviation and in particular those of the Brisbane Airport. That problem has been before the Estimates committees on two occasions that I can recall in the last couple of years. Why the shortage? Why was not the Department able to anticipate the growth in aviation in Australia and make the necessary arrangements to train air traffic controllers? Apparently, because of the shortage of air traffic controllers in Australia, the conditions under which they worked became too strenuous and difficult. Long hours had to be worked and, as the statement reveals, there was an increase in resignations and in the scarcity of controllers because of the problem of ill health. The Minister's statement uses those two factors as an excuse but, in fact, they were caused by the failure of the Department of Transport to train sufficient personnel. The shortage led to unduly harsh conditions-to the risk of air travellers generally. Those harsh conditions, in turn, led to resignations by controllers seeking overseas posts and to resignations due to ill health. The reasons given for the shortage of air traffic controllers do not read well. According to the Minister, since the early 1970s the total number of air traffic controllers in Australia has increased from just over 1,000 to the present level of 1,156. He says that although we have a shortage we have more air traffic controllers than we had in the past. That is a absurd position to face. We have had an increase of 100 in numbers, but we still have a shortage. I repeat: That shortage results from the fact that, for some reason or another, over a period no additional air traffic controllers were trained. That failure is not properly explained in the statement. For a whole two years, if I read the paper correctly, no air traffic controllers were trained. </PARA>
<PARA> The wastage in Queensland was 8 per cent and that throughout Australia was 3.5 per cent. The higher figure in Queensland resulted from the Department of Transport's refusal to recognise the problem that existed. Despite constant complaints by aircraft controllers in the Brisbane area no action was taken. In turn, a shortage which was bad became one that led to the closure of the airport at 9 p.m. According to the Minister's statement, it will be almost two years before the situation is corrected. That is appalling, when considered from the point of view of an air traveller, expecially one proceeding to Brisbane. Possibly for two years we will suffer a shortage of controllers which will lead to the curtailment of services into Brisbane. The only saving grace is that Queensland, because of one of the many quaint positions taken by the Queensland Premier, does not propose to fall into line with other States in regard to daylight saving. </PARA>

This is the only instance in which the absence of daylight saving will be of benefit to Queenslanders. During the period of daylight saving elsewhere there will not be a need for a curfew because all planes will arrive in Queensland one hour earlier. In that way, they can escape the 9 o'clock curfew. Thus, for six months the Department of Transport will get a reprieve, but when that period is over we will be back to the position we are in at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If there is to be a shortage of air traffic controllers in Australia the impact of that shortage should be spread across every State. It seems to me to be very unreasonable that Brisbane should be selected as the one place to suffer. I thought it would be possible to transfer personnel to the Brisbane area. One also has to look a little more closely at the conditions which have applied to controllers. I do not think that is the reason that there is a shortage. The reason is that the Department of Transport has failed to train any personnel whatsoever for two years. The Department and the Minister have to answer for that. Why did they fail to train people during that period? Why did they fail to anticipate the growth of the aviation industry? The airline companies could have told them of their expectations and what the growth pattern would be. The explanation should not just be accepted and passed to one side. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister and the Department should be brought under close scrutiny as to why this situation developed and why it will take so long to recover. There has been an appalling lack of effort and initiative. At a time of high unemployment in this country and when youngsters, both male and female, have been finding it difficult to obtain work, here is one department which has failed to carry out a training program. One would have to ask the Department, if there is a shortage of personnel, why it has not investigated the possibility of training and employing women in this area. I cannot for the life of me accept or understand how a department could fail to train people when so many are seeking this sort of work. It is reasonably skilled work but it would not be beyond the capacity of many youngsters, both male and female, who are seeking work. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Department can overcome the problem that it faces. It seems to be that it has not anticipated the rapid growth of the industry. The statement indicates that there has been an increase in training and a greater intake of personnel. Nevertheless, one cannot escape from the fear that the industry will grow faster than even these innovations. For that reason, I will seek leave to continue my remarks later but suggest that close attention be paid to the statement and that from time to time questions be asked of the Minister as to what progress is being made to correct what I consider to be a disgraceful situation. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>Whilst the report from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs is welcomed by the Opposition, in that it does document some programs which are being funded by the Federal Government to improve the situation of Aboriginal Australians, it is an unsatisfactory document to the extent that it does not give the Australian public an overall idea of the circumstances facing Aboriginal Australians today. It presents a catalogue of Government programs and of the money spent on Aboriginals in the last financial year. It presents a rosy picture of Government action to improve the lot of Aboriginal Australians. It fails to give a comprehensive review of the problems still facing the Aboriginal community in Australia. Because of that it is impossible to derive from the report any idea of the real progress that is being made to solve those problems. For example, whilst details are provided of all housing programs which benefit Aboriginals, we are given no indication of how many houses remain to be provided before all Australian Aboriginals have acceptable standards of housing. The Government has been insisting lately that we present a balanced picture of what is happening with regard to Aboriginal affairs. If we are to have a balanced understanding of the progress that is being made towards providing housing for Australian Aboriginals, then we really need to know how many are still without housing as well as how many have been assisted in gaining housing in the last financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some developments described in the report on which I would like to comment briefly. The first relates to the establishment of the Aboriginal Development Commission. The Federal Australian Labor Party is, in general, supportive of the establishment of the Aboriginal Development Commission because it is established according to the principle of independence and self-management for Aboriginal people. However, I must sound a note of warning here that the Aboriginal Development Commission has taken on a huge task. It has taken on the task of providing assistance to all the Aboriginal enterprises throughout Australia and of providing special Aboriginal housing loans to a large number of eligible people. In both cases-we must be frank about this-the Commission has inherited many problems. </PARA>
<PARA> We would like to see the Commission succeed. We would like to see it as a statutory body which has the confidence of Aboriginal people in both its policies and its administration. Unless the Government is prepared to provide the Commission with adequate resources to carry out its charter it will not gain the confidence of its Aboriginal clients and it will, I believe, become overwhelmed by the administrative problem of trying to make too small a cake go too far. We would like to see a more realistic allocation of resources to the Aboriginal Development Commission if it is to carry out its charter. Of course, we agree with the charter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that it is very helpful of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to call out by way of interjection: 'How much?' Obviously, the occasion of commenting on an annual report is not an occasion for us to put up our alternative budget for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. We will do that in due course. We will certainly do it before the next Federal election. I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report also documents the transferral of State grants for Aboriginal housing from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to the Department of Housing and Construction and the transferral of local government and municipal type functions for the Northern Territory Aboriginal settlements from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to the Northern Territory Government as of 1 July 1980. These developments reflect the fact that departmental functions are being eroded. If the functions are to go to Aboriginal organisations, such as the Aboriginal Development Commission or the National Aboriginal Conference, it is, in principle, a good thing. But if functions are being transferred from the Federal Department to unsympathetic State or Territory governments it will be a backward step for Aboriginal advancement and self-determination. I say quite directly that transferring functions to the Northern Territory Administration is transferring functions to a less sympathetic and, in respect of some activities, quite hostile administration and is not, therefore, in the interests of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> The report comments on settlement of land claims. It points out that title deeds to Warlpiri, Alyawarra and Uluru land claim areas have been issued and that a title deed to the Borroloola Common has been prepared for issue. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) has also announced that he will accept the recommendations of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner to grant title deed to Aborigines for Utopia and Willowra pastoral leases. I remind the Senate that the Rowlands report was tabled in Parliament on 18 November 1980. According to page 6 of the annual report discussions have taken place with land councils and the Northern Territory Government 'about possible means of overcoming a number of practical difficulties in the operation of the Northern Territory Land Rights Act'. The report fails to mention that the Northern Territory Government is hostile to many provisions of the Land Rights Act and has attacked the operation of the Land Rights Act in a hostile fashion. The report fails to address itself to the serious situation regarding Aboriginal land in Queensland and in the case of Western Australia restricts itself to a sketchy outline of the Noonkanbah incident. I must comment that this is hardly an adequate coverage of what is the most important issue facing Aborigines in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the makarrata or the concept of a proposed treaty between the Australian Government and Aboriginal people, the report states that the National Aboriginal Conference completed an initial round of consultations with Aboriginal and Islander communities and published an interim report on 2 July 1980. Discussions and consultations on the makarrata will continue. I must point out that an enormous task of consultation and negotiation is ahead of any government which is really serious about, firstly, developing the machinery to establish a treaty between the Australian Government and the Aboriginal people and, secondly, negotiating the terms of such a treaty. The Government has taken on no small exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I sound a note of warning that if the Government thinks that this is something the NAC can do in its spare time and that some treaty or agreement can be quickly arrived at which will solve the problem of the injustice done to the Aboriginal people when Australia was colonised by the British, the Government is seriously mistaken. If the Government is serious about evolving machinery for a treaty and negotiating the terms of a treaty, it will have to be prepared to put a lot of time and resources into this exercise. In relation to broadcasting, the report documents assistance given to the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association and assistance given to public broadcasting stations which provide for regular Aboriginal programs. In both of these developments I am happy to say that the Opposition is in agreement with the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of employment, the report does give some indication of the unacceptably high levels of unemployment amongst Aborigines. It estimates that 36 per cent of the estimated Aboriginal work force is unemployed, and I think this is a conservative estimate. Certainly, in this area we do not know the full extent of the problem and it is an area in which there is scope for government action to increase Aboriginal employment. In particular I have put forward in this place on a number of occasions the view that the Government should have an active policy of providing for Aboriginal employment within the public sector. During the recent Estimates committee discussions in the Senate I regularly questioned officers from various departments on their policies regarding the employment of Aboriginal people. At this stage I can say only that there is very little by way of a genuine assertive policy to encourage departments to place and train Aboriginal people within their staff establishments. Until the Government is determined that it will provide employment opportunities for Aboriginal people I think these very high rates of Aboriginal unemployment which are documented in the Department's annual report will continue and, in the present employment situation, will grow worse. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of housing the report documents the implementation of government programs. It fails to document the need which still exists in this area. For instance, the report of the World Council of Churches documents a survey taken in Queensland in 1979 which showed that 64 per cent of Aboriginal housing was totally unacceptable, that 34 per cent of Aboriginal housing was acceptable but in urgent need of repair and that 3 per cent only of Aboriginal housing was on a par with normal white Australian standards. That is the sort of picture I think we must have if we are to make a realistic assessment of the work being done by the Department. I do not wish to denigrate the good work being done by the Department and by the many dedicated officers within the Department, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal. However, in the areas on which I have commented and in other areas, such as health and welfare, on which I will not comment because of time limitations, I think it would be more helpful and more conducive to the development of a truly bipartisan approach to Aboriginal issues if the annual reports of the Department gave the full picture and not simply the statistics about things that have been done. If we are going to set long term policy objectives and long term program objectives I think we need more information than that which is currently presented in the report of the Department. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The 1980-81 annual report of the Department of Housing and Construction is, if nothing else, a rather extraordinary document. On the one hand it refers constantly to the value of the construction and housing industries in the Australian economy generally. On the other hand it frequently reports the fact that the Department of Housing and Construction is having to change its operations to accommodate changing government policy. From the tone of the report it seems that it is not exactly happy to be forced into that position. A reading of this annual report induced at least in me a sense of overwhelming frustration which must have been felt by the Department as it was forced into curtailing activities it sees as being very influential and beneficial to the Australian economy. The language the report uses is considerably restrained but this serves merely to add to that sense of frustration. For instance, page 10 of the report, under the heading 'Looking ahead' states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Department looks back on a year of efficient administration of the Government's housing policy and programs and a multi-million dollar construction program which involved many varied and complex public works. </PARA>
<PARA> In the year ahead the Department faces a period of change and consolidation as it continues with its record of achievement and service to the Government and people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I get the distinct impression that, if the author of this document were not being restrained, the last sentence rather would read: ' . . . the Department faces a period of change and consolidation as it continues to try to maintain its record of achievement and service to the Government and people of Australia'. The rest of this report clearly indicates the Department is not likely to succeed in that attempt. One wonders how the Government can reconcile some of its stated aims, as quoted in this report, with its actions which are also described in this document. I refer in particular to page 21 and the chapter headed 'Housing policy'. According to the report the Government aims to do the following:</PARA>
<PARA>ensure that every family in Australia is able to obtain adequate housing within its capacity to pay</PARA>
<PARA>encourage home ownership across the widest possible range of income groups, . . . </PARA>
<PARA>maintain and improve housing styles . . . </PARA>
<PARA>ensure that there are economic conditions within which a stable and adequate building industry can assist us to achieve our social goals. </PARA>
<PARA>One wonders how it does this when it continually cuts funding to the public housing sector, as it did this year, from something like $286m in 1980-81 to $262m in 1981-82 and limits through the razor gang recommendations various housing and construction functions including, as is pointed out on page 8, the monitoring of the building industry, housing costs and housing policy advice. How a government expects to be able to maintain an intelligent policy in regard to the building and construction industry when its very department is limited in offering it advice is beyond my comprehension. Furthermore, one wonders how the Government equates statements such as that on page 11 of the report with the present slump in the construction industry. Page 11 is the first page in the chapter entitled 'The industry and the economy'. It begins by making the following point:</PARA>
<PARA> The construction industry . . . makes a valuable contribution to the community through provision of physical facilities such as housing, schools, water supply, roads, aerodromes, shops, office buildings and factories. To this end very substantial resources of land, capital and labour are employed in the construction of the nation's physical infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA>I pause at this point to ask whether the cover of this report is not somehow indicative of the disappearing part that the building and construction industry is playing in the Australian economy. Having made that first point, the report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>As almost all its inputs are domestically supplied, it has strong linkages to other sectors of the economy. Changes in activity levels in the industry can therefore have considerable significance for the economy as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>That sentence bears repeating. Following straight on from that comes this statement:</PARA>
<PARA>The industry, in turn, is sensitive to change in general economic conditions and to the types of policies used by the Government to achieve its overall economic objectives . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Some paragraphs later the report adds this further rider:</PARA>
<PARA> Instability in the industry adds to costs as well as further destabilising other sectors of the economy. Rapid changes in the availability of housing finance also cause considerable welfare losses to the many homeowners seeking to change their dwelling as well as those who are hoping to buy their first home. The health, efficiency and stability of the dwelling construction sector is a major determinant of the extent to which people's housing needs are met. </PARA>
<PARA>One wonders how the Government equates these comments with the serious instability in the market presently induced by the Government's fiscal policies, in particular those relating to interest rates. Since interest rates are a predominant factor in people's accessibility to finance and hence their ability to purchase or to build a home, the problems which are besetting the banking community and the community generally are bound to cause problems in this, an extremely highly labour intensive area. The point is, of course, that the Government cannot equate these conflicting statements. As I said, the situation is exacerbated, too, by the ensuing damage that its conflicting attitudes to the building and construction market are inflicting on the labour market. Page 13 of the document makes this point:</PARA>
<PARA> According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics the construction industry directly employs about half a million people, some 8 per cent of the total employment in Australia. It is estimated that the jobs of a further 8 to 10 per cent are indirectly dependent upon the industry, being engaged in producing materials, parts, business, professional and transport services and so on. Altogether, more than one million workers (almost one in every six of those in employment) are dependent on the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a higher component of self-employment in the industry than in many others. This reflects the prevalence of small sub-contracting firms in the industry, particularly among special trades in the housing sector. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to tabulate those trades and skills which are employed in the industry. They range from professional and administrative people through to tradesmen. When one reads this report one must ask how on earth the Government can hope to engender fuller employment in Australia if it actively restrains the development of such a high employment industry. If this report does nothing else, it points out in appalling clarity the mess that this Government is getting itself into through ill thought out contradictory policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-A joint select committee of the Parliament was appointed in September 1978 to inquire into, and report on, the provisions and operation of the Family Law Act 1975 and it presented its report to the Parliament on 28 August 1980. The comprehensive nature of the report bears witness to the hard work of the Committee and I would like, on behalf of the Government, to pay tribute to its efforts and to the very careful consideration it gave to the very important issues involved. There were dissenting reports, either in toto or related to specific matters, by certain members of the Committee and consideration has been given to the views expressed in them. Naturally attention has mainly been directed to the majority report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Bearing that in mind, I think it is fair to say that the report gives clear support to the basic philosophy of the Family Law Act as it stands at present. The main thrust of the 72 recommendations in the report is to strengthen and extend the main features of the Act. For example, I note that the report does not recommend any retreat from the most fundamental change made by the Family Law Act. I refer to the abolition by the Act of the concept of 'matrimonial offences' as grounds for divorce, and their replacement by a single ground of divorce based on irretrievable breakdown of marriage as evidenced by 12 months separation. In this regard, I draw attention particularly to the Committee's conclusion that 'there is no necessary coincidence between the number of marriages that have broken down and the number of divorces'. The Committee went on to say that 'the effect of easier availability of divorce has the effect of closing the gap between the number of marriages that have been broken down in fact and those that are dissolved at law'. </PARA>
<PARA> Family law has traditionally been a non-party area in respect of which members of this Parliament have exercised individual judgments according to their consciences. The Government considers that this traditional approach should continue to be followed. For this reason, it is not appropriate that there should be an official Government response to the report's recommendations, other than those that impinge upon some area of general Government policy, such as those having implications for Government expenditure. Accordingly, the responses that are set out in the schedule that I will be seeking leave to have incorporated in Hansard at the conclusion of my statement are to be taken as expressing my own views, unless a particular response is so expressed as to indicate that it has been, or will be, the subject of a Government decision. </PARA>
<PARA> In dealing with the report's recommendations, I have divided them into two main categories-those involving legislation and those involving administrative or other mainly non-legislative action of some kind. I would like now specifically to mention some of the more important individual matters in those categories. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the detailed parts of this statement as I have just indicated them, and then I will read the conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement continued-</PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WOULD INVOLVE LEGISLATION</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable Senators will recall that on 11 December 1980 I announced that the preparation of substantial amendments to the Family Law Act, the major purpose of which were to implement 24 of the Report's recommendations, had commenced. In fact, as a result of further consideration, the Family Law Amendment Bill 1981, will implement 27 of those recommendations. As I also announced in December 1980, in accordance with the non-party approach I have already referred to, Government members will exercise a free vote on the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I will canvass in detail those recommendations with which the Bill deals when I come to introduce it, but I would mention that, as will be seen from the Schedule, the great majority of the important legislative changes proposed by the Committee will be dealt with in the Bill, and accordingly it will constitute by far the most extensive reform of the Family Law Act since its enactment. The recommendations that will be dealt with in the Bill are numbers-2, 3, 10, 11, 18, 21, 25, 31 (g), 33, 34 (part), 35, 39, 40, 48, 50, 51, 52, 54, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 65, 66, 67, and 69. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the small number of legislative recommendations that it has been decided, after due consideration, could not or should not be implemented in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 12-Finality of Custody Orders</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 12 proposes the insertion of a new provision in the Family Law Act requiring a court, in proceedings with respect to the custody or guardianship of a child of a marriage, as far as practicable to make such an order as would avoid further proceedings. All the available evidence suggests that, at the present time, courts, as a matter of common sense, make every attempt to make orders of the kind referred to in the recommendation. However, it is worth noting that custody orders, by their nature, have entirely future operation and therefore may be rendered inappropriate by future events. The Family Law Council, after considering this matter, has recommended against implementing the Committee's proposal, on the grounds that application to vary a custody order must always be allowed if circumstances warrant and the present requirement of significant change has not given rise to excessive litigation. Accordingly, it seemed to me that a provision of the kind proposed in the recommendation would probably serve little useful purpose and might, in fact, cause difficulty by introducing some rigidity in an area in which flexibility is more desirable. In any event, the problem with which the Committee appeared most concerned, namely, the repeated changing of custody as a result of reversals of decisions on appeal, is not solved by the recommendation, and it is difficult to see how this could be overcome except by an unacceptable limitation on rights of appeal. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 13-Criteria for Custody Decisions</PARA>
<PARA> In recommendation 13, the Committee set out detailed criteria which it considered should be inserted in the Act and which a court would thus be required to take into account in deciding child custody cases. The Family Law Council has since examined this proposal in depth and has recommended against it on the ground that any regulation of courts' discretion in custody cases was undesirable. I have therefore concluded it is preferrable that the wide discretion of courts in this area should be retained. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 22-Redraft of s.72</PARA>
<PARA> In recommendation 22 the Committee recommended a redraft of s.72 of the Family Law Act to eliminate what it saw as an 'ambiguity' in the existing provision. Examination of the issue by both the Family Law Council and my Department has led to the conclusion, that the ambiguity perceived by the Committee does not exist and that, accordingly, the proposed change is not necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 26-Redraft of s.75 (2) (1)</PARA>
<PARA> The apparent intention of the redraft of s.75 (2) (1) proposed in recommendation 26 was to improve the existing provision to make it clear that the frustration of the applicant's expectation of continuing to be a wife and/or mother is to be taken into account in maintenance proceedings. Examination of this, particularly by the Family Law Council, has led to the conclusion that the redraft proposed by the Committee does not achieve that result. Further, any other possible redraft would be likely to create as many problems as might be solved. It is also worth noting that the existing provision has not caused any particular problems in practice as far as I am aware. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 27-Redraft of s.75 (2) (o)</PARA>
<PARA> The redraft of s.75 (2) (o) proposed in recommendation 27 would make the applicant's matrimonial conduct in general-not just such conduct having direct economic consequences-relevant in maintenance proceedings. Sensing that this recommendation had doubtless generated strong feelings amongst Committee members, other Honourable Senators and the public generally, I gave careful consideration to the matter and consulted at some length with both the Family Law Council and the Chief Judge of the Family Court before reaching a view. </PARA>
<PARA> It is basic to the philosophy of the Family Law Act that the concept of matrimonial conduct as such-as distinct from conduct relevant to particular issues-is no longer relevant in matrimonial proceedings. Implementation of this recommendation would amount to a pointed reintroduction of the examination of matrimonial conduct at large, and would undoubtedly be seen as an invitation in maintenance proceedings to bring up all alleged misconduct of the applicant however long ago and however irrelevant to the issues of maintenance. Any amendment having that result would to a substantial extent reopen the flood-gates to recrimination and counter-recrimination. This would lead to more protracted and costly proceedings, and to a consequent greater strain on limited Court and legal aid resources. It would also reintroduce the rejected notion that maintenance-or the witholding of it-might be used to punish the party 'guilty' of misconduct. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as conduct affecting the issue of maintenance is concerned, recent court decisions have clearly established that the conduct of one of the parties to maintenance proceedings that affected the economic circumstances of the other party can, in fact, be taken into account under the present provision. I believe that this is the limit of the extent to which conduct should be relevant. In reaching this decision, I have regard to the minority opposition of the recommendation within the Committee itself. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 32-Redraft of s. 79A</PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the redraft of s. 79A proposed by recommendation 32 would be to widen substantially the grounds on which a property settlement order previously made by the court could subsequently be varied or set aside so as to enable this to be done wherever the court considered that there was 'just cause' for so doing. The present policy of the Act, as reflected in both the existing ss. 79AA and 81 is that, in the interests of the parties, property orders should be final and should be able to be varied or set aside only where the original order had been obtained by fraud, duress, false evidence or there had otherwise been a miscarriage of justice. The recommendation envisages a clear departure from this basic policy and would, I believe, be likely to encourage continuing relitigation of property disputes. In my view this would be against the interests of all concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Family Law Council made a recommendation to me for amendment of s. 79A which would allow property orders to be set aside or varied on grounds that are somewhat wider than at present, but which would be much more limited than that proposed in the Committee's recommendation. The additional grounds would relate to specific circumstances, for example, default of the respondent or substantial hardship to a child of the former marriage. Amendments based on the Family Law Council's recommendation are being considered for inclusion in the Family Law Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 34-Abatement of maintenance and property orders by death</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 34 calls for the Act to be amended to prevent the abatement of maintenance and property settlement proceedings by the death of the respondent. I accept that it is appropriate that property proceedings should survive the death of the respondent and an amendment to this effect will be included in the Family Law Amendment Bill. However, this is not appropriate in maintenance proceedings because the continuing nature of maintenance directly conflicts with the fact that there is no longer a continuing source of income. The Family Law Council has recommended to me that where the respondent dies the applicants' maintenance claims are more appropriately catered for under State or Territory legislation dealing with testators' family maintenance and I understand that in most, if not all, cases this is so. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 38-Injunctions to protect property rights</PARA>
<PARA> The effect of recommendation 38 is that the Act should be amended to affirm the court's power to order an injunction in respect of matrimonial property prior to the entitlement of the party to seek a property settlement. In accordance with the spirit of recommendation 3, the Family Law Amendment Bill will provide for an extension of the Family Court's jurisdiction to enable it to deal with property settlement proceedings prior to proceedings for principal relief and thus the amendment proposed by this recommendation will not be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 58-State courts of summary jurisdiction</PARA>
<PARA> In recommendation 58, the Committee proposed that the Act should be amended to provide for the exercise of federal family law jurisdiction in State courts of summary jurisdiction only by selected magistrates specifically appointed for the purpose by the Governor-General. Quite apart from the difficult question whether it would be constitutionally possible to do this by Commonwealth legislative action, it would amount to a serious unilateral interference with State court systems and thus would have complex practical problems. The Government has therefore decided that implementation of this recommendation would be very difficult and would, in any event, not be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 65-Power to award costs</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 65 calls for the giving to the Family Court of a ''wider discretion to order costs in proceedings under the Family Law Act.''</PARA>
<PARA> The basic principle of s.117 of the Act is that, in proceedings under the Act, each party should bear his or her own costs, subject to a discretion given to the court to make a costs order. In the recent decision in Penfold v Penfold, the High Court held that the discretion given to the court under s.117 to award costs is wider than hitherto was thought, and the Family Law Council has expressed the view that the Act should be amended to put this beyond doubt. Accordingly, I propose that the Family Law Amendment Bill should include an amendment to this effect. It may be that this is as far as the recommendation intended the Act should be amended. If, however, it intended that the basic principle to which I have referred should be abolished, then I do not favour it to that extent. </PARA>
<PARA>* * *</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the remaining legislative recommendations to which a final response cannot be provided. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 5-Consolidation of Marriage and Family Law Acts</PARA>
<PARA> In recommendation 5, the Committee proposed a consolidation of the Marriage and Family Law Acts into one piece of legislation. One of the Committee's reasons for this-that it would assist in alerting those considering marriage of their responsibilities and the consequences of breakdown-appears to some extent not to accord with the view expressed elsewhere by the Committee. I have in mind the view of the Committee that 'the provisions of the divorce law are not a significant factor influencing marriage breakdown'. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Committee's view that a consolidated Act would be more clearly based on the 'marriage' power under the Constitution than at present is not supported by the fact that a succession of High Court decisions has left no doubt that substantial provisions of the existing Family Law Act are supported by that power. </PARA>
<PARA> It needed to be considered whether the disadvantages of consolidation, namely, the considerable printing expenses and the extra administrative burden of dealing with what would be a large, unwieldly piece of legislation, would be outweighed by the benefits seen by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Family Law Council has considered the matter and expressed the view that there are both pragmatic and philosophical grounds for consolidating the 2 Acts and that the principle should be accepted in family law for the future. The Council did not, however, see it as a matter requiring immediate action. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, I have accepted in principle the desirability of implementing the recommendation when an appropriate opportunity arises in the future. Given the size and cost of that task, however, and the number of other matters deserving of immediate attention, I have decided not to proceed with it for the present. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 9, 17 &amp; 28-Wardship jurisdiction and reduction of judicial discretion re maintenance</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendations 9 and 17 concern the proposed conferral of a wardship jurisdiction on the Family Court with respect to children; this has a number of difficult legal problems associated with it that require careful examination. </PARA>
<PARA> An ad hoc committee established by the Family Law Council under the chairmanship of Mr Justice Watson of the Family Court and including several members of the practising profession has since early 1980 been examining the questions raised by these recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 28 proposes that the Family Law Regulations made under the Act prescribe specific amounts, subject to automatic adjustment, to be payable in respect of the maintenance of children. This would introduce a degree of rigidity in relation to a court's discretion which does not exist at present and it is desirable that there be a careful examination of how it would be likely to operate in practice. Accordingly, recommendation 12 is currently under detailed examination by the Family Law Council itself. </PARA>
<PARA> A decision on these recommendations has therefore been deferred pending receipt of the results of the deliberations of the Council and the Watson Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 8-Definition of terms concerning children</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 8 proposes that the terms 'guardianship', 'custody' and 'care and control' be uniformly defined in all Commonwealth and State legislation. The legal and policy aspects of this proposal are also under consideration by the Watson Committee established by the Family Law Council. As envisaged by the Parliamentary Committee, there will also have to be consultation with both my colleague the Minister for Social Security and State Governments about this. All in all, by its very scope, this recommendation cannot be proceeded with until these consultation processes have been completed, and clearly they will inevitably occupy some little time. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 20-Disclosure of Government information</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 20 envisages the enactment of a requirement that Commonwealth departments and agencies disclose information for the purposes of enforcement of orders with respect to the custody of children. It will be appreciated that this raises difficult issues regarding confidentiality and personal privacy in relation to Government records. It may be that the forthcoming Report of the Australian Law Reform Commission regarding privacy will have something to say that is relevant to these issues. Furthermore the Government has undertaken to review the secrecy provision in legislation within 3 years of the coming into force of the freedom of information legislation. The recommendation will be the subject of a Government decision following a proposed joint submission to Cabinet by the Minister for Social Security and myself in due course. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 23, 24 and 30-Social Security benefits and maintenance assessment and enforcement</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 30, which concerns the proposed establishment of a maintenance enforcement agency administered by the Department of Social Security has, together with the amendments to the Social Services Act proposed by recommendations 23 and 24, significant implications that require careful consideration, particularly in relation to the provision of administrative resources. The recommendations will therefore be the subject of Government decision following a joint submission to Cabinet by the Minister for Social Security and myself to be made as soon as practicable. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 31-Maintenance enforcement</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 31 contains a number of detailed proposals for improving the system for the enforcement of maintenance orders, including amendments to the Family Law Regulations and to the Family Law Act and the Bankruptcy Act. Consideration of the proposed amendments to the Family Law Regulations by my Department and by the combined Family Law Council/Family Court Regulations Committee is proceeding and I would expect that appropriate amendments will be made in due course. Other legislative amendments are either included in the Family Law Amendment Bill 1981 or are the subject of interdepartmental consultation now taking place between my Department and the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 54-Family law in ACT</PARA>
<PARA> This recommendation supports the conferring on the Family Court, when sitting in the ACT, of as broad a family jurisdiction as possible. I have received a comprehensive report from a committee chaired by Mr Justice Ellis on what legislative and other steps are necessary to cause a comprehensive family jurisdiction to be exercised by the Family Court in the ACT. Its implementation involves amendment of a number of ACT ordinances. But, as a first step in responding to that report, a necessary enabling amendment to s.31 of the Family Law Act, which confers jurisdiction on the Family Court, will be included in the Family Law Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 68-Filing fee on divorce/nullity applications</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 68 calls for a reduction in the filing fee on application for divorce and nullity of marriage. The fixing of the amount of the fee, which has not been changed since 1977, is a matter for decision by the Government in the context of its consideration of the annual budget. I can do no more than say that when court fees, including this fee, are next being reviewed, the Committee's recommendation will be kept in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendation also proposed broadening the circumstances in which exemption from paying the fee can be claimed. In fact, they were broadened by way of an amendment to the Family Law Regulations in 1979 that appears to meet the complaint that gave rise to this particular recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA>ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER MAINLY NON-LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS</PARA>
<PARA>Although the precise situation with respect to each of the recommendations is set out in the Schedule to which I shall come shortly, I should like to make specific reference to the more important non-legislative recommendations and the action that has been, or is being, taken in respect of them. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 1-Reference of powers</PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the support given by the Committee in recommendation 1 to the proposed reference from the States to the Commonwealth of powers over disputes concerning maintenance and custody of certain children and certain husband and wife property disputes in respect of which the Commonwealth does not have the legislative power under the Constitution at present. Agreement on this question has taken and is still taking much longer than I had hoped or expected. The Senate may be assured that I am as anxious as the Committee obviously was to see this matter resolved. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 4 and 41-Dual judicial commissions</PARA>
<PARA> The possibility of certain State and Federal Judges holding dual commissions to enable the exercise of what the Committee referred to in recommendation 4 as a 'unified jurisdiction in family law matters throughout Australia' does involve a number of legal and administrative problems of substantial magnitude, particularly related to the differences between the terms and conditions of service of State and Federal Judges. I have been actively considering the matter and may need to consult at length with each of my State counterparts. But, to some extent, the need for this will hopefully be reduced by the proposed reference of powers to the Commonwealth to which I referred a moment ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had discussions over some years with the Attorney-General of Western Australia regarding the question of dual commissions for Judges of the Family Court of that State, as recommended in recommendation 41, and the matter is still under consideration because of the difficulties I mention. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 7-Arrangements for welfare of children</PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with recommendation 7, I have asked the Institute of Family Studies to research and report on the question of court-approved arrangements regarding the welfare of children on the divorce of their parents and related matters. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 19-Family Court Marshals and Deputy Marshals</PARA>
<PARA> In recommendation 19, the Committee proposed the appointment under s. 37 of the Act of a Marshal and Deputy Marshals of the Family Court in each State and registry of the Court respectively. At present, officers of the Australian Federal Police hold these appointments, and I am informed that members of that force provide, within the limits of their resources, a satisfactory and useful service to the Court in the performance of police-type tasks, such as the execution of warrants. If persons were appointed full-time to such positions, it is difficult to see what useful role they would perform without resources such as those at the command of the Australian Federal Police. Having regard to the Government's present program of Public Service staff reductions, the provision of back-up resources of the kind I have mentioned to replace the police is out of the question. I consider that it would be far more efficient to utilize the Court's available resources for more pressing purposes, such as additional counselling and registry facilities, than for the appointment of a full-time Marshal and Deputy Marshals. Accordingly, the Government has decided against implementing the recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 14, 15, 16 and 45-Pre-trial procedures</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendations 14, 15, 16 and 45 all propose or relate to the mandatory use of pre-trial conferences and other related procedures in contested cases concerning children or property. The reduction of such cases going to fully-contested court hearings by the use of counselling and conferences has been one of the basic aims of the Family court since its inception and it has achieved, and is continuing to achieve, a great measure of success. These procedures are now used in the great majority of contested cases of the kind referred to. For instance, in the calendar year ending 31 December 1980, I am informed that 56,000 persons took advantage of the court counselling service. Accordingly, the spirit of the recommendations is continuing to be followed by the Family Court within the necessary constraints of the resources that can realistically be made available to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Family Law Council has expressed opposition to these recommendations, insofar as they imply achieving the desired ends by legislation, on the grounds that these matters relate to the administration of the Court, and should be left to judicial policy and discretion. The Council also pointed out that the spirit of the recommendations is being achieved already by these means. In addition, I mention that the Council is currently undertaking a review of all pre-trial procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 46, 47 and 55-Family Court Resources</PARA>
<PARA> These recommendations all relate to the proposed provision of registry and counselling facilities in regional areas. The Government accepts this as a desirable aim and will continue to move towards the appropriate provision of Family Court facilities in areas that need them as resources permit. The Government regards the provision of counselling services in particular as being of priority importance in view of the undoubted success of the counselling service in achieving settlements by conciliation and a consequent significant reduction in the overall work of the Court, the cost to parties and savings for legal aid. </PARA>
<PARA> My Department and the Family Court is keeping under constant review the need for provision of resources to the Court, ways in which those resources can be most efficiently used and the most effective geographical spread of those resources. An example of this is provided by the severe problems that were being experienced by the volume of work being carried on in the Melbourne Registry of the Court. The provision of additional resources, particularly counsellors, to that registry together with praise-worthy efforts by the judges and the staff at the registry has achieved a dramatic turn around in the delays there. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as Darwin and Alice Springs are concerned, the Government accepts that it is ultimately desirable that registries of the Family Court be established in such centres and this will be kept in mind for the future. In the meantime, consistent with the emphasis on counselling, a full-time Family Court counsellor has been stationed in Darwin for some time now and that person also provides a regular service at Alice Springs. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 57</PARA>
<PARA> This recommendation proposed the provision of Family Court type facilities such as counselling services to all courts of summary jurisdiction exercising jurisdiction under the Family Law Act. Again the Government accepts that the provision of such facilities in all courts doing family law work is ultimately desirable. But, given the number of courts of summary jurisdiction in the States and Territories that are involved in this work this will need to be a long term goal. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention that those persons who are involved in family law proceedings in courts of summary jurisdiction can, of course, avail themselves of the counselling facilities provided through the Family Court itself and are encouraged to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 29-Tax deductibility of maintenance payments</PARA>
<PARA> I have drawn the attention of the Treasurer to recommendation 29 which proposes that he arrange for an inter-departmental examination of the question of tax deductibility of maintenance payments. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 36 and 37-Matrimonial property regime</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to recommendation 36, in which the Committee proposed a full study of the implications of the introduction of a full matrimonial property regime in Australia, including a survey of community attitudes and an assessment of overseas experience. The Committee recommended that such a study should be carried out by the Australian Law Reform Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable Senators will be aware that the Law Reform Commission's resources are already stretched in coping with the several very important matters it currently has under reference. Furthermore, problems of family law have hitherto been the province of the Family Law Council rather than the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government acknowledges that the question of a matrimonial property regime, affecting as it would the property interests of most adults in the comeunity, is such an important matter as to warrant investigation by a body of unquestioned expertise in this field and with adequate resources for the task. Although the members of the Family Law Council are distinguished by their professional expertise in various aspects of family law, they are all part-time members, and the back-up resources of the Council would be quite unequal to servicing an enquiry such as is called for. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Government has decided that the task will be undertaken by an ad hoc committee of enquiry which will be appointed specifically for the purpose, and which will consult with the Family Law Council. The committee is to consist of a full-time member with appropriate qualifications and expertise and 4 part-time members. It will be required to report within 2 years of its establishment. I expect to make an announcement about the membership of the committee and provide details of its terms of reference in the near future after I have consulted with State Attorneys-General. The proposal concerning ownership of the matrimonial home made in recommendation 37 will be subsumed by the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 42, 43 and 44-Migrants and the Family Court</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 44, which calls for more explanatory material on family law and related matters in appropriate foreign languages, has been accepted and a working party consisting of representatives of my Department, the Family Court, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Office of Women's Affairs of the Department of Home Affairs and Environment has been established to co-ordinate its implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> As regards recommendation 43, which proposes that the Family Court should recruit people with sensitivity and experience in working with ethnic communities, I understand that the Family Court is already doing this as far as possible, consistent with the need for the holders of positions in the Court to possess appropriate educational or professional qualifications. In relation to Recommendation 42, which deals with the provision of interpreter services in family law proceedings, I point out that under arrangements now in operation, properly accredited interpreters are available to any party who requires such services in the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 53-Parliamentary representations on Family Law Council</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 53 proposes that membership of the Family Law Council should include representation from the Parliament. After considering the matter, the Government has decided that it would not be appropriate for members of the Parliament to be appointed to the Council, which is essentially a specialist advisory body. </PARA>
<PARA> As regards the call by recommendation 53 for the appointment of a magistrate as a member of the Council, a magistrate, Mr E. J. Blythman S.M. of Brisbane, was in fact appointed to the Council on 25 May 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 70-Appeal Cost Fund</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I briefly mention recommendation 70 which proposed the establishment of an Appeal Costs Fund for the purposes of proceedings in the Family Court. In this regard, Honourable Senators may recall that this matter is now covered by the recently enacted Federal Proceeding (Costs) Act 1981. </PARA>

<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA> We live in a period when the rate of divorce has significantly increased. Although that increase has not reached the worst fears of many people, and it certainly is not as great as in a number of other countries, it nevertheless represents a major social disruption for our community. I must say that I share the concerns which have been expressed by many people about this situation. The problems of dissolving a marriage are often greater and more enduring than those which are sought to be avoided. Nevertheless, the Government and the Parliament are obliged to deal with the problems of widespread breakdown of marriage, whether we like it or not. Both the Government and Parliament have done much in recent years to assist people to repair a marriage or reconcile after separation; for example, the grants to marriage counselling organisations. By amendments to the Marriage Act several years ago, the Parliament sought to encourage people to prepare for marriage. Perhaps more could be done in these areas. However, it is essentially a moral question which must be decided by each individual. Both the Government and Parliament have also done much in recent years to make the process of dissolution more humane, less traumatic, and as amicable as possible. The establishment of the Family Court of Australian has been a notable achievement in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I would would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Chief Judge and the judges of that court, and the Family Court of Western Australia on the work they have done. It is often referred to as 'a helping Court'. That is not an empty rhetorical phrase. The judges of that Court have been selected not only for their expertise in family law but also for their suitability as judges in the very sensitive area in which they work. It is regrettable that so many people seem to misunderstand and devalue that work. However, I am sure that the great majority of people who have been assisted by the Court have not taken that attitude. The Court is not only the judges. The counsellors who have been attached to it have also made a significant contribution. The policy of appointing deputy registrars to conduct pre-trial conferences has also been a remarkable success. The work of the counsellors and the registrars has significantly reduced the number of cases coming to trial and thereby shortened the delays, which would otherwise have been greater than they are today. I am gratified that the parliamentary Committee so clearly recognised all these features of the new Court which is, for Australia at least, a new and almost revolutionary concept for the judicial process. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the foregoing statement is a positive response to the report of the parliamentary Committee. The proposed Family Law Amendment Bill will provide further evidence of the attention that has been devoted to the Committee's recommendations. In terms of figures, when the recommendations to be dealt with in the Bill are added together with the other recommendations disposed of either by decisions against implementation or because no further action is required, some 58 of the 72 recommendations in the report will have effectively been disposed of when the Bill is introduced. I trust that this statement and the Bill will meet with a constructive response from the Parliament. In conclusion, I seek the leave of the Senate to incorporate in Hansard the schedule of the responses to each of the recommendations in the parliamentary Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The schedule read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Number 1</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed reference of powers from the States to the Commonwealth in the outstanding areas of children and property be proceeded with as a matter of urgency. The Commonwealth should proceed to enact legislation in this regard on the recommendation of a majority of States if agreement of all States proves impossible to procure. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Consultation with 4 States for an appropriate reference of powers is continuing. It is unlikely that a reference will result in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 2</PARA>
<PARA> Independent of any reference of powers by the States, the Commonwealth move to amend the Family Law Act to exploit to the fullest extent its legislative powers with respect to children; the rights of third parties and re-introduction of the original definition of 'child of the marriage'. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> To be dealt with in the Family Law Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 3</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth move to amend the Family Law Act by relating the jurisdiction in respect of matrimonial property disputes to the marriage power. It is proposed that the property jurisdiction be limited to require:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) The proceedings to be between the parties to the marriage;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) That the dispute relates to the property or proprietary claims of either party;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) That the claim arises out of the marital relationship, or arises by reason of the fact that the parties are married;</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes such legislation would survive testing of its validity in the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> To be dealt with in the Family Law Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 4</PARA>
<PARA> The Government of the States and the Commonwealth examine the possibility of issuing State commissions to federal Family Court Judges and Federal Commissions to selected State judges to enable the exercise of a unified jurisdiction in family law matters throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed that this be raised individually with each of the State Governments. This proposal raises problems of great complexity. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 5</PARA>
<PARA> Those considering matrimony should be appraised of the responsibility involved in that state and the consequences that will result from marriage breakdown. As a means of highlighting this approach the Committee recommends that the Marriage Act and the present Family Law Act be consolidated. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Family Law Council has recommended that the principle of consolidating the two Acts should be accepted in family law for the future but did not see it as a matter requiring immediate action. Therefore given the size and cost of the task, it has been deferred for the time being. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 6</PARA>
<PARA> There should be no change to the provisions of the Act relating to grounds for divorce. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> This has been accepted and no action is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 7</PARA>
<PARA> The Institute of Family Studies should undertake research with a view both to assess the value of the procedures under s.63(1) of the Family Law Act, relating to the approval by the court of arrangements reached by the parties to a marriage regarding the welfare of children of the marriage and to examine alternative methods of supervising placement arrangements by couples upon separation. The study should make recommendations as to the extent of involvement of Commonwealth and State welfare departments, voluntary agencies and the court counselling services. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Institute of Family Studies has been requested to institute such a study.</PARA>
<PARA>Number 8</PARA>
<PARA> The Family Law Act and other legislation of the Commonwealth and the States should be examined by the appropriate authorities to ensure a consistent use of terms such as guardianship, care and control and custody. Where necessary, terms should be defined so that the nature of the relationship between a child and the person standing in a relationship towards the child are precisely expressed. The Commonwealth Attorney-General and the Minister for Social Security should take this matter up with their State counterparts with a view to achieving a uniform approach to the use of these terms. This Committee is of the view that the terms 'guardianship' and 'custody' and 'care and control' should be defined with some care in the Family Law Act itself and more particularly, that the terms 'guardianship' and 'care and control' should be carried through into other provisions and Part VII of the Act which are relevant e.g., s.61(4); s.64 sub-sections (2), (3), (4), (9), s.67(1), s.68, s.69, s.70. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Action on this has been deferred, pending receipt of the views of the Family Law Council, which in early 1980 established an ad hoc committee of experts under the Chairmanship of Mr Justice Watson (the 'Watson Committee') to examine in detail this and related matters. It is proposed that the Council's views, when received, will be the subject of consultation with both the Minister for Social Security and the Governments of the States. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 9</PARA>
<PARA> The Family Law act be amended to insert into section 61 of the Act, a provision that would empower the Family Court to exercise the prerogative of declaring children within its jurisdiction to be wards of the court. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Action on this has been deferred pending receipt of the views of the Family Law Council. It is among the matters being examined by the Watson Committee (see response to recommendation 8 above). </PARA>
<PARA>Number 10</PARA>
<PARA> The Family Law Act be amended to provide that the court may request a designated official (i.e., an officer responsible for administering child welfare laws in the State or Territory) to intervene in proceedings before the court where the court considers it appropriate so to request in relation to a child of a marriage whose welfare is under consideration in proceedings before the court. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> To be dealt with in the Family Law Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 11</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the extent that the wishes of a child should be taken into account in custody proceedings that the specific reference to the age of 14 should be removed from the legislation and not replaced by any reference to a specific age. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> To be dealt with in the Family Law Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 12</PARA>
<PARA> In order to reduce as far as possible unnecessary bitter and prolonged custody and access proceedings, a new s. 70A should be inserted in the Act providing that in proceedings with respect to the custody and guardianship of a child of a marriage, the court shall, as far as practicable, make such orders as will avoid further proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Courts having jurisdiction under the Family Law Act already make every attempt to make orders that will, as far as possible, not be susceptible to being changed. In addition, custody orders have entirely future operation and may thus often be rendered inappropriate by future events. It is also considered that the major problem with which the Committee was concerned, namely the changing of custody as a result of reversals of decisions on appeal, is not dealt with by the recommendation. The Family Law Council has concurred with this view. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 13</PARA>
<PARA> In order to facilitate the more immediate settlement of disputes over custody s. 64 (1) should be drafted to state criteria that the court must consider. It should be provided that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The Court shall regard the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Court shall take the following matters into account:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the relevant conduct, as parents, of the parents of the child;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the relevant conduct of any step-parents or persons sharing the care, control and guardianship of the child with the custodian;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the wishes of the child's parent or parents as to his custody;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) the wishes of the child;</PARA>
<PARA> (v) the desirability of, and the effect of, any change in the present care and control of the child;</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) if there is more than one child under consideration the effect of the separation on the children;</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) the education and up-bringing of the child;</PARA>
<PARA> (viii) any other fact or circumstance which, in the opinion of the court, the justice of the case requires to be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Subject to paragraphs (a) and (b), the court may make such order in respect of those matters as it thinks proper, including an order until further order. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> It is considered that it would be undesirable to restrict or reduce a court's discretion in relation to proceedings concerning children by attempting to specify matters that it must consider. It is preferable that the wide discretion of courts in the area should be retained. The Family Law Council has so recommended. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 14</PARA>
<PARA> Except in cases of urgent necessity no custody case should be listed for determination by a judge until the parties have attempted to resolve the dispute in pre-trial conferences with court counsellors and registrars. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> This recommendation, together with related recommendation 15, is accepted in principle. Pre-trial procedures involving counselling, conferences and/or reports are now conducted in the great majority of contested custody proceedings in the Family Court of Australia, whether final or interim in nature, and progress towards the objectives proposed in the recommendations is continuing. In such proceedings, however, the procedures referred to are conducted by the counselling service of the Court rather than registrars and this is considered to be appropriate in cases involving children. The Family Law Council has recommended against implementing these recommendations by legislation, on the grounds that they are being achieved by administrative action. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 15</PARA>
<PARA> Except in cases of urgent necessity no court should entertain an application for interim custody before pre-trial conferences have been conducted. The application for such an interim order should not be made in the absence of a report from a registrar on the outcome of the pre-trial conference. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> See response to recommendation 14 above. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 16</PARA>
<PARA> Except in cases of urgent necessity (i) no interim custody order should be granted unless the other spouse has been served with notice of the proceedings, (ii) no court should grant such an order in the absence of a report from a court officer who has interviewed the respondent and advised that person of the implications of the order. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> This recommendation is accepted in principle. As far as part (i) is concerned, it is at present the case that ex parte orders are only granted in cases of urgent necessity. As to part (ii), action will be taken as far as possible to achieve this. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 17</PARA>
<PARA> Section 64 (4) of the Family Law Act be amended to provide that upon the death of a person awarded sole custody of a child, the child should become a ward of court pending the further order of the court. it is further recommended that the Act be amended to the fullest extent possible within the jurisdictional limits of the powers of the Commonwealth to ensure that the Family Court has jurisdiction in all matters affecting custody, guardianship and access to a child. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Action on this has been deferred pending receipt of the views of the Family Law Council. It is among the matters being examined by the Watson Committee (see response to recommendation 8 above). </PARA>
<PARA>Number 18</PARA>
<PARA> Some means be employed to formalise the use of State police forces to assist in the enforcement of custody and access orders. The Committee therefore considers that steps should be taken for the necessary arrangements to be made with State police forces as envisaged by s. 112 of the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> To be dealt with in the Family Law Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 19</PARA>
<PARA> A marshal of the court as provided for in s. 37 (4) should be appointed to the Family Court in each State to liaise with State and Commonwealth police. Deputy marshals should be appointed to registries in the States. Further, the Commonwealth should fund the States in respect of the cost of their police. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not propose to appoint a full-time Marshal and full-time Deputy Marshals of the Family Court. It is considered that the present arrangement under which part-time appointments to those positions are held by members of the Australian Federal Police is working satisfactorily and that full-time Marshal and Deputy Marshals would be unlikely to be able to perform an effective role without resources such as are at the command of the Australian Federal Police. It is also considered that there is insufficient work to occupy full time holders of the positions. Further, the necessarily limited recources available to the Family Court could more usefully be devoted to more pressing areas of work. The remainder of the recommendation is under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 20</PARA>
<PARA> It should be clearly provided in legislation that in circumstances where a custody order cannot be enforced because of a child's whereabouts are not known it should be incumbent on Commonwealth Departments of State having information concerning the whereabouts of the child to provide an authorised officer of the court with such information as he may require to enforce the orders and pocesses of the court. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> This recommendation will be the subject of Government decision following a joint submission to be made to Cabinet by the Minister for Social Security and myself in due course, having regard to the difficult issue of confidentiality involved and that the anticipated report of the Australian Law Reform Commission on its reference on privacy may be relevant to the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the Government has undertaken to review the secrecy provisions in legislation within 3 years of the coming into force of the freedom of information legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 21</PARA>
<PARA> A party absconding with a child should be required to reimburse the Government for any costs associated within the recovery of such a child. Therefore s. 117 of the Family Law Act should be amended to put beyond doubt that the court has power to make an order directing the reimbursement of the Government for its expenses in assisting a party to regain custody to a child taken interstate or out of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> To be dealt with in the Family Law Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 22</PARA>
<PARA> Section 72 concerning the right of a spouse to maintenance be amended to read:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) A party to a marriage is liable to maintain the other party to the extent that the first party is reasonably able to do so, if, and only if, that other party is unable to support herself or himself adequately whether-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) by reason of having the care and control of a child of the marriage who has not attained the age of 18 years; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) by reason of age or physical or mental incapacity for appropriate gainful employment; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) for any other adequate reason. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) In considering whether a party to a marriage is unable to support himself or herself adequately by reason of the matters contained in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of sub-section (1) the court shall have regard to any relevant matter referred to in s. 75 (2). </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Examination of the ambiguity in s. 72 perceived by the Committee and of the change proposed has led to the conclusion that the ambiguity does not exist and that therefore the proposed change is unnecessary. The Family Law Council has also come to this conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 23</PARA>
<PARA> The Social Services Act 1947 be amended to delete provisions requiring Social Security applicants to take maintenance proceedings (ss. 62 (3) and 83AAD) with a new provision to be inserted that would have the effect that:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The Department of Social Security will assess the means of the liable relative and determine what it is proper for him to pay to the Department in or towards satisfaction of the money it has paid out;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Department will be entitled to order the liable relative to pay the Department the amount so assessed. For the purposes of exposition we shall call such an order by the Department an 'administrative order';</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Subject to rights of review and appeal the administrative order will be legally binding on the liable relative and enforceable against him;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The amount of the administrative order will in no case exceed the amount of the applicant's entitlement to social service benefits. Within this limit the amount will be within the Department's discretion. In exercising this discretion the Department will act in accordance with published criteria for assessment, framed so as to produce a fair result in the normal run of cases; but the discretion will always be available to allow for individual circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Department will never be in a position of having to pass judgement on matrimonial conduct. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> This recommendation, together with recommendations 24 and 30, will be the subject of Government decision following a joint submission to Cabinet to be made by the Minister for Social Security and myself as soon as practicable. In making its decision, the Government will examine carefully the implications of recommendation 24 and 30 in relation to the availability of Government staffing and financial resources, having regard to the need for maximum constraint in the provision and use of such resources at present. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 24</PARA>
<PARA> The Social Services Act 1947 be amended to extend eligibility for Class A and Class B widows pensions to all separated wives rather than just to 'deserted wives' as at present. For statistical purposes the Committee believes it is desirable that a record be maintained of payments to separated wives and supporting parents as distinct from widows. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> See response to recommendation 23 above. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 25</PARA>
<PARA> Section 75 (2) (f) be amended to read: The eligibility of either party for a pension, allowance or benefit under any superannuation fund or scheme, or the rate of any such pension, allowance or benefit being paid to either party. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> To be dealt with in the Family Law Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 26</PARA>
<PARA> Section 75 (2) (1) be amended to read: The need to protect the position and reasonable expectations of a party to a marriage who had contributed to the welfare of the family during the marriage and that, but for the dissolution of the marriage, such party would continue so to contribute. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Examination of this recommendation has lead to the conclusion that the redraft proposed does not achieve the intended result and that any other possible redraft of s.75 (2) (1) would be likely to create as many problems as it would solve. The Family Law Council expressed a similar view. The provision has not to date come to notice as having given rise to problems in practice. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 27</PARA>
<PARA> Section 75 (2) (o) be repealed and the following provision inserted: Any fact or circumstance including any conduct of the applicant for maintenance towards the respondent and relevant to the matrimonial relationship, which, in the opinion of the court, the justice of the case required to be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The recommendation amounts to a pointed reintroduction of matrimonial conduct at large and, accordingly, is contrary to the basic philosophy of the Family Law Act. It would undoubtedly be seen as an invitation in maintenance proceedings to bring up all alleged misconduct of the applicant-whether or not relevant to the issue of maintenance-and thus open the floodgates to the reintroduction of recrimination and counter-recrimination. It would lead to more protracted and costly proceedings, and thus to a greater drain on limited Court and legal aid resources. It would also necessarily reintroduce the notion that maintenance-or the witholding of it-may be used to punish the party 'guilty' of misconduct. The conduct of one of the parties to maintenance proceedings that has affected the economic circumstances of the other party can be taken into account under the existing provision, and it is considered that this is the only extent to which conduct should be relevant. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 28</PARA>
<PARA> The Regulations prescribe the various amounts payable in respect of children's maintenance using criteria supplied by the Commonwealth Statistician. Furthermore, the Committee recommends that the amount payable to children should be subject to automatic adjustment. Accordingly, it is recommended that the Commonwealth Statistician regularly determine variations in the amount based on the relative cost of bringing up children. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The practicability of this recommendation is under examination at present by the Family Law Council. A Government decision will be taken when the Council's views are available. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 29</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer refer the matter of the tax deductibility of maintenance for consideration by an inter-departmental committee after canvassing the views of organisations interested in the matter and to have regard to the effect of such a proposal on the ability to pay maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> This is under examination by the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 30</PARA>
<PARA> The Government review the arrangements for the collection and enforcement of maintenance with a view to establishing a consistent administrative approach. An agency should be created, modelled on the systems developed by the Department of Community Services in South Australia and the Collector of Maintenance in Western Australia. In view of the withdrawal of some States and the prospective withdrawal of other States from the responsibility of providing grants under the States Grants (Deserted Wives) Act, it is considered that this agency should be established in and administered by the Department of Social Security in close liaison with the Family Court and courts of summary jurisdiction under the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> See response to recommendation 23 above. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 31</PARA>
<PARA> Procedures for the enforcement of Maintenance should be improved and in particular it is recommended that:-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Maintenance proceedings be undertaken by specialist Family Court magistrates in designated courts specialising in family law work (see further Chapter 8);</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The regulations be amended to ensure the attendance, wherever possible, of both parties when maintenance matters are dealt with in the court;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The regulations be amended to ensure that upon default by a respondent to a maintenance order the order is reviewed by the court, or the defaulter examined as to his means, to ensure that the order reflects the capacity of the defaulter to pay;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Steps to be taken to improve the capacity of courts of summary jurisdiction exercising jurisdction under the Act to perform these functions adequately. The Committee makes specific recommendations in this regard in Chapter 8;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) The agency established in accordance with recommendation 30 be equipped to provide credit counselling facilities and conciliation services to assist parties involved in maintenance proceedings;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) Section 40 (3) of the Bankruptcy Act be amended by the addition of a further sub-paragraph to deem a maintenance order to be a final order for the purpose of founding procedures in Bankruptcy;</PARA>
<PARA> (g) The Family Law Act should be amended to place beyond doubt the court's power to imprison for contempt in the face of the court in proceedings relating to maintenance;</PARA>
<PARA> (h) Amendment to the Family Law Act to effect that those amendments to the Act and Regulations proposed by the Family Law Council in its Working Paper (No. 4) on the enforcement of Maintenance be made, namely: Amendment of Regulations 136, 139 (4), 144 and 145 to enable the Collector, Deputy Collector or Assistant Collector of Maintenance in South Australia and Western Australia to apply for sequestration (Reg 136) and to transfer an order interstate;</PARA>
<PARA> (i) A provision be included in the regulations to issue a warrant in the first instance where an application is lodged under Regulation 133 (2) but the whereabouts of the payer is unknown;</PARA>
<PARA> (j) Amendments to Regulation 133 be made to authorise withdrawal of a warrant;</PARA>
<PARA> (k) Amendment of the Regulations relating to sequestration be made to include the power to sell specific real estate; alternatively that the enforcement regulations be amended to empower the court to make an order for the sale of a particular item of the respondent's real property in satisfaction of an unsatisfied order;</PARA>
<PARA> (l) The Family Law Act be amended to permit the registration of lump sum maintenance orders in State courts and to permit the enforcement of such orders in the State courts (c.f. s.104 (1) of Matrimonial Causes Act 1959). </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> (a) See response to recommendation 58 below. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Under consideration in the context of the preparation of a number of amendments to the Family Law Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Under consideration in the context of the preparation of a number of amendments to the Family Law Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) See response to recommendation 57 below. </PARA>
<PARA> (e) See response to recommendation 23 above. </PARA>
<PARA> (f) Under consideration in the context of consultation between the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> (g) To be dealt with in Family Law Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> (h) Under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> (i) Under consideration in the context of the preparation of a number of amendments to the Family Law Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> (j) Under consideration in the context of the preparation of a number of amendments to the Family Law Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> (k) Under consideration in the context of the preparation of a number of amendments to the Family Law Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> (l) As indicated by the immediately preceding responses, the issue of the improvement of maintenance enforcement procedures is under review. It therefore seems desirable that a final decision on this recommendation be deferred until the overall review of these proceedures is completed. However while the recommendation will be given consideration it is questionable whether it is desirable to permit courts not otherwise exercising jurisdiction under the Act to enforce decrees without reference to the principles normally attaching to that jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 32</PARA>
<PARA> Section 79A of the Family Law Act dealing with the setting aside of orders altering property interests be repealed and that a new section be inserted in its stead to provide that: (a) On the application of a person affected by an order made under s. 79 of the Family Law Act or s. 86 of the Matrimonial Causes Act, the court may if it is satisfied that there is just cause for so doing, set aside that order, and if it thinks fit, make another order under and subject to the terms of s. 79 of the Act in substitution for the order so set aside;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) In the exercise of this power to set aside an order made under s. 79 of the Family Law Act or s. 86 of the Matrimonial Causes Act the court shall have regard to the interests of, and shall make any order propert for the protection of, a bona fide purchaser or other persons interested;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Proceedings for the setting aside of an order made under s. 79 of the Family Law Act or s. 86 of the Matrimonial Causes Act shall not be instituted until leave has been obtained from the court in which the proceedings are to be instituted;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) The court shall not grant such leave unless it is satisfied that hardship would be caused to a party to a marriage or to a child of the marriage if leave were not granted. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> This would be a substantial departure from the present policy of the Act that property orders should, as far as possible, be final, and as such would be likely to encourage continuing relitigation of property disputes.

<PARA> To be dealt with in the Family Law Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 34</PARA>
<PARA> The Family Law Act be amended to prevent the abatement of a maintenance or property application on the death of the respondent. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The recommendation of surviver of property applications is to be dealt with in the Family Law Amendment Bill 1981. The surviver of maintenance proceedings is, however, not appropriate because the continuing nature of maintenance directly conflicts with the fact that there is no longer a continuing source of income. This is more appropriately dealt with in State and Territory testators' family maintenance legislation. The Family Law Council has recommended to the same effect. </PARA>

<PARA> Arrangements for the introduction of a full Matrimonial Property Regime should be preceded by:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) A survey to establish community attitudes to the proposal;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) A full study carried out by the Law Reform Commission (Cwlth) of the legal implications of the introduction of such a scheme;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The assessment of the experience of the New Zealand and various Canadian schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Because of the existing commitments of the Law Reform Commission, and bearing in mind that family law has been the responsibility of the Family Law Council, which however is not equipped to undertake such a demanding task as the question of a matrimonial property regime, the Government has decided that it should be the subject of an enquiry by an ad hoc committee appointed for the task and consisting of 1 full-time member and 4 part-time members with appropriate qualifications. It is intended that the committee, whose membership and terms of reference will be announced in the near future, will work closely with the Family Law Council. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 37</PARA>
<PARA> The Family Law Act be amended to provide that during the subsistence of a marriage and on the breakup of a marriage, the parties to the marriage will be presumed to own the matrimonial home in equal shares. </PARA>

<PARA> The subject of this recommendation will be examined by the committee of inquiry referred to in the response to recommendation 36. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 38</PARA>
<PARA> While there is no immediate need for an amendment of the Act to clarify the power of the court to grant an injunction to preserve a prospective right to a property under s. 78 or 79 where no application for dissolution or nullity has been filed, such an amendment to ensure that this power is available would be necessary, should doubt be cast on the principle that once a marriage has broken down the court's power to grant an injunction under s. 114 (1) can be used to protect the incipient or inchoate right to seek a property order under s. 79. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to be included in the Family Law Amendment Bill 1981 arising out of recommendation 3 will make the proposed provision unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 39</PARA>
<PARA> Section 114 of the Family Law Act be amended to give a judge a discretion to attach a power to arrest to an order or injunction where the judge:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Makes an order or grants an injunction containing a provision relating to the personal protection of the applicant or a child of the marriage, or makes an exclusion order;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Is satisfied that the other party to the marriage has caused actual bodily harm to the applicant or the child; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Considers that the other party is likely to do so again. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the Federal and State police should have the powers of arrest in cases where there is reasonable cause for suspecting a breach of the order or injunction by reason of violence or entry into the excluded premises or area. They should be required to bring the person so arrested before any judge or magistrate exercising jurisdiction under the Act within 24 hours and to seek the directions of the court as to the time and place at which the arrested person is to be brought before the court. </PARA>

<PARA>Number 41 The Attorney-General pursuant to s.22 (2A) of the Family Law Act grant federal commissions to the judges of the Family Court of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Response Under consideration in consultation with the Government of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 42 Interpreter services be made available to parties who so require it. Any such interpreter should have full accreditation. </PARA>
<PARA>Response Under arrangements now in operation, properly accredited interpreters are available to any party who requires the service in the Family Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 43 The Family Court recruit people with a sensitivity and experience in working with ethnic communities residing in the area where the court is located. </PARA>
<PARA>Response This is already being done as far as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 44 A wider range of explanatory documents in the major language groups be prepared in all areas of the courts' operation, particularly on counselling and specific areas of the Act such as custody, maintenance and property. It is further recommended that wider publicity is given in the major languages, to the services provided by voluntary marriage guidance organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>Response This recommendation has been accepted and a working party comprising officers of the Attorney-General's Department, the Family Court and the Departments of Home Affairs and Environment and Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has been set up to co-ordinate its implementation. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 45 (i) Pre-trial proceedings should be mandatory in all disputed cases involving child custody or access or financial relationships other than those of urgent necessity and (ii) that the Department of the Attorney-General in association with the Principal Court Registrar undertake immediate studies to determine the number of deputy registrars that would be required to ensure that pre-trial proceedings are available in respect of every disputed matter involving either child custody or financial relationships and that the Public Service Board facilitate these appointments as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA>Response Substantial progress has been and is continuing to be made in the area of the pre-trial procedures and they are now conducted in the great majority of proceedings of the kind referred to in the recommendation (see also response to recommendations 14-15). Accordingly, in practice, the principle embodied in the recommendation is being applied, as far as is practicable. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 46 Studies be undertaken with a view to establishing branch registries consisting of deputy registrars and court counsellors in rural areas and areas of large population not adequately served by the existing registries of the court and that the Government make the necessary resources available as a matter of urgency. These studies should also investigate the extent to which a re-allocation of resources within or between existing registries may alleviate some of the present staffing shortages. </PARA>
<PARA>Response As regards this recommendation, together with recommendations 47 and 55, the Government accepts that the provision of appropriate registry and counselling facilities in regional areas that need them is a desirable aim and will continue to move towards this as resources permit. The Government regards the provision of counselling services in particular a being of priority importance because of its success in achieving settlements by conciliation. My Department and the Family Court are keeping the questions of the provision, efficient use and geographic spread of resources under constant review to this end. As regards recommendation 55, in particular, the establishment of registries at Darwin and Alice Springs will be kept in mind for the future, but, in the meantime, it is pointed out that a full-time Family Court counsellor is already stationed at Darwin and that person visits Alice Springs regularly. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 47 Branch registries be permanently located in centres visited by the Family Court on circuit so that the work of the court can continue in a regular way, pending the periodic visits of the judges. </PARA>
<PARA>Response See response to recommendation 46 above. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 48 The necessary amendments to procedures be made to enable parties who wish to do so to file joint applications for dissolution. </PARA>
<PARA>Response To be dealt with in the Family Law Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 49 The Government should take steps to foster organisations like citizens' advice bureaux in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Response The Government has established an on-going funding program for voluntary and community legal centres. The funds to be made available each year are, of course, subject to overall constraints applying to Government expenditure on legal aid. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 50 Simplified procedures in the cases of undefended dissolution be introduced in Australia to provide for affidavit evidence without the necessity for parties to appear unless the court otherwise decrees. </PARA>
<PARA>Response To be dealt with in the Family Law Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 51 The Committee supports the recommendations of the Family Law Council in relation to the body charged with the making of rules and regulations and accordingly recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The rule making power under the Family Law Act should reside in a body of judges of the Family Court of Australia and the Family Court of Western Australia with provision for the rules to apply to other courts exercising jurisdiction under the Act;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Matters such as costs and fees be excluded from the rule-making power;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) A committee responsible to the body of judges should continue to have the responsibility for receiving and considering proposals for the amendment of the regulations, for consulting with the legal profession and other interested groups and for making recommendations to the judges;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) The committee should have representation from the legal profession, the registrars of the court, the Attorney-General's Department and courts of summary jurisdiction and should consult widely before reaching its conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA>Response To be dealt with in the Family Law Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 52 The Regulations be amended to empower the Principal Registrar at the direction of the Chief Judge to issue directions binding on all registries and staff of the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA>Response To be dealt with in the Family Law Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 53</PARA>
<PARA> The membership of the Family Law Council be extended to include representation of federal parliament. This representation should be drawn from the Senate and the House of Representatives. There should also be representation of magistrates on the Council. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided that it would not be appropriate for Members of Parliament to be appointed to the Family Law Council. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 54</PARA>
<PARA> The Family Court of the A.C.T. should be invested with as broad a jurisdiction in family law matters under s.31 (1) (c) of the Family Law Act as possible. </PARA>

<PARA> To be dealt with in the Family Law Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 55</PARA>
<PARA> Branch Registries comprising a deputy registrar and court counsellor be established in Darwin and Alice Springs to provide services to the Courts in the Territory exercising jurisdiction under the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> See response to recommendation 46 above. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 56</PARA>
<PARA> Steps be taken to obtain better statistical information concerning the work of the courts of summary jurisdiction under the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Action to this end has already been taken. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 57</PARA>
<PARA> Every effort should be made to ensure that all courts of summary jurisdiction exercising jurisdiction under the Family Law Act or likely to exercise such jurisdiction, should be supported by the provision of services to enable them to provide the legal services under the Act that they are expected to provide. Conciliation services such as counselling and pre-trial procedures should be available from these courts. In this connection our recommendation 46 in Chapter 7 that branch registries staffed by counsellors and deputy registrars of the Family Court in remote regions should be noted. The services of these officers should be available to local courts of summary jurisdiction as well as to the Family Court on circuit. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepts that the provision of Family Court-type facilities, such as counselling services, in all courts doing family law work is ultimately desirable, but, given the number of such State courts of summary jurisdiction, this will need to be a long-term goal. Persons involved in family law proceedings in these courts can, of course, at present avail themselves of the counselling facilities provided through the Family Court itself. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 58</PARA>
<PARA> The Family Law Act be amended to provide that the federal jurisdiction of courts of summary jurisdiction be exercised in each State by magistrates (specifically named) specially authorised by the Governor-General to exercise such jurisdiction. It is envisaged that the Governor-General would only authorise the exercise of jurisdiction by magistrates considered by his advisers to be appropriately qualified to exercise the jurisdiction. The Act should be amended to empower the Governor-General by Proclamation to confer jurisdiction on identified State courts and in respect of identified elements of the jurisdiction in family law matters. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided that implementation of this recommendation would not be practicable, in the light of the possible consititutional difficulties involved, and the fact that it would constitute a unilateral interference with state court systems. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 59</PARA>
<PARA> The Family Court be open to the public provided that the judge retains a discretion to exclude persons from the court of its own motion or on the application of a party. In the case of closed proceedings, the court should have a discretion to permit persons to enter. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> To be dealt with in the Family Law Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 60</PARA>
<PARA> The publication of the details of proceedings under the Act should be permitted and that steps be taken to relax the restrictions on publication contained in s.121 of the Family Law Act, provided that the names of the parties and any other identifying information is prohibited from disclosure. Severe penalties should be provided for infringement. </PARA>

<PARA>Number 61</PARA>
<PARA> Marriage Counselling be defined under the Family Law Act to encompass pre-marital counselling, marital counselling, pre-divorce supportive counselling during divorce and post-divorce counselling. The Committee further recommends that education for marriage and family life be further supported either by incorporating provisions in the Family Law Act or by reinforcing those in the Marriage Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> To be dealt with in the Family Law Amendments Bill 1981, and a proposed Marriage Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 62</PARA>
<PARA> Steps to be taken to amend the Family Law Act to discourage the practice of ordering reportable conferences under s.62 and to preserve the original intention that where a counselling conference is ordered under s.62 (1) it should be confidential. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> To be dealt with in the Family Law Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 63</PARA>
<PARA> Section 16 (2) of the Family Law Act which states: 'A party to a marriage may seek the assistance of the counselling facilities of the Family Court or of a Family Court of a State and the Principal Director of Court Counselling of the Family Court or an appropriate officer of the Family Court of that State as the case may be, shall, as far as practicable make those facilities available' be amended by adding after the words 'A party to', the words, 'or a child of'. This would allow a child to seek the intervention of a counsellor where necessary and gives recognition to the right of a child to initiate proceedings. </PARA>

<PARA>Number 64</PARA>
<PARA> The settlement of ancillary matters, that is custody, access, injunctions and property settlement matters, should be encouraged as far as possible. </PARA>

<PARA> This is already the case and no further action is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 65</PARA>
<PARA> The Family Court of Australia be allowed a wider discretion to order costs in proceedings under the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> An amendment that will put beyond doubt the wider discretion to order costs referred to in the High Court's decision in Penfold v. Penfold is being considered for inclusion in the Family Law Amendment Bill 1981. Insofar as the recommendation seeks the abolition of the existing rule that, in the absence of a costs order, each party to family law proceedings should bear his own costs, it is considered that this basic principle should be retained. The Family Law Council has expressed a similar opinion. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 66</PARA>
<PARA> All factors listed in the amendment to s. 117 (1) and (2) of the Family Law Act as proposed by the Law Council of Australia to the Williams Inquiry, should be included in the Act as factors to be taken into account when an order for costs is being considered by the court. </PARA>

<PARA> To be dealt with in the Family Law Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 67</PARA>
<PARA> The Act and Regulations be amended to provide specifically for the concept of a proposal for settlement and that where such an offer to settle has been made it should be a factor to be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion to order costs. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> To be dealt with in the Family Law Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 68</PARA>
<PARA> The fee for filing an application for a decree of dissolution or nullity should not be abolished but should be reduced and that steps should be taken to amend the Regulations to broaden the circumstances in which the exemption can be claimed. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The fixing of the amount of the fee, which has remained the same since 1977, is a matter for decision by the Government in the context of its consideration of the annual Budget. The recommendation will be kept in mind during any future review of court fees in that context. Expansion of the criteria for exemption from a filing fee was in fact provided for in amendments to the Family Law Regulations in 1979, which removed the word 'substantial' before the word 'hardship' in the relevant regulation. </PARA>
<PARA>Number 69</PARA>
<PARA> The Regulations be amended to provide for the refunding of the filing fee to a party making such a request in circumstances where that party has filed a dissolution application without being aware that the other party to the marriage has already filed an application at an earlier date. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no other area of the law which generates such heated controversy and impassioned opposition as the Family Law Act and the Family Court of Australia. That is true both in respect of decisions in individual cases, where it reflects the impossibility of satisfying all parties in an inherently antagonistic and unhappy situation, and also in respect of the structure of the Act and the demands for its reform. There are widely differing views within the community as to the kind of legislation which is appropriate and necessary for the resolution of disputes consequent upon a marriage breakdown, as to the scope and nature of the powers of the Family Court, as to the obligations which it is reasonable to impose upon parties to the marriage after the divorce, and as to the best mechanism for ensuring that the welfare of the children in particular is ensured.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We on this side of the chamber readily acknowledge the high level of feeling within the community which has traditionally operated in this area and which does serve to underline further the need for continuing scrutiny of the operation of the Act. It is within that context that we welcomed the detailed report of the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act when it was presented to the Federal Parliament in August 1980. It is in that context also that we on this side of the chamber deplore the inactivity-I hope just until today, although I never like to speak too soon in this respect-of the present Government in response to the very carefully presented recommendations of that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I acknowledge, like the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) in his statement, that family law is traditionally a free vote area in this Parliament-certainly I do not purport in anything I say now to be in any way speaking on behalf of or binding my colleagues on this side of the chamber-I do nonetheless believe that I certainly speak for the great majority of my colleagues, perhaps all of them, when I say that we in the Opposition do not resile from the basic principles and intention of the Family Law Act. We regard the Act as landmark legislation which, by its removal of the concept of fault and the institution of single ground, no fault divorce, has obviously helped very considerably to reduce both the emotional aspect and the cost and complexity of many divorce proceedings. Equally obviously however, the Act does need reform in a number of areas. Our basic position, or that-again I qualify it-of undoubtedly the great majority of my colleagues, would be one of support, I believe, for the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee. It is not necessarily total support or support for every one of those recommendations, but certainly support for the vast majority of them, which I believe will greatly improve the functioning of the Act as it affects the people involved in a marriage breakdown. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I say a little about the Attorney's response, I want to comment, and again I do it this time I think very much not only on behalf of the Opposition but also on behalf of a great many other senators in this chamber and parliamentarians generally, on the disgraceful but regrettably all too typical tardiness of this Government and the Attorney-General in particular in producing amendments to the Act and, indeed, a response to the other recommendations of the Committee report. This Government has always been pathologically lethargic when it comes to law reform matters, but this time its sluggishness has, I believe, set new records. After all, it was in October 1978 that the Joint Select Committee was established. In July 1980 the Attorney-General, if I can put it politely, had the cheek to issue a Press release when explaining his reluctance at that stage to introduce any changes to the Act. He expressed his disappointment in these words:</PARA>
<PARA> I am disappointed that the Committee has twice sought an extension of its original deadline, and will not now be reporting until the end of next month. </PARA>
<PARA>That was in July 1980. It was in that month that the report was completed, and in the following month it was presented to the Parliament with its 72 recommendations. In December 1980, four months later, the Attorney-General made an announcement to the following effect:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . work has begun on drafting instructions to make significant amendments to the Family Law Act. The amending legislation will be introduced into the Parliament as soon as possible and I hope that the program of Government business will allow it to be introduced in the next sittings of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that announcement specified 24 of the 72 recommendations in respect of which the Government--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Early in the session we could well have done with some more business while so many of the Government's Ministers were displaying again such pathological incapacity to make up their minds about the major pieces of legislation that were before them. There would have been ample opportunity to debate this kind of legislation in detail. I regret the opportunity then lapsed to bring forward some of the major and more urgent reforms that are contemplated in the legislation now, again, today, foreshadowed. That was in December 1980, and the situation is that it is only now, today, in October 1981 that we have another statement from the Attorney inching the matter forward, if I can so describe it, when again the statement is made that legislation will be introduced within a matter of days to legislate for those 24 recommendations, or such of them as have survived the Government's further scrutiny over the interim period, with another three or four added to that original list, I readily acknowledge. We are told today that of the 51 legislative recommendations -I am glad to see that the Attorney has to some extent reacted to my passion for arithmetic in these matters and incorporated some of his own in his statement-27 have been accepted. Ten have been rejected for reasons of varying validity which I will come to in a moment, but which I shall mainly leave to be debated when we debate the Bill and 12 of them are still outstanding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension for dinner I was engaging in some mild and friendly laceration of the Attorney-General for his delay in bringing forward both the legislation to reform the Family Law Act and also, of course, this Government reaction. I confess that I am not entirely clear in which capacity the Attorney has been experiencing that laceration because, reflecting the rather odd character of family law legislation in this place as being, from at least one point of view, free-vote legislation, it did seem that the Attorney has wanted to present this reaction in something of a schizophrenic guise-on the one hand as reflecting his own personal viewpoint and yet on the other hand, and apparently for the most part simultaneously, as reflecting the Government's own reaction. I am not entirely clear whether the Bill he is foreshadowing is to be regarded from that point of view as a private member's Bill or whether it is in fact Government legislation. But whatever the capacity in which the Attorney was in fact producing this statement to which we are now responding, it is evident that some blame is due to him and his Government not only for the delays that have occurred so far but also it seems because of the delays that are still to be experienced before we are going to have a viable, effective and fully sane system of family law in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the one hand there are a number of recommendations of the Joint Select Committee still outstanding so far as the Government's, or at least the Attorney's, reaction is concerned. Some 12 really quite significant recommendations fall into that category and the language in which the Government's, or the Attorney's reaction is cast is such as to suggest we are going to be waiting for a long time yet before legislation is actually presented to this chamber to incorporate some of the further desirable changes that may well still be necessary. I refer in particular to recommendations such as Nos 20 and 30, No. 31 on the extraordinarily important and difficult subject of maintenance enforcement, and No. 54 relating to the passage of certain ordinances to reform the situation here in the Australian Capital Territory, the experience of reform in which when it comes to passing ordinances has been such as to give one very grave cause for alarm as to when the subordinate legislation in question will ever come forward. </PARA>
<PARA> The other part of the statement that still gives us cause for concern so far as its delay potential is concerned is the absence of any very precise timetable being proposed for the consideration of the amending Bill when it is introduced in a few days time. The Attorney has indicated that the Bill will be brought forward but there seems some reason to suppose that there is no great disposition on the Government's behalf at least for that Bill actually to be debated this session, and I think that would be a most unfortunate state of affairs given the long and sad history of delays in this whole area that I have already outlined. Of course it is a matter, particularly these days, for the Senate itself to determine its own legislative timetable. I hope that individual senators who are concerned to move forward the pace of necessary change to family law to remedy the perceived deficiencies in it will take heed of what I am saying so that it does in fact prove possible to advance the debate and, it is hoped, wind it up before this session is over. That still, of course, creates the difficulty of getting legislation on foot in the other House, and that is, of course, where the Government, however much it might pretend that this is free-vote legislation, has the trump card in the setting of the legislative program. I hope, and I do not belabour the point any more than that, this long overdue legislation will in fact get its proper parliamentary attention and that the changes that are necessary and vital to the successful operation of the legislation will in fact be enforced as soon as possible and, it is hoped, before Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not stop now to go into any great detail at all in relation to the legislative recommendations of the Committee or the Government's response to them for the obvious reason that there will be ample opportunity to do that in the context of the debate on the Bill. There will be ample opportunity also to move amendments in respect of that quite numerous range of matters in respect of which the Government or the Attorney has so far demonstrated no great disposition to accept the Committee's recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, however, a couple of quick and general points I would wish to make about the legislative recommendations. The first of those points is that I am pleased that the Government has demonstrated its willingness to legislate to a greater extent to explore the character and scope of its constitutional power with respect to marriage and matrimonial relations. There are a number of matters detailed in the joint select committee report which suggest themselves as candidates for this sort of more adventurous exploration of the Commonwealth's legislative power. I am inclined to think that there are other areas beyond those mentioned by the committee and by the Government in its response that deserve this sort of attention given the unlikelihood of getting referrals of power from the States or, in the short run, any expansion of the Commonwealth's family law jurisdiction in any other way. The particular matters that I think ought to be the subject of such adventurous extension of the actual terms of the Act by reliance on the existing heads of constitutional power are these: Property proceedings between parties to marriage otherwise than in the context of dissolution; proceedings involving a natural or adopted child or just one of the parties to the marriage; third party proceedings involving custody, guardianship or access to children; third party proceedings involving certain property that is owned or partially owned by the parties to the marriage. Beyond that I would also add the question of children and property proceedings in de facto marriages-that is, established non-formal relationships-which do, of course, raise acute practical problems requiring the attentions of any civilised system of family law. I am disappointed that the committee drew back from making explicit recommendations of this kind. I hope that that will be one of the matters that we in the Parliament could pay attention to as justifying again as adventurous exploration of the Commonwealth's marriage powers to see whether it might not extend to that area. </PARA>
<PARA> The other general point I wish to make about the legislative recommendations which are being accepted so far by the Government is this: I am pleased that the Government has shown itself not disposed to do anything that would seek fundamentally to undermine the concept of family law as it was introduced in 1974. We have all been, I suppose, to some extent under increased pressure to do so-not so much now with respect to the grounds of divorce themselves, although no doubt rear-guard actions will still continue to be fought by social reactionaries amply represented here in this chamber by my learned colleague Senator Martyr and my other colleague Senator Walters. But I am thinking more in terms of the pressure to wind back the operation of the Family Law Act in respect of the procedures and the formality of the jurisdiction in its basic role and perception of its role as being not of a forbidding court in the traditional majestic form to which we are accustomed but rather a helping court. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an argument, of course, which has been much kicked along in recent days by the intervention in the debate of Mr Trevor Nyman from the New South Wales Bar writing as he has in a much publicised way in that otherwise rather modest journal produced by the Law Council of Australia and called Law News. Mr Nyman has in fact made a number of suggestions about restoring all the awful in terrorem majesty of the court system in the family court area, about recreating that atmosphere of polished wood and judges sitting on high and, of course, recreating the atmosphere of the presence of bewigged and begowned lawyers, no doubt including Mr Nyman himself. Let us be clear about it: No one, human nature being what it is, will be too anxious to step into the inner sanctums of the legal process once again, unrepresented, when they are confronted with all this traditional, but no more familiar for that to the ordinary layman, panoply of the law. It is a concept which I personally reject, and which I would hope will be rejected not only as it appears to have been by the Committee in its recommendations and by the Government in accepting them in this respect but also by other members of this Parliament when this matter comes to be debated. </PARA>
<PARA> I do applaud one significant change in the practice and procedure of the court which has been recommended by the Committee, although not without some controversy within its own ranks, and which has been accepted by the Government. I refer, of course, to the reopening, to a limited extent anyway, of the Family Court to the public. Nobody wants a return to the bad old days of lurid divorce reporting and certainly, as has been recommended by the Committee and accepted again by the Government, the identity of the parties should not be a matter directly or indirectly for Press publication. But I certainly take the view, and I hope it would be the view taken by this Parliament, that secret justice is never satisfactory justice. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that in fact a great many of the charges of bias or insensitivity that have been made against certain Family Court judges will in fact simply evaporate when the court can be seen at work not only by those immediately engaged in a particular matter but also by people who perhaps have a case pending and want to get some familiarisation with the court and who also want to feel that the workings of the court are in fact exposed to the steely eye, or for the most part steely when it is not too blurred, of the Press. That is an improvement, I am sure, of the open court system and one much to be welcomed, although no doubt it is a change that will be much debated in this and the other chamber when it does come forward as a legislative proposition. I repeat that I would resist very strenuously the notion that there be any kind of return in any other significant way to the bewigged and begowned formality of this particular jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> There will always, of course, be some who want their day in court. There will be some, always, who will not conciliate, who will not settle and who will want to extract the last half ounce of blood from the other party to the marriage. There will always be some people who are never satisfied by the determination of the proceedings in whatever form those proceedings take. Perhaps there is something to be said psychologically for having those people get their final stage of lack of satisfaction in a more formal atmosphere than occurs at the moment. But the situation is, and this emerges in the proceedings of the Standing Committee and the way in which they are reported by the Committee, that the overwhelming majority of litigants in this jurisdiction simply want speedy, expeditious justice in a non- intimidatory, helping, conciliatory and, so far as possible, co-operative atmosphere. The strain of undertaking any kind of marriage dissolution procedure-not that I have been through that myself, mercifully-is enough in itself, particularly so, of course, if there is the added human stress of having the custody of children at stake, without adding and multiplying to that strain by recreating for the parties to the litigation the forbidding traditional atmosphere of the wood panelled, stern, courtroom. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a way out for the problems of delay and dissatisfaction to the extent that they presently exist in the Family Court jurisdiction. I think essentially the elements of that way out, although I do not want to spend too much time debating them now, would involve more counsellors and deputy registrars being appointed to exercise in a more effective way even than is the case at the moment the conciliatory, helping, settlement assisting functions of the court. I also think that the delays in the court and the willingness of parties to settle their cases rather than fight them out to the last drop would be assisted by the Act containing more clear criteria that are likely to be employed by the judge in the final resolution of these contested matters, in particular in the area of custody, the notion being of course that the more criteria are articulated in the text of the legislation the more likely it is that one can predict the outcome of a given case and the more likely in turn it then being that the minds of the respective litigants will be concentrated on the task ahead. They will not get inflated or over- ambitious ideas of what is possible and will in fact be encouraged to settle their case. If respect of both of those matters-the provision of more counselling assistance and more deputy registrars and also the building into the text of the Act more clearly descriptive criteria-I am disappointed to note that the Government's reaction has in fact been negative. I will come back in a moment finally to the counselling question. </PARA>
<PARA> That leads me to comment even more briefly on the subject of the non-legislative recommendations of the Committee and the Government's response to them. Here the prospects of change for the better are much less rosy, if the Government's reaction is any guide, than seems to be the case by and large with respect to the legislative area. Let me mention just two or three of the rather long list of matters which are still outstanding or still unresolved in the Government's mind in this respect. The first such matter is the vexed question of the insufficiency of Commonwealth constitutional power to cover fully the family law field. It may be that a lot of the gaps in this respect can be filled, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, by more adventurous use of the Commonwealth's existing powers, particularly its marriage power. But it is obviously the case that if we are fully to cover the area of illegitimacy, certainly if we are to get adoption and proceedings of that kind under the auspices of the single family court system, we will need some powers transferred from the States to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality of the matter, as is acknowledged in the Government's response, is that although the Labor States have been willing from the very outset to refer such powers, regrettably all sorts of difficulties are being experienced elsewhere and there does not seem to be any real prospect in the immediate future of at least an across-the-board referral of powers. That is an unhappy state of affairs and one which seems not to concern Senator Durack especially, but it very much concerns me and those of us on this side. Let me make it clear that the Labor Party's attitude to this is very explicit and very clear cut. We will certainly support, of course, and continue to support so far as our State parties are concerned, the referral of powers to the Commonwealth to the extent that it is possible to grant them. We will also commit ourselves ultimately to the conduct of a referendum to expand the Commonwealth's constitutional powers in the event that they cannot be obtained rationally any other way. </PARA>
<PARA> The other side of the coin, so far as the Commonwealth's powers are concerned is, of course, the whole very difficult question of divided jurisdiction of the courts themselves in the family law area. Here again there seems to be simply no movement visible in either the negotiations that have been conducted so far by this Government or those that are likely to take place in the future. I simply say here that I do not underestimate the difficulty of the task of rationalising the exercise of family law jurisdiction particularly now that we have a well-established and functioning set of Federal family law courts. But at the same time I do not share Senator Durack's apparent hopelessness about this matter and I would hope that we can get some movement before too long not only on the question of resolving jurisdictional conflicts in the Family Court areas and their State counterparts but also on the larger question of establishing a single uniform national court system overall. That is a topic which it is inappropriate to develop further here, but I make the point that the Government's response in this respect is exceedingly empty and exceedingly depressing and is not unimportant. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally let me mention the subject of pre-trial procedures, which is the subject of another set of Committee recommendations in respect of which the Government's response is very disappointing indeed. The Committee recommends, for very well argued reasons, a substantial increase in the number of deputy registrars to conduct pre-trial conferences and of Family Court counsellors to assist in this conciliatory trial-avoiding process. But that recommendation has simply been greeted, for razor gang and other associated reasons, with nothing more constructive than hollow rhetoric from the Government and from Senator Durack in the response before us now. The opportunity for the Government to do something in this respect is basically now gone with the introduction of the Budget Bills. As we explored in detail in discussing this matter in Estimates Committee A and as is evident from looking at the Budget Papers themselves, this Government has made absolutely no commitment to and no provision whatsoever for any increase even of one body in the area of counsellors on the one hand or deputy registrars on the other. Let that perhaps be the epitaph for this statement now before us, a matter of windy rhetoric when dollars and cents are needed and profound lethargy when a legislative response is called for. </PARA>
<PARA> We do look forward to the introduction of the Bill, if indeed it is possible to believe there will at last be a Bill forthcoming, and we look forward to the opportunity that Bill will provide to explore further the strengths and weaknesses of the Government's response, or, if one prefers to put it another way, Senator Durack's response. We look forward to it so that we can between ourselves, as a parliament behaving rationally, sensibly and constructively and I hope unemotionally contribute something to this profoundly important-because it is so profoundly human in its implications-area of social legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not delay the Senate for very long. To me the statement of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) largely is a collection of cosmetic proposals which really do not do much to alter the fundamental badness of the legislation. My report was the only in toto dissenting report of the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act. Naturally I am disappointed that the Government did not give attention-it did not give any attention it seems to me-to my dissenting report or to any of its recommendations. My dissent was based on, to me, the undeniable fact that sociology, not law, is still the basis of the so-called Family Law Act. I will certainly have more to say when a Bill based on the statement of the Attorney-General comes before the House. Suffice to say that one of the important functions of the law for many generations has been the trial system to establish guilt or innocence or, in other ways, fault or degree of fault. The so-called Family Law Act wiped out all of that to the detriment of, I believe, the institution of marriage which it very severely affected. I think plenty of evidence was put forward to the inquiry which backs up that point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have taken the opportunity tonight to reiterate my view because I believe it is necessary to remind the Senate of the very many people who feel the same way as I do and who feel that their upholding of the traditional permanence of marriage has been undermined by the almost trivial and only ground for the dissolution of marriage of just 12 months separation which still remains the basis of the Family Law Act. I think that sums up the most basic ground of my dissent and it is still the reason why I cannot support what the Attorney-General has put down and why, as I have said, I will have some very strong opposition again to the amendments when they come forward in the form of a Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My being a deputy chairman of the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act for a time I feel necessitates my saying something. I am a little concerned at the earlier remarks of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) that he was disturbed that the Committee had asked for two extensions of time. Perhaps it is worth noting at this stage that there were 504 written submissions to that Committee and that even though we extended the closing date for submissions we were still being requested to receive additional material while the Committee was meeting. We had to consider also the additional reports that were coming up as a result of seminars that were organised by the Committee in relation to specific matters mentioned in the terms of reference. While the Attorney-General expresses his concern at the delay caused by the Committee I express my concern at the delay of the Government in responding to the report of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee met in all States of Australia. We had inspections of family law courts, meetings with judges and with the Chief Judge of the Family Court. We had, as I mentioned, seminars relating to specific areas of the terms of reference of the Committee. We had a large committee of some 15 members from both the House of Representatives and the Senate. I am sure that those of us who have served on Senate standing and Senate select committees will appreciate the difficulty in getting from such a large number a quorum to enable the Committee to meet or to travel and meet in the various capitals. Hundreds of individuals and organisations made submissions to the Committee on a personal basis but of course the Committee could not deal with them because basically we were concerned with an overall view of the matters that were relevant. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the staff of the Committee deserve particular mention, especially the secretary, Mr Donald Nairn, who was an untiring worker for the duration of the meetings of the Committee and certainly up to and including the presentation of the report. I think as a deputy chairman for part of the time the Committee met it is my duty to record an expression of appreciation to the staff and particularly to the secretary, Donald Nairn. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not my intention to keep the Senate very long at this stage because of the opportunity that we hope will arise with the introduction of the Bill which I understand will take place on Tuesday or Wednesday of next week. But I think it is important that I make mention of the concern expressed by my colleague Senator Evans that perhaps the Bill may not be debated properly at that time. I would not like to think that there will not be a full and complete debate in this chamber and in the House of Representatives prior to the rising of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> There were some matters that were under consideration by the Committee which I must admit caused me some heartburn, not the least of which was the subject of open family law courts. Members of the Senate may be aware that the Family Court of Western Australia is an open court, and that system has not been abused. But I do not want to see a return to the situation in which dramatic and sensational headlines were available in most areas of the Press throughout Australia when people were named as having appeared in a divorce court. I still have some apprehension about the recommendation-the Government's response to it indicates that it is accepting this recommendation-that the courts be open courts. I still have some reservations because I believe it will not be impossible for an astute journalist, particularly when dealing with a mildly sensational divorce involving parties who live in a small town or even a small suburb, to write the story in such a way that the people involved could be fairly readily identified, and that causes me more than a little concern. I think divorce, as with marriage and with a marriage partnership, should be a matter of privacy. I did not submit a minority report on that matter because I was convinced by members of the Committee and witnesses who appeared before the Committee that this was not likely to happen. I do not know that I have as much faith in the media in Australia as other members of the Committee who have said that that sensationalism will not arise again. If it did occur I would be most apprehensive that perhaps the courts would not have the necessary power to take action against the people who did identify participants in family court proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans spoke about the attitude being expressed by one judge that perhaps we should return to the pomp and panoply of the past where people are confronted by a judge bewigged and gowned. Of course my attitude on such matters is that there is already enough fear when people go into any court of law; whether they go in as witnesses or participants in the proceedings is not important. There is that fear of the bureaucracy and of the judiciary sitting there and determining an attitude perhaps on something that one says. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the items selected by the Government for a positive response relates to the age of children. At the moment the Family Law Act determines that the wishes of children from the age of 14 years are taken into consideration where custody matters are being discussed. The Committee's recommendation that there should not be an age limit set is one that I heartily agreed with. I do not believe that there is such similarity between children that one can say that only children at the age of 14 years are adult enough or mature enough to determine with which parent they wish to live or with which parent they have an affinity. I believe all children are able to do that at some age. No two children are alike. No two babies are alike as no two adults are alike in everthing they do. Some children, perhaps as young as six or seven years, can determine immediately that they have an affinity with their male or female parent and want to spend their lives with that parent rather than with the other parent. Their wishes should be paramount because they are the ones who will spend the rest of their lives living with the consequences of the determination that they make. I think that is their right and responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I am not going to take the Senate's time tonight to debate these matters but I would like an assurance from the Minister that in actual fact we will have a full and proper debate on this matter coming to a conclusion with a debate on the Family Law Amendment Bill when it is introduced into this House prior to the rising of the Senate and the House of Representatives in the current sitting. It is an extremely important piece of legislation and whilst all the recommendations of the Committee have not been accepted there is opportunity in a full debate for amendments to be moved, and perhaps accepted by a majority of the Senate, which are of paramount importance to the majority of people in the community who have to avail themselves of the services of the Family Court, and from that the Family Law Act. I add that with the free vote of Government and Opposition members we could find ourselves in some rather unusual alliances in this chamber. Similarly, I imagine that in the House of Representatives there would be a number of occasions, with amendments being put forward, when there would be alliances between the Government and the Opposition which might surprise a number of people in both chambers. I will leave the balance of my contribution to the debate for the time when the Bill actually reaches this chamber. I hope that in fact it will be a full and complete debate at that time. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill makes a number of unrelated amendments to the Defence Act 1903 and consequential amendments to the Defence (Visiting Forces) Act 1963. </PARA>
<PARA> The most pressing of the amendments are those made by clause 6 of the Bill which are intended to provide a means of protecting the livelihood of Defence Force reservists who suffer long term total incapacity for work as a result of compensable injuries received during reserve service. </PARA>
<PARA> Publicity was given some time ago to the fact that some reserve units were taking out commercial insurance policies, at their own expense, to meet this situation. The Government takes the view that it is not appropriate that reservists should have to pay their own premiums to protect themselves against events occurring outside their normal civilian occupations, when these events are related to voluntary national defence training in their spare time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government accordingly decided, as the Minister for Defence announced on 30 June 1981, that legislation should be brought down to amend the Defence Act to bring the entitlements of totally incapacitated reservists more into line with those of totally incapacitated regular servicemen. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Compensation (Australian Government Employees) Act 1971, employees totally incapacitated through their employment receive normal weekly earnings for up to 26 weeks and then statutory weekly payments not exceeding a prescribed amount per week, with extra amounts for dependants. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of regular servicemen, their normal military salary and relevant allowances continue while they remain members. If such a member's service is terminated and his incapacity is assessed as more than 60 per cent in relation to civil employment he becomes entitled to a class ''A'' DFRDB invalidity pension of 76.5 per cent of his normal military salary. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 58B of the Defence Act empowers the Minister for Defence to determine financial conditions of service for members of the Defence Force. Clause 6 of the Bill amends section 58B to empower the Minister for Defence to determine the payment of additional compensation to reservists to whom compensation is payable under the Compensation Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It is intended that a determination be made entitling a totally incapacitated reservist, after the first 26 weeks of incapacity, to an addition to the amount payable under the Compensation Act to bring his total weekly entitlement to 76.5 per cent of his average civilian weekly earnings or, if he was previously unemployed or a student, to 76.5 per cent of his reserve military salary. </PARA>
<PARA> This determination will, in common with all other section 58B determinations, be subject to tabling in, and disallowance by, the Parliament, and will be drafted in such a way as to give the reservist a right to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against decisions made under the determination concerning the amount of additional compensation payable. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 9 of the Bill marks an interesting new development, namely, the necessity to legislate regarding control over members of the public using defence lands for recreational purposes where general access for that purpose is permitted. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an increasing use by the public of defence property for recreational purposes where this is compatible with defence requirements. This is a matter of interest to State authorities from at least four aspects, namely, the availability of such areas for use by their citizens; the development in such areas of recreational facilities such as barbeques and camping areas; the conservation of such areas; and the maintenance of law and order in such areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The authorities of the States concerned have been most co-operative in this matter. However the States lack the power to make the legislation required to provide the necessary controls. </PARA>
<PARA> Adequate power to control the activities of members of the public on defence property is normally provided by the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971, the Crimes Act 1914, the Defence Act 1903 and state criminal law. </PARA>
<PARA> However these powers and common law powers are not very suitable where persons are permitted to enter for recreational purposes, particularly where large areas are involved necessitating the employment of rangers. </PARA>
<PARA> Where the ecology of the area is fragile, as at Garden Island in Western Australia, it is essential that there be practical powers of control over such matters as camping, the lighting of fires, the use of off-road vehicles and the removal of plants. </PARA>
<PARA> The nature and extent of the problem will be appreciated when I mention that some of the defence properties are quite large. Garden Island in Western Australia is about 1,200 hectares in extent, of which the public is allowed access to an area of about 950 hectares. Beecroft Peninsula at Jervis Bay is even larger, comprising about 4,600 hectares. </PARA>
<PARA> We are faced, in effect, with a situation similar in a number of respects to that presented by the control of national parks, and the solution adopted is to pass legislation based, to the extent appropriate, on the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 9 accordingly inserts a new Part IXB into the Defence Act which provides for such matters as the declaration of the relevant parts of defence lands as public areas; the appointment of rangers; their powers of arrest and search; and offences such as personating or assaulting rangers. The legislation also empowers the Minister for Defence to make by-laws relating to the control and management of public areas. </PARA>
<PARA> All by-laws will be subject to tabling in, and disallowance by, the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision is also made permitting the continued operation of State and territory laws. This will permit the operation of laws such as those relating to the declaration of high fire danger. </PARA>
<PARA> On this question of defence lands, I mention finally the Naval Establishments (Public Areas) Regulations. These were made at the end of 1980 as an interim arrangement pending the preparation and passing of the Bill now before the House. The regulations are necessarily limited in their scope. They cannot apply to all defence lands but only to those which fall within the definition of ''naval establishment'' in the Naval Defence Act 1910, nor can they encompass all the matters dealt with in the new Part IXB of the Defence Act. The regulations will be repealed in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining provisions of the Bill may be dealt with more briefly. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 8, taken in conjunction with Part III of the Bill (which amends the Defence (Visiting Forces) Act 1963), in effect transfers certain provisions from the latter Act to the Defence Act. The operation of these provisions is not restricted to visiting forces and their inclusion in the Defence (Visiting Forces) Act 1963 was done as a matter of expediency, as the Senate was informed at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions in question relate to attachments of personnel between the Australian Defence Force and the armed forces of other countries, mutual powers of command between such forces and the arrest and disposal of illegal absentees from the armed forces of other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> In the main, the differences between the new provisions and the existing provisions are of a drafting or clarifying nature. </PARA>
<PARA> Significant changes are the provision of additional safeguards where illegal absentees from the forces of other countries are held in custody by the Australian authorities. The Bill requires the person who has custody of the illegal absentee to cause an authorised officer to be informed and to ensure that the person in custody understands his right to request his release. </PARA>
<PARA> The power of an authorised officer (who is appointed by a chief of staff) to hand the arrested person over to the authorities of his own country is abolished and this power is to be vested in the Minister for Defence. </PARA>
<PARA> One other significant change has been made where an officer of the armed forces of another country is given command over Australian forces. The Chief of Defence Force Staff is empowered by the Bill to limit the scope of the powers of command and discipline that may be exercised. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining amendments of any consequence are made to the regulation-making powers in the Defence Act. These clarify the power to make regulations on four matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, in addition to providing for the forfeiture of salary and allowances of members of the Defence Force who are absent without leave, etc., provision may be made for the suspension of the payment of salary etc. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, in addition to providing for the establishment and operation of service canteens and messes, provision may be made subjecting them to Commonwealth, State and territory taxes (other than income tax). </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, provision may be made for compensation by the Commonwealth for loss, injury or damage by reason of anything done under the Defence Act as, for example, the exercise of control over building heights in the vicinity of defence airfields. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, in addition to providing for the appointment and procedures of service courts and boards of inquiry, provision may be made under which a witness may be compelled to answer a question although the answer may be self-incriminating, and a witness may be provided with protection against the use of the answer in proceedings against him before a service tribunal or a civil court. </PARA>
<PARA> This last matter calls for further explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> Boards of inquiry are held, not infrequently, to investigate such matters as the loss of an aircraft, a fatal accident involving the use of service weapons or equipment, the grounding of a ship or a failure in the operation of a ship's navigational or propulsion equipment, as well as deficiencies in, or loss of or damage to, stores. </PARA>
<PARA> The primary purpose of a board of inquiry, particularly if there has been a serious or fatal accident, is to ascertain as quickly as possible what, if anything, went wrong and to prevent a recurrence. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that the board of inquiry's investigation will reveal some dereliction of duty and result in subsequent disciplinary action, but this must not be allowed to negate the primary purpose of the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> In order that the truth be established without delay, it is essential that witnesses give their evidence frankly. In the case of possible equipment failure, for example, which could result in (say) the grounding of aircraft, a witness who is provided with adequate protection against self-incrimination would probably be more ready to admit that the failure was caused by error on his part and not by any inherent defect in design. </PARA>
<PARA> The law relating to boards of accident inquiry under the Air Navigation Act 1920 and to royal commissions, contains similar provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I should mention that I will be introducing in the Committee stage of the Bill several amendments which arose from suggestions put to the Minister in another place by the Opposition during the Committee stage of the debate in that place. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> Debate (on motion by Senator Robertson) adjourned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take advantage of the Senate Standing Orders to speak on the first reading of the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1981 and associated Bills on a matter concerning the so-called Greek conspiracy case, which of course has not been raised in speeches in this Parliament for some time. In particular tonight I wish to raise the mistreatment and neglect of a small and almost forgotten group, the Greek Australian pensioners who lost their invalid pensions in Greece in 1978. The case at the time caused some controversy. The then Minister for Social Security, Senator Guilfoyle-who is at the table-sometimes made, not from any cause of her own, statements about the situation of these people which were misleading at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting also to note that two other major figures involved in the events of the alleged social security conspiracy case, Mr Lanigan, the then Director-General of the Department of Social Security, and Mr Thomas, the then Chief Detective Inspector with the Commonwealth Police at the time this case was first raised, are no longer with us. They have both fled the scene. Both are practising lawyers, Mr Thomas having been invalided out of the Australian Federal Police and Mr Lanigan having taken the opportunity of retiring early from the Department of Social Security. Of course, Mr Rofe, another distinguished member in the case, is at present prosecuting in the court case which continues in Sydney. Up until now he has received $430,000 for the prosecution of this case. One may suspect that this is ample reward for his role in the famous Sankey case, the notorious Sankey case, which occurred in Canberra and which involved leading members of the last Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> As background I remind the Senate that at the time of the dawn raids in Sydney between 31 March and 21 April 1978 183 persons were arrested in Sydney on conspiracy charges. Over 170 of them were Greek-born and Greek-speaking invalid pensioners and sickness beneficiaries. The others were five doctors, of whom three were Greek-speaking, a psychologist and persons who allegedly had acted as agents or go-betweens. At the time Detective Inspector Thomas announced to the Press that more than 1,000 people would be charged and that he and his officers would be responsible for getting those more than 1,000 people. At the moment, after $7m has been spent, 20 people remain charged and there are also nine people charged in Athens under Greek law. We will have something to say about that at another time. About 700 pensions and benefits of people who were of Greek origin and had consulted the accused doctors, were cancelled. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, in April 1978, and on the same grounds-that they had attended the accused doctors; I repeat accused, not convicted, then or now-138 invalid pensioners in Greece, all of whom had at some time worked in Australia, where they had qualified for an individual pension, on income, medical and residential grounds, were asked to attend the Australian Embassy in Athens for medical reviews. They had received their last payments on 16 March 1978. Most of them, in fact, would never receive another Australian Government payment. The first medical reviews, so-called, were conducted by a Dr Ivil and 135 persons attended, of whom 105 lost their pension. These medical examinations, according to Greek pensioners and their relatives who have returned to Australia or whose stories have been told in Greece and transmitted to Australia through the Greek-Australian Pensioners' Association in Greece, were closer to the proceedings of a kangaroo court. Although at the time the Minister told me that the average time of examination was not recorded, there is general agreement that it took Dr Ivil only five minutes to decide that a pensioner was ineligible and to remove entirely his family's financial security. </PARA>
<PARA> In reply to questions that I asked of Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle about who gave the order to terminate the pensions, when the order was given and when it took effect-questions to which I have never received a full answer-I was told on 30 May 1979:</PARA>
<PARA> The Director-General advises me that the reviews which took place were properly conducted. </PARA>
<PARA>The Director-General at the time, Mr Lanigan, may have been satisfied and so may the Minister, but the evidence strongly suggests that the reviews were perfunctory and that justice was neither done nor seen to be done. Mr Morgan, the Social Security Department's Director in Europe, wrote to the pensioners requesting their attendance at the Embassy in Athens with letters from local doctors showing the medication that they had taken previously. Pensions were all stopped until after these reviews took place-for one reason only, guilt by association, as they had been patients of doctors in Australia who had been charged with conspiracy. Apparently the five minute reviews took the form of questions, which were mainly: 'Who were your doctors in Sydney? How much money do you have?' The doctor did not have complete medical histories and decided not to examine at all one man whom he had seen a few months earlier. Patients claimed that medical certificates were ignored. In fact, most of the patients had such certificates from their doctors in Greece. </PARA>
<PARA> The 105 rejected pensioners were sent letters stating that no further payments could be made because, on the medical evidence available, they were not considered to be 85 per cent incapacitated. They were told that they could appeal. In one case, which is typical of the documentary evidence that I have, the last pension payment was made on 16 March 1978. The letter directing attendance for medical examination was sent on 5 April 1978. Notification of cancellation of the pension was given on 16 May 1978. An appeal was lodged on 26 June 1978 and the letter for the appellant to attend the medical appeal was sent on 4 January 1979-a period of almost 10 months between loss of income and advice of appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> There were at the time, and there have been since, examples of misinformation given to this Parliament by the then Minister for Social Security, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, about the situation of some of the overseas pensioners. On 3 May 1978, the Minister told the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> There has not been and there will not be any interference with payments to persons who have been granted benefits on the basis of medical evidence which is not under challenge. </PARA>
<PARA>This was simply not true. A large number, probably the majority, of pensioners who lost their pensions here or in Greece had corroborating medical assessments from doctors in Australia who had not been charged or challenged. Hospitals and doctors in Greece had confirmed incapacity, but pensions were still taken from pensioners in Athens on the basis of a list supplied from Canberra and Dr Ivil's brief interview. </PARA>
<PARA> On 3 May 1978, the Minister told the Senate that about 70 per cent of overseas pensioners had been found ineligible following medical examination; that the others were qualifying for age pension. It was later admitted by the same Minister that not 30 per cent, but in fact none, was being paid the age pension. On 24 November 1978, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle said that many of the invalid pensioners in Greece had had their pensions cancelled because they had not passed the income test. Six months later she had to admit that this too was false information. Not one, let alone many, had had the pension cancelled on income grounds. Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle said that the overseas Greek pensioners would have medical examinations before the next pension pay day. They did not and they could not. The facility was not made available to them on anything like the next pension pay day. </PARA>
<PARA> On 5 April 1978, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle said that any pensioner who was dissatisfied with departmental rulings had the right of appeal. In fact, families in Greece had to beg or borrow money because the Government decided that it was in no hurry to provide the mechanism for appealing. Mr Lanigan told the Senate Estimates Committee in October 1978, in adopting a rather cynical approach:</PARA>
<PARA> We will in due course have to set up some form of medical tribunal-</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to appeals--</PARA>
<PARA>. . . but we have not done this as yet. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Government had meanwhile discarded responsibility for those ill and disabled pensioners. As Mr Lanigan said at the same time:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . once it is established that they are not eligible for an Australian pension . . . then it becomes the responsibility of the Greek Government, not the Australian Government, to support them when they are in Greece. </PARA>
<PARA>This, of course, was fast work-cable across a list of names, give the people on the list a brief interview, followed by cancellation notices, and they no longer exist as far as the Australian Government is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government medical team-two Government doctors-eventually, in January 1979, went to Athens with instructions, I am told, not to take the availability of suitable work into consideration. They saw 64 pensioners, restored three pensions and left 61 pensioners who had appealed and 40 who had not with only two alternatives-to stay in Greece and depend on relatives, or borrow money to return to Australia and try to get their pensions back after seeing new doctors. At least one pensioner died in the interim, with stress caused by losing the pension considered to be a major factor. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Minister, the Government doctors went to Greece 'assisted by an advice, the terms of which were settled by the Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department'-advice that this Parliament, I might say, has not seen. Mr Lanigan, in a famous memorandum called Control of Invalid Pensions issued in May 1979, said that these instructions were in line with the Government's actions and stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The European cases are not typical because they were former patients of doctors who have since been charged with criminal offences . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is, he believed the doctors guilty and the pensioners fraudulent and took action to punish the pensioners well ahead of any court hearings-hearings which have not yet been completed. As is now well known, and as many honourable senators will well remember, this memorandum led to a tightening of the criteria by which eligibility for all invalid pensions in this country were assessed. Mr Lanigan, I remind honourable senators, had stressed that the same criteria applied in Greece as applied in Australia. All were to be judged on medical disability alone, with no other circumstances being taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> The result of this memorandum and of these new policies was a considerable questioning of the Government's actions, a considerable campaign in this country to have the situation reversed. More than a year later, the criteria were relaxed to the pre-April 1978 guidelines because they had been manifestly inhumane and unworkable and many people were being harshly treated. But they applied only to those individual pensioners who were in Australia. Those who were stranded overseas, in Greece, were left without the benefit of these new criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> My last information from Senator Chaney, the present Minister for Social Security, is that in fact 60 pensioners have returned from Greece. Of these, two are known to be at work, 14 are on sickness benefits and six are on other benefits. Some 20 have had the invalid pension restored, presumably for the same reason as it was granted in the first place-that they fulfilled the eligibility criteria that were in vogue before April 1978. I believe, as do many who have been involved with these cases, especially social workers and members of the Australian-Greek Pensioners' Association, that all of these people have been treated very shabbily. Senator Chaney was not the Minister during the earlier disgraceful episode, but he is now the responsible Minister. I believe he should exercise his powers to redress, where he can, the injustice that has been done to those pensioners in Greece whose pensions were axed in 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make three suggestions in this respect. Firstly, all those pensioners who have had their pensions restored on the same basis on which they were originally granted should be paid arrears from the time the pensions were stopped. Only two of those 20 pensioners have received full back pay. I believe all of them have a valid case for claiming entitlement to that pension in the intervening period. Secondly, I believe all those pensioners who have returned from Greece to try to establish their pension entitlements should be given reimbursements for their fares. Their medical reviews in Greece were inadequate. They had been judged ineligible because they had been associated with certain doctors and not on the basis of their illnesses. The only way they could have claims properly assessed was to reapply in Australia with a new and non-suspect set of doctors. They had to return because of Australian Government actions. I believe the Australian Government has some responsibility to pay their fares. Thirdly, I believe all remaining pensioners in Greece whose pensions were stopped in March 1978 should be re-examined in Greece by an independent medical team under the criteria which currently exist for the granting of invalid pensions-that is, those which take other factors, such as work availability, into account. </PARA>
<PARA> I have asked Senator Chaney to look at the right of appeal of pensioners from Greece. During the hearings of Senate Estimates committees he promised to do so. I believe it is a disgrace to the social security system that the presumption of guilt by association deprived of their invalid pensions so many people who had spent their working lives in Australia-a reason which, incidentally, precludes them from qualifying for contributory pensions in Greece. The fact that so many pensioners here have had their pensions reinstated is proof of the inadequacy of the medical examinations which were conducted in Athens. In spite of the efforts of the Government and Mr Lanigan in particular to dismiss these people from Australia's responsibility and the Australian consciousness, the ill and the penniless ex-pensioners in Greece remain with their problems. </PARA>
<PARA> This whole affair has been remarkable for the Government's silence. The Government has made no statements about what is going on. Only by raising the matter in Parliament, asking questions and taking note of the representations from Greek social workers and doctors, have we been able to piece together some pattern of what happened to those 138 people in Greece who were caught up in what might well be considered a racist purge. I have no doubt at all that racial prejudice strongly affected the actions of some of those Government principals in the affair. The media at the time blasted 'Greek cheats'. This was orchestrated by the Commonwealth Police and some sections of the Department of Social Security which, in fact, invited sections of the Press to accompany them in their dawn raids. There is no way that the Australian Government would have acted at long distance as judge, jury and executioner to remove the only incomes from 138 people if those people had been Anglo-Saxon overseas pensioners and families. The New Year's message that year from the then Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs was a remarkable statement and a remarkable example of hypocritical insensitivity. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> My special thoughts go to the Australian Greek community in Sydney, which has felt badly let down through the publicity given to certain social security matters. </PARA>
<PARA> As one of Australia's oldest and proudest communities you have, I know, been deeply hurt. I ask you, however, to continue to walk with pride in yourselves in an innate sense of fair play which is one of the contributions of your new homeland. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that that fair play was missing when the capricious mass cancellation of pensions took place in Greece and Australia. These people lost their only means of livelihood and also shared the cloud which hung over all those members of the Greek community who were suspect because they were ill, had attended some of the accused Greek-speaking doctors, had needed pensions and were of Greek origin. The matter has now been sent to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) by the Greek-Australian Pensioners Association in Greece. I ask Senator Chaney to discuss this continuing injustice with the Prime Minister and to prove his determination of which he spoke in the Senate two weeks ago when he spoke of his determination to have the Department of Social Security deal with all Australians on an equal basis. Many of these people are Australian citizens. I will give some examples of their experiences. The examples are all documented and will be made available. </PARA>
<PARA> The first case relates to a man with Australian citizenship who, after 13 years work in Australia, suffered deteriorating health and in 1968 was recommended-by non-accused doctors included-for an invalid pension. He left for Greece, as he was entitled to do under our law, having been assured that his pension would not be affected. His pension was stopped in March 1978. He had two medical interviews in Athens, but not examinations. He borrowed money from his wife's family to support his immediate family. He returned to Australia in 1979 and his pension was restored on medical grounds. He has asked for but has not received a reimbursement of fares so that he can pay back his wife's family. </PARA>
<PARA> The second case involves an Australian citizen who worked for 11 years in the building industry. When he became ill he saw several doctors, only two of whom were the accused doctors, and was granted an invalid pension. He took his family back to Greece in 1976. When his pension was cancelled in 1978 he borrowed money to support his family, returned to Australia, and was put on special benefit while he applied for an invalid pension. He cannot return to Greece with special benefit and is trying to borrow money to bring his family here again. </PARA>
<PARA> The third case involves an Australian citizen who came to Australia in 1954 and lived here for almost 25 years. He was given a pension on orthopaedic grounds in 1976; the pension was confirmed in 1977, but cancelled in 1978. His nephews have given him something to live on. He has returned to Australia, where three doctors have found him qualified for an invalid pension but, under the tougher pension guidelines, the Commonwealth Medical Officer found him ineligible. One doctor, who has never been accused of any conspiracy, has told Senator Chaney that it was one of the most tragic cases he had come across for some time. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> How any psychiatrist, whether they be Government or otherwise could possibly say that this man is fit to work would be beyond me . . . I feel that if this man's plight was to become known by the public there would be a general outcry against it. </PARA>
<PARA>Those were the words of the psychiatrist who examined the man. The fourth case relates to a man who, with his wife and two children, is still in Greece. He worked from 1960 to 1970, when he sustained a spinal injury. He could not get work because of his condition and eventually was given an invalid pension in 1974, which was confirmed in 1976, when he returned to Greece with his family. He was arrested in May 1980, imprisoned for a month and then transferred to the psychiatric section of the prison. His wife managed to raise bail but his condition has deteriorated and he depends on the charity of his relatives. Cases such as this are repeated on the records of the Greek-Australian Pensioners Association and on the records of Greek social workers in this country. I know there are members of the Government parties who take the view that we should not have portability of pensions. But the fact remains that portability is the law of this country. I certainly am in favour of it. I note that people who oppose portability of pensions only oppose it for migrants and do not oppose it for retired Governors-General or retired members of parliament who may choose to live in the Greek Islands. </PARA>

It is a blot on Australia's social security laws. It is a blot on our system of justice and it is a blot on our treatment of migrants generally. I think it is worth recalling that in the first days of the case those who were involved-both of them are now in very comfortable, private legal practices having obtained pensions from the Federal Government-made the claim that over 1,000 people would be found guilty. Only 20 people remain charged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that over several months, almost a year, a series of accusations were made by people in the Greek community. Questions resulting from those accusations were raised in this Parliament by me and others. Accusations were made such as that the people had their photographs taken with the word 'Greece' appearing underneath them, et cetera. All those accusations were initially denied. All those accusations were eventually found to be true and were demonstrated in this place to be true. We now have the same situation arising with these unfortunate invalid pensioners in Greece. A large proportion of those who have managed to get back to this country by borrowing money from relatives, friends or the Greek-Australian Pensioners Association in Athens have had their invalid pensions restored when they have come back to this country. Those who are left in Greece and who cannot afford to do this have no means open for appeal. I am at least thankful that the Minister for Social Security has said that he will reconsider whether appeals should be made available to these people. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime we must ensure that justice is done and that justice is seen to be done. We must ensure that Ministers do not come into this Parliament misled by stories from their public servants or from the Australian Federal Police. In the meantime those who it is obvious have not received justice should receive justice by having their pensions back-paid. Those who have come back to Australia and those who are trying to get back here to appeal-they certainly have good grounds for appeal on the evidence of the Greek medical practitioners-should be assisted to appeal or, at the very least, an independent medical tribunal and others should go to Greece to assist these people. Until this is done the $7m that has been spent on this case and the hundreds of thousands of dollars which have been given to people like Mr Rofe in payment for their previous services will remain a blot on the system of justice and on this Parliament. Until that sort of recompense is made I and others in this place will be putting the case of these unfortunate people. </PARA>

<PARA> I rise to speak on the motion for the first reading of three Bills affecting the apple and pear industry. I do this because it gives me a far wider opportunity to discuss all the ramifications associated with fruit growers, not only in Tasmania but also throughout the whole of Australia. On 10 March in this chamber we were discussing matters affecting the dried fruits industry and the Apple and Pear Corporation Amendment Bill. I recall that on that occasion my colleague on the other side of the chamber, Senator McLaren, put forth the view that there was a need for his own State of South Australia and for Queensland to have representatives on the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation. One of the Bills now before us, the Apple and Pear Corporation Amendment Bill, actually seeks to do this. It increases the number of members from four to six. I think that change was requested by members of the apple and pear growers association. The other Bill deals with changes to the rates of levy which are set by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The third Bill, the Apple and Pear Export Charge Amendment Bill, deals with three matters: It increases the maximum rate of the export charge per box. It also uses the weight factor to convert fruit not packed in boxes to a box equivalent and makes modifications in that regard. The third part affects regulations. I refer to an article appearing in the Age of Monday, 12 October under the heading 'Fruitgrowers hit by canning crisis'. Almost daily in the Tasmanian Press we read of the crises faced by the Tasmanian apple and pear growers. From reading the Age we notice that the fruit growers in the State of Victoria are having an equally disastrous time. Paul Chadwick's article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Australian fruitgrowers plan to destroy 30,000 tonnes of produce and almost 2,000 hectares of orchards because the canning industry is facing economic strife. </PARA>
<PARA>These are quite horrendous sorts of figures. The article goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Up to 100 of Victoria's 600 growers could be ruined, and one of the State's three canneries would be in 'diabolical trouble' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Two reasons are put forward. One is the worsening of the export market which has been affected by actions of the European Economic Community. The other is the revaluation of the Australian dollar relative to the currencies of many West European countries. In terms of employment opportunities, in Victoria this situation will deprive a large number of seasonal workers of employment. Paul Chadwick states:</PARA>
<PARA> A large proportion of the industry's 8,000 to 10,000 seasonal jobs and 2,000 permanent jobs could be lost, . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is indeed a tragedy for Victoria and also for Tasmania. I mentioned earlier that one of the amendments seeks to increase the membership of the Apple and Pear Corporation from four members to six members. My initial reaction to this change was that it was not and should never be the purpose of the Corporation to be a gathering of States. I believe the Corporation was designed to help apple and pear growers. Previously the States of Queensland and South Australia did not have a member on the Corporation. Through very intense lobbying this legislation has now been put forward whereby these States, which are small producers, can now have a place on the Apple and Pear Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators also that my own State of Tasmania exports 67 per cent of apples to what are known as the at-risk markets. Accordingly, the apple industry makes a pretty important contribution to the Tasmanian economy, particularly to areas such as the Huon Valley where the apple and pear industry is particularly significant. I was rather concerned some time ago when the Bureau of Transport Economics came down with some recommendations in relation to the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme. The changes it recommended could have jeopardised the marketing opportunity of some of the Huon Valley orchardists to send fruit to Sydney. I hope that the Government will not take up those recommendations of the Bureau of Transport Economics because that would certainly worsen the plight of those Huon orchardists. On the other hand, the Bureau's recommendations could possibly assist northern growers in marketing their fruit on the mainland. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems faced by the apple and pear growers is the exchange rate movements that have occurred. Bearing in mind that we are dealing with traditional markets in western Europe, I shall refer to some of these exchange movements. In the last 12 months the exchange rate has moved up about 34 per cent, revalued, in relation to the West German mark, about 26 per cent to 27 per cent in relation to the pound sterling and 39 per cent in relation to the French franc. It is no wonder that the apple producers who send their fruit in advance to these at-risk markets suddenly find themselves in a dilemma when the Australian dollar appreciates or revalues to the extent of the figures I have just mentioned. It is no wonder that the French have cut back their purchases, certainly of sheepskins, because of the 39 per cent revaluation. It has not only cut out the profit but also has extended into a large element of the cost. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe if our Government wishes to encourage people to move into exports there must be some recognition of or some compensation for these extreme upward price movements. However, the cynics may well ask whether, on the other hand, Australians are benefiting from the cheaper goods that should come in from these countries. Let us look at the facts. Have the prices of Mercedes-Benz cars cheapened in Australia? No, these companies charge what the market will bear. This is one of the problems we will face if we dismantle the Australian car industry. I give another example. Australia carries out no assembly or manufacture of motorcycles. On a comparative basis the prices of motorcycles in the United States are hundreds of dollars less than they are in Australia. That indicates that these overseas conglomerates tend to charge what the local market will bear. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the European situation. One might say we could get in goods a lot cheaper from Europe. Perhaps we could if they were bought off the shelf but if any extensive manufacture or time lag is required these overseas suppliers become rather hesitant because when there are such movements there is a fear that the exchange rate might move back again and they too will get caught. So violent movements in exchange rates are not helping either the exporters from Australia or the importers overseas unless the items can be purchased readily off the shelf. I mention countries such as Germany, the traditional export markets to which we send fruit, because we are not exporting to markets which are known to be highly volatile, such as some of the countries of South America where governments come and go with great rapidity, inflation is rampant and exchange movements are rife. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the point: If our Government wishes to encourage people to move into exports it will have to do something dramatic soon because I think there will be a trade deficit-that is, imports will exceed exports-of something in the order of $6.5 billion. Some people-apart from the traditional miners and sheep, cattle and wool producers-are moving out of exports in a fairly big way. Many who are in an area such as the exporting of fruit play a significant part in the overall export scheme of things. If these sorts of people are seen to be losing all along the line they will rapidly move out of the exporting field. The culmination of all these sorts of decisions will result in further problems in our overall export performance. So the exchange rate movement is significant and I contend the Government must take some responsibility in the setting of its policy to look at exchange rate movements and somehow to take up these severe losses, because they are quite substantial and can wipe out an industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look back into history at the funding of the Apple and Pear Growers Association. This has now become quite a vexed question for growers. For example, when the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation was set up in 1975 the then Minister for Primary Industry-a Tasmanian, Senator Wriedt-asked the Association for support in introducing the changes. The old board, as it then existed in 1975, was purely for exports and was funded by a levy on exports. Honourable senators will notice that the new Corporation has six major functions; the first three are related to export and the others are related to domestic matters. The new Corporation, which was to cover exports and domestic matters as well as processing, was to be funded by a levy on all apples and pears produced-the emphasis being on the word 'produced'. The Minister indicated that the Association must be a strong and active mouthpiece of the industry with direct access to all Australian growers. I am emphasising the growers' point of view. The Association is made up of six members-from the Growers Association or its equivalent in each State- and is administered by an executive comprising the President and one executive member from each State. Membership fees are set at $1,250 per annum, which pays for executive sitting fees for five two-day meetings per annum. When the Corporation was set up the Federal Government instructed the Corporation to allocate $53m for the Association to set up its own office and its own secretariat. However, with the change of government the Association was told that funding from the Corporation levy would be reduced. The growers then found themselves in a dilemma. The present Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) has instructed the Association that funding must finish in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that Association members have looked to many alternative schemes of income. They have looked at operating an insurance scheme but State grower bodies are already doing this and it would cut across their incomes. They have looked at increasing the membership fees to, say, $7,000 per State and they have also looked at voluntary grower contributions. It would not be practical to collect such contributions in the current climate of the apple industry. The Corporation and the State grower bodies all support full funding coming from the Corporation levy. The growers know of no grower anywhere in Australia who has publicly opposed that principle. There is some concern because the Minister is looking to the growers to become self-sufficient. I have taken up this matter with the Minister and although he has indicated this general intention, he has said there is no time limit within which this self-sufficiency is to be achieved. There is no Budget allocation for the 1982 calendar year and of course this is a matter of concern to the growers. Funding is generally considered at the time of the Budget and according to the Minister there is no specific suggestion that funding will be discontinued in the present year. I think in the present uncertainty of the apple industry there is a need for the Minister to provide some assurance to the Growers Association in relation to its own funding problems. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two distinct and difficult areas in Tasmania. One is the interstate market and the other is the export market. If growers en masse move out of exports their produce must inevitably flood onto the Australian market, which will hurt growers in the rest of Australia. I think we have to recognise that there should be a limit to the number of bushels that can be sent interstate. It is well recognised that mainland crops vary significantly, and Tasmania's traditional role is to maintain sufficient production to fill the gap in the Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the export market, because the domestic market is limited the surplus must be exported. Generally, more exports are generated in years when the domestic market is flooded. At the moment there is an anticipated loss to the Tasmanian Apple and Pear Marketing Authority, and this is before taking into account government stabilisation assistance of a Commonwealth and State nature of about $21,000 for each grower. When we take into account all the Federal and State subsidies, TAMA is still $2,800,000 in arrears, or $8,000 per grower. This is a substantial amount, and it will be debited to next year's growers' account. I take the opportunity of quoting from a letter to growers by Mr E. A. N. Beaumont, the Chairman of the Tasmanian Apple and Pear Marketing Authority. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> We have recently completed an estimated net F.O.B. return by variety for fruits sold at risk to the United Kingdom, the Continent and Scandinavia and also estimated the return of other exporting States, which indicates that after Government Stabilisation, Underwriting and Supplementary Assistance there will still be a debit balance in TAMA books amounting to about $2,800,000, or on average approximately $1.80 per carton. That is to say TAMA calculates that export realisations together with Government subvention payments will not cover the Advances made to growers by TAMA to the tune of about $2,800,000. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> As things stand at present this is a debt against growers accounts. </PARA>
<PARA>Growers have reacted in this manner. Some are prepared to test their legal arm and pull out of TAMA. Others believe that the State Government and the Federal Government should offer some support. It is well known that the State Government guarantees TAMA and as things stand TAMA must look in some way to recovering this money. The growers are naturally very unhappy about the situation and the extent of the loss. There is the further problem that Tasmanian growers are now seeking a poll in an attempt to review what is known as the compulsory crop insurance scheme, because of the lack of cash flow and because of their high costs and the difficulties that have occurred in the export market. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators that on 10 March, when we were discussing the previous amending Bills, I expressed concern at the underwriting scheme which provided a maximum of 95 per cent over a four-year average. I also expressed concern about the problem of introducing this type of underwriting scheme into the apple industry because of the long time it takes to bring crops into production. I suggested that there should be indexation of about 10 per cent, 15 per cent or 20 per cent. I notice from the large number of letters I have received from growers that they supported that concept, but they would have preferred to stick with the old stabilisation scheme. The Government actually moved in relation to this legislation by largely adopting the Industries Assistance Commission recommendations, which cut right across the wishes of the growers and of the Apple and Pear Corporation. I thought that was a disastrous situation. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, after representations to the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon), to his credit he said that he would review, or look at-that might be a better way of putting it-the operations of the new scheme, but he wanted time to see how it worked out. He has had time. The results have been quite disastrous and there have been substantial losses. I therefore appeal to him to act expeditiously and to restore some confidence to the low morale in the apple and pear industry at present. As I said, to Mr Nixon's credit he has undertaken in late October or early November to look at the position in relation to orchardists. I hope that, in conjunction with the Tasmanian Government, some sort of scheme can be worked out which will give a degree of equity to growers. The $2,800,000 loss is about equivalent to the revaluation of the Australian dollar. People who are exporting in good faith suddenly find that because of matters beyond their control in traditional and not new markets, this loss has been forced upon them they believe as a result of the effective revaluation of the Australian dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that something must be done to overcome this problem. One plan that was put forward to growers was that TAMA should undertake responsibility not only for the marketing of export fruit but also for fruit sold on the domestic market and for fruit used in processing. The growers are not particularly happy about that proposition. I acknowledge that TAMA is doing a good job in very difficult and extenuating circumstances. I quote from an article in the Agribusiness Executive of September 1981. The author was interviewing John Elliott of Henry Jones Ltd in relation to government-run bodies, and he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . he does not believe that government run bodies can market agribusiness products efficiently throughout the world. This is because they do not have the incentive and they are also subject to the political infighting of various people on boards. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Elliott said:</PARA>
<PARA> My experience is that commodity boards are certainly not maximising income to growers. </PARA>
<PARA>The article went on:</PARA>
<PARA>For example, the Australian apple industry slipped back badly because we allowed the quality of marketing to decline. </PARA>
<PARA> John Elliott says that from his experience of sitting on the board of the Apple and Pear Corporation and the Canned Fruits Board. </PARA>
<PARA>There we have a top Australian executive, the head of Henry Jones, coming out against government-run apple and other marketing authority boards. It is all very well to say: 'All right, engage in tree pull schemes and change the variety of apples to meet new markets', but it is not quite as easy as that. A sheep farmer can possibly sell his sheep and move into wheat or go from wheat back into sheep without too much dislocation. But when one considers that it takes something like six years to bring a tree into production and something like 18 years before a tree pays for itself, when an orchardist moves into or out of fruit growing it represents a pretty dramatic change in his lifestyle. The acreage an orchardist has is generally insufficient to enable a living income to be derived if he goes to an alternative such as sheep, goats, beef or even dairy cattle. He is in something of a dilemma. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at my own district of West Tamar and at the estuary there. One leading grower, Don Wright, is grubbing out some orchard this year. Inquiries show that six of the 60 northern growers will go out of business this year alone. That represents a decrease of 10 per cent in just one area, which has already seen a tremendous slide out of the apple industry. On a State-wide basis, more than 20 growers will lose their businesses. I think this is a rather sorry situation which does not reflect particularly well on either State or Federal governments. </PARA>
<PARA> More than 300 acres of orchards in Tasmania will be pulled up this year. Therefore, unless something is done the effect will be fairly dramatic. Unless taxpayers generally foot the $2.6 to $2.8m bill the apple industry will be in for major problems. I appeal to Mr Nixon to look at this underwriting scheme. I ask the Government to look at the effect that violent movements in exchange rates are having on this industry. Although there is new emphasis on resource booms we must bear in mind that some of the traditional industries are suffering. One of the principal sufferers is the fruit industry. We are told that if we move into resource based industries the nation will be better off and our living standards will rise. But in the interim some of the traditional industries such as the fruit industry are really going to suffer. People who have put a lifetime of effort into the fruit industry will not only leave the industry but lose their whole business because their losses are so substantial. </PARA>
<PARA> I further appeal to the Minister to review the legislation that was dealt with earlier this year in relation to the underwriting scheme, which is inadequate. If we persist with this scheme at least let us introduce some degree of indexation. We should at least acknowledge the problems that one sector of the Australian economy is having in resource development. I refer particularly to the plight of apple and pear producers. Unless something is done the situation in Tasmania will spread to other States. As I have mentioned, 67 per cent of exports which are at risk come from Tasmania. Tasmanian fruit that is not exported will be diverted to the mainland market. Earlier I mentioned the problems of the canning industry in Victoria. The State governments will face major problems in this area. The Federal Government has a responsibility to do something to assist these people because some of the problems are outside of their control and some, I believe, can be related to the resources boom. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to use the opportunity tonight in speaking on the first reading of a money Bill to make some remarks about the recent State elections in my State of New South Wales and in particular the campaign in the electorate of Manly-a campaign already referred to by one of my colleagues on 24 September. On 18 September 1980-that is over 12 months ago-I replied to an attack by an ex-senator on certain members of the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales. I said this concerning the electorate of Manly:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He has won the preselection--</PARA>
<PARA>I was referring to Mr Meers, who had recently won preselection for Manly--</PARA>
<PARA>and I am just giving the Senate notice tonight that he is not going to win the State seat of Manly because he will be like the man that the Liberal Party imported once before, Mr Barton Higgs, who was the Mayor of North Sydney. Of course, Mr Douglas Darby, who was a legend in Manly, was able to defeat him. The people of Manly will not accept a second choice, and they will not accept a person who does not live in the Manly electorate. </PARA>
<PARA>When I said the people of Manly would not accept a second choice, I was referring to the fact that Mr Meers had already sought preselection for the State seat of Willoughby and had been defeated. My claim in that speech was proved to be correct as the final figures for the electorate of Manly are: Stewart, ALP 14,600; Meers, Liberal, 13,891. That is a majority of 709 for the Labor candidate after the distribution of preferences. </PARA>
<PARA> In passing I must refer briefly to the result in Willoughby. In 1978 the Labor Party candidate in Willoughby received 37 per cent of the vote. A former Liberal Minister, who had lost his preselection for the seat, stood as an independent and polled 15 per cent of the vote, and directed his preferences to the Labor Party, with the result that the Labor Party won the seat of Willoughby by approximately 400 votes. As honourable senators can see by those figures, Willoughby was considered a blue ribbon seat. However, the winning of the seat by the Labor Party was one of the great upsets in New South Wales political history. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very interesting to look at the 1981 result in Willoughby. There was a boundary redistribution between 1978 and 1981 and as a result the Labor party proportion of the vote was expected to drop by 3 per cent. In the 1981 election, Mr Eddie Britt, the Labor Party member for Willoughby, received 46.5 per cent of the vote. This was a remarkable achievement when one realises that he not only held all of the Labor vote from 1978 but also held practically all of the Independent Liberal vote recorded by the former Liberal Minister in 1978. This result is a tribute to the dedication and hard work that was put in by Eddie Britt in his three years as the ALP member for a blue ribbon Liberal seat. I believe that this achievement deserves to be put on record. In fact, I believe that if the election for that seat had been held on the 1978 boundaries the result would have been a cliff hanger. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to refer to the scurrilous campaign that was waged by the Liberal Party in the Manly electorate. The Liberal candidate said in May of this year in an interview reported in the Sydney Morning Herald that his campaign would cost $45,000. The Labor Party campaign in 1978, when we won the seat, cost $3,449. Because of public funding a considerable amount was spent this time-much more than what we spent in 1978. However, when one considers how much was spent by the Liberal Party we can see that this was probably the most unequal campaign in terms of spending in any electorate in New South Wales. There have been estimates that the Liberal Party and the Liberal Party candidate spent in excess of $100,000. If one takes into account the fact that they had two permanent offices in two shopping centres, that they had permanent staff and that they had the use of a number of trucks and cars and even a plane on election day, one would realise that that sort of campaign does not come cheaply and that perhaps somewhere between $45,000, as was claimed, and $100,000 was the cost of the Liberal Party campaign in that seat. It was certainly the most expensive campaign that I have ever seen at a State level in my experience as a party official or as a member of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the interesting things about this campaign is, of course, that the Liberal Party refused to accept public funding, which was introduced for the first time by the New South Wales Labor Government. I suppose if one is spending $45,000 as a minimum one does not have to worry too much about public funding. However, later in the campaign, obviously when the Liberal candidate was worried about the likely outcome of the result, every household in the electorate, and at least one person on the roll in every house in the electorate, received a letter from the Honourable Michael MacKellar, the Minister for Health, who happens to be the Federal member for the electorate of Warringah, which includes the State seat of Manly. Of course, that letter was sent out on his official stationery and in parliamentary envelopes. Of course he was asking the electors of Manly to support the candidature of Mr Meers. Really, is this not just public funding? I do not object to public funding but it is a good example of hypocrisy when one campaigns openly against public funding and one takes it in another form through the back door. One can only imagine how much this exercise cost the taxpayers. The letter was quite obviously a mistake. Unfortunately for the Liberal Party the Minister for Health at the time was in the process of presiding over the demise of Medibank and was seen by many people as being responsible for the increase in the costs of health care. I think this fact was not missed by a large number of electors in Manly who received the letter. </PARA>
<PARA> Another smear used in the campaign was when the Liberal candidate who was under attack because of tactics of campaign workers, said in an article in the Manly Daily that there was a slogan 'vote early and often' used by the Labor Party which he wanted to stop. In fact, he was saying that there was going to be double voting in the Manly electorate and this was going to be carried out by the Labor Party. The article was entitled 'Liberal doorknock sparks complaints: Campaign workers'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Questions asked by Liberal campaign workers in the Manly electorate are an invasion of privacy, irate residents claim. </PARA>
<PARA> Several residents contacted Warringah Shire Council and the Manly Daily to complain about the electoral roll being checked by door-knockers. </PARA>
<PARA> 'They wanted to know if I was dead or alive-and who I was going to vote for', one man said. </PARA>
<PARA> 'The man, who said he was a Liberal voter but would not give his name, claimed the doorknocker was 'about 14-years-old' and asked questions about his occupation and voting habits, and those of his neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA> 'As far is I am concerned updating the electoral roll is the job of the Commonwealth Electoral Office and who I vote for is my business,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA>Later on in the article the Liberal candidate is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> It is important that we know who is entitled to vote. There is a slogan, 'vote early and often', used by the Labor Party and we want to stop this. </PARA>
<PARA> Scrutineers need to know who is entitled to vote. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Another breach of the Electoral Act was the use of a plane on election day towing a banner supporting the Liberal candidate. Again the police were needed. They had to intervene to stop this blatant breach of the Act. But I think the worst breach which occurred was on polling day itself when Liberal Party scrutineers inside the polling booth approached and spoke to voters, which I regard as a serious breach of the Electoral Act. This occurred repeatedly during the day, despite the efforts of the State electoral officer in Manly who attempted to stop them. What was happening was that Liberal Party scrutineers were standing close to where people were coming up to vote. If they found out that those people were voting outside their subdivision, they then offered-I said spoke to them which was a clear breach of the Act-to drive them to their correct polling booth where in fact they could vote. If some honourable senators opposite think that this is something which has been passed on to me by Labor Party campaign workers I point out that in fact I was informed of this by a State electoral officer in another neighboring electorate as I was doing my rounds on the day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another section of the scurrilious campaign which certainly deserves comment was the campaign organised by the so-called pro-life candidate who directed her second preference votes to the Liberal candidate, Mr Meers. The candidate, Miss Langworthy, was sponsored by Right to Life Australia, whose chairman is Mrs Tighe, of Victoria. It is interesting to note that the New South Wales Right to Life group had nothing to do with the campaign and did not endorse this candidate. I would be interested to know who talked her into running and whether in fact the Labor candidate, Mr Stewart, was even asked by the organisation for his comments on the right to life issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The tactics used by the pro-life group completely backfired, as is shown by two articles in the Manly Daily. The first article was entitled 'Pro-life votes to favor Meers'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Independent Pro-life candidate for the State seat of Manly, Miss Patti Langworthy, will direct her second preference votes to the Liberal candidate, Mr Nelson Meers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The end result of that campaign was that the Labor candidate received more preferences from the Pro-Life candidate than did the Liberals. In fact, when the preferences of the Pro-life candidate were distributed, the Labor Party gained 24 votes on the overall total, and she had a total of in excess of 1,100, so even the people who supported the Pro-Life candidate saw through the campaign that the Liberals were running.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another scare tactic which was used by the Liberals was a quite deliberate and carefully set up fear campaign associated with public housing. The Liberal Party candidate said that slum type housing developments would take place in Manly if the Labor Government was returned to office. My colleague, Senator Gietzelt, spoke at length on this matter earlier and in detail on 24 September. I will not repeat the number of points that he made, except to say that I think this campaing definitely influenced some voters in particular sections of the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> The present situation is that there has been a rather abortive court case over whether ticks or crosses should be counted as a valid vote. As honourable senators would realise, optional preferential voting was introduced into New South Wales by the Labor Government and appropriate alterations were made to the Electoral Act. They were made to ensure that the votes of electors who were making a clear voting intention would be counted. That is surely a more democratic situation than having votes declared informal on a technicality. The judge who heard the case ruled that it was not within his jurisdiction and that any further complaints should go to the Court of Disputed Returns. But it is rather strange, when one looks at the tactics of the State Liberal Party, to know why it even took this court case. It took it in only three seats, Bligh, Manly and North Shore. Apparently the reason why it took the court case was that it believed the Labor candidates had more ticks and crosses than numerals, giving them the primary vote. In fact it was thought that if there was a recount and the ticks and crosses were ruled not to be valid the Labor Party would suffer. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that the scrutineers of both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party agreed upon was that regardless of the outcome of the court case it would not make any difference in the two seats of Bligh and Manly. Certainly it would reduce the Labor majority, but it would not give the seats to the Liberals. If we follow the same line of reasoning, in the third seat of North Shore, where the Liberal candidate and the Liberal leader, Mr Bruce McDonald, has now lost his seat, the only thing that could possibly have happened was that the labor vote would have dropped. If that had happened, of course, it would have guaranteed that the Labor Party candidate went out, as that candidate did, and ensured that the independent beat Mr McDonald in the seat. It is no wonder that the Liberals in New South Wales are in disarray. The court case cost them thousands, and I just wonder who will be paying the costs. </PARA>

<PARA>COURT STOPS TICKS AND CROSSES VOTE COUNT</PARA>
<PARA>By Anne Flahvin</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party has obtained a Supreme Court order to stop the counting of votes in the State election in Manly. </PARA>
<PARA> Counting will not resume until after a court challenge by the Liberal Party, on the validity of votes marked with ticks and crosses rather than the number 1. </PARA>
<PARA> Counting has also been stopped in Bligh and North Shore for the same reason. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party will present its case in court on Tuesday. </PARA>
<PARA> The party believes it might be able to pick up a net five per cent of the vote if ticks and crosses are ruled invalid. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the election, the State Electoral Office issued a handbook to all returning officers telling them to accept ballot papers marked with ticks or crosses as valid. </PARA>
<PARA> The unsuccessful Liberal candidate for Wakehurst, Mr Phillip Wearne, said yesterday the Liberal Party believed Labor Party voters were more likely to cast informal votes under the system of nominating preferences. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What the Liberal candidate for Wakehurst was really saying was that he would like to maintain a system such as we already have for the Senate, a system which in New South Wales made one in every 10 votes informal. Now, of course, with the introduction of optional preferential voting in New South Wales, I believe the number of informal votes in the upper House, the equivalent of voting in the Senate where there are a lot of candidates, this time is under 4 per cent, as opposed to the 10 per cent who voted informally at the last Senate election. The campaign that was run in the seat of Manly by the Liberals was a disgrace and the people who organised it should now pack up their carpet-bags and go back to where they came from. The seat of Manly is still a Liberal voting electorate. One only has to look at the Federal figures to realise that. However, I believe Alan Stewart will continue to hold the seat while the Liberals run this sort of campaign on behalf of imported candidates. History has shown that the electors of Manly will always vote for a local man who looks after the problems of the electorate. History has shown it to be a unique seat which rewards the genuine, honest local member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion I should mention the campaign in the electorate of Wakehurst, the neighbouring electorate in which I live. I was involved in the campaign in that electorate. I must say that at least in this electorate the Liberals ran a clean, hard-fought, above-board campaign. In the seat of Wakehurst the sitting Labor member, Mr Tom Webster, achieved a remarkable victory. In 1978 he received the second largest swing in New South Wales, the largest swing being achieved by the Premier, Neville Wran. The swing that gave him the seat was approximately 15 per cent and there were many people in the Labor Party and in the community, including myself, who considered that it would be impossible to hold a swing of that order; that is, 15 per cent. Not only was the vote maintained but it was increased by approximately one per cent. The Labor vote in the electorate of Wakehurst is now just in excess of 57 per cent. Tom Webster won all but three of the polling booths in the seat of Wakehurst, including winning some for the first time ever. I compare that situation with the 1972 and 1974 Federal figures and the 1978 State figures. The final results in this electorate where I live were: Tom Webster ALP, 14,887; Australian Democrats, 837; Liberals, 11,191. The Labor Party received 56 per cent of the effective Australian Democrats preferences, that is, the preferences recorded by people completing the ballot paper from one to three. </PARA>
<PARA> The scene is now set for what I once considered to be impossible: The State seats of Manly and Wakehurst look like being held by the Labor Party for the third time in a row. In respect of the seat of Wakehurst, it is not now even listed in the marginal seat category. I believe it will remain a Labor seat as long as New South Wales has a Labor government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make use of this first reading motion on a money Bill to raise an issue which is important in many towns and cities throughout the country today, and that is the national day of protest on education. I wish to raise a series of matters dealing particularly with university education in Australia and I wish in particular to make reference to the University of Queensland. It is one of the major universities in this country and therefore can act as a representative university. I wish to detail the types of problems that the University of Queensland is facing and to show that those problems are the problems that all universities in this country are either facing now or will face in the very near future. I will run through a series of problems that university administration, staff and student unions find as their major problems at the present time and I will go on to give some detail in relation to the University of Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first issue obviously deals with the level of funding available to universities in this country. Here the problem is not only one of magnitude but also one of how this Budget has sought real changes in the way that the grants in the future will be administered. The major problem of course is the problem of supplementation. The Government now intends to estimate prospectively that a certain supplementation will be necessary for increases. Up to this time universities have been able to rely on the fact that any real increase that took place was covered by an increase in funds by way of supplementation. That guarantee has now been lost. Although almost all of the increases are beyond the control of universities themselves they will not now be covered by supplementation grants. If that is not enough, this Government has continued the absurdity of one-year funding. There must be no other multi-million dollar enterprise in any country such as ours which has to rely on one-year funding or even one-year planning. How any government, let alone a government committed to some notion of private enterprise, could continue with the absurdity of one-year funding and the costs that are thereby involved is beyond the understanding of anybody who knows anything about keeping a major enterprise alive and functioning efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA> The level of funding is in a parlous state. The 1980-81 capital funding was less than one-quarter of the 1974-75 funding and in this Budget it has been dropped yet again. The 1979 report of the Universities Council reported that at that time 12 per cent of all university buildings were in need of major renovation, that 5 per cent had become unsuitable for further use and that every university was able to submit to its appropriate organisation lists of essential capital developments. Those claims have not been taken up by the Government; they have not been met in this Budget. We are now confronted with what is rapidly becoming the norm in all universities: Overcrowded libraries, dangerous antiquated laboratories, draughty offices and fire traps for lecture halls-that in a country as wealthy as ours. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of equipment the situation is very much the same. Although the equipment grant was increased this year the situation is that the amount provided allows for less than 7 per cent of the equipment to be replaced each year. In other words, it allows an average depreciation life of 15 years for equipment in universities. The average life of such equipment in universities in countries comparable to our own is 10 years and the taxation laws for private enterprises in this country allow 7 1/2 years. So what the Government is expecting the universities to do is in fact to eke out from their meagre handout from the Government in terms of the equipment grant twice the life that is allowed under the taxation laws for everybody else in this country. There has not been any massive increase in equipment grants since 1974-75. Yet if one looks at the type of research base that is necessary one finds that obviously massive injections of funds for sophisticated equipment are necessary and are overdue by something like six years. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, in terms of general funding the 1980-81 funding was reduced by 10 per cent over the 1977-78 level. This year's Budget slices another 5 per cent off that. Therefore we are in for further staff cuts. Indeed, most universities have frozen all unadvertised positions. In other words, we are saying that when a staff position falls vacant in a university, at no matter what level, it will not be filled at the current time. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to that the staff situation has grown increasingly difficult over the last couple of years, to such an extent that we now have set in train one of the most difficult staff situations that any enterprise could face; that is, having an increasingly aging staff with no younger replacements. In the long term this will be disastrous. Of course, in the short term it adds to university costs because one of the elements within a university's funding, which very few people realise, is what is called by the unfelicitious phrase of incremental creep. In other words, each staff member gets a raise each additional year that he is in the university. If staff is not replaced and staff does not move from one university to another then total staff costs are much higher than would normally be expected. Incremental creep in universities indeed is one of the headaches that all vice chancellors and administrations have had to face in recent times. The prospect of that becoming greater each year is a terrifying element within any university budget because of the extremely large percentage in any university budget going to pay staff salaries. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably the situation is now that the Government is seeking in some form or another to suggest to universities some type of steady state. The only steady state we are getting in universities is a steady decline. I do not know whether that falls under the heading of a steady state. There are steady declines in all the major areas that I have mentioned. But the situation goes much further than that. The squeeze currently under way affects technicians and research assistants. These people are absolutely vital to the promotion and the continuity of any genuine research effort in our universities. Because many of these people, particularly the research assistants, are non-tenured staff they are the people who necessarily are being laid off as the first staff to go. Why I say 'necessarily' is that the universities would find it excessively difficult to face the problem of getting rid of tenured staff. Whether we like it or not and whether it is necessarily the correct move, those research assistants are the first people to go. Therefore, the research effort is affected in the work place which those people sustain from the inside. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already mentioned the lack of sophisticated equipment. The other major problem which is affecting more and more departments and one which is felt particularly acutely in the major universities is the problem of computer time. Anybody who has tried to operate on a university computer would know the type of log jam that people time and again run into. No matter how heavily the people in the university work on keeping the computer operating, users constantly have the computer crashing in the middle of working through a whole variety of problems. Indeed, in many universities the problem now is so acute that people would rather pay out of their own pockets to use outside computers simply to be able to get the job done and to get on with the task. Yet we all know that the computer is a vital element in any sophisticated research which is done in almost any department of any university in Australia. We do not have the elementary backing. It is as though in times gone past we failed to provide classrooms with blackboard and chalk. To fail to provide universities with adequate and sophisticated computers and adequate computer time is in fact to approach the whole notion of research in universities in a juvenile and almost criminal way. I will come to that element shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> The libraries are also feeling a terrible pinch. Indeed, the libraries are feeling the pinch in a number of ways, one of which I hope is currently under review in the House of Representatives; that is, the sales tax on books. Although libraries in universities are exempt from paying that sales tax the cost of books will necessarily rise because the sales tax affects other elements apart from simply the element of purchase. So the total cost to libraries will be greater although they do not have to pay that extra sales tax impost on top of the extra charges for books. Libraries have not been able to get the grant increases that are necessary to enable them to stay anywhere near the level of the increases in costs of books and, in particular, the increase in the cost of periodicals. The periodical element is one which people who do not make use of university libraries are probably unaware of. The vast bulk of costs in university libraries now goes on buying periodicals simply because the only way to remain current is with periodicals. One does not remain current in books any longer, generally because the publication of a book has a time lag of anywhere between four and six years. A periodical would have a time lag of between only six months and one and a half years. Anyone who wants to remain current remains current with periodicals. </PARA>
<PARA> For libraries to remain research libraries-presumably what we are attempting to provide in universities are research libraries-we have to spend heavily on periodicals. Most universities can no longer do that. They are now cutting back on a whole range of periodicals so those libraries are increasingly becoming inadequate. This is not only a short term problem; it is also a long term problem. It will not be possible at any time in the future to regain the position. I presume the Government is well aware of that. At no stage in the future will it be possible to resurrect a library which has become derelict in research material. The costs are so astronomical as to be totally impossible to meet. In fact there we are faced with the first long term slide that is setting in; that is in research efforts that can be made in libraries. </PARA>
<PARA> Post-graduate students will be affected and are currently being affected. A debate in this House within the next few weeks will be on fees. I do not intend to go into that at this point. There are two other elements of research other than that involving post-graduate students who are an excessively important element within the support of any research program within universities. One point concerns the Tertiary Education Commission grants which are falling every year as a percentage of total grants available to universities. The second concerns the Australian Research Grants Scheme. This has not kept pace in any way with the number of research workers. From 1966 to 1978 the staff in universities has doubled whereas the ARGS funds and also the funds available from the National Health and Medical Research Council scheme have not risen appreciably in that time-certainly not anywhere near in keeping with inflation. So we have had a rapid increase in staff, yet not a rapid increase in research funds to provide that staff with useful back-up facilities. It is all very well to gain highly qualified people in universities, but if it is not possible to provide them with backing it is not possible for them to work effectively and efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA> Increasing amounts of funds are now coming to universities from outside bodies. In most cases they are welcomed by universities, but the universities are keeping a very strict eye on them. I raise here the point that it is not possible to any large extent to replace the public funding of research by private funding, beyond that percentage to which it is already kept, without raising serious ethical and major research problems for universities. I raise only one element here to show the type of problem that overseas universities have run into and that our universities will run into if governments wind down, as they have in the last few years, the money that is devoted to research. Imagine a uranium mining company, for example, being at all interested in funding a scholarly work on Middle English epic poetry, funding a Marxist interpretation of Australian history or, what would be unthinkable, actually funding and furthering work on the lethal nature of low dose radiation. I do not imagine that uranium companies would be very interested in funding that type of research, which obviously is vital and necessary and must be covered by public funding. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to student numbers, the Government has admitted in the Budget Papers that there will be no real growth in the next few years. Indeed, it has suggested a real drop in university student numbers next year and that level remaining steady for the next few years. What an absurdity for a country such as ours, which is seeking to move into high technology, even to contemplate a drop in university numbers. </PARA>

<PARA> The Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowance, of course, is very interesting in relation to this subject. It has always been below the current poverty line. Currently it is 59.5 per cent of the Henderson poverty line figure. By next September, given the Government's own inflation predictions, it will be below 50 per cent of the poverty line figure. In other words, we expect those who are engaged in university studies-whom the Australian Democrats see as engaging in a worthwhile occupation for the country-to live on less than 50 per cent of the poverty line figure. Also, the number of those who receive TEAS allowances has been dropping since 1977. In that year there were 99,153, in 1978, 98,220, in 1979, 93,559, and in 1980, 91,356. In real terms, expenditure also has dropped every year since 1977. Presumably the Government says: 'We will cut out this fund. It is good for scholars to remain in the poverty to which they have traditionally become accustomed. It is better for their minds.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, probably it bespeaks a philosophy towards education that comes from the last century. The post-graduate, if we may single him out, is expected to live on a measly $4,620 in a time of rising inflation and extra sales taxes. Such a student, if he is typical, will be working between 60 and 80 hours a week-I would certainly have expected my post-graduate students to work that length of time-with very little recreational leave, because that is necessary if he is to get through his studies. He receives no sick leave, loadings, incremental salaries or additional support in regard to health costs. Let us not forget that the typical post-graduate student has some type of dependant. Such a situation means, of course, that currently we have, and increasingly will have, a shortage of doctoral degree students. That has led this year to a crisis for research; and to turn a crisis into an absolute catastrophe we have had the imposition of fees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to discuss other elements in relation to universities before passing on to the question of Queensland University in particular. I refer first to the closure of the engineering school at Deakin University which, from our point of view, is the first direct and open infringement of university autonomy in this country. It means that the Government is testing the water. It means that if the Government moves easily with this one and does not find terribly much backlash in the community it will be in a position to attack any other university course. That is the real point of the closure of the engineering school at Deakin. Any course which the Government does not like it can then move to close down. I would imagine that many university courses must be anathema to this particular conservative Government. It will probably be looking at them in years to come-in other words, suggesting to universities that it might be very well if they pulled money out of here and popped it into there. The universities will have to buckle on those demands if they buckle on this one. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very glad today to see the universities taking a stand on this matter and drawing an appropriate historical analogy. That analogy, of course, is the move that Hitler made. Those who might want to go back and re-read the history books will realise that the first moves made in Nazi Germany were against the universities-much earlier than Hitler showed his hand anywhere else-and the universities buckled. The universities were the first to go. Luckily, I believe, Australian universities may be a little grittier than that and will hold on. I do not think it is an exaggerated claim, and it is one which was raised today by the vice-chancellor of that university. </PARA>
<PARA> My next point concerns the centres of excellence. During the 1980 election campaign we found the Government taking up a comment made in the sixth report of the Tertiary Education Commission, which talked about centres of research concentration. We had a subtle renaming to centres of excellence, 'excellence' being a nice word. So we then had the Government dedicating itself to centres of research excellence. That indeed is a laudable proposition. Unfortunately, we then discovered who was going to be paying for them. They were to be paid for from reduced current and capital grants, so all higher education institutions had to foot the bill. Additional funds to set up these worthwhile initiatives did not go to the universities. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the shifting of funds to transition education may seem to be a long way from university education, I would like to show how I believe that it is linked directly to it. The guidelines of the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) in June 1981 spelt out the Government's aims in this fashion:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government wishes to accelerate the development of appropriate transition courses in secondary schools, with emphasis on basic changes in curricula relevant particularly to the needs of low achievers. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Government is setting about a unilateral attempt to change the direction of Australian public education and, in its own words, bring about 'a substantial shift of emphasis within schools'. So we see that little sleight of hand whereby $27m suddenly disappeared from the amounts that the States had and suddenly reappeared in the transition education area. The States have been confronted with receiving $27m less for their ordinary school expenditures. In other words, these programs were to be reduced in quality, at least in the public schools. The private schools have not been interfered with in the same way and are receiving increasingly generous financial support. Of course the private schools will continue and will be able to continue to do what all schools ought to be able to do-that is, provide preparation for those people who are able and who wish to undertake tertiary studies. I foresee that these current trends will continue and that we will have an elite entering universities. It will be a privileged elite, and an ever diminishing elite, given the figures that I have already cited. </PARA>
<PARA> Between 1974 and 1980 the proportion of school leavers proceeding straight to higher education dropped by nearly 20 per cent. The increase in numbers coming from private schools was dramatic. That is the state which exists in universities around the country. I approached the various departments at Queensland University for a comment about their research position. I wish briefly to summarise some of the replies because I think they give the flavour of what is going on in one university which is typical of all universities. The replies were from heads of departments. The reply which I received from the Chemistry Department was that it will not be able to keep abreast of new technology with other countries. The Classics Department will lose most of its promising post-graduate students and the Computer Science Department has lost one very good man and will lose another top man to overseas, where they can get money to pursue their research interests. A major project developing a micro-computer system is being scrapped. An amount of $550,000-that is a pittance in terms of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting-spread over six years would have allowed the Department to become self-sufficient in terms of research and would have enabled it to make money. This is an utter absurdity. A free enterprise operation of the University has been knocked on the head. </PARA>
<PARA> The Education Department has had to abandon its classroom management project-an incredibly important research project involving a large number of the staff of that department. According to the head of the Civil Engineering Department, the research capacity of that department has been severely affected because of high teaching loads. The Electrical Engineering Department has lost three top class post-graduate students to industry, which is able to pay two and a half times what the doctoral students are getting on their pittance. In the Mining and Metallurgical Department there is again a lack of post-graduate students for the same reason. In the English Department the research effort is being severely hampered by the harsh cutbacks in the library. The French Department is experiencing extensive delays in processing its research. The Geology and Minerology Department has experienced the destruction of a project supporting the only silicate oxygen extraction line operating in Australia. The Department's allocation went from $14,000 last year to nil this year. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Japanese Department, the Ph. D. and masters students have been severely affected. The Department believes that within two years there will be no students enrolled in post-graduate Asian studies. The Japanese Department of the Queensland University, in fact, is the leader in this country in Japanese studies and languages. In other words, we are supposed to be getting into Asia so let us stop learning about it! The same situation applies in the Occupational Therapy Department. All independent research projects have been scrapped and clinical training is also being threatened. The Philosophy Department's development of computer aided learning in formal logic is threatened. The Physics Department is not able to keep up and it will have to scrap some worthwhile projects. That is what the Department is looking at at the moment because, it says, 'something has to go'. In the Regional and Town Planning Department, research into the causes of decline in country towns is going. If ever we wanted a particular project, that is one. Planners are being trained by the Regional and Town Planning Department of the University of Queenland for the Third World. I would imagine that is something dear to the heart of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Social Work Department. The role of voluntary organisations in meeting social needs is to go. In the Veterinary Medicine Department the training of veterinarians is being affected. That is an incredibly important matter for our primary industry. What an extraordinary situation we have in this country when that type of quality research is being affected.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning, in response to a question asked by Senator Missen, I said that I would give consideration to his question and request within the question and respond at a later hour this day. I have done so. I must say that I believe the question is not in order because it does not fall within the terms of Standing Order 98A, which governs the putting of questions to chairmen of committees. That Standing Order provides that questions must relate to activities of the committees. Standing committees of the Senate may inquire only into such matters as are referred to them by the Senate. A question to such a committee must, therefore, relate to the activities of the committee in relation to some matter which the Senate has referred to that committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator's question purported to ask the chairman whether the Committee would inquire into a certain matter. The chairman cannot answer in relation to the activities of his committee in respect of a matter which the Senate has not referred to the committee. If Senator Missen wishes the Senate to refer to a particular committee a matter into which it is not at present empowered to inquire, the proper course is for him to give notice of a motion for that purpose. He cannot ask the chairman for his knowledge of a matter or whether the committee will inquire into a matter when the Senate has not yet referred that matter to the committee. Therefore, as I said earlier, I believe the question is out of order.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I wish to raise a matter which is of great importance in far north Queensland. I speak of the television service in that area. Those people in the capital cities and the provincial cities often take television services for granted. In fact, in some of our capital cities we have five channels; in other capital cities we have four channels. In Canberra, our national capital, we have two channels, but that is far better than one being available in many parts of Queensland and far better than none in other parts of Queensland. I speak specifically of the television service for Thursday Island which, I understand, is scheduled for completion in December. I certainly hope that it will be completed in December. I have in mind the translator promised for the Airlie Beach area in 1975. The local residents are still waiting for the translator in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The principal matter of concern in relation to Thursday Island is that I have had some information passed on to me from Mr Robert Scott, normally known as Bob Scott, who is the member for the State seat of Cook in far north Queensland. Cook is the northernmost seat in Queensland and takes in Thursday Island and other islands in Torres Strait, as well as some areas on the mainland. Mr Scott has informed me that he had heard that the Thursday Island service will have an effective range of reception of only about 10 kilometres. This would mean that Thursday Island would enjoy a long overdue television service. But if a 10 kilometre radius is, in fact, the effective range of the service, the reception will be limited to Thursday Island and islands which are very close to Thursday Island. More importantly, several communities in the Torres Strait area will not have a television service. As well, the community of Bamaga on the very tip of mainland Australia will be beyond the range of Thursday Island television facilities. Bamaga residents and other residents in the Torres Strait area rightly expected that they would benefit from the Thursday Island television translator. They and Mr Scott are concerned about suggestions that they will miss out on a facility that many Australians take for granted. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I am not sure whether this information is correct and that is the reason I am bringing it before the Senate tonight. I would like to pose certain questions about this service. The first question is: Will the television service be limited to Thursday Island and nearby surroundings? Secondly, if it is not available to many Torres Strait communities and Bamaga, when will it be likely to become available to those communities? Thirdly, can anything be done at this stage to boost the power of the television signal; that is, if the original information given to me is correct, namely that there will be only a 10 kilometre effective reception range? If nothing can be done to boost the power of the television signal, what are the technical reasons for the inability to do so? I trust that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) will be able to provide me with some advice I can pass on to Mr Scott and the community leaders in this area of far north Queensland.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I appreciate Senator Colston's interest in this quite magnificent area of Australia. Like him I find Bamaga a magnificent community to visit and its people interesting to talk to. I do not know his colleague, Mr Robert Scott. I do know the person whom Robert Scott defeated, and that is Evelyn Scott who was our candidate in that election and who, in fact, is one of our officers in Aboriginal Hostels Ltd. She is an Aboriginal officer who is one of the best people with whom I have had the privilege of working. I take it that the Queensland Parliament's loss was my gain owing to the fact that she remains with Aboriginal Hostels Ltd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have some information on the three questions raised by Senator Colston. The first question asked: Will television services be limited to Thursday Island and nearby surroundings? I am advised that the answer to that question is yes, they will be so limited. The Thursday Island television service which is expected to commence operation in December is part of the remote area television program. The RATV program is designed to provide low power and thus low coverage service to isolated towns and limited surrounding areas. In this way the overall population coverage throughout Australia will be maximised within the funds available. It is a matter of how much coverage we can get with the amount of money we have to spend. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Colston's second question was: If a television service will not be available to a number of Torres Strait communities and the community of Bamaga on the tip of Cape York Peninsula, when is it likely that those communities will have a television service? I am advised that extension of the service to other Torres Strait communities, including the top of Cape York Peninsula, is not planned at this stage due to the limited availability of funds and resources. It may well prove that the Australian national satellite to be operational by the mid-1980s will be the most appropriate way for the Government to provide television services to communities in this area. Local communities may, however, prefer to fund privately installations of their own.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Colston's third question asked whether anything could be done at this stage to boost the power of the television signal and, if that could not be done, what technical reasons there were for the inability so to do. I am advised that any practicable increase in power of the Thursday Island RATV transmitter would not provide a service to established communities on Cape York Peninsula due to the distance involved. I take it that there is a technical difficulty in boosting across the distances, even between those communities. That is all the information I have been able to obtain. I am not sure whether it completely resolves Senator Colston's concerns. If not, if he is able to make known to me any other questions I will pass those to the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) and see whether I can obtain further information for the honourable senator. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>
