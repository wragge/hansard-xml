<PARA> That we request that the Government take immediate steps to relieve us of the burden of increasing mortgage costs resulting from increasing home loan interest rates.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth, do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Note that legislation establishing plant breeders' rights in other countries has had serious adverse effects, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Virtual monopoly control of seed production has passed into the hands of a few large international corporations seeking to profit from the exclusive rights over plant genetic materials created by such legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The varieties of seeds available have been restricted mainly to hybrids which will not reproduce truly and will not grow without the aid of artificial fertilizers and pesticides, thus maximising corporate profits without regard for the interests of growers and consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The genetic diversity of crops has been eroded, rendering them vulnerable to disease and other environmental threats.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Recognize that maintenance of the genetic diversity of plant varieties is crucial to the continued well-being of the Australian Nation, and take all necessary steps to preserve and promote such genetic diversity as a public resource and to prevent exclusive control over plant genetic materials from falling into private hands.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Defend the vital interests of Australian farmers and gardeners, independent Australian seed companies and their employees, and consumers of Australian farm and garden produce, by rejecting any proposal to legislate for the establishment of plant breeders' rights in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The decision by the Australia Council to discontinue the General Grant of $20,000 (which is in the nature of recurrent funding) to La Boite Theatre, Brisbane, will jeopardise the continued viability of the theatre, and in particular, the Main House Theatre; Adult Theatre Workshops; Youth Theatre activities and the existence of the professional core of the theatre.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The decision has been taken without sufficient consultation and without giving sufficient notice to La Boite Administration.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The absence of Federal Government funding will mean the loss to Brisbane of genuine community-oriented and community-based projects and of the regular presentation of Australian plays.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senate will request the Government to cause the Theatre Board's General Grant of $20,000 to La Boite Theatre to be reinstated without delay.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) That the Minatome uranium deposit at Ben Lomond, near Charters Towers, exists within hydrologically unstable ground in a region of intense seasonal rainfall and is generally regarded as uneconomical and unsafe.</PARA>

<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senate carefully weigh the limited economic benefit to a 100 per cent French-owned company against the health of a large number of Australian citizens and a significant section of our grazing industry and refuse to allow the granting of export licenses for any uranium products from the Ben Lomond mine.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 7 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That on the 10th December 1948, the general Assembly of the United Nations adopted and proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which declares that, 'Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration . . .' (Article 2) that 'Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives . . . The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or equivalent free voting procedures'. (Article 21 (1) and (3).)</PARA>
<PARA> Elections for senators meet all requirements except one. Senators are elected periodically, by secret ballot, with universal franchise, and the quota-preferential method of proportional representation ensures that the vote values within states are equal as nearly as can be.</PARA>
<PARA> However the provision of the Electoral Act that compels voters to show preferences for all candidates on the ballot paper interferes with the free expression of the will of the voters, and is unjust.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia, as a Member State of the United Nations, is pledged to achieve observance of Human Rights and Freedoms.</PARA>
<PARA> We, the undersigned citizens of Australia, therefore humbly pray that the Senate will fulfil the pledge of a Member State of the United Nations and take steps to remove the compulsion from the Electoral Act in order to allow freedom of expression for everyone who has the right to vote for Senators.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 237 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that the introduction of tuition fees for post-graduate and second degree students will:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) severely limit access to such levels of study. The ability of a student to pay tuition fees will be the main criteria for entry to such courses. The restricted availability of Commonwealth post-graduate scholarships and the difficulty of finding part-time work in employment related areas further restricts the ability of post-graduate students to pay tuition fees.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) result in higher attrition rates in post-graduate and second degree studies. Recent surveys have indicated that up to 50 per cent of students would be unable to continue their studies if tuition fees at the level of $1,000 per year were introduced. Inability to continue study is both a personal tragedy and a waste of the community's resources.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) limit Australia's capacity to cope with technological, economic and social change. Many degree students who will have to pay tuition fees undertake further study to upgrade their qualifications to cope with changes in their area of employment. Many are forced to undertake retraining in areas outside their current employment because of declining job opportunities in such areas due to economic change. Further study for many students will bring no financial benefit but simply allow them to extend their contribution in the course of their work. For example thousands of teachers have undertaken further study to gain expertise in such areas as migrant education, remedial literacy and numeracy teaching, curriculum development and so on.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) further restrict access to such study for women students. As a result of the abolition of tuition fees the proportion of women students in tertiary education has increased significantly. Mature age women students have benefited by the opportunity denied them when they left school.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) seriously undermine Australia's research effort. Approximately 22 per cent of Australian research takes place in tertiary institutions. The bulk of Australia's basic research is undertaken in universities. The introduction of tuition fees threaten Australia's capacity to cope with major structural change in the economy.</PARA>

<PARA> 2. That if trading hours are deregulated in the Australian Capital Territory the present restrictions on trading hours in other parts of Australia be lifted.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Past performances have proved that longer trading hours do not lead to increased sales. However, they do increase costs, because shops have to be staffed for longer periods. To cover these increased costs, retailers are forced to increase prices and reduce staff levels. This means that longer trading hours increase both prices and unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. There is no real consumer demand for longer trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. I think he has had some notice of this question. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a circular dated 10 January 1979 by Mr K. R. Constantine, the Chief Veterinary Officer of the Department of Primary Industry in New South Wales? Did that circular warn meat inspectors about corrupt practices in the export trade? Did these alleged practices include the substitution of horse and kangaroo meat for beef? Can the Minister say whether the director of meat inspection, Mr Gee, knew of the allegations and whether he in turn informed the Minister for Primary Industry at the time, Mr Sinclair? If Mr Sinclair was informed, what action did he take to see that these practices were stamped out?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Leader of the Opposition indicated, I had some notice that he intended to ask a question concerning this area. I am pleased about that, because I did not hear AM this morning and would not have been aware of the statements made by Mr Hallam on that program. I have now had the opportunity to see a transcript of what was said and to obtain some information from the Minister for Primary Industry. Because of that, I am now aware of the circular to which the honourable senator has referred. I have a copy of it with me. If it were wished, I could table that copy in the Senate for the information of honourable senators. The circular did not warn meat inspectors about corrupt practices in the export trade, unless, I think, one takes a fairly broad definition of the word 'corrupt'. In its terms, it reminded meat inspection staff of the need to check product description on all meat export packs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The circular was issued to Department of Primary Industry officers in all States, to the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and to industry organisations. This was following some complaints that had been received by the Bureau of Animal Health in Canberra about the removal of cuts from some packs; the substitution of mutton for lamb, young sheep for hogget and cow for heifer; and some incorrect trade descriptions of skirt and salt beef. There was no suggestion, however, as was raised in the question, of any species substitution such as horse meat or kangaroo meat being substituted for beef. The Central Office advice was carried out within the normal administrative processes of the Veterinary Public Health Branch of the Bureau of Animal Health. The Director of the Bureau of Animal Health, Mr Gee, was not informed of the circular, which was a routine reminder to all inspection staff of their responsibilities. I am advised that the then Minister would also not have been advised of the circular.</PARA>
<PARA> The matter was raised on AM this morning by the New South Wales Minister for Agriculture, Mr Hallam, who has taken this issue out of context and has been blatantly dishonest in his approach to it. Indeed, he and the Leader of the Opposition seem to be more intent on trying to destroy the credibility of Australia's export meat trade than trying to support it and to rebuild its reputation following the recent unfortunate horse and kangaroo meat substitution issue. Notwithstanding the excitement on the Opposition benches, I would have thought we would all be united in our wish to have effective meat inspection services and also united in our wish to have a healthy meat export industry, which is important not only to supporters of the Government but also to the tiny proportion of people who support the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hallam claimed on AM this morning that the circular demonstrates that the federal meat inspection service was not up to scratch whereas, in fact, the circular demonstrates that it was the opposite. It was issued following complaints and it was issued to remind inspection officers of their responsibilities. It pointed out quite clearly that correct trade descriptions and common codes must be applied at all times for all destinations, and also pointed out that failure to do so undermines the credibility of the inspection service and reflects adversely on the Australian meat industry. I think the attempts on AM this morning to continue the concern about the industry were most inappropriate in the light of the measures which have been taken to ensure that procedures are satisfactory.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs who represents the Minister for Health in this chamber. I refer to health insurance arrangements for remote Aboriginal communities, a matter which was raised with me by the Pitjantjatjara communities in South Australia whom I visited last week on the Minister's behalf. In the past, persons who live in remote Aboriginal communities have not needed to make any special arrangements for health insurance because they have had free access to local community health clinics and to public hospitals in the nearer, major population centres. Under the new health insurance arrangements, persons in remote Aboriginal communities have now to write out applications either for health insurance cover, if their income exceeds the cut-in of the means test for publicly provided insurance, or for the publicly provided insurance.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I doubt that the Government is likely to change the basis of the health arrangements, but that does not mean that we are not sensitive to the problems which have been raised by Senator Teague. I note that he was in the Pitjantjatjara area last week for the handing over of the title deeds. I remind the Senate that that was an historic event. The questions which he raises and which relate to people in some of the remote communities are real questions. It is true that many of the people are not literate and that someone is required to fill in forms for them. It is fair to say, however, that most of the Aboriginal people in those areas have an income sufficiently low that they would qualify without any doubt for the health insurance cover scheme which the Government has announced for low income earners. If they do qualify they qualify for six months. The honourable senator will be aware of that. I believe he may be correct in saying that there will be an extra load on some of the community advisers in terms of the paper work required. We will certainly try to investigate that aspect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator referred to variations which might occur in people's income. The arrangements provide that people can earn up to 125 per cent of the qualifying level in any four-week period before they lose their entitlement. But again, there could be some extra administrative work for those people who have a fluctuating income. The matter really is one which affects my colleagues the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Security. I will undertake to make Senator Teague's concerns known to them and to see whether we can look at the arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I preface it by referring to the mission impossible that the Department inherited in the imposition by the Public Service Board of an unreal staff ceiling under which, in the last couple of years, the Department has had to process at least 9,000 applications made during the mini-amnesty, a work load that led to a nine months' backlog in processing citizenship applications-at least in Sydney, if not in Melbourne-and has had to cope with the revised criteria on migrant selections. It is in that context that I ask the Minister: What hopes have we that the Public Service Board Luddites will finally agree to a much needed infusion of additional staff into that Department? As a postscript-I am trying to be helpful and base this suggestion on observations I have made in Sydney-I ask whether it would be possible to utilise the manpower of some of the surplus clerks in the Public Service Board who are located on the eighteenth floor by transferring them to the eleventh floor where the work is.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I am glad that the close relationship Senator Mulvihill has with the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is not impaired by the honourable senator's question; I see that he is still seeking assistance for that Department. At present the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is analysing its staffing. For instance, the recent changes in the migrant selection policy are being reviewed with a view to taking the matter up with the Public Service Board to ensure that the necessary resources are available to enable the kind of service that is expected from a department of that type to be given. The review of citizenship procedures is also being undertaken in co-operation with the Public Service Board. It is hoped that that review will be completed by the end of this month. In other words, reviews of the staffing are being undertaken within the Department and representations have been made to the Public Service Board for the provision of the requisite staff to give the kind of service that is expected.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose it is basic to the honourable senator's question that it is not merely the decisions of government which affect the shape of industry in this country. Quite clearly, the attitudes which are taken by trade unions, like the decisions which are taken by government with respect to measures such as taxation and protection, do have an effect on the shape of manufacturing industry in Australia. The question raised by the honourable senator specifically referred to an advertisement which was inserted by the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation in combination with General Motors-Holden's Ltd. I am aware of that advertisement. I think it would be fair to say that it opposed the adoption of the proposals contained in the draft report of the Industries Assistance Commission. General Motors-Holden's and the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation gave evidence to the IAC and both advocated change to the existing assistance arrangements, although both support the retention of some form of content plan and some form of market sharing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose the feature of this area is that all the interested parties, whether they are trade unions or those who are involved as employers and manufacturers, do have a great diversity of stance. The only common point seems to be that they all want some change, but the fact is that they all seem to seek varied changes. In broad terms, the IAC has estimated that the consumer tax equivalent of the current assistance arrangements is about $1,000m per annum. Using that figure it would be possible to derive a notional estimate for the assistance provided per car produced, but I am not sure that either figure of itself has any particular significance. The figures are influenced as much by the size of the industry as by the assistance received and involve a lot of assumptions, including difficult judgments about the likely price of cars in a theoretical free trade situation. Again, some very differing views are being put forward, both publicly and privately, on that point at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA> If the honourable senator wishes to draw a comparison between the assistance accorded to this industry and that provided to other areas of manufacturing, I would refer him to the IAC's specific comments on this. The Commission has estimated that the assistance accorded to the industry is about four times the average for the manufacturing sector overall. As far as the industrial claims mentioned by the honourable senator are concerned, my understanding is that the union did submit a log of claims earlier this year seeking both a $30 a week wage rise and the introduction of a 35-hour working week. The subsequent history of those claims is complex but I understand that the present position, in essence, is that the claim for a 35-hour working week has been absorbed in the general Australian Council of Trade Unions program on this issue and is no longer being pursued separately by the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation, and that the wage claim has been before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission but that the Commission's award of $9 a week for non-tradesmen and $14 a week for tradesmen has been rejected by some members of the union. The dispute at Ford's Broadmeadows plant flowed from that.</PARA>
<PARA> I cannot quantify the cost per car if the demands were met and they were fully passed on in terms of car prices. As to the influence which these issues may have on the outcome of the current review of assistance arrangements, I can only repeat the advice previously given, that in reaching its decisions on future assistance arrangements for the industry the Government will be guided by what it considers will best serve the overall national interest. There have been a number of questions from both sides of the House. In response to all of them I have been at some pains to emphasise that the Government will very carefully consider the employment and other considerations which obviously are very significant in this whole area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, concerns a statement attributed to the Treasurer today that the Government will not grant tax cuts or increase family allowances if the Australian Democrats allow legislation for higher petrol prices to pass through the Senate. I ask: Was not the Government elected on a clear and unqualified promise by the Prime Minister during the last Federal election campaign that any future revenue from higher petrol prices due to the crude oil levy would be passed back to the Australian people as tax cuts or higher family allowances? Is not the circumstance that the Government might be getting less revenue than it expected totally irrelevant to this issue since the Prime Minister's election promise was not qualified? The Democrats, and no doubt the Australian people, would like a straight answer on whether this breaking of an election promise is a considered change of policy to apply not only to the petrol price rise projected from 1 January but also to all such future rises based on world parity pricing arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not hear the Treasurer's statement except that part in which he stated, as I said yesterday, that the present trend of production of oil from Bass Strait, owing to the interruption by industrial unrest, would result in a shortfall of about $220m overall this year compared with the Budget estimate and that, even allowing for an adjustment on 1 January, there would be a shortfall of about $120m. In fact the revenue will be less and not more. I do not believe that the Government has broken any promises in this regard. I repeat that the Government has placed great emphasis upon the development of the family. In this Budget there is emphasis upon the family and there will be for the future. I repeat what I said yesterday, that the thrust of our overall Budget and monetary policy is to do the most significant thing possible for all families, that is, to get inflation down and to bear down on interest rates. No better help than this could be given to the Australian family. Indeed, over the past six years the inflation rate, which six years ago was running at 17 1/2 per cent and moving higher, has fallen. The inflation rate during past governments in Australia was numbered amongst the highest in the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Australia now has one of the lowest inflation rates. Whereas six or seven years ago its ability to trade was being shrunk out of the world, we are now widening and improving our trading ability better than we have done in 10 years. The picture is a good one. Since I have not seen the full text of the Treasurer's statement I am unable to comment on the remainder of the question.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for National Development and Energy. Is it true that coal liquefaction projects have received funding in the sum of $8.1m between the years 1978-79 and 1980-81 on the recommendation of the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council? Is it also true that funding for coal gasification has been less than 5 per cent of that sum? In view of the expiry of the gas contract to South Australia in 1987, and in view of the fact that reports of the South Australian Department of Mines and Energy put the cost of gas produced at the Wakefield coal deposit at no higher than the cost of Bass Strait natural gas as appears in the NERDDC funded Davy McKee Paper, what is the justification for such apparent discrimination?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2011" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no discrimination. On the contrary, the Commonwealth Government has been busy talking to the States to try to get some agreement that the linking of the Wagga Wagga and Albury pipelines would allow for the future a real assurance of additional gas supply to South Australia in the event of any other non-negotiability of contract after 1987. A very great deal of work has been done in that regard and in other matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me respond to the four parts of the question. It is true that $8.1m has been allocated for research into coal liquefaction in recent years and that coal gasification research has been in the order of $0.34m over that period. The allocations, which are recommended to me by the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council and are set out in its booklet, are based on the criteria of the priorities in this regard. The Council identifies a need to support sufficient activity in the coal liquefaction area to enable a proper assessment of the process routes for conversion of Australian coals to liquid fuels. Coal gasification is considered important not only for the production of synthetic natural gas but also for the generation of hydrogen or synthesis gas for liquefaction processes. However-and this is the important point-coal gasification processes are already available, have been commercially applied and are viable.</PARA>
<PARA> The study called the Davy McKee study on market and production aspects of the use of methanol as a gasolene extender assumed a notional natural gas cost of $3.90 a gigajoule. In addition to investigating the production of gas from coal of course it would be appropriate for the South Australian authorities to pursue commercial negotiations for gas contracts beyond 1987. The development of exploration for gas and liquids in the Cooper Basin has shown a healthy sign. The proposed linking of the pipeline from Wagga to Albury is another significant assurance for the future. The Commonwealth is in continuous discussion with South Australia. I believe it should be readily possible for South Australia to have an ensured gas supply for the indefinite future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. It relates to the seagoing watchkeeping experience of our naval officers. At a recent symposium on sea transport technology, the Chief of Naval Materiel, Rear-Admiral Rourke, is reported to have said that the Royal Australian Navy had problems providing adequate sea time for junior and more advanced officers and would welcome approaches from shipping companies willing to take naval officers to sea on their ships. Is this so? Can the Minister tell us why this is so? What steps are being taken to ensure that naval officers obtain sufficient practical experience to retain their competence to command our ships?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact that, at a symposium on sea transport technology, Rear-Admiral Rourke was questioned as to the past arrangements to allow naval officers to go to sea in merchant ships to broaden the experience of their operations. He was asked whether he thought these arrangements should be reintroduced. My understanding is that the Royal Australian Navy is currently planning to attach junior officers to merchant ships to further their training, to broaden their experience and to promote good will between the RAN and the merchant service. Commanding officer designates of specific fleet units are currently planned to sea ride in merchant ships to gain further experience. In addition, merchant shipping involvement in naval exercises is increasing all the time. Arrangements to form an Australian shipping defence council are currently well advanced with the aim of developing a better liaison between the RAN and the shipping companies and to promote greater co-operation between the two in both peacetime and wartime.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Education. Firstly, how much will the proposed amalgamations of tertiary institutions recommended by the Review of Commonwealth Functions cost? In particular, what sums will have to be paid because of the amalgamating or closing of colleges to staff who have entitlements to severance pay, accrued annual leave, accrued sick pay and, where their determinations include this, any accrued long service leave? Secondly, why was an eight-month deadline set when the Tertiary Education Commission and the Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission suggested three years as appropriate and overseas experience shows that such amalgamations can take five years to accomplish satisfactorily? Thirdly, how will access to tertiary education and the quality of education be improved since the evidence points to the reverse? Fourthly, why was there virtually no consultation carried out with the colleges, their councils, staffs and students, all of whom have suffered by these proposed amalgamations? Finally, when can I expect an answer to an earlier question on guidelines for amalgamating institutes which I asked on 10 September in this place? Is it the case that no such guidelines exist?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The original recommendation for amalgamation of colleges and universities arose from the Tertiary Education Commission and was taken up by the Committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions. It is important to realise that the Tertiary Education Commission is an objective body of education specialists headed by a very distinguished Australian, Professor Karmel. The Commission and its concomitant councils are to be in daily contact and consultation with the institutions concerned and, therefore, are required to have very specialist knowledge. Senator Siddons, therefore, must keep in mind that, in the days when the demographic population trends in Australia were such that our youngsters were expanding in numbers and primary and secondary education was expanding, there was a burgeoning of teacher training colleges. There was also the development of single purpose teacher training colleges in Australia. The Tertiary Education Commission and other educationists believed that these single purpose colleges in themselves were wrong in concept and that they ought to be multi-purpose. Indeed, the demographic trend was such that they could not be viable on their own and, therefore, amalgamation was necessary. All those things are basically sensible conclusions. In the view of expert educationists they are to the benefit of education.</PARA></TALK.START>

I did not have the opportunity of reading the Border Morning Mail of that day, either in black and white or in the technicolour in which Senator Bonner has described so I cannot respond to the questions about it. But as to the question whether the Government is to proceed, I say emphatically that the Government intends to proceed on the course it has defined. Let me make that clear. So that there is no confusion let me say a few things. The problem of defining the Barrier Reef and declaring it a national park is no simple matter; it is a highly complex one. The Government has made a categoric and absolute guarantee of protection of the reef. I have spoken on many occasions of the permanent preservation of the reef.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is much confusion in many minds over the Great Barrier Reef and its region. There is a general tendency to make no distinction between the two. The reef is drawn in the broadest possible way to ensure that none of the widely scattered reef is excluded. The Great Barrier Reef consists, in fact, of over 2,500 reefs and islands spread over almost 2,000 kilometres with, in many places, large areas of open water between important areas. The definition of the reef and the identification of the ecologically vital areas are work which is complex, detailed and still proceeding. It is unreal, in administrative terms, to talk glibly of proclaiming the whole region. The preparation of zoning plans to allow for protection of the reef, shipping lanes, existing and essential professional fishing, amateur fishing and tourist activity necessarily involves much detailed work. This Government has done more to protect the reef than has any other government. Its actions have been in accordance with the findings of the royal commission into petroleum drilling on the reef. We will continue to proceed co-operatively with Queensland on this matter. We have already declared one region, the Capricornia region. The Cairns region is now under consideration. I have no doubt that with good will what we propose will be done. We are making progress. No other government sought to do what we are doing. They had the opportunity to do it and they did not try to do it. So let those who now seek to criticise look to themselves and wonder why they did not take the opportunity.</PARA>

If this is unsuccessful the Commissioner may issue a certificate enabling the aggrieved person or persons to commence proceedings in the courts. A decision as to whether court action should be taken is one for the aggrieved person himself, of course, and not for the Government.

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> In December 1979 the Philippines Government established Phil-Bai, a state trading organisation, to undertake the import of meat and livestock from Australia and New Zealand. Phil-Bai is controlled by the Philippines Bureau of Animal Industry. Following this decision, a company, Phil-Bai International Pty Ltd, was established in Australia with 90 per cent Philippine Government and 10 per cent Australian interests.</PARA>
<PARA> In July, 1980, Phil-Bai International applied to the AMLC for export licences for meat and livestock. The application was refused on the grounds that the Corporation was opposed to granting an Australian export licence to the purchasing arm of a foreign government sole import agency. This general policy of the AMLC is designed to protect the interests of the Australian industry in dealing with foreign sole importing agencies by preserving for the Corporation the right to step into the market itself as a sole seller so that it can, if necessary, deal with a sole buyer on equal terms.</PARA>
<PARA> As Phil-Bai has been able to arrange purchases of meat in Australia and arrange with licensed exporters to export the meat to the Philippines, the policy decision by the AMLC has not materially affected Phil-Bai's commercial interests. A number of Australian meat exporters have expressed satisfaction with the trading links they have established with Phil-Bai. There does not appear to have been any significant diversion of trade away from Australia to New Zealand because of the AMLC's action. Total exports of meat to the Philippines from Australia in 1980-81 were around 4,800 tonnes, compared to 5,300 tonnes for 1979-80.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is now some time since the publication of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the so-called razor gang, decisions. It is time, of course, that we reviewed and revisited some of those decisions to see actually what has happened to them since. It is now about six months since those decisions were made. At the time of the Review of Commonwealth Functions the series of decisions made by the Government, the so-called razor gang decisions, were touted about as a triumph for small government and lower taxation. In view of the Government's stated philosophy at the time, a lot of symbolism was attached to those decisions. The symbolism is important because increasingly the symbol is beginning to look like a monument. We will be drawing attention to that monument from now until the next election. In fact, the very day before the razor gang report was delivered half-tax-indexation was abolished and, effectively, the Government announced its intention to slug Australian taxpayers another $500m a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since the miraculous age of small government was heralded by the razor gang we have had a Budget which promises to take 22 per cent more in pay-as-you-earn taxation and $1,000m more in sales tax from the Australian people. That indicates just to what degree the razor gang was for real, and the reasons stated for its decisions were for real, in terms of bringing about lower taxation. It demonstrates the extent to which the Review of Commonwealth Functions was nothing but a stunt. Most of the actual decisions made in the course of the so-called review were made because the Government wished to be seen to be bringing in small government. They were not hard decisions. They had very little, if any, effect upon Government outlays. However, they were mostly bad decisions. They were certainly ad hoc decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most extraordinary and spectacular example of this ad hoc approach was provided by the last minute excisions from the razor gang report itself. Certain sections were blacked out in printer's ink. In the statement brought down by the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) the day before the report was presented changes were also made in the printed text to accommodate the views of particular Ministers. The statement itself might have been called a collage. It had been cut up with scissors, put together with sticky tape and re-photocopied within hours of its delivery. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention these things not just to demonstrate the degree of political turmoil which exists at the very highest levels of this Government and not just to demonstrate that its decision-making processes are like those which mark the essay writing of a poor student whose approach is characterised by months of dithering and weakness followed by a frenzied and desperate activity as the deadline approaches. I mention them because they belie in the clearest way the Government's portrayal of its decisions as the rational and thoughtful implementation of a political philosophy.

<PARA> In the five years since its establishment the Curriculum Development Centre has undertaken a formidable array of projects which have resulted in an enrichment of the fabric of Australian education. </PARA>
<PARA>One month after he made that statement and the money had been spent the razor gang put the existence of the Australian Curriculum Development Centre into jeopardy. That is a classic example of the question of whether the function of government is one of delivery of services or of something else. That question mark hangs over the whole of the deliberations of the razor gang. We still do not know the fate of the Australian Curriculum Development Centre, which Mr Fife praised to the skies in March of this year. That led to the conclusions that were drawn by Liberal back benchers such as Mr Burr, who said of the Government's performance, when speaking in the House of Representatives in September:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government on many issues is simply firing from the hip with ad hoc policy decisions that do not seem to correspond perhaps with other policy decisions that have been made in the past. </PARA>
<PARA>With respect, I could not have described it better myself. What better example is there of that than the fact that more than 40 committees were abolished by the razor gang. Over three-quarters of those 40 committees were established by Liberal-National Country Party governments. Half were created by governments led by Malcolm Fraser. All of the latter were created with a great song and dance, a great display of bravado about what they were going to do in terms of the performing of functions for the Australian people and the delivery of services by the Government. It is a case of, 'Now you see them, now you don't'. The Fraser Government announces a whole series of committees and a year or so later in many cases it abolishes the same committees. One would have thought that to be a wasteful process of government or of human activity in whatever area one is talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> More than one-quarter of the committees which were abolished were created in the last three years of the Fraser Government. Several advisory committees which the razor gang abolished and which arose from election promises either had never been established or had never met. In fact, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) misled the Parliament and the Australian people, when they stated, for example, that the National Consultative Committee on Occupational Safety and Health would be abolished. Not only had no such body been established but also the Government had already decided never to go ahead with it, although it was the subject matter of an election promise by the Fraser Government. I suppose that the crowning achievement of all was the Government's abolition of the Australian Capital Territory Nature Conservation Advisory Committee and the Technology Transfer Advisory Board. The Government abolished these committees, it said, to save money. Both committees were giving their services to the Government voluntarily and without any charge whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> When the report of the razor gang first saw the light of day I was concerned about what some of the implications of the decisions of the Government in relation to these matters would be. I placed a number of questions on the Notice Paper seeking information as to why various decisions had been taken. One such decision was to sell assets and to contract work out to the private sector. I asked whether the changes would make things more efficient, save money or lower prices. In hardly any case did the responsible Minister answer these questions in a way which suggested that these favourable results would follow. In most cases the Ministers concerned admitted that they had no idea what the effects of the decisions would be. The Department of Science and Technology, for example, will contract out the operation of the Baseline Air Pollution Station to private enterprise. That was a Government decision. Will it save money, will it promote efficiency? Nobody knows, least of all the Minister concerned. In answer to a question he said:</PARA>
<PARA> At this time it is not possible to make comparative economic assessments between (private and public) . . . operation of the facility. </PARA>
<PARA>When I asked the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) what would be the result of selling the Experimental Building Station, he had no idea. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible at this stage to make a financial assessment. </PARA>
<PARA>When the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) was asked whether greater private contracting would save money he said that no cost comparison had been done. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . Review of Commonwealth Functions decisions are based not simply on cost savings but on the basis that many activities are undertaken by government which in the view of the Government would be more appropriately left to the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA>Why is that decision made in the case of a committee which is concerned with Commonwealth functions? What is the explanation for that extraordinary answer? In other words, the Review of Commonwealth Functions decisions-the razor gang decisions-were not made on the basis of equity and efficiency. They are founded on ideological prejudice. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great requirements of any government is the requirement of accountability to the Parliament and to the people through the media. That is no mean or insignificant requirement of government. It is fundamental for the workings of democracy as we know it that people have access to government, that they can ask questions of the Government about what it is doing and what its instrumentalities are doing. They ought to receive answers from the Government so that they know what it is doing and how it is using their money. I make this charge about accountability with some seriousness because this Government has the worst record of accountability of any Australian government since Federation. At the same time, I assert that a lack of accountability in government constitutes a strong threat to any nation that cherishes small government or decentralisation of power. Nothing sets the scene better for centralisation of power than a lack of accountability to the people about government decisions. The Government's record in this area has been a disgrace. I refer to the evasive answers to questions, the failure of Ministers in the Government to disclose publicly their financial interests and the financial interests of their families, the failure of the Prime Minister to grant access to the media, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The very document we are considering, the report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, is an appalling document in the sense that it flouts the whole principle of accountability. We were given a list of 350 decisions, some of which were so vaguely worded it was impossible to extract a meaning, but none of the decisions is ever really explained. All the efforts were directed towards a public relations stunt and nothing was made clear about the functional aspects of a decision. We are told nothing about previously existing schemes and programs which were cut, or about existing arrangements which will be cut in the future. Because of the nature of this report I asked several hundred questions on notice seeking information which ought to have been provided by the report itself. I have quoted from some of the answers. As the razor gang was alleged to produce an eventual ongoing saving of $560m to the Commonwealth Government, I asked for the breakdown of that saving. I received an extraordinary answer from the Prime Minister. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Many of the decisions were not of a kind where the savings could be stated at the time. </PARA>
<PARA>The savings could not be stated at the time, but out of the blue we get a figure of $560m, which is all part of the stunt of the razor gang announcing a $560m cut in Commonwealth expenditure. Yet when we ask how that cut is calculated no information is available at all. The Government had no idea what any particular decision of the razor gang would save but it said that all the ingredients total $560m. When a journalist from the National Times, Julie Flynn, spoke to senior public servants about the $560m which would allegedly be saved, most of them laughed, she reports. One said:</PARA>
<PARA> We don't know what the savings will be. No costing has been done of how much some of the recommendations will actually cost the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Another one said:</PARA>
<PARA> Pick a number, any number and multiply by two. You've got just as much chance of being right as anyone in the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for the $560m which the Commonwealth Government says it will save. So is it any wonder that the razor gang report is seen as a stunt and an example of incompetence and confusion rather than anything else? The razor gang has given rise to more than 200 Public Service reviews-committees on committees and things of that kind. I thought that sort of monumental inefficiency was reserved for the Parliament. That means that one in every two recommendations of the razor gang involved the setting up of a review. In the Public Service Board alone, 60 reviews are occupying the full time of 65 people. That represents a cost to the Public Service Board of $1m so far. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Education portfolio there is a degree of chaos resulting from the razor gang decisions. No one knows what is happening to the Australian Curriculum Development Centre. Of the 30 colleges of advanced education scheduled for rationalisation, one was reprieved and six remain in limbo. At Question Time today Senator Carrick, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, was unable to answer any question from Senator Siddons about costs and alleged efficiencies which will arise from those decisions. It has become clear that implementation of the decision on fees for second degrees would be an administrative nightmare. Fortunately the Government may be saved by a wise decision of the Senate in relation to that matter. Six months on from the razor gang, confusion reigns as to what will become of the Australian Wool Testing Authority and the Bendigo Ordnance Factory, to name just two of the Government's more ill-advised sales to private interests-if those sales, in fact, ever take place. </PARA>
<PARA> All that adds up not to cost cutting or small government but to bad government, confused government. It is little wonder that this Government, lurching from one political crisis to another, can seize events such as that as merely public relations stunts. It is very little wonder that the Government's own back bench members criticise it for being ad hoc. It is little wonder that the business community in Australia is at the end of its tether. Sir Roderick Carnegie, Chairman of Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd, when talking about the present Government put it this way on 1 September this year:</PARA>
<PARA> It has created uncertainty in the minds of buyers about Australia's reliability . . . They're changing the rules of the game all the time. It is very hard for people who are approaching things in the short term perspective of politics to understand the long term damage they do. </PARA>
<PARA>There is very little wonder at that when one looks at the abolition of 40 committees, 20 of which were established by the present Government in the last two years. The President of the Australian Mining Industry Council, Mr Hugh Morgan of Western Mining, said of this year's Budget, in the same sort of context:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government did not understand what it was doing. </PARA>
<PARA>The razor gang was heralded in a blaze of Government rhetoric about small government philosophy. The difference between the Opposition's and the Government's philosophies in this area is marked indeed, but it is not a permanent difference in attitude on the size of government spending and it is not a fundamental difference in attitude on the expenditure by the Australian Public Service which should be justified. One would have hoped it was not a difference in relation to the accountability of a government for its decision making, but we suspect it is. We would insist on much greater degrees of accountability than this present Government is concerned with. The basic difference between the Government and the Opposition is that the Opposition has a conception of the role of government in a healthy mixed economy. That does not mean that the ideology should be so overbearing as to exclude an assessment of what functions government and private enterprise can provide in a healthy mixed economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition does not believe in hacking away at one sector of the economy without undertaking a much more considered review than the Review of Commonwealth Functions-the so-called razor gang. One would hope that in a review of the functions of government there would be an assessment of the sorts of questions which I can briefly enumerate in the time available to me: Does this function of government promote or otherwise the welfare of the most needy sections of the Australian population? Does this function of government provide objective information for the Australian community and the private sector of the economy? These questions can be thought about in the light of the various bodies which were abolished. Further, should government intervene in the economy to stimulate competition and to promote efficiency and social justice? Do the decisions made by the government do that? Do they promote the decentralisation of political power in Australia or rather do they promote the centralisation of political power and the absence of accountability? These are fundamental questions to which any review of the functions of the Australian Government and the Australian Public Service should address itself. None of these issues were addressed by the razor gang. That has led to the confusion which is very apparent in the Australian community at the present time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button submitted to the Senate a matter of public importance. He raised matters which he claimed were evidence of the ineptitude of the Review of Commonwealth Functions and the confusion caused in the community by attempts to implement its recommendations. I want to say a number of things on this subject. First, we ought to recall that the report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions has been discussed in the Senate on a number of occasions, and I think we would all welcome the opportunity to discuss it again. Senator Button raised, in particular, some specific areas in which he sees problems in the implementation of the recommendations of the report. Perhaps something can be said about some of those, but in general I want to say that the implementation of the report is proceeding satisfactorily. Despite the attempts of Senator Button and some of his colleagues to cite confusion or to cause confusion about the recommendations, the reverse is the case. The implementation of the recommendations is proceeding satisfactorily. There is an ongoing monitoring of this work. The report of the Review is that these recommendations have been put into effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button made a most reflective speech. It was a speech which I think, in his own terms, showed that he realised that we needed to come to terms with the size of government in this country. That is not unique to Australia. All around the world, countries are looking at the size of government, the intrusion of government and the role of government. I was fascinated to hear Senator Button talk about the decentralisation of the power of government. I welcome the comment which he made along those lines. If we are to look at the matters that were raised, perhaps we should look at the background and the reason why the Review was undertaken at the time when it commenced last year. The Government decided to take the initiative to look at a number of the functions of the Commonwealth Government and to try to determine-it is not easy to do that, given the size of government-whether some of those functions could be better or adequately undertaken by the private sector, by another level of government or by individuals. This is reflected in the report and in the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcom Fraser) when the report was introduced into the Parliament. Perhaps we ought to reflect on why the Australian Labor Party feels there is some threat from this report. Perhaps it does reflect the fact that there was community support for the philosphy of the report. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; No. I think there is community support for the fact that government is prepared to look at itself. I think it is high time that it did. I was fascinated by much of what the honourable senator said. In the conservative nature of his approach to government Senator Button said that there is no room for change with government-that because one sets up 40 committees ipso facto for ever and a day one needs those 40 committees to continue. It does not matter whether their relevance has been lost, whether the paper work which they produce is of assistance to government, whether the people who are giving voluntary time and at the same time causing work in the departments to service them are of value and that the time that those people are prepared to give could be appreciated and used by government. I believe the report was a far-reaching one. It represents a significant undertaking by the Federal Government. I hope that we are prepared to continue to look at the size of the departments, the range of advice that comes in to government and the way in which this can be ultimately reflected in the role of government and in the decisions taken by government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that the report recognised one matter that was very timely: That was the desire of the Australian community for smaller government. We sometimes hear people talking these days about more limited government. That is not a new term either. At the same time when people talk of smaller government, they link with that lower taxation because they realise that government does not generate its own wealth. The resources of the Australian people are used to provide this level of government and to provide the size of government that has grown. People are looking also at the regulatory style of government that we have and whether it relates to business or to any other aspect of community life. I believe that there is a mood in the community to recognise that less centralised control of government is a good thing. I was glad to hear Senator Button expressing the same sort of proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions did express the Government's determination to make sure that the Commonwealth Government's operations are as streamlined and as efficient as they can be. That is not something that one is able to do, or is able to pretend that one can do, by one review over a number of months by a servicing unit and a small number of Ministers. To talk of streamlining governments of the size that exists in Australia at the Commonwealth level at least is to identify an enormous task. It is an ongoing task and we ought to be prepared to look at it. I wonder whether the Australian Labor Party does recognise that the Australian community wants lower taxation and that the only way to get this is to reduce the size of government and to make the public sector more efficient. Perhaps the people should be asked whether they do want continuity of these services, which we have decided are the services that they want and for which they will pay, regardless whether they feel that they are of benefit to them. </PARA>
<PARA> From time to time we have heard Senator Button and other Opposition senators urging, in this place and on other platforms, more Government spending in a host of areas. Of course, that has one inevitable consequence. According to the Australian Labor Party, more money is needed for education, welfare benefits, construction in Canberra and any sort of shopping list that one might like to mention. Every time a Bill is introduced the Opposition says that either we do not need to raise the revenue or that we ought to have more expenditure. That equation just does not work. We cannot have more expenditure and less revenue. Yet that has been the whole pattern of this session of the Senate in considering proposals relating to the 1981 Budget. If Senator Button sees his role as being a spokesman for all the interest groups that come to his party, perhaps he recognises that the review of government that was undertaken might have the consequences that we find. Perhaps criticism of the fact that we have removed some committees and that we have endeavoured to rationalise some of the things that were being done has made every interest group come to him and put forward its proposals. If he has that sort of pressure upon him perhaps he feels that he has to raise a matter of public importance of this kind and to ventilate the issues in order to try to explain exactly what role the Labor Party is taking with regard to the size of government and the continuity of these things that over the years we have added to. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we search in vain now for responsible suggestions from the Opposition as to how Government expenditure can be restrained or how it can be reduced. I would have thought that the ALP always expressed the philosophy of an expanded public sector; that it had a program for curing every ill in the community; that a government should make life a new Utopia for the Australian people. I think what Senator Button has done today is very welcome indeed. When we were facing the electors at the last election the Australian Labor Party attempted to portray its policies in so many areas as being similar to those of the Fraser Government. This is what we are seeing again today. There seems to be something like a consensus with regard to government. Maybe that is how it is going to work out. Are we all going to be prepared to review things and have efficiency and accountability? That sounds good on a day such as this but we would have to argue that accountability in government was not exactly the experience of the Australian people when the present Opposition was the Government. Efficiency was also not one of that Government's notable features. If we now have a new understanding of accountability and efficiency in government, we are well along the way to finding some responsibility that we can share in the role of government in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there is one area in which the ALP will find it difficult to walk down the path with a Liberal and National Country Party Government; that is the area of lower taxation. We have found in all the speeches from the Opposition throughout this Budget session a reference to the need for more expenditure in every area that has been mentioned. There has been limited acceptance of some of the Bills but always it was said that there ought to be more expenditure. That makes it extremely difficult for us to fulfil perhaps one of the prime objectives at the time that the Review of Commonwealth Functions was set up-to see how we can have efficiency in government, how we can have the accountability that was mentioned, and at the same time reduce the burden on the Australian taxpayers who have to provide the resources for government programs which have grown to such a large extent. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last few days the Press has reported further attempts by the Australian Labor Party to develop a new range of taxes, such as wealth taxes and capital gains taxes, to finance its policies. If there is to be restraint in government expenditure one would need to ask why there is this constant interest in the raising of additional taxes. That is one of the areas where we part company with the Labor Party because we are looking at restraint in government expenditure. That is a constant thread that has run throughout the six years of Fraser Government. We want to restrain expenditure so that we are able to reduce the burden of tax collections that need to be made to finance government programs. I think Senator Button has the intelligence to recognise the electoral difficulty of the Australian Labor Party in such policies with regard to the collection of taxes. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I think we can probably agree on a number of things. The honourable senator has to recognise-I am sure that he does-that big government means high taxation and it cannot be funded in any way other than through collections in various ways from the Australian people. The Review of Commonwealth Functions committee was perhaps able to take just one small step forward to stop the growth of big government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If real growth in Budget outlays can be held down, the consequences, especially in terms of an enhanced potential for income tax reductions, are more obvious than they otherwise would be. No one can suggest that it is easy to put together the expenditure side and the revenue raising, tax collecting and other government charges side of the Budget and come out with the sort of result we have achieved on this occasion. But this is one of the reasons why we have made a continued attack on expenditure. It is perhaps one of the reasons why there is a continued attack on this report. The fact that through this exercise we were prepared to look at ways in which government might try to restrain its growth and contain its expenditure is probably why we have been attacked. The result of that sort of achievement would be a greater capacity to lower the tax collections from the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We certainly believe the Review of Commonwealth Functions is making an important contribution to the objective of further reining in government expenditure. This makes room for private sector growth and paves the way for significant reductions in the burden of taxation. These are the principles underlying the review. I would also draw attention to the fact that the Prime Minister said when he introduced the report that the philosophy behind it went further than simply the restraint of expenditure. The restraint of expenditure is at the heart of the Government's overall approach to economic policy but it also is this Government's belief that we should emphasise the right of individuals to economic self-determination by reducing bureaucratic barriers to fair competition and by reducing the burden of overblown government on the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button mentioned that we had not been able to put into effect many of the decisions made in the report; that it was a report that really had no substance and no achievement. But considerable progress has been made towards giving effect to the Government's decision. I stress that considerable progress has been made. Legislation passed by the Parliament last session gave legislative effect where necessary to a number of the decisions and administrative action has been taken to implement many others. Far from there being a disorderly process plagued by ineptitude, as the matter of public importance submitted by Senator Button claims, the reverse is in fact true. The implementation of all Review of Commonwealth Functions decisions is being carefully monitored by a committee of senior Ministers chaired by Sir Phillip Lynch which meets on a regular basis to oversight the implementation of all of the decisions. At the end of October about 270 or 75 per cent of the originally announced decisions had been implemented or were very close to final implementation. That, in such a short period, is the sort of achievement that we were looking for from the implementation of the report. The remaining decisions are being vigorously pursued and certainly some of them do take time to implement. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee and the responsible Ministers, where decisions affect their area of responsibility, are carefully working toward the implementation of the remaining decisions where this is possible. It was never envisaged that overnight all the recommendations could be implemented, because some involve highly complex legal and administrative questions and some require lengthy negotiations with State governments and other bodies. The sale of a number of government assets, for example, has thrown up some difficulties which could not have been foreseen at the time, but progress in all of these cases is satisfactory and proceeding according to schedule. Expressions of interest need to be sought if we are to look at the disposal of government assets or government functions, and there will always be a need for negotiations with interested persons or bodies to take place and for consultations with the individuals, staff associations, unions and others who are involved. In all of this, the consultation and the consideration are being processed as quickly as practicable. </PARA>
<PARA> As was stated by the Prime Minister in his statement, on the basis of staffing assessments made to that date a reduction in staffing of the order of 16,000 to 17,000 public servants was expected. That target remains the expectation. In other words, there was an expectation from all the recommendations that there would be a reduction in staffing of some 16,000 or 17,000 Commonwealth public servants. Instead of a growth in the public sector, as we have so often seen, we find through this staffing assessment a deliberate reduction. Surely that shows the reasons behind the decisions that were taken and the effect of them. The Review indicated ongoing savings of some $560m. Decisions taken in the Review now merge with other decisions that were taken in the Budget, which is still before the Parliament. Many of the decisions taken in the Budget context are reflections of recommendations and decisions taken on recommendations in the RCF. So I imagine that were Julie Flynn or someone else to ask a Commonwealth public servant how costings were made, she would need to go to every department and she would need to go right through the Budget and look at the reflection of these decisions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join in this debate for the brief time allocated to me to support Senator Button's contention that the recent evidence of the ineptitude of the committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions and the confusion caused in the community by attempts to implement its recommendations are matters of importance to this Senate and, indeed, to the whole country. One realises how correct Senator Button was in bringing up this matter of public importance when one hears the reply from the good Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), who has just sat down. We got 10 minutes of her version of the Australian Labor Party's policy in various areas and her version of the Labor Party's debate on taxation policy in recent times, and then various comments on how difficult it was really to assess just what the Review of Commonwealth Functions Committee had done and would do and how difficult it was to assess how much would be saved. I do not remember any mention of any item in the review or any attempt to justify just what has happened in the six months since the report on it came down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We did hear from the Minister that the review carried out a couple of important functions of this Government. They included looking at means of lowering taxes and consulting with people about whether they wished to continue with the services already in existence. I suggest that in the activities of the Review-the so-called razor gang-one has had no evidence at all of any consultation with any community group or with very few Public Service groups as to what we should do about the various services we have in the community. The Minister sits as Minister for Finance in the Government which is, in fact, the highest taxing government in our history. Taxes are a higher proportion of gross domestic product than they have ever been in this community, a fact pointed out not only by the Opposition and by politicians in this country but also by Mr Risstrom of the Australian Taxpayers Association and every economic observer in existence. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact there is no evidence that this Review will result in reduced taxes. As the Government is attempting to apply more indirect taxes in the form of sales tax, to put up charges to people in the community, particularly in the health area and in the pharmaceutical benefits area and to restrict social security benefits, it is hard to see how anything that has resulted from this Review or from any of this Government's actions will reduce costs on the people in this community. It certainly will not reduce costs on the disadvantaged people of this community. The Committee consisted of a group of senior Ministers sitting together in what they were happy enough to describe, and in what everyone else described, as the razor gang. They treated it as a great little effort. They had their photographs taken for the newspaper with the leader of the gang, Sir Phillip Lynch, sitting there with a razor, all with big rosy smiles on their faces, to promote this so-called Review of Commonwealth Functions. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fraser, the Prime Minister, on 7 May this year called the results of their deliberations imaginative decisions. If one accepts the definition of imagination as being the mental faculty forming images of external objects not present to the senses-in other words, a dream-like situation-then one can understand that that is in fact what happened. Those Ministers sat down and dreamed up images out of the air. They worked out roughly where they could make these reductions as though they were all sitting round smoking pot or taking LSD and having a collective hallucination, and this report was a result of that. The Prime Minister announced that this was a serious attempt, as the Minister said here today, to reduce government functions and that the Committee had had a serious look at what was happening in the community so far as the functions of government were concerned. It had reviewed these functions and decided to rationalise some and to reduce others. </PARA>
<PARA> One can suggest that the words 'review', 'rationalise' and 'reduce', which are repeated over and over again throughout this report, mean that the Committee was cutting out wherever it could, willy-nilly, like some Jack the Ripper with a razor. Since then there have been several reviews of the review. Some changes have been made, some things have been cut out and in some cases it was decided that it was impossible to carry out some of the functions that the Review suggested should be carried out. We have had confusion in the community, demonstrated by Senator Button and by statements like those of Sir Roderick Carnegie, and we have had this demonstration of the ineptitude of the whole exercise. If one looks through the Review, it seems to do several things. In some places it announces the abolition of non-existent authorities or non-existent functions of government. We will come to that later. In other cases it gives an excuse for the Government to back off from unwise decisions that were made by the Prime Minister, decisions that in themselves were stunts, decisions that were thrown out as election gimmicks but which never got off the ground. If one looks at page 30 of the Review of Commonwealth Functions one sees it has been decided:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will withdraw its offer of assistance for the proposed Sydney-Melbourne railway electrification in view of the lack of priority accorded to this project by the States. </PARA>
<PARA>This project was announced by the Prime Minister without any consultation with the States. The States did not want it. The people knew that it was too expensive and not appropriate to be introduced at the time. What better chance for the Prime Minister to get out of this nonsensical promise that he made than to say that this Review of serious Ministers has decided that because of the States' actions the Government will not go ahead with it. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Button has pointed out, some 60 consultative committees established in the last few years by the Government-many of them in existence for fewer than two years-were also cut out by the Review of Commonwealth Functions. We know that some of them should have been cut out. We said so when they were established. Many of them were established with enormous fanfare by the Minister for Finance, who is sitting at the table. She used to come into this place and announce the setting up of another consultative committee the members of which she, of course, always picked herself. They were mostly not allowed to report to the Parliament and to talk about their consultations with the organisations to which they belonged. Of course the committees were an embarrassment to the Minister because they were phoney when they were set up. They were never meant to be consultative committees. What better opportunity to get rid of them without embarrassment than to have this senior group of Ministers in the guise of cutting government functions to make up for the Minister's mistakes!</PARA>
<PARA> There was another series of decisions which were obviously ad hoc, ill conceived and ill thought out. They caused much confusion in the community and have since been changed. There were silly little decisions-decisions which harmed many people and which cost very little. One of the first results of this Review was to suspend a publication from the ethnic Press. Only the publication was suspended. It was a small publication distributed to a few thousand people and contained a review of the various sections of the ethnic Press translated into English and distributed throughout the Public Service and the community members who were vitally interested in what was happening in the ethnic Press. The Government still continued to have the information collected and correlated. The Government still had the information printed for its own purposes within the responsible department but for a few thousand dollars it stopped distributing this information and therefore affected a group of people who were concerned about one of the great disadvantaged groups in our community-the migrants, and particularly the newly arrived migrants. It was not surprising when another journalist-I refer to another well-known female journalist, Jenni Hewett from the Sydney Morning Herald-looked into the report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions when it was produced and also decided to contact senior members of the Public Service and indeed senior members of the Government. The answer she got was similar to the answers that Julie Flynn, whose remarks Senator Button quoted, got. One gentleman said:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The Government is-ah-essentially restating-no, ah-clarifying its position with respect to this.'</PARA>
<PARA> 'Look, have you seen that TV show, Yes, Minister. It explains a lot.'</PARA>
<PARA>Another said:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Doesn't mean a bloody thing. It's nonsense. We do it already.'</PARA>
<PARA>This is the sort of derision with which this review and this report were in fact treated by the Public Service. There were small absurdities in the report, like the abolition of positions such as the controller of prices, the receiver of scalps and the rent controller which had not been operational for many years. These positions were costing nothing and were doing nothing, yet their abolition was announced with great seriousness as a means of cutting down. The decision to abolish the Legislative Drafting Institute merely meant that when Mr Neil Sexton retired his position would not be filled. This was the area used in the training of overseas people interested in legislative drafting skills. That small piece of assistance has now gone out of the window. It is that sort of decision which really makes no great difference to our budgetary situation but in fact may make a great difference to our reputation overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> There were more serious changes, of course, such as the abolition of the collection of statistics including the Commonwealth Employment Service statistics. We no longer know how many people are registered for jobs and in particular we do not know how many registered jobs are in specific areas. These were the only figures which showed the distribution of unemployment difficulties in our community. But the review committee, by some of its decisions, upset even those who were normally the friends and supporters of the Government. One can cite no better example of this than the decision to dispose of the Australian Wool Testing Authority to private enterprise. This decision, as every honourable senator knows, created considerable uproar amongst the private wool growers, the wool distributors and others in the community. The Government decided to get rid of the Authority. There was an uproar in the industry because private enterprise had worked in this area and it had failed. There were then some grave doubts as to whether the Government could get rid of the Authority at all. There was some uncertainty as to whether the Government was in a position to get rid of the Authority because of the ownership of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, after much confusion-confusion which continues-we know that the Government has been negotiating with the Australian Wool Corporation and that it has informed the Government in a letter dated 13 October that, in fact, the result of transferring this organisation, as apparently the Government wishes to do, may mean an increase in costs ranging from 8 per cent to 14 per cent-in some cases up to 20 per cent-in the area of wool testing. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the preferred option set out in the Report is largely a matter of cosmetic accounting which is far removed from any commercial sale. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of 'commercial sale' advocated in the review committee's report. The review committee came down with a firm decision to get rid of the Australian Wool Testing Authority willy-nilly and hand it over to private enterprise. We then had the situation in which the Government was uncertain whether it could do it. Its own supporters did not want it to do it. When the Government eventually cut through the confusion and approached the Wool Corporation about the matter, the Wool Corporation said, in fact, that we are indulging in a cosmetic transfer of the accounting methods and a transfer of the assets of this organisation. To do so would cost the wool grower and, therefore, the community some 8 per cent to 14 per cent more for wool testing. That is a perfect example of the ineptitude of the Government in an area in which it, through its colleagues in the National Country Party and those rural members of the Liberal Party, claims some expertise. It is a perfect example of the ineptitude which Senator Button points out in this matter of public importance. I believe that I need go no further. There are many other examples throughout the whole system. The reviews ordered by this committee into the area of social security have not been completed. They are being conducted with great confusion and have created confusion among those people who so much need the services of the Department of Social Security. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The chaos that is being caused and will continue to be caused by the razor gang cuts is a typical example of one of the basic problems facing our economy. I refer to the ad hockery, to the lack of long term direction and to the lack of indicative planning from which this country suffers. If we are going to save costs in Australia we have to do it first by clearly sorting out what our long term objectives are. We cannot have everything. We do have to make choices in this country. It is reasonable that those choices be quantified. In arriving at the sorts of long terms objectives and the sorts of areas where we want to concentrate our resources in the interests of our long term development, an attempt should be made for a bipartisan approach to these long term objectives. It can be done. The costs of what we are attempting to do can be quantified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What have we seen with the razor gang? We have seen a whole series of decisions made without any attempt to quantify their cost-effectiveness. I illustrate what I mean by taking a very simple example. We have been told that we are to save $560m and 16,000 places in the Public Service. I suggest that those figures can be taken with a grain of salt. I take this simple example to point out exactly why that is the case. I refer to the Commonwealth Parliament Offices in Victoria. It had a staff of cleaners who were conscientious and enthusiastic in their jobs. As a result of the razor gang cuts they were told one day that they were to be retrenched, that their services were no longer required. Some of them were temporary and some of them were permanent public servants. Those senators who have offices in the Commonwealth Parliament Offices in Victoria went to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) and asked: 'How much saving will this result in? What alternatives are there to keep the offices clean?'. We were told that a firm of contract cleaners would be brought in. There has been no attempt to cost the alternative cleaning approach. </PARA>
<PARA> It was very clear in the discussions that we had that the prime consideration of the Minister and, I presume, of the Government, is to reduce the size of the Public Service, to get people off the payroll of the Public Service. This is presumably so that at election time the Government can say: 'There are 16,000 fewer people employed by the Government'. That is not good enough. We have to look at the cost-effectiveness of what is being done and we have to look at the cost of the alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to illustrate the chaos that the razor gang's ad hoc decisions have caused in two important areas: Firstly, in education and, secondly, in the proposed closure of two important Government factories producing our defence requirements. In the case of education, I believe one of the worst ideas emerging from the razor gang's report was a decision that 30 of our colleges of advanced education had to merge with other colleges by the end of this year. It has proved a most disastrous decision both to individuals and to the colleges concerned. Mr Geoff Maslen, the education editor of the Age, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> The list of 30 colleges named by the Razor Gang was taken from a table in the last Tertiary Education Commission's report-a table unrelated to any proposals for mergers and which simply listed colleges mainly involved with teacher education. In the process, the Razor Gang overlooked several colleges with fewer than 1,000 students which might have benefited from a merger. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, instead of accepting a reasonable proposal from the TEC that the colleges be allowed until 1984 to draw up 'flexible plans and options' for amalgamation, the Commonwealth plumped for 8 months. The result has been inevitable confusion, great hardship to individuals, particularly teachers, and a general lack of morale. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to quote from a letter I received from Peter Norman, a teacher of 31 years service with the Education Department in Victoria and who has written at great length on education. He has been told that come the end of this year his services will no longer be required. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> During 1981, I have been pushed from pillar to post-a year of total confusion. Early in the year, there was serious talk of Frankston combining with Rusden. As Rusden was shorter of science staff than Frankston, I was asked to go to Rusden 1 1/2 days a week in addition to my work at Frankston. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that he was then sent to the Caulfield Institute of Technology because there was some possibility of an amalgamation. Now he has been told that his services will no longer be required. That is just typical of thousands of cases of hardship that are arising from the razor gang's decision to merge colleges of advanced education rapidly, without any real reference to the staff and without any real planning. We cannot hope to save money unless we plan to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The other example I want to take is the case of the Government defence factory at Bendigo and its clothing factory at Coburg. Decisions were made regarding these factories without due regard to the possible repercussions on our defence preparedness. This applies particularly to the Bendigo Ordnance Factory, where we have a nucleus of expertise, highly technical staff who could be used in the event of an emergency rapidly to expand their expertise in private industry. Presumably we went ahead with these decisions on the basis that it was not very difficult to obtain defence equipment from overseas. That is not the case. I quote from a recent article in the US News and World Report which states that the arms buildup in the United States is already in deep trouble. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The effects of a shortage of metals and raw materials already are apparent, both in higher prices and long delays in weapons production. </PARA>
<PARA>We have orders on the United States for vital defence equipment, equipment that could well have been made at the Bendigo Ordnance Factory but instead was ordered on the United States. We now find that deliveries of that vital equipment from the United States have been drastically extended and we have no real commitment as to when we are likely to get it. It is very apparent that with the problems the United States has in producing defence equipment for its own purposes, in building up its own defence production capacity, this vital equipment required by Australia will be further and further delayed. Those are two examples-education and defence production-where long-term implications have not been taken into account, and of course that applies to a whole range of other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude, in the short time I have available, by saying that we are talking about a very basic problem, the ad hockery of Government decisions. Very shortly in this place we will debate another area of ad hockery, namely, the rate of protection of manufacturing industry in this country, particularly as it applies to the automotive industry. All these areas must be looked at in terms of where we are heading. The Japanese can do it very well. They have a planning department called the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or MITI. They have representatives in most countries who quantify the demand in all countries. They then get these long-term projections before the companies that are involved in the manufacture and discuss their projections with them. They get agreement with interested parties, industry, trade unions and the community as to what is the likely demand for a particular product. They then look at their own resources and the development that can be expected in certain areas. The Japanese said that they were going to concentrate on two areas-the manufacture of motor cars and the production of steel. They did so with great efficiency. But everybody in that country knew in which areas the encouragement of development would take place. In Australia we have no idea. We do not know from one day to the next whether we want manufacturing industry or what sort of manufacturing industry we want. We do not know whether we are going to spend money on education or to what degree and in what areas. We are then told that these ad hoc, short term decisions, as in the case of the razor gang, are being made to save money. There is only one way in which we will save money and that is to get our priorities in order and to plan carefully the best way and the most efficient way in which to achieve these objectives in the long term. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Government, I sincerely reject the view put forward by the Leader of the Opposition, Senator John Button, claiming ineptitude in the Review of Commonwealth Functions. Similarly, I wish to squash the thought which may be in the minds of the community that there is some confusion on the Government's part. I contend that, if there is to be any allegation of confusion, that confusion is certainly not of the Government's making; rather, it has been insidiously generated by those who have some vested interests to protect or who have a philosophy which is out to destroy the Government's philosophy. I am surprised that Senator Siddons stated that there were no objectives in the ministerial statement on the Review of Commonwealth Functions. From that remark it is fairly obvious that he has not read the statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I mention this because a lot of emphasis in the argument was placed on a lack of objectives. I believe that our Government has wisely set out its objectives and followed these objectives in implementing its decisions. The Government's first objective is to make sure that Commonwealth Government activity does not crowd out the private enterprise sector by inhibiting private sector expansion in the area of job opportunities. Yet here we have the doyen of private enterprise within the Australian Democrats saying virtually that the Government can carry out those sorts of activities, including manufacturing, much more efficiently than the private sector. I ask the honourable senator whether he believes, for example, that government enterprise can produce adjustable wrenches more efficiently and at lower cost than his company, Siddons Industries Ltd. I wonder therefore whether there is any justification in the remarks and the criticism that he made as to lack of objectivity. Let us come back to the objectives which we are alleged not to have in mind. Our second objective is to reduce the unnecessary demands on the taxpayer by cutting back on the bureaucracy. Surely, that is a cry of this twentieth century. The third objective is to make sure that Commonwealth Government activities are performed with the greatest efficiency and effectiveness possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that in this debate there has been a degree of nitpicking and a flippant attitude by those who are putting forward this charge against the Government which is intended to cloud the overall picture of what our Government is trying to do and the philosophy that it is pursuing. I believe that the Review of Commonwealth Functions distinguishes clearly the basic difference in philosophy and outlook between the Liberal-National Country Party coalition and that of the Opposition. The Australian Labor Party, on the one hand, seeks to increase the high degree of government intervention at all levels in the lives of individuals in our society, which ultimately tends to sap people's initiative, tends to destroy morale and tends to lead towards a high degree of negativism. On the other hand, we have a Liberal Party philosophy which is manifest in these recommendations of the review committee, which seeks to reward initiative and to motivate individuals and at the same time to care for people in our society who are in genuine need. This is something that is often overlooked. We have a basic concern to care for those who are in genuine need. </PARA>
<PARA> How will we go about achieving these objectives? We will streamline and fine down Commonwealth operations by partly withdrawing from functions that are more appropriately those of State governments or even of private enterprise. At the same time we will rationalise the functions which properly belong to the Commonwealth Government. I must congratulate the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) for lifting this debate to a very much higher plane than other speakers. The starting point of the whole exercise lies with individuals. Our Liberal Party philosophy places importance on individuals. Page 1 of the ministerial statement on the Review of Commonwealth Functions states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Review's starting point is that Australia's greatest resource is the Australian people and that the role of government is to enable people to exercise their abilities, their skills, their imaginations and their enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA>I readily acknowledge that the Review of Commonwealth Functions has come as somewhat of a jolt to those who have self-created little empires which they now wish to continue to preserve. Naturally, they have felt under attack. They are rebelling. If there is some confusion it is surely coming from this quarter. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is any criticism of this committee maybe it is because it has taken such a long time to get a committee established and to set up all the necessary mechanisms and the machinery so that we can evaluate Commonwealth functions and consider those that are really irrelevant to the needs of this day and generation. The Review really goes much further than that. It is part of a whole program whereby we are seeking out cost cutting measures over a range of Commonwealth expenditure. This philosophy was manifested in the Budget. In the Budget, for the first time in many years, we have a domestic surplus. Most of us realise that running a nation is not very much different in economic terms from running the ordinary household. True, there are many differences in the scale of operations and in the quantum of money, but the economic principles are much the same. We cannot continue to live beyond our means or continue to service by debt recurrent expenditure of government, such as the paying of politicians' salaries, public servants' salaries and the cost of pensions. This is all part of this whole economic philosophy of living beyond one's means. Perhaps it is good economics to finance, partially, long term capital assets that will serve future generations through the creation of debt. It is certainly bad economics to live beyond one's means by creating debt to pay for recurrent expenditures of government. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we should make a positive contribution, that this review should be part of an on-going plan rather than be a one-off exercise. Whilst the imposition of staff ceilings may be a short term measure necessary to save government money, in the long term we must look at more appropriate measures. I use an analogy from the University of Tasmania. The department of information science, a growing faculty, is housed in prefabricated buildings. The staff ceiling imposed does not recognise the growth departments and departments in need. Therefore, I believe that we have to look at programs that will evaluate the whole function of government in terms of the needs of our present society. I believe that we must seek, therefore, to develop programs and functions that are appropriate to the needs of our decade rather than to continue to build on programs, patterns and administrations that have grown like Topsy, that inhibit communication and that are too costly in terms of modern technology. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier I mentioned some of the problems of negativism. We must seek to adopt modern technology, provided always that in so doing we employ adequate safeguards. For instance, we could with advantage introduce microelectronics techniques. I believe that, with the aid of mini-computers, we could have a degree of centralised policy-making yet carry out administration in decentralised areas of importance, or in the States, so that there could be personal contact with people. It is true that some old jobs will disappear, but if we hold back too long, whether in government or in private enterprise, in adopting such technology and cling instead to outdated techniques, we will be surpassed by those nations which do adopt it and, in the long term, will see our present standard of living disappear. </PARA>
<PARA> Last weekend His Grace, Archbishop Young, in addressing the Catholic Parents and Friends Association's annual meeting in Burnie, spoke of the dangers of nominalism. He was not using the term in a political context but his thoughts bear further examination. When we think of nominalism we can relate it to our church, to our ideals, to our morals and even to our political pursuasion. Although we speak of liberalism in many ways I believe that in the Review of Commonwealth Functions we have a demonstration of the application of that philosophy-along a line that we are pursuing for the first time. We are trying to amend things to ensure that they fit that philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA> To return to the subject of nominalism, all too often we hear research scientists and people from universities lament the proportion of students moving away from mathematics and physics studies and choosing instead what are really the soft options. That epitomises what is happening in our society today. We are seeking the easy way out and possibly tending to increase the range of government activities irrespective of need. In so doing we impose increasing burdens of taxation. As a party we must seek to loosen the shackles from the necks of the people. We must try to lift some of the burden of taxation. I believe that the Review of Commonwealth Functions was a first attempt in that direction. In other words, we must begin to appraise some of the sacred cows that gradually are being permitted to graze on what must, after all, be a limited pasture. </PARA>
<PARA> Every farmer knows that he must make allowance for the problems of drought and the difficulties of winter. We must look to the future. We must fine-tune government programs and philosophies in order to provide a worthwhile future for our children. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague, Senator Martyr, recently suggested that we should be looking at ways of removing some of the antiquated statutes, regulations and ordinances that no longer are applicable to our society. Too many people in our community believe that the Commonwealth has an unlimited purse, but we must remember that what they are advocating is the spending of the taxpayers' money. All too often we see deviations from the original intent of a statute, instrumentality or agency of government. Recently an example was provided by Qantas Airways Ltd. Unfortunately Qantas ran into financial difficulties as a result of unprofitable trading situations. When we look behind the balance sheet we find, first, an imbalance between debt and equity capital which is more synonymous with a highly geared finance company than a suitably run airline and, secondly, an involvement in hotels, in constructing new buildings and so on which take over $100m to complete. While the board of directors is concentrating on these things a proportion of its time is diverted from its true purpose, that of conducting an airline. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we need continuing monitoring from the Parliament to ensure that these statutory corporations are operating according to the dictates of the statute or ordinance that creates them. Let the managers manage. Regrettably there is interference from far too many interdepartmental committees. Some people on our side of politics have stated that these cost cutting measures have not gone far enough. I believe that the Opposition has failed to sustain the charges that have been levelled. I believe that we have a philosophy for the future. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment is charged by the Senate to maintain a continuing scrutiny of the problems of pollution and under this general reference the Committee, since March 1979, has been examining action taken to control pollution of the River Murray and to manage the adjacent environment. During its examinations the Committee has placed particular emphasis on the need for co-ordinated management of the River Murray. The report that Senator Collard has just tabled dealing with the problems caused by low flow in the River Murray and the closure of the Murray mouth is the third report that the Committee has made to the Senate dealing with the problems of the River Murray.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that on 30 April 1981 there was a complete closure of the mouth of the River Murray at Goolwa. This event aroused considerable interest, particularly in South Australia, and a number of adverse consequences were feared-in particular, that the sea would break through the Sir Richard Peninsula and contaminate the terminal lakes and the River Murray and that the high salinities in the Corrong could not be diluted by an inflow of water of lower salinity from the Southern Ocean. Evidence given to the Committee indicated that the closure of the mouth of the River Murray is not a particularly unexpected event in view of the conditions applying at the time, namely: No river flow for some 200 days; a long period of calm weather with the beach well built up; and a period of very small neap tides for a week or so preceding the actual closure. </PARA>
<PARA> Evidence given to the Committee indicates that it is extremely unlikely that the sea would break through the coastal dunes and bypass the Goolwa barrage. However, in this regard it is important to stress that the condition of the coastal dunes must be maintained and the Committee has drawn attention to the problems caused by off-road vehicle traffic. The South Australian Government is well aware of these problems and has been considering more stringent controls on off-road vehicles for some time. In the report the Committee has suggested that these be introduced as soon as possible. Following heavy rain, the opening of the Goolwa barrages and the cutting of a channel by the South Australian Engineering and Water Supply Department, the mouth of the Murray was reopened on 16 July 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has drawn attention in the report to the pressing need for a co-ordinated approach to the problems of the River Murray and has reiterated its previous recommendation that the River Murray Commission be empowered to administer a co-ordinated strategy for dealing with the River Murray. The Committee has also recommended that the Commonwealth and the States should consider the establishment of a national body to determine water quality standards and to set guidelines with respect to the future development along all Australian river systems. The Committee welcomes the recent amendments to the River Murray Waters Agreement giving powers to the River Murray Commission in respect of water quality. However, the Committee has again restated its view that the agreement does not go far enough. What is still lacking is a co-ordinated and effective implementation of the technical solutions to the problems of the River Murray. The Committee has drawn attention to the incredibly protracted process by which amendments were agreed to. The process commenced in March 1973 with a meeting between the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the three Premiers, with final agreement being reached in October 1981-a period of over eight years and which makes changes in the decision making process quite imperative. The Committee notes with interest that the new agreement will enable account to be taken of the quality of tributary inflows and man-made outflows in determining the entitlements of each State to Rivery Murray water. However, the rules by which such a system would operate have yet to be developed and agreed to. The Committee would hope that such a vital element for river management will be agreed to without delay. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Committee welcomes the recognition by the Commonwealth and the States that improved irrigation techniques are a vital element in combating salinity and drainage problems and that a Commonwealth-State working party has been set up to look at possible future incentives to hasten the introduction of improved techniques. In this regard the Committee has recommended that the Commonwealth give immediate consideration to providing additional finance to the States for such purposes. </PARA>

The River Murray Commission, as it was, had a remarkable similarity to the United Nations Security Council in that if there was only one dissenting voice in the form of a veto, nothing very much happened. It is a milestone that there has been a gradual submergence of State rights. I say that because the Snowy Mountains project, the great effort of the post-war period in Australia, came about only when Premiers like Sir William McKell looked beyond their State boundaries to the common effort with the Government of the day under Ben Chifley. In this current time, whether the State government happens to be Labor or Liberal, there is a lesson to be learned by looking back and emulating the unity of purpose that was manifest when the Snowy Mountains project became a reality. I think the Committee will certainly watch closely to see that the River Murray Waters Agreement is not just a scrap of paper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst I am on my feet-I know that Senator Jessop will concur with me-I point out that our presence in the area I think ensured that anyone who had any ideas about jeopardising the pelican habitat with trail bikes realised that public opinion was against it. So it was an effective assignment. The fact that the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environmnent is a permanent feature or a component of this Senate will cause it to act equally as a watchdog as it did in relation to certain forest promises that were given, including the Gippsland forest where our vigilance was able to ensure that the Leadbeater's Possum habitat was maintained. That will be the theme that we will be following. </PARA>

<PARA>The Problem</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Six years ago today the Whitlam Government was dismissed from office and forced to a premature election by the then Governor-General, following the failure of the Opposition-dominated Senate to pass the annual Appropriation Bills. The 1975 constitutional crisis was undoubtedly one of the most traumatic events in Australia's political history, with the community deeply divided-not always on strict party lines-as to the legitimacy of what occurred. A legacy of bitterness was created by the actions of the Senate and the intervention of the Governor-General which still shows little sign of dissipation. Perhaps even more importantly, an institutional legacy was also clearly established by the events of 1974 and 1975, whereby no government lacking a secure majority in the Senate can any longer look forward to seeing out its full term. If an opposition see it as politically advantageous to use them, the weapons are ready to hand every six months with the recurring Supply and Appropriation Bills. The potential for instability inherent in the letter of the Australian Constitution has at last been fully realised. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1975 nothing has changed. The Constitution has not been amended in any relevant respect. It remains within the power of the Senate to block Supply and within the power of the Governor-General to dismiss governments retaining the confidence of the House of Representatives and to dissolve the Parliament. Moreover, since 1 July this year the practical preconditions for the exercise of these powers have once again been created, with the Government's loss of control of the Senate. Until now the new Senate has exercised its power in a cautious and principled way, with neither the Australian Labor Party nor the Australian Democrats being willing to block in any way the passage of those money Bills crucial to the survival of any government in office, or to interfere with those measures for which the Government could reasonably claim a mandate. But nor have the Opposition parties, which with Senator Harradine constitute a clear cut 33-31 majority in this chamber, been inhibited in forcing major changes to measures-such as sales tax, social security and tertiary fees-in respect of which the Government may not be able to claim an explicit electoral justification, but which are undoubtedly important to its overall governing strategy. Nor can it be assumed that, as parties, personalities and the political environment change, the present non-Government parties will always maintain their absolutist opposition to using their greatest weapon. The Liberal Party of Australia and the National Country Party may yet reap the whirlwind they have themselves sown. </PARA>
<PARA>The Whitlam and Court Solutions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Most of the debate so far about amending the Constitution to avoid a repetition of the events of 1975 has centred around the two more or less extreme solutions which have been championed respectively by Mr Whitlam on behalf of the ALP and Sir Charles Court on behalf of the Liberal and National Country parties at meetings of the Australian Constitutional Convention. The Whitlam solution is simply, without more, to remove from section 53 of the Constitution any power of the Senate to reject or 'in any other manner block' money Bills. The Court solution, on the other hand, would confirm and institutionalise the Senate's existing stranglehold over the House of Representatives by requiring an automatic double dissolution, without vice-regal intervention, in the event that the Senate failed to pass a Bill 'appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government' within 30 days. </PARA>
<PARA> When these propositions were debated at the Perth Constitutional Convention in July 1978, the Court proposal was adopted following a close division on party lines. Standing Committee D of the Convention has subsequently given the Court proposal detailed drafting consideration, but, given the record of abject failure of referendum proposals that have failed to secure a significant measure of cross-party support, it remains unlikely that it will ever be put to referendum. Equally it must be acknowledged that the Whitlam proposal, were it to be put to referendum in the reasonably foreseeable future, would probably not have a much greater chance of success. </PARA>
<PARA>The Fixed Term Parliament Solution</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> If we are to have some sane resolution of a constitutional situation which has been acknowledged on both sides of politics to be manifestly unsatisfactory, and which is likely to blow up again at any time, it is evident that a search has to be made for an amendment formula which is acceptable, albeit perhaps as a second best, to everyone. A solution has to be found, the acceptance of which by either side of politics does not involve either a confession of past error or loss of present face, and the implementation of which offers advantages for both sides. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in this spirit that the proposal for a constitutional amendment to implement a system of fixed term parliaments has been developed, written and talked about by a number of people over the last two years. For example, I refer to the article by Geoffrey Lindell entitled 'Fixed Term Parliaments: The Proposed Demise of the Early Federal Election', in Australian Quarterly of autumn 1981 and the references to the work of Dean Jaensch and others cited therein. It is in that spirit that the proposal is now advanced by me on behalf of the Australian Labor Party in this private member's Bill. Although there are many possible variations of detail when one gets down to questions of actual implementation of the fixed term concept, the essence of the fixed term proposal for me, and for almost everyone else who has supported the concept, is this: The government of the day, so long as it retains the confidence of the House of Representatives, is guaranteed its full term of office and cannot be forced against its will to an early election, by a hostile Senate or anyone else, but in return for that security the government loses the power to manipulate election dates to suit its own political advantage. </PARA>
<PARA>Advantages of Fixed Terms</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> A system of fixed term parliaments or, to be more precise, fixed House of Representatives terms-since Senate terms, of course, have always been fixed-has a number of distinct advantages, quite apart from its impact on relations between the two Houses. Most obviously, it creates a stable political environment in which governments could plan and execute policy in a more coherent and systematic way than they seem able to at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Regularly recurring cycles make all forms of planning, and especially forward budgetary programming, much easier. The advantages of stability are not necessarily confined to governments, as Professor Colin Howard pointed out in his paper to the 1981 Australasian Study of Parliament Group workshop on fixed term parliaments, oppositions should be better able to prepare and present policies of greater depth and durability than tends to be the case when baskets of electoral ammunition have to be kept ready to hand at all times against the threat of a snap election. Also from an Opposition viewpoint, the introduction of a fixed term system would of course remove one of the major advantages of incumbency, the ability of a government to bring on an election at a time of its own choosing. Governments will always have more means available to them than oppositions to manipulate a favourable electoral climate, but fixed term parliaments at least do something to even the race. </PARA>
<PARA> From another perspective entirely, fixed term parliaments have the advantage of removing from the unelected office of Governor-General much of the discretionary power to dismiss and dissolve now vested in it, which power in recent years has necessarily tended-with unhappy results of which we are all aware-to politicise that office. Again, to the extent that this is an advantage-and I suggest it is seen as such by most Australians who regard themselves as having something of a surfeit of electoral democracy-fixed term parliaments would be likely to result in a reduction in the number of elections held over any given 10 to 15 year period. But important as all these considerations are, the central and overriding advantage of the fixed term concept is simply that, as a possible solution to the constitutional problems of 1975, it is really, as an American might say, 'the only game in town'. It is not only a principled solution to the problem of 1975, but it is also a politically more realistic solution, simply because it does involve significant elements of trade-off or compromise in a way that the Court and Whitlam proposals, and others like them, do not. </PARA>
<PARA> On the one hand, the government of the day is, for all practical purposes, guaranteed a full term notwithstanding the existence of a hostile Senate: The constitutional possibility of there being an early election means that, even in the absence of any direct amendment of the Senate's powers under section 53-and it may be a matter of argument as to whether there needs to be such an amendment-there would simply be no point in the Senate blocking Supply. The resulting chaos if it did would be seen as all the Senate's own work, and there would be no possibility of political rescue by the Governor-General from an unpopular position, as occurred in 1975. What the Whitlam proposal sought to do directly, the fixed term parliaments proposal does very indirectly: The limitation on the Senate's powers of life and death over the properly elected government is a corollary of a major institutional change having a number of advantages in its own right, rather than itself being the be all and end all of the change. As I have said elsewhere, fixed term parliaments offer a way of clambering round the Senate obstacle without actually dynamiting it out of existence. And whereas the sole beneficiary of the Whitlam proposal was the government of the day, whichever it was, the fixed term parliament proposal does have an obvious countervailing advantage for oppositions in the removal of the government's power to fix election dates. </PARA>
<PARA>Possible Disadvantages</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Are there any major and obvious disadvantages of the fixed term concept which should be stated at this stage and weighed in the balance? I refer here to objections of a general kind, and not to criticisms of matters of detail going to the mode of implementation of the concept, which I will outline below and about which there are bound to be differing views which in turn may or may not be able to be accommodated at the Committee stage of this debate. The likely second reading type objections fall into four categories. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first place, of course, there will be those who argue that there is simply no problem inherent in the present balance between the two Houses, in the overriding discretionary powers vested in the Governor-General, and in the way those various powers were exercised in 1974 and 1975. As to this, it is perhaps sufficient to say that the Bill is premised on the assumption that there is a problem, one that is likely to recur in future for both sides of politics, and one which both sides genuinely want to solve. Even Sir Charles Court's resolution was premised, it will be recalled, on the necessity-or at least desirability, so it was argued-of removing the Governor-General's independent discretionary power in the event of another Supply crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> A second objection, put for example by Senator Lewis at the Australasian Study of Parliament Group workshop on fixed term parliaments last August, to which I have already referred, is that while the fixed term system might work well enough now, it will break down in the event that clear and stable majorities in the House of Representatives cease to become the norm in future, for example, as a consequence of the introduction of proportional representation. Is it not the case, the argument goes, that in this situation-or indeed even now in the event of a party split or a series of by-election defeats-it may often happen that no government can command a sustained vote of confidence, and does not this mean there is then the possibility that, as Senator Lewis put it, 'the nation could have suffered irreparable damage while a government thrashed about aimlessly but secure in the knowledge that nothing could force it to the polls'? Assuming for the sake of argument-but not conceding-that the possibility of greater fragmentation in the House of Representatives is a real one, much of the answer to this kind of objection depends on how the 'no confidence' provisions in the scheme are drafted: If, as is provided in the present Bill, an extraordinary early election can, and indeed must, be called in the event that a government loses a no confidence resolution and no alternative government is able to secure the confidence of the House within seven days, this will cover the great majority of the situations that in practice may arise. </PARA>
<PARA> The only situation it will not cover is the stalemate which may arise where those members holding the balance of power will not support the government in its legislative program, but at the same time will not join in a motion of no confidence. It ultimately becomes a matter for judgment whether the political dynamics and pressures that are likely to operate in the real world, and which will undoubtedly encourage pivotal members not to create chaos for its own sake, are such as to make this a real threat to the viability of the system. I do not think it will be, and I am reinforced in that position by a number of commentators, including Professors Sawer and Howard, who have argued that the problem of minority governments will essentially look after itself and that there should be no 'confidence' exception at all to the fixed term rule. </PARA>
<PARA> A third general objection is that the fixed term concept, by its very nature, rules out the possibility of a government with a very slender and fragile majority seeking an early renewal of its electoral mandate. Assuming that no government would want to debase itself by passing a 'technical' motion of no confidence in itself, or at least assuming that no government would want to be the first to establish the precedent, this consequence does follow. Again it is a matter of weighing the relative importance of this contingency against the variety of real and present problems which the introduction of fixed term parliaments would solve. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth general objection likely to be made is that the fixed term concept does not travel well. It may be appropriate to the United States, with its quite different presidential system of government, and to Norway and Spain-the only other two countries which, on Inter-Parliamentary Union data, have absolutely indissoluble parliaments-but, it will be said, it is not at all appropriate to Westminster systems of government like our own, where the Executive owes its existence to the legislature, and where there are a mass of conventions governing the relationship. Senator Lewis, in his ASPG workshop paper, has put it thus:</PARA>
<PARA> I am cautious about attempting to graft onto our Constitution an alien provision, derived from the constitution of another country. How can it be done without adopting the history, the mores, the checks and balances, and the conventions of the nation from which the concept has come?</PARA>
<PARA>The short answer to this is that no other country appears to have our peculiar combination of Westminster and federal government, with two equally powerful Houses. Our founding fathers were well enough aware that in vesting the Senate with the powers they did-equal in nearly every respect to those of the Representatives-they were building in an inherent inconsistency between the principles of responsible government and of federal bicameralism. </PARA>
<PARA> How exactly a government could be responsible to two Houses simultaneously, each of which was elected on an entirely different basis and was likely to divide on different lines, was a problem they left to future generations to solve. Essentially, they just hoped that good sense would prevail, and the problem would simply go away-and for 74 years that is exactly what happened. But now it is necessary for us to resolve the problem and, being an unusual problem-one that simply does not arise in Westminster systems elsewhere-it demands a specially tailored solution. It may be that other possible solutions to the problem are neater and cleaner-for example, the ALP policy, to which I still remain committed as a longer term goal, that not only should the Senate have no power to reject or block all money Bills, but also its power over all other classes of legislation should be reduced to that of mere delay for a maximum of six months. But the task for the present is to find a middle of the road solution which has a real chance of being implemented, and I believe that the fixed term parliament solution fits that description. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The text of the proposed amendment is necessarily somewhat long and complex, because of the range of technical matters with which it is necessary to deal, but the main elements in the Bill can be stated quite simply. </PARA>
<PARA>Basic Fixed Term Rule</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> New section 28 of the Constitution-clause 6 of the Bill-provides for a basic three-year term for the House of Representatives, with elections in future being required to be held, subject only to the two specific exceptions relating to no confidence motions and deadlocks which I will come to, on the third Saturday in November every third year, following dissolution of the Parliament on the last Thursday in October. New section 5, clause 2 of the Bill, provides that the Governor-General has no power-the no confidence and deadlock exceptions to one side-to dissolve the Parliament other than at this time; and a new section 64 of the Constitution, clause 10 of the Bill, makes it clear that the Governor-General cannot cut short the life of a government by dismissing his Ministers except upon them losing the confidence of the House. By amendments to sections 7, 9 and 13 of the Constitution-clauses 3, 4 and 5 respectively of the Bill-Senate terms are described as equivalent to two House of Representative terms, and the conditions are created for Senate elections to be always held at the same time as House of Representatives elections. Further amendments to sections 12 and 32 of the Constitution in clauses 5 and 7 of the Bill ensure that writs for House and Senate elections are issued at the proper time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill, it will be noted, is drafted specifically on the assumption that the House of Representatives term will remain its present three years, and that the Senate term will be twice that-normally six years, again as at present. There is strong argument to be made for the Representatives term to be extended to four years, following the example now being set in the States. The Bill could easily be altered to accommodate this change. It is a more familiar and easily understood change than the fixed term concept, and it might well attract strong cross-party support. The difficulty with the four year proposal, however, is that it immediately raises the question of the duration of senators' terms. The only practical alternatives are a Representatives-length four years for senators-which is my preferred solution, and likely to be that of the ALP-or eight years, twice the Representatives term, which I would regard as unacceptably long, but which seems to have many supporters within the present Parliament, particularly on the Government side. In short, it seems unlikely that a consensus can readily be reached on the extended term issue, and since this is not only logically distinct from the fixed term issue but also a substantially lower constitutional priority, it has been thought preferable for present purposes to let the present situation as to the length of the term continue. </PARA>
<PARA> A question arises as to whether it is necessary or desirable to specify an actual date, namely, the third Saturday in November, as the ordinary due date for elections, particularly since the choice of any particular date, however much in accordance with precedent and however conveniently it may fit the annual Budget cycle, is likely to excite a degree of controversy. Technically it is not necessary to specify any particular date; it could simply be provided that the next election date should be no more, or less, than three years after the last, but this creates the possibility that, in the event of a double dissolution occurring at an odd or difficult time of the year, for example, January, or Easter, or in Budget month, the Parliament would thereafter-or at least until the next double dissolution-be locked into an awkward electoral cycle. It was also felt desirable to introduce-as an extra disincentive to extraordinary elections-as much certainty, regularity and familiarity into the election cycle as humanly possible. As will be seen below, the difficulty in restoring a November election date cycle even after an extraordinary dissolution is easily overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> If the objection to any particular date being set is that some disaster may intrude to make it in fact impossible to hold the election on that date, one can only reply that the Americans seem to have been lucky in this respect now for nearly 200 years in the dates of their Presidential elections. In the event, however, that some spectacular hazard did make polling impossible, no doubt the courts would find it possible to beat off any vexatious litigant claiming the nullity of an election held on the closest possible alternative date; it should not be impossible for the courts legally to come up with some application of the principle lex non cogit ad impossibilia, or in English, the law does not compel the impossible. </PARA>
<PARA>First Exception: No Confidence Resolution</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Section 5-clause 6-provides for the House to be dissolved in the event that a formal resolution of no confidence, of which at least 24 hours notice has to be given, is passed against the Government, and that there is no further resolution passed by the House within 7 days expressing confidence in an alternative Ministry. The House is expressly required to meet within seven days, if it is not otherwise scheduled to do so, in order that this confidence question can be tested. By virtue of new sections 13 and 28, an election must be held for the Representatives-and half the Senate-four weeks after the dissolution. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that there is no obligation imposed upon the government to resign immediately upon the passage of such a no confidence motion; its obligation to do so, on pain of dismissal under the new section 64 if it does not, arises only after a motion of confidence has been carried in an alternative Ministry. In the event that no alternative government can be formed in this way, the defeated government will remain in office during the election period. In the event that the government does resign after the passage of a no confidence motion, the Governor-General is free to appoint an alternative Ministry but he must, under the new section 5, dissolve the Parliament in the event that that new government does not secure the confidence of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no specific provision made to cover the situation where a Prime Minister or one or more of his Ministers simply resigns without there having been a no confidence resolution passed. By virtue of section 64, the Governor-General would simply act to fill the gaps, and his judgment would then be subject to testing in the ordinary way by the no confidence provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The loss of confidence provisions outlined here have been drafted to cover a situation which, it seems generally agreed, should amount to an exception to the fixed term rule, albeit that changes of allegiance in the lower House have not forced a single election since Federation, and that it is unlikely that they will be any more common in the reasonably foreseeable future. It has been suggested by some that it may be possible to use the section 5 no confidence dissolution procedure to drive a coach and horses through the whole fixed term concept, the argument being that all the Government has to do to bring on an early election at a time of its own choosing, is to arrange for a so-called 'technical' no confidence motion to be passed by its supporters in the House of Representatives. All one cay say to this is that while it remains a theoretical possibility, it is very difficult to see it being applied-at least for the first time-in practice. A government which is seen to be willing to express no confidence in itself is going to have a lot of difficulty plausibly claiming the confidence of the electors. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if it could live with this potential embarrassment, for a government to act in the manner suggested would be a flagrant breach of the spirit of the new provisions, and it could be expected to incur a good deal of wrath from the media and other opinion leaders if it tried it on. </PARA>
<PARA>Second Exception: Senate Deadlock</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed that the other-and only other-circumstance enabling an early election to be called in breach of the basic fixed term rule, should be the case of a sustained deadlock between the two Houses, which the government in the House of Representatives chooses to break by advising a double dissolution. The main reason for preserving this possibility is to give the House of Representatives some weaponry with which to fight an Opposition-dominated Senate bent on destroying, delaying or emasculating its legislative program. It is a matter for judgment as to just how significant a weapon the threat of a double dissolution is these days. Much obviously depends on the political circumstances prevailing at the time, and it is difficult to usefully generalise. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that in the Bill, as it is drafted, the Senate's opportunities for harrassing the government are significantly limited. The proposed new section 53-clause 8 of the Bill-removes the right of the Senate to hold up for more than one month the passage of any money Bill, including the annual Supply and Appropriation Bills. Largely this merely formalises what would happen anyway under the basic fixed term rule, since if a Senate simply cannot force an early election upon the House against its will there would be no political advantage-and in fact a good deal of disadvantage-in its creating a Supply crisis. It is true that with section 53 amended in this way there is also no point in an Opposition building up a 'stockpile' of twice rejected Bills, which it can then-as happened in 1974 and 1975-demand the government use, in the context of a supply crisis, as a vehicle for calling an early election. This removes a little of the room for manoeuvre which the Senate would have otherwise retained, but is unlikely in practice-with governments being much more cautious about creating stockpiles in the future than they were in the past-to have amounted to much of an advantage. In any event, with section 53 amended in this way it is appropriate to remove money Bills altogether from the ambit of section 57, and the Bill-clause 9-does just that.</PARA>
<PARA> A more significant and far reaching change to section 57 is the incorporation in it of the recommendations of the all-party 1959 Joint Committee on Constitutional Review. The main change is the addition of an alternative option for a government when its legislation fails to pass the Senate after successive presentations three months apart. Under the new section 57 the government of the day will have the option of advising either a double dissolution, as at present, or a joint sitting in lieu thereof. This is consistent with the general policy of the Bill, which is to insist so far as possible on the fixed term principle being maintained, and to ensure that extraordinary elections are kept to an absolute minimum. Although first appearances are perhaps to the contrary, this new option has some advantages from the Senate point of view to the extent that it means that the Senate does not necessarily risk an election, as it does at the moment, by maintaining its objections to a Bill for longer than three months. </PARA>
<PARA>Restoring the Election Cycle after an Extraordinary Dissolution</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> With the possibility thus created, under sections 5 and 57, for extraordinary elections to be held before the ordinary three year term has expired, it is necessary to make some provision to ensure not only that House and Senate elections occur simultaneously-accomplished by new sections 9, 12 and 13-but also that the ordinary election cycle is restored as soon as possible. One alternative would be, at least in the case of a section 5 dissolution of the House of Representatives, simply to provide for the incoming government to see out what was left of the term of its predecessor, and then for another election to be held at the due date in the normal way. The main difficulty with this is that it creates the possibility of elections being held very closely together-perhaps as little as a month apart-and that it is one of the objects of the fixed term parliament amendment to avoid the expense and inconvenience of elections which are not, on any view of democratic principles, absolutely necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> This difficulty could in turn be solved by fixing some band of time-say three months prior to the ordinary election date in November-whereby if an extraordinary election were held during this time it would be unnecessary to hold a further election on the ordinary due date. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill in fact adopts a variation of the last mentioned proposal. Section 28, clause 6, provides in essence that if an extraordinary election is held within a period six months prior to the ordinary election date in any year, then the term runs for three plus years, for example until the ordinary date three Novembers hence, whereas if the extraordinary election occurs within six months following the ordinary November date in any year, then the term runs for three minus years-for example until the ordinary date three Novembers hence. Thus, for example, assuming an election is due in the ordinary course in November 1983, an extraordinary election occurring anywhere between June 1981 and May 1982-for example six months either side of the closest 'ordinary date', November 1981-would require the next election to be held in November 1984. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill grapples with problems of great complexity, but it is difficult to overstate their constitutional importance. If the Bill is passed by this Parliament and then by the Australian people in a referendum, it will amount to probably the most far-reaching change to our constitutional arrangements since Federation. It is perhaps easy under these circumstances to dismiss the Bill as essentially some kind of academic pipe-dream with no ultimate chance of attracting the broad cross-party support which we know to be a necessary-if not sufficient-condition of securing constitutional reform. </PARA>
<PARA> But I remain reasonably confident that when its implications are fully absorbed and understood-and even more importantly when the alternatives are considered-a new fixed term parliament system will be seen by most members and senators as the only presently realistic solution to the institutional problems inherent in our present Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> To ensure that the terms of the Bill are fully understood, and that there is ample time for reaction to flow back in not only from politicians and other parties but also from the community at large, it is proposed to defer debate on this Bill until early in the Autumn session next year. If significant reform is to be achieved the process of building consensus must be followed out, however laborious and frustrating for all concerned it may be. I simply express the hope that in the debate which will arise we all resist the temptation to engage in cheap and easy political point scoring, and approach the exercise in a co-operative and constructive spirit. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>General Paper by Senator Austin Lewis</PARA>
<PARA> ''Liberty has never come from the government . . .''</PARA>
<PARA>Woodrow Wilson</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The current enthusiasm for the concept of a ''fixed term'' for the House of Representatives appears to be related directly to the events of 1974-75 and the sudden interest then in the constitutional powers of the Senate over all Bills, but particularly over money bills-an interest which was minimal on the occasion of the 1974 double dissolution but which erupted in 1975 into what has so often, then and still, been described, in accordance with the modern ''headline catching'' manner, as a ''constitutional crisis''. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. The background papers (and Professor Howard's previous papers) tend to comment at length (in what is known as a ''single issue'' fashion) on the subject of the Senate and its powers. The fixed term proposal is taken as having, as its starting point, the desirability of establishing a back door method of ensuring that the Senate's powers are limited, not by formal amendment (the difficulty of which is recognized, particularly in Dr Colin Hughes' paper) but by so restricting their operation that, in the words of Senator Evans, it would be more likely to be politically acceptable than a direct challenge either to affirm or deny those powers. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Is this a genuinely sufficient reason for introducing a fixed term system, with the problems inherent in such a system? Should the Constitution be altered just to suit the wishes of those who are preaching an anti-Senate line? We should be very wary of altering the Constitution so that it fits the current political and party set-up, which may well change in the future. A fixed term House of Representatives might be suitable for the present situation, where there are two opposing political groups with a high degree of stability, but if Australia should develop a European-type multi-party set-up or return to a 19th century instability in political allegiances (either is possible) a fixed term House of Representatives could be a nuisance; and does ''stability'', in the minds of its proponents, really mean executive domination and inviolability? A fixed term would mean that no government need fear the perils of mismanagement, corruption or incompetence as no mechanism would exist to demand an appeal to the electorate. It is immaterial whether such a government would be banished from office at the end of its term. What is of vital importance is that the nation could have suffered irreparable damage while a government thrashed about aimlessly but secure in the knowledge that nothing could force it to the polls. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. The great authorities on the British and American Constitutions, such as Walter Bagehot on the British side and Woodrow Wilson on the American side, believed that the fact that the lower house can be dissolved at any time and the executive can appeal to the electorate is one of the great strengths of the British as against the American System. It would be foolish to abandon this feature of our Constitution without more careful consideration of its advantages. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. There are valid reasons why a government should want to have an early election without being defeated in the lower House, apart from the desire to choose a convenient time, which many, including Senator Evans, seem to think is the only reason for governments wanting early elections. </PARA>
<PARA> For example:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a government with a small majority may be about to make some grave change of policy, but may wish to seek the opinion of the electorate; Oppositions abuse governments for taking serious steps for which they have no electoral mandate; how are they to seek a mandate with a fixed term House of Representatives?</PARA>
<PARA> (b) A House of Representatives due to some party split, may harass and frustrate a government without passing a motion of no confidence, thereby preventing an election while maintaining a weak government in office; why should not a government in such a situation be able to appeal to the electorate?</PARA>
<PARA> 6. If the majority of the House of Representatives seeks to overthrow a Government and instal another government in office, without holding an election, why should not the defeated government be able to appeal to the electorate to test the opinion of the country on the change? There are good grounds for saying that the recent change of government in Papua New Guinea, for example, was undemocratic in that the electorate did not have the opportunity of endorsing the new government. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. Many astute modern politicians, for example, Mr Norman St John-Stevas, a former Leader of the House of Commons, in his introduction to the collected works of Bagehot, have declared that the supposed hold which a Prime Minister has over his followers by the threat of an early election is illusory. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. There may be good reasons for postponing or bringing forward an election, particularly to avoid holding an election during some grave crisis. It has been well pointed out that the Americans have been extremely lucky that their presidential elections have not fallen due at times of grave crisis; for example, if President Lincoln had been elected a year later or had had to stand for re-election a year earlier the secession of the Southern States would have succeeded. What if the British had been forced by a written Constitution to hold an election in the summer of 1940 (during the Blitz)?</PARA>
<PARA> 9. There is no guarantee that a House of Representatives with a fixed term would provide a more effective check and scrutiny of the executive than does the present House. To the contrary, a very respectable argument could be made out that the combination of party discipline and the 'unavoidability' or inevitability of electoral events might well produce an even more stagnant chamber, with an entrenched executive free from any real influence. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. Perhaps some real consideration should be given to the proposition that the present non-fixed term of whatever length (most commonly described as a choice between 3 and 4 years) is perhaps not as bad as some fixed term proponents claim. Perhaps, also, with the passage of time, some consideration should be given to the proposition that, in the Australian federal system-and this should be stressed, as the Australian Federal Parliament is not directly comparable with any other legislature-the checks and balances provided within the Constitution worked as they should in both 1974 and 1975. But the argument that a constitutional crisis occurred in 1975 has become part of the received wisdom of political debate. May I suggest for serious analysis that, on the contrary, constitutional safeguards operated as they should in 1975?</PARA>
<PARA> Much has been made of the partisan role of the Senate and the Governor-General at that time. Are we to suggest, though, that party played no part in the House of Representatives? Let us speculate for a moment whether there might have been a disaffected group of Government members in the Lower House. What option was open to them in a Parliamentary system? Would it have been possible, under Constitutional conventions and practices governing the conduct of the House of Representatives in Australia, to vote against their Leader on the floor of the House, or against a significant measure introduced by the Government of the day? And let us try to be realistic-is it conceivable that members who are totally dissatisfied with their Leader would vote to bring about an election at a time when their own seats would be in greatest jeopardy?</PARA>
<PARA> I do not pretend to be describing what might have been happening at the time: I merely suggest that the enormous concentration on conventions supposedly applicable to the two other constituent parts of Parliament has ensured that consideration of conventions applicable to the third component-the House of Representatives-has been studiously ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> In this same vein, the assumption that in 1975 the Governor-General was 'final arbiter' in dismissing a constitutionally elected government may also be challenged. Is it not reasonable to suggest that his action ensured that the electors-surely, within a parliamentary democracy, the absolute arbiters between competing contenders for governmental power-were, by the so-called 'arbitrary' action of the Governor-General, permitted to cast the final judgment? No clear solution has occurred to many people since those events, other than (a) abolition of Senate powers and, consequently, (b) absolute domination and freedom of executive action. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. It is interesting to look at the situation in the United States. Watergate occurred in June 1972. Nixon resigned in August 1974, but the people did not get a chance to vote out his successor until November 1976, and President Carter did not take office until January 1977-4 1/2 years after Watergate. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there has always been criticism of the fixed term in the United States, but in the wake of Watergate and the rising concern about world events there has been a resurgence of that criticism. So while we are debating the merits of fixed terms, they are debating the merits of flexible election dates. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. So far as the length of Parliamentary terms is concerned, it is worth pointing out, as a matter of historical interest, that despite the constraints perceived in the present 3-year term, only once in the history of the Australian Federal system has the House of Representatives been dissolved ''by effluxion of time'', in accordance with section 5 of the Constitution. Only on very few occasions has the House of Representatives lasted for three years from the date of the previous election: in fact, the average ''life'' of a House of Representatives since 1901 has been about 2 1/2 years. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that Senator Evans puts forward the view that, if the term of the House of Representatives is extended to four years, a four-year term for Senators is the best available option, on the ground that a term longer than 6 years-the only reasonable alternative under a 4-year Parliamentary system- would make Senators less accountable to both party and people. </PARA>
<PARA> Serious consideration needs to be given, however, to preserving the continuity of the Senate itself-as distinct from the length of Senators' terms. Let me put to you an unashamedly biased Senate view on the implication, contained in Senator Evans' paper, that all Senators should be elected together at the same time as Members of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> My view is that the Parliament-as an institution-has previously maintained whatever support it has (however little that may unfortunately be) through the activities of the Senate and, in particular, its Committees-and that those few favourable concepts that exist in the perhaps mythical ''public mind'' owe much to the scrutiny, the critical and constructive roles, which flow from a popularly elected proportionately-representative, independent House, where the members have a sufficiently long term to develop and pursue interests, and the chamber itself has a continuing existence, largely unfettered by government domination. The most simple example of such benefits is in the capacity for the Senate's Committees to get on with the job ''notwithstanding any prorogation or dissolution of the House of Representatives''. The alternative of ''shutting up shop'' to suit the convenience of the government of the day is not one that appeals. </PARA>
<PARA> 13. If Parliament is to survive, let alone prosper, it must maintain its independence. A lack of capacity in the Houses to express freedom of action-whether by overturning governments or otherwise-restricts the effectiveness of the people's representatives. It places them more and more under the yolk of executive domination. I suggest that we should consider whether the fixed term proposal would go any distance towards giving the Parliament independence. I am cautious about attempting to graft on to our Constitution an alien provision, derived from the Constitution of another country. How can it be done without adopting the history, the mores, the checks and balances, and the conventions, of the nation from which the concept has come?</PARA>
<PARA> In your determination to ensure that the events of 1975 never happen again, you are prepared to guarantee an elected government a term of 4 years, regardless of its behaviour. I do not see that as in any way advancing the freedom of the people-the Americans knew about the tyranny of government, and look at the safeguards in their Constitution, which we do not have. Let me quote to you something from Woodrow Wilson:</PARA>
<PARA> ''Liberty has never come from the government . . . The history of liberty is the history of the limitation of governmental power, not the increase of it.''</PARA>

<PARA> That the Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1981 No. 302 and made under the Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1976, be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to put a couple of questions. Is it possible to defer paying tax for five months and then receive indefinitely an effective 23 3/4 per cent interest rate on a deposit in a government trust account? Is it possible to defer paying a $30,000 tax bill for three years by depositing $50,000 in a trust account for one year on which the depositor gets almost $5,000 in interest and evades forever a $4,000 tax bill? The answer to both those questions is yes, if a person has an off-farm income of $35,000 or above and substantial farming interests. Well-known groups of people who fit into that category are Cabinet Ministers and other Pitt Street farmers. This tax haven is not a function of previously unrecognised loopholes or of bizarre High Court judgments in favour of tax dodgers. The tax haven which I have outlined is the product of a series of deliberate government decisions, the last of which was contained in Statutory Rules 1981 No. 302 which I have moved to disallow. The actual motion is that the Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Regulations (Amendments), as contained in Statutory Rules 1981 No. 302 and made under the Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1976, be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA> Statutory Rules 1981 No. 302 increases from 7 per cent to 9 1/2 per cent the interest rate payable on funds lodged in a trust account known as income equalisation deposits. Superficially it seems quite reasonable that interest should be increased from 7 per cent to 9 1/2 per cent. Because that seems, superficially, reasonable the Government thought it could get away with the serious extension of a pre-existing tax haven. It is reasonable until one discovers that the deposit is deductible from taxable income. In fact, it can be deducted from taxable income before it is actually made. If one is one of the privileged people who qualify for participation in this tax haven one gets 9 1/2 per cent on one's money. One also gets 9 1/2 per cent on the taxpayers' money-on money that would otherwise have been paid in tax if the deposit was not made. If one is wealthy-that is, if one has an income of above $35,000-one can deposit $100 in an income equalisation deposit, which is, I stress, a trust account, a gilt-edged government security. By paying that $100 into the trust account, one's taxable income is reduced by $100 and the tax that one has to pay is reduced by $60. So, in effect, one deposits $60 of the taxpayers' money and $40 of one's own money. On that $40 one gets $9.50 interest every year, which, on the $40, is a rate of 23.75 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is hard to understand what I have just outlined and why this is a tax haven-a rort-imagine capital being subscribed to a company on a new share issue or on share purchases being fully deductible from taxable income five months before the share purchase is made. That is precisely what we are talking about here. We are talking about an investment like buying shares which is totally deductible from taxable income and may be deducted five months before the share purchase is made. Imagine subscriptions to government loans being deductible in advance from taxable income. Would anyone suggest anything so ludicrous as to make subscriptions to any old government loan fully deductible from taxable income and still attracting very close to the present rate of interest?</PARA>
<PARA> Among several spurious arguments circulated today by the National Farmers Federation is the argument that the interest paid is, itself, taxable. That, according to the National Farmers Federation, demonstrates that there is no rort or anomaly involved. Sure, the interest paid on the deposit is deductible. So is the interest paid on government loans, on savings bank accounts, or fixed deposits, and on building society accounts, and so it ought to be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of the unplanned termination of the broadcast just before 6 p.m., and since proceedings are now being broadcast, I reiterate some of the points that I made before 6 p.m. on this motion for disallowance of Statutory Rules 1981 No. 302. The Statutory Rule increases the nominal rate of interest on funds lodged in the Government trust account, known as income equalisation deposits, from 7 per cent to 9 1/2 per cent. But before moving on to that aspect I want to ask a few questions. Is it possible to defer paying tax for five months and then to receive, for an indefinite period, an effective interest rate of 23 3/4 per cent on a deposit in a government trust account-a gilt-edged government security indistinguishable from a Commonwealth bond? Is it also possible to defer paying a $30,000 tax bill for three years by depositing $50,000 in a trust account for one year on which almost $5,000 interest would be received and a $4,000 tax bill would be evaded forever?

Cabinet Ministers and other Pitt Street farmers are people who come readily to mind who fit into that category.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This tax haven is not a function of some previously unrecognised loophole in tax law, or of bizarre interpretations by the High Court in favour of tax judgments. The tax haven, which I have outlined, is the product of a series of deliberate government decisions, the last of which is contained in Statutory Rule 302. That Rule increases from 7 per cent to 9 1/2 per cent the interest rate payable on funds lodged in the trust account known as income equalisation deposits. That is superficially reasonable, given the present level of interest rates. The knowledge that it is superficially reasonable no doubt prompted the Government to believe that it could get away with what it has attempted to do. It seems reasonable until we discover that the deposit is fully deductible from taxable income. In fact, it can be deducted from provisional tax before the deposit is even made. If one is a member of the privileged group-a very small group that qualifies for this privilege-one gets 9 1/2 per cent on one's money. One gets also 9 1/2 per cent on the taxpayers' money-money which would otherwise have been paid in tax if the deposit was not made. If one is wealthy-that means if one has an income above $35,000-one can deposit $100 in an IED. That reduces one's taxable income by $100 and the tax payable by $60. So if one deposits $100 in fact $60 of it is taxpayers' money and $40 is one's own. Every year one gets $9.50 interest on the $40 which one has deposited, which gives an effective interest rate of 23 3/4 per cent. I stress the words an effective interest rate of 23 3/4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is hard to understand the arithmetic behind that, just imagine capital subscribed to a company or money spent purchasing shares on the stock exchange being fully deductible from taxable income five months before the shares were bought. Imagine subscriptions to government loans being deductible in advance from taxable income. Among several spurious arguments circulated today in a letter from the National Farmers Federation is the statement that the interest paid is taxable, which of course it is and so it ought to be. But the argument goes on to imply that the fact that the interest is taxable invalidates the fact that the effective rate of interest for someone on the maximum marginal tax rate is nearly 24 per cent. It is true that the interest paid on the deposit is taxable. So is the interest paid on government loans, savings bank accounts, fixed deposits with banks and building society accounts, and so it ought to be. But the only account into which the original deposit is tax deductible is the income equalisation deposit tax account. In that letter the National Farmers Federation is attempting to equate unlike things. Resorting to that sort of spurious argument further tarnishes its credibility which has already been seriously damaged by this issue. Because of the unique provision that the deposit is tax deductible, the effective interest rate for a depositor is positively tied to his or her taxable income. The higher the income, the higher the interest rate, which is innately inequitable. The National Farmers Federation restated defence of that proposition reveals something about its priorities and concerns about which I may say more later. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the gazettal of Statutory Rule 302 the effective interest rates for a depositor who has an income above $34,500 was a very generous 17 1/2 per cent. For someone whose income was below $17,000 it was a moderate 10.3 per cent. After Statutory Rule 302 was gazetted the effective interest rate for the high income taxpayer is 23 3/4 per cent and for those who earn less than $17,000-the low income taxpayer-the effective rate is 14 per cent. Honourable senators note that the increase in the interest rate for the high income taxpayer is 6 1/4 per cent and the increase in the effective interest rate for the low income taxpayer is 3.7 per cent. This tells us something more about how unequitable this proposition is. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not object to paying more than a 10.3 per cent interest rate under present circumstances. What I do object to is paying the rich nearly twice the interest rate that is paid to the poor for the same deposit. I object very strongly to the creation of a tax haven, especially by a government which purports to be cracking down on tax dodging at the very same time as it is seriously exacerbating, expanding and extending a pre-existing tax haven which it has created. I object very strongly to governments creating tax havens for Pitt Street farmers, including Cabinet Ministers. Moreover, this will actually harm low income farmers or anyone whose primary interest is in agriculture. The point that the creation of tax havens actually harms those who are interested in farming was put quite lucidly by the former Director of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, Dr Geoff Miller, at the Agro 79 Conference in Perth in March 1979. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Farmers should aim at achieving tax equity with other people in the community but not tax concessions not shared with others. </PARA>
<PARA> Tax concessions result in excessive entry into agriculture for the specific purpose of receiving the economic reward associated with the concession. Rural land values and the costs of other limited resources such as livestock and credit are inflated by this process. </PARA>
<PARA> Although individuals may benefit, the benefits of tax concessions to rural industries as a whole are likely to be negative. </PARA>
<PARA>This gross inequity in the present system sponsored by this Government of paying higher rates of interest to people with higher incomes is avoidable. The Industries Assistance Commission, in its original report on this matter in 1975, recommended that interest be paid on the deposit at a higher rate-incidentally, at the medium term bond rate which is currently between 12 per cent and 13 per cent-net of tax which would otherwise have been payable. Had that proposition been adopted, the effective rate of interest for all depositors would have been identical. The Government rejected that recommendation and opted for the policy of paying to the highest income depositors almost twice the rate of interest payable to the lower income depositors. I would support, and the Australian Labor Party would support, an effective rate of interest above 9 1/2 per cent if it was paid on the deposit net of tax deferred. I certainly will not support paying 23 3/4per cent to anyone, let alone help create tax havens for Pitt Street farmers and Cabinet Ministers which have been engineered by those Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to make too much of this point, but it was revealed some two years ago that the Prime Minister's wife and members of her family received, under somewhat sordid circumstances, government loans at 4 1/2 per cent. The question which arises is whether the wife of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and her relatives are currently receiving effectively 23 3/4 per cent by lending money to the Government. On two occasions-on 27 and 29 October-I sought from Senator Carrick, as the Minister representing the Prime Minister, a guarantee that people who come into the category, which includes half of the Fraser Cabinet, were not exploiting the tax haven that they had created by this decision to pay almost 24 per cent in interest. I received evasive answers from Senator Carrick at the time. Today, Senator McLaren received from Senator Carrick a further communication regarding those questions, which said that some 200,000 individuals would be eligible. Incidentally, only 12,000 have actually taken advantage of the scheme, but I will deal with that later. In response to the questions which Senator McLaren and I had asked, which were explicitly seeking a guarantee from the Prime Minister that neither he nor any of the other Ministers who are qualified to participate in, to take advantage of, or to exploit this tax haven were actually doing so, I received this reply:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . In addition, at meetings of Cabinet and its committees Ministers are required to disclose to their colleagues any interests which they have or which they know a member of their immediate family has, which conflict or might reasonably be thought likely to conflict with their public duty as a Minister. Ministers who disclose such interest only take part in the discussions in question . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The important point is that the Prime Minister is still evading the question as to whether he or any of the other Ministers clearly qualified to do so are exploiting the tax haven which they have created. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister refuses to make it public. The Ministers know that they can get away with it. They know that this is a highly complex issue and they think that they can get away with it. I might add that so far they have got away with it with an effrontery that it is almost impossible not to admire. The National Farmers Federation claimed today to be concerned about the effect of the disallowance of this regulation on struggling, low income farmers. In response to that I say that if the National Farmers Federation were really concerned about the effect on low income farmers it would back the IAC recommendation that interest not be paid on the tax deferred components of these deposits. Instead, the National Farmers Federation or its predecessor opposed that IAC recommendation-an opposition re-endorsed by the National Farmers Federation today. The unfortunate but I suppose predictable fact is that most farmer organisations present the perspective of the high income farmers who, incidentally, often have large non-farm incomes and dominate the farmers' organisations. I know that there are some exceptions. I know of at least one farmer leader from Western Australia who acknowledges that this is a rort which is indefensible by any rational or reasonable person.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to the degree of participation in the scheme and the degree to which this would affect those who are actually farmers. Of the 200,000-odd primary producer taxpayers who are eligible to participate in this scheme only 12,000 have actually lodged deposits. My source for that is page 33 of the last report of the Reserve Bank of Australia. I add that if Statutory Rule No. 302 is allowed to stand the number of depositors may not go up very much but I guarantee that the amount which is deposited will. </PARA>
<PARA> This tax haven set up by a series of Government decisions is very complex. The Government thought that the very complexity of the scheme would protect the Government from the exposure of its own infamy. This plan involves interaction between provisional tax, taxation averaging for primary producers, marginal tax rates and the rules governing the timing of deposits and their withdrawal. I will not try to explain in detail those interactions, rather I will take a couple of specific cases; for example, someone with an off-farm income of $60,000-again, a Cabinet Minister comes readily to mind-and a substantial farm income of, say, $25,000. At the end of March next year such a person could reduce by $30,000 the provisional tax assessed as payable by him on that day. In other words, he could avoid paying $30,000 in tax. To validate that action he must deposit $50,000 on or before 31 August of next year, that is, within five months. The $30,000 in tax remains unpaid tax for as long as the $50,000 remains deposited in the IED. Therefore, the break-up of the $50,000 investment is $30,000 from the rest of the taxpayers of Australia and $20,000 from the taxpayer who has the deposit. </PARA>
<PARA> On that deposit which, remember, includes $20,000 of the depositor's money, $4,750 is paid in interest-a rate of 23 3/4 per cent-and the deposit may be left there indefinitely. The taxpayer, or depositor, on an effective deposit of $20,000 of his own money picks up every year $4,750 in interest for as long as he cares to leave the money there and for as long as Statutory Rule 302 is not struck down by this Senate; that is, if one likes to look at it as an ongoing investment. There are other alternatives. Some one may look on it as partly an investment but primarily a means of deferring and evading taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take another hypothetical situation, someone with a farm income of $50,000 and $40,000 in off-farm income. On 31 March of next year such a person can reduce the provisional tax bill due for payment by him on that day by $30,000, provided that on or before the end of August of next year he deposits $50,000 in an IED. He may then withdraw that deposit on 1 December 1983, one year and one day after making it. As a result of that transaction he will receive $4,750 in interest for the one year of the deposit. The $30,000 in taxation, the payment of which was deferred as at the end of March 1982, would not be paid until 31 March 1985. In other words, the taxpayer will have borrowed $30,000 from the Government for three years and paid no interest, and will have lent $50,000 to the Government for one year and received almost $5,000 in interest. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not the end of it. The same taxpayer, who meets the criteria that I have stipulated, at the end of the exercise, for the three years in question, would have a total taxation bill of $132,420. If he had not manipulated his taxable income, through the use of an income equalisation deposit, the tax payable would have been $136,399. In other words, the taxpayer borrows $30,000 from the Government for three years and pays no interest, lends $50,000 to the Government for one year, gets almost $5,000 in interest, and evades forever the payment of $4,000 in taxation. The National Farmers Federation, in its letter circulated today, acknowledges that my arithmetic, in previous examples I had circulated, was correct. It said that they were extreme examples which made unrealistic assumptions, such as there being constant farm income, so I did another exercise, which again assumed high off-farm income and a fluctuating level of farm income of the type that is commonly encountered-indeed fluctuating between $20,000 and $40,000.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The taxpayer represented in the table which has just been incorporated has a farm income which varies throughout the period in question from $20,000 to $40,000 and a constant non-farm income of $40,000. Let us say that he or she puts $25,000 into an income equalisation deposit on 31 August next year and takes it out on 1 September 1984. For that 12 months, with $25,000 in the deposit, the taxpayer gets $2,375 in interest. In doing that, the taxpayer defers paying $15,000 in taxation from the end of March 1982 to the end of March 1985 and also permanently avoids paying $2,234 in tax. This is not an unrealistic example, but a very realistic one, since the National Farmers Federation wants to debate it on that level. The rewards for the taxpayer are that the taxpayer lends $25,000 to the Government for one year and gets $2,375 in interest; the taxpayer borrows $15,000 from the Government for three years, pays no interest at all and evades forever $2,234 in tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The National Farmers Federation also claimed in today's letter that my examples were dependent on:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . primary producers continually receiving farm income levels at the highest marginal tax rate . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is just factually wrong. They depend upon no such thing. They depend upon a high level of income being maintained whether or not it is farm income. I have cited a not atypical case; indeed, it is a case which would go very close to fitting precisely half the Federal Cabinet. With those sort of rewards, does anyone believe that Pitt Street farmers will not gobble up such a proposition, especially if other avenues for tax avoidance are closed off? Will many new Pitt Street farmers not do exactly what Geoff Miller said they would do-I have already quoted that view-to, I stress, the disadvantage of all bona fide farmers who want to remain farmers? The small farmers in particular, who do not use IEDs anyway, will become hurt by that process. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Farmers Federation in its letter said that it knows of nobody manipulating IEDs to avoid tax by destabilising taxable incomes. Incidentally, I note that the tax reward for destabilising taxable income utterly contradicts the very reason for the existence of income equalisation deposits which is supposed to be to smooth out fluctuations in taxable income. There may not have been many doing it up to now, but with 24 per cent interest going for a deposit as well as all the other incentives that were previously available, one would have to be very naive to believe that it will not be exploited in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> To stop that exploitation, that ripping off of the taxpayers, that undesirable encouragement of off-farm capital into agriculture, it is essential to disallow this regulation, which is the last of a series of regulations and rules that an incompetent or malevolent government has introduced. The Senate cannot correct all of those past mistakes but it can stop this latest and most serious extension of a government-created tax haven. As in so many other cases with this Government, what is displayed here is gross incompetence, inequity and a stench of corruption. Are the Ministers who made these rules actually exploiting them? I have absolutely no doubt that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) is as disgusted by this statutory regulation and the things which preceded it as I am. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walsh continues to make statements imputing all sorts of things about other people for which he has no substantiation. I think we should ignore that part of his speech and address ourselves to the matter that is before the Senate. Perhaps we ought to begin by asking whether Senator Walsh speaks for the Australian Labor Party, or are we to look at the statements of those who represent certain areas of interest as spokesmen for the Labor Party? Senator Walsh shows a continuing capacity to ignore the policy of his own party and places his colleagues in a difficult and embarrassing position. I think it will be of interest to some of his colleagues on the front bench and those in his party who have an interest in primary industry matters to read what he said tonight about the Income Equalisation Deposits Scheme. I understood that the Australian Labor Party supported the policy of the Income Equalisation Deposits Scheme. I heard from Senator Walsh tonight how he would like to see the scheme implemented and the changes that he wishes to make. He referred to the Industries Assistance Commission recommendation with regard to it. I wonder whether he was stating Labor Party policy in the speech that he just gave?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we look at the statement on 19 August of the Australian Labor Party spokesman on primary industry, Mr John Kerin, we find that he welcomed the general economic approach of the Government in the Budget. He made certain comments regarding the Budget's effect on the rural sector. He welcomed the general economic approach of the Government and he further said that primary producers would welcome the Government's continued approach of fighting inflation. I think that that was a fairly sensible approach to his area of responsiblity. In criticism of the Budget, however-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; He did not say for the lower income earners. He said he hoped that the Government would lift the interest paid on income equalisation deposits. Mr Kerin made that statement on behalf of the Labor Party. It was his Budget statement. Perhaps we ought to say that this is precisely what the Government has done. It has lifted the interest rate that is paid on income equalisation deposits; it has done the very thing that was suggested by the spokesman on primary industry for the Labor Party. We ought to look then at why the Government has increased the interest rates payable on these deposits. Perhaps some background ought to be given. Senator Walsh traversed some of the background to the introduction of this scheme. It was introduced by the Government in the 1976-77 Budget. It was one of a number of initiatives taken for the benefit of the rural sector. Under the scheme-I think some of these facts are known quite widely-eligible primary producers can obtain an income tax deduction in the year that income equalisation deposits are made, a deduction equal to the amount of that deposit. That was the purpose of the introduction of the scheme. When deposits are withdrawn they constitute assessable income in that year. That adjustment is made to their income tax assessment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The aim of this scheme is to provide a means whereby primary producers can act themselves to smooth out their income flows for taxation purposes by making deposits in high income years and withdrawals in low income years. In this way they can reduce the adverse effects on their taxation liabilities which would result from the interaction of a progressive tax rate scale and fluctuating incomes. That is the aim of this scheme and that is how it works. Smoothing out farmers' income flows through the use of income equalisation deposits could have other advantages. First, by facilitating saving by farmers in good years it could relieve pressure on the Government for financial support when downturns occur. Further, it could assist in smoothing out fluctuations in farm investment, with beneficial effects on service and supply industries. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to make use of the Income Equalisation Deposits Scheme, a primary producer has, of course, to part with some cash during the period it is on deposit; consequently, interest is paid on that deposit. However, to allow for the fact that part of the deposit represents tax saved rather than an investment as such, the interest rate paid is set below the rates payable on other Commonwealth securities. When the Income Equalisation Deposits Scheme was introduced in 1976 the interest rate paid on deposits was set at 5 per cent. At that time it was considered that that rate provided for the bulk of the deposit subscribers an effective rate of return on the investment component of deposits, similar to that which could be obtained on comparable securities. So in 1976 the rate was 5 per cent. In August 1980 the income equalisation deposit interest rate was increased to 7 per cent in recognition of increases which had occurred in interest rates generally since the scheme's inception. So the interest rate increased from 5 per cent to 7 per cent between 1976 and 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> Since August 1980 there have been further general increases in interest rates. For example, between August 1980 and August 1981 the rate of interest payable on two-year Commonwealth Bonds increased from 11.5 per cent to 14.65 per cent; the interest rate payable on five-year Commonwealth Bonds increased from 11.8 per cent to 15 per cent; and the interest rate on Australian Savings Bonds increased from 10.25 per cent to 12.25 per cent. In view of these increases in rates during that year from August 1980 to August 1981, the Government decided that the income equalisation deposit rate should be increased further, to 9.5 per cent. That is the change that we are discussing here tonight-the increase from 7 per cent to 9.5 per cent, taking into account those other increases in interest rates that I have just mentioned. The new rate took effect from 23 October this year and it applies to the income equalisation deposits made before that date as well as to deposits made subsequently. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very surprised that the Opposition is seeking to disallow this regulation approving the latest increases in the income equalisation deposit rate. Does anyone serously believe that the interest rate payable on income equalisation deposits should remain fixed while interest rates on other securities-such as Commonwealth bonds, private sector debentures and bank and building society deposits-increase substantially? After all, part of an income equalisation deposit represents an investment and it is only proper that the interest rate paid on this investment should be kept in line with interest rate movements in the financial market generally. The Opposition motion, if passed tonight, would unfairly penalise the depositors by pegging their interest rate at its August 1980 level despite the fact that since then interest rates generally have moved upwards. The Government is not prepared to accept such a course of action and it stands by its decision to increase the income equalisation deposit rate from 7 per cent to 9.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I have noted the many figures given by Senator Walsh and I think that they could bear examination. Perhaps the interaction between the IED Scheme and the tax averaging provisions could cause some anomalies. If the figures, when they are checked, show that anomalies can be sustained in the way that Senator Walsh has put them forward I suppose we will accept that an interaction of two policies can raise anomalies. The National Farmers Federation, whose letter was quoted in some detail by Senator Walsh, raises the point that Senator Walsh's Press release takes no account of the people using the scheme in bona fide circumstances, the people who are participants in a scheme that was introduced to assist them with their fluctuating incomes. After all, the introduction of an income equalisation deposits scheme was one of the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission. Senator Walsh has told us that his approach would be that it was recommended by the IAC. With regard to the statement that he has made on that, I am advised that it was not done in that way solely because of administrative impracticability. </PARA>

That was not done, as I have stated, because of administrative impracticability. Interest is accrued continuously, but there would have been no way of knowing the tax saving or the net deposit until an assessment had been issued. In the meantime interest would have been accruing. An interest cheque may have had to be posted before the assessment of tax was made at that time. It was considered that this was an administrative difficulty. That was the reason why the Scheme was introduced in the way in which it is now administered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have spoken of anomalies. At present a review is being undertaken with regard to the matter of assistance for those in the primary industry sector. Anomalies and all sorts of matters are being addressed within the context of a review of the effectiveness and efficiency of the tax equity and income stabilisation arrangements for primary producers. The review is being carried out by the working party which is preparing a policy discussion paper on agriculture. If, as a result of that review, there are matters which need to be addressed relating to the efficiency, the equity and the interaction of policies that presently exist I am sure the Government will give them consideration. Acceptance of Senator Walsh's proposal to return the interest rate to 7 per cent would result in an effective yield which is well below the market rates for the great bulk of actual and potential income equalisation depositers who use the scheme to stabilise their income. </PARA>

I would think that Senator Walsh is somewhat chastened by the letter from the National Farmers Federation which takes issue with the statements he has made. As he would recollect from the time that he was more directly involved in these policy matters for the Opposition, he would receive a hostile reception within farming areas for the attitude which he now propounds. The Farmers Federation has stated that it would have no hesitation in giving his attitude appropriate publicity. Issues such as this where we have the spokesman for the Australian Labor Party welcoming the general economic approach and suggesting that it would be desirable for the Government to increase interest rates in this Budget in the way that it has now done would, it would seem to me, place Senator Walsh in a position of some embarrassment in relation to his own colleagues, including the Opposition's spokesman on primary industry. I suggest that the Senate should give support to the Government's proposal and ignore the proposition that has been put forward by Senator Walsh tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night when the Senate was debating the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill 1981 we got to the stage of dealing with clause 6 of the Bill which provides that the Minister for Education may effectively, by instrument in writing, determine what fees shall be paid by students in respect of second degrees. At the stage of the adjournment, the Australian Democrats had moved an amendment which in effect provided a mechanism whereby the Minister would still be empowered under clause 6 to make a declaration in respect of fees but that declaration would have no effect until it was approved by both Houses of Parliament. I think that is an effective summation of the proposal put forward by the Australian Democrats. I remind the Senate that Senator Macklin advanced argument in respect of the proposal on the basis of his view of the proper role of delegated legislation. Senator Missen advanced argument against the Democrats' proposal on the basis of a totally different view of the appropriateness of this provision as delegated legislation. Senator Ryan, on behalf of the Opposition, indicated our total opposition to clause 6.</PARA></TALK.START>

There is always the possibility-I hesitate to give this example-that on some occasion after the Minister had made a declaration and fees had been approved by the House of Representatives a declaration of the Minister could be introduced into the Senate and by some magical exercise which none of us can anticipate at the moment that declaration could be approved by the Senate.

<PARA> Another point I want to make is somewhat consistent with a point that Senator Missen made last night. Is this Parliament continually to be an arbiter of fees? For example, let us suppose that the Minister introduced a declaration in relation to fees for, say, the medical profession and we have been having a barney in here about the virtues of the medical profession, which is not particularly highly regarded by the Australian people. Were that issue to come before the Senate would we then debate, as a group of experts, questions of respective fees for respective courses and so on? I would have thought it highly inappropriate that we should do that. That is a matter for the Minister to determine on a broad across-the-board basis in relation to post-graduate fees generally and is not a matter which should be determined by detailed debate in the Senate or the House of Representatives. The Opposition's concern that this legislation should be dealt with appropriately at this time, that the clause should be rejected and that the Democrats' amendment, for the reasons I have stated, should not be supported, however well intentioned it may be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button made a big point about statements made by the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) prior to the last election in which he gave a promise, it is alleged by the Opposition, that fees for tertiary students would not be reintroduced during the three years of this Government. What he said was that the Government was not presently considering any fees. I have already admitted in my speech at the second reading stage that there is a spectrum of interpretation of those words, but I certainly reject from that spectrum that the Minister was lying or that he made a firm promise which is now being denied. I reject that utterly. I believe the Minister for Education committed himself prior to the last election to the statement that the Government was not at that stage considering the introduction of fees. Let us look at the matters about which the Government did make very clear statements. I refer to its very clear promise that there would be maximum responsible restraint on government spending. As a result of that clear promise, the Review of Commonwealth Functions was set up shortly after the election and that spending restraint was applied to the field of education as much as to other areas. As a result of that promise being followed up by the Government, we have the decision by the RCF that there would be a partial reintroduction of fees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the Australian Democrats spokesman, Senator Macklin, was speaking about this he talked about it being a matter of extreme importance to the community. I believe it is of importance to a section of the community, but there are in the debates in this Senate many matters of more direct importance to the community. I do not really believe that the reintroduction of fees of up to $1,000 maximum in a year for 8,000 students-perhaps fewer, the Democrats suggest-is of enormous concern to the community. Does anybody receive letters other than from students or academics, those who are directly involved in that small part of the community? What is of concern to a part, as we all know, to quote John Donne, is of concern to all of us. I would not want to take this too much out of perspective because the alternative, in terms of the concerns of this 8,000, is an increased levy or tax upon the whole 8 million taxpayers of Australia. One could argue that the 8 million are concerned with restraint in spending. That restraint, as a promise of the Government in the last election campaign, has to be balanced with the concerns of the 8,000 who may be required to pay up to $1,000 in fees. The only other point I want to make relates to the Australian Democrats motion. Senator Missen has already said that it is a very rare procedure here to have the affirmative form of review of a determination by the Senate. I do not think--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, there is nothing intrinsically wrong with that, but I believe it is misplaced. More importantly, there does need to be some clear statement of the Senate's mind in this matter and I believe that now is the time to state it. If the Democrats' amendment is adopted by the Senate and if that is the form in which clause 6 of the Bill is passed, then some 15 sitting days after the Senate returns in February, with universities and colleges taking enrolments, it is possible-depending on which side of the bed the Democrats got out of to come to the Parliament on the day-that the Democrats would approve or disapprove the determination according to whether they thought it was a money Bill or according to whether they thought that the referendum of party members suggested that they should do so. I believe that degree of uncertainty about a determination being disallowable-if the Democrats' amendment is adopted tonight-is an uncertainty that students, staff and the community at large do not seek. I believe, therefore, that the Democrats' amendment is misplaced and that we should reject it. I believe also that we should reject the amendment moved by the Opposition, for reasons that have been well canvassed in the earlier speeches.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As our proceedings are being broadcast, I rise to make a few remarks about some of the comments that Senator Button has seen fit to make; not so much about what he said but about his motivation for saying what he did-all the rubbish that he has said about Australian Democrats senators being in bed when votes were taken. He knows the truth of that as well as I do. I have observed Senator Button around this place for a good many years. He always has the sort of Don Quixote attitude of rushing around and charging at different windmills when he is either worried or not quite sure of whether his position is the right one. This is a classic case of that, so I think we can dismiss the other irrelevancies of what he had to say a few moments ago and come right back to what the Australian Labor Party is up to over this matter. Senator Button is so badly rattled because he knows that the amendment represents sanity and a reasonable compromise in this matter. It has been urged by the Australian Democrats in that light.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But if the Labor Party and the Government want a confrontation, a head-on collision over this matter-as has been their custom for so many years-and if they want to take up the time of the public of this country and inconvenience it to the extent that they apparently want, purely from the viewpoint of a couple of gangs of eight-year-olds in the playground, to take a head-on collision course over this matter when either or both of them could accept this amendment, then so be it. There are only five of us here and we are not really in a position to influence them other than in what we say. If we cannot persuade them to agree to the Macklin amendment-I assure honourable senators that it is a simple exercise in democracy, which is something we could have a lot more of in this country with benefit-perhaps we have not been persuasive or eloquent enough. Perhaps Senator Macklin will be more eloquent than me. I am merely trying to put the simple proposition that here is an amendment which will give all of us what we want. Is it a stupid proposition? Is it an unreasonable or undemocratic proposition that a Minister's determination in a matter as important as this should not be subject to affirmation of the votes of the Houses of parliament? Why do we have Houses of parliament? Let us get back to that point. Why do we bother to have a Senate? Why do we bother to have a House of Representatives if we say that the whole thing is to be run by two, three or four members, or by one member, of the Executive of this country?</PARA>
<PARA> I commend this amendment to the Committee, Mr Temporary Chairman, and through you urge honourable senators to vote for it. By doing so, they will show the people of this country that they are above petty confrontationist, squabbling politics and the sort of verbal diarrhoea that Senator Button indulged in earlier, and one can describe it as no more than that. I suggest to him that he should elevate his tone of debate somewhat if he wants to get somewhere in this place. Honourable senators rise above that and consider this amendment for what it is-a genuine, reasonable, democratic compromise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to indicate that the Government will oppose both the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats and the foreshadowed amendments of the Australian Labor Party. The Government has given a policy determination in clause 6 of the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill to impose fees for higher degrees. That is the Government's policy. It intends to do so. The fact of the matter is, and the public should understand this, that although there has been an inter-familial squabble here tonight there will be a quite incestuous partnership as between the Democrats and the Labor Party when it comes to the final vote tonight. The political incest itself is very evident because, as I understand it, we will see tonight a situation of quite some intriguing design. The Democrats are saying by inference that there should be fees because they are saying that fees shall be determined by positive vote of both Houses. So let that be clear. The Democrats' amendment is an acceptance of the principle that is a right for fees to be determined.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Therefore they could not under any circumstances vote against the clause. They are saying that the way for fees to be determined-and naturally there will be fees-is for them to be determined by vote of both Houses. Of course, because of the pairing arrangements and other things, my understanding is that the Democrats, having failed to get their amendment accepted, will then vote for the deletion of the clause. The truth of the matter is that the Democrats have put on a phoney fight here tonight to pretend that there is a difference between them and the Labor Party, but the real intention of the Democrats is to destroy the clause.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The debate upon the substance of this matter has taken place in this chamber and in another place on the second reading motions. It is not now the time to debate the merits of the matter. The fact is that the Committee has before it a choice. The Government has determined that there should be fees and that the Minister should have the right of determination, which is a normal condition in an infinite amount of legislation that goes about this place. The Democrats say: That being so, then the way to do it is by positive determination in the chambers. The Labor Party says: There shall be no fees. We shall watch how the Democrats vote when it comes to the question of 'no fees'. </PARA>
<PARA> I take the point that tonight there has been some very interesting discussion on the relative honesty and integrity of individuals. I only wish that Hansard could record the number of statements and contradictions of the Democrats. Because we are dealing tonight with matters affecting money and supply, I could not resist remembering that it is 11 November and recalling that for six years the great sin has been an Opposition blocking Supply. Let me quote some of the things that were said tonight at 6.40 p.m.:</PARA>
<PARA> Peter Harvey: 'It was possible that unless the Government agreed to Senate reform it too could face the blocking of supply.'</PARA>
<PARA>That is a question asked by a television interviewer. Senator Gareth Evans replied:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not within the realm of the reasonably foreshadowed, but it is possible and the Government should not in its own thinking rule out entirely the possibility of the Labor Party moving in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA>Now that, if we are talking about keeping the hybrid illegitimates honest, is a classic. For over six years there has been the statement that the great and cardinal sin in this place is to block money Bills and Supply. Tonight there is this exposure. I do not want to delay the Committee. I merely indicate that the Government will oppose both of the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is a pity that, on an issue as important as this one is for this country, we should have had such a trivial and disgraceful example from a number of speakers which really did not have very much substance and, in fact, did not attempt to come to grips with the type of proposition that is put forward in this amendment. A number of senators ranged over a number of issues that were obviously their own pet concerns. They used the time of the Senate in relation to those matters rather than addressing themselves to the issue. I will comment on a number of points made in relation to this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last night, Senator Missen raised the point that he thought that the affirmation of both Houses of Parliament should be reserved for important issues. He said that he did not think that this was one of those issues. In other words, he did not think that this was an important issue. That same line of thinking was reiterated tonight by Senator Teague when he said that all I was concerned about in my speech on the second reading was the fee issue and whether that was of vital importance to the electorate. Unfortunately, if Senator Teague had listened to or read the speech that I made on the second reading he would know that I did not mention the issue of fees at all. I concentrated entirely on the matter of the destruction of tertiary education in this country. I said that that was a vital issue. I still believe that it is a vital issue. I believe that the country believes that it is a vital issue even if Senator Teague does not. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter that we debated last night and that Senator Button alluded to again tonight was the fact that clause 6, to which I moved an amendment, indeed gives the Minister for Education a discretionary power in relation to the imposition of fees. We have suggested that, if the Minister were to set fees such action should be subject to the affirmation and the approval of both Houses of Parliament. That is precisely what we are saying. There is absolutely no inconsistency between that and our opposition to fees. </PARA>
<PARA> We have offered to the Committee what we believe is a reasonable compromise. We have been attacked by the Australian Labor Party as suggesting that really we do want fees because we have moved this amendment. The example ran something like this if I do not misrepresent Senator Button's position: He said: 'Let us look at the possibility of, at some stage, the House of Representatives passing a determination and then if some senators were absent that could be put through the Senate'. The example that he used related to the absence of Australian Democrat senators who were ill at the time and who, in fact, were absent for a vote. But, unfortunately, the example that Senator Button chose was a rather poor one. The reason is that, if a Bill to introduce fees had passed the House of Representatives in exactly the same way as a determination and was, in other words, sitting outside the door of this chamber, if any senators were absent which gave the Government a majority in the chamber, it could as easily pass a Bill as pass a determination. Senator Button accepted this because the example he used concerned the passing of a Bill. So there is no substance in the suggestion that this would in any way make it more probable for fees to go through rather than for a Bill to go through. When a Government has a majority in this place it can suspend Standing Orders, move the gag, or do what it likes and have something through in double-quick time. The numbers speak very loudly in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> That point aside, I move on to a couple of other matters that were raised. One matter relates to the fact that we put up these amendments, that this is really a phoney fight, and that later on we will be voting with the Australian Labor Party. If that statement were contained in the speech of anybody other than the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) I think it could graciously be ignored as being an aberration of a senator late at night. The fact that the Leader of the Government chose to use that matter as his major point I think needs answering. We have voted in this House constantly in relation to this issue. The Leader of the Government and other Government senators know that we have voted with them on many issues. Members of the Labor Party also know that we have voted with them on many issues. We will continue to vote on the issue and we will continue to maintain that stance. There does not happen to be any possibility in this chamber other than that of voting with the Government or with the Labor Party simply because their members vote en bloc on these issues. If there were other types of combinations I imagine that that would be a delight not only to this House but also to the electorate at large. Therefore, it is utter nonsense and it is an absurdity to claim that when we vote with the Opposition or with the Government we are necessarily in league with them. Given recent occurrences and other occurrences that are in the wind we believe that there will be a shake-up of the political structures in this country in the not too far distant future. Then we will be quite happy to allow the remnants of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party to vote with us and we will not make accusations in that regard. Indeed we had present in the chamber yesterday a representative from the Social Democrats. We expect that such a party will emerge shortly in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not mind. We welcome competition. It is a free enterprise party. I reiterate the point that I made in relation to our amendment. We hope that it will be viewed as a reasonable compromise. Obviously that has now been lost. There is a preference to go into a fight on this matter and to leave our universities up in the air. Senator Teague suggested that if our amendment were carried it would have exactly the same effect. The Minister for Education (Mr Fife) presumably would not take very kindly to Senator Teague's implied suggestion that he is not doing his job properly. I imagine that the Minister for Education already has his determination in hand, and has completed the planning for the introduction of fees. There is absolutely no reason why he should wait until next year. If in fact this amendment were carried he could take his determination into the House of Representatives next Tuesday and have it brought into the Senate tomorrow. The whole matter would then be cleaned up. There is absolutely no problem preventing the matter from being settled this week in the Senate and on Tuesday of next week in the House of Representatives. I hope that the Minister for Education has done his homework and has not left these types of things up in the air as was suggested by Senator Teague.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We put forward these types of suggestions from time to time in the hope that various groups in this chamber may be able to agree not to get all that they want but at least some movement in these areas. For example, in relation to this Bill we hope to be able to dissociate rapidly the motion of funding universities from the idea of whether or not we will charge fees. If the Government had to introduce this particular provision we would have much preferred-I suggested this yesterday-that it did so as a new policy, in other words in a separate Bill so that it could get the spotlight free from the emotional atmosphere that is now being created and the instability in the minds of our tertiary institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> We hoped that we would have been able to have this debate as a separate debate and the issue carried or lost on its merits. We hope that in future new policies being implemented in Bills may be dealt with in that fashion rather than being tied up with other elements that have the full support of this chamber. If that were the case on this occasion this chamber would be only too eager to move to vote for the money for our tertiary institutions. I hope that in future the Government may accede to what I believe is a legitimate request on the part of senators that we have the chance to discuss new policies as part of separate Bills. Thus we would avoid repetition of the rather disastrous situation we face at the moment with threats hanging over our universities and colleges of advanced education that they might lack funds for the start of a new academic year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the second reading debate I outlined some arguments against the reintroduction of fees at universities and colleges of advanced education and I do not intend to pursue those arguments again tonight. However I wish to follow one argument which was presented by Senator Teague. Probably for the first time in this debate Senator Teague and I are on the same wavelength. I want to mention the point that Senator Teague raised about the chaos that would occur if the Australian Democrats' amendment were passed. I am not sure that Senator Teague used the word 'chaos' but there would be chaos between now and, say, the middle of the first semester next year at universities and colleges of advanced education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How could that occur? The Minister for Education (Mr Fife) could make a determination in relation to fees but he could make that determination the day after this chamber and the House of Representatives had adjourned for the summer recess. If the Minister made such a determination, presumably at that point that determination would be lawful. It would have to come before both Houses of Parliament within five sitting days of those Houses of Parliament resuming in 1982. Suppose we came back in mid-February. Five sitting days after we came back could take us, quite conceivably, into March. It would not be necessary for the Minister to table that determination until, say, March next year. That is not at all a far-fetched supposition. If we came back later than mid-February the tabling date could be towards the end of March, but let us say that it is the beginning of March-within 10 sitting days both Houses of Parliament have to come to some decision about the determination that the Minister has made. As Easter is about that time of the year, it could be mid-April before 10 sitting days expire after the first five sitting days. </PARA>
<PARA> What will happen in the meantime? The universities will have to make a decision about whether they are going to charge these fees, which at that time will be lawful. Probably some of them will do so; some will hold off, thinking they will have to wait until the Parliament has made a decision. The ones which hold off might find that the determinations become lawful because of some chance happening that the fees are ratified by both Houses of Parliament. They would then have to go to their students and collect fees or suffer the consequences of not doing so, the consequences being that they would lose some of their revenue. The ones which charge fees might find subsequently that the fees are not ratified by one of the Houses of Parliament. What would they do then? They might have to refund the fees to all of the students. In the meantime there would be all this uncertainty at universities and colleges of advanced education. It could conceivably begin at about the beginning of December and finish at about the end of April next year. This sort of thing can happen if this amendment is passed. Senator Teague mentioned it this evening. I think it is one of the points which must be brought forward and recognised before we actually vote on the amendment proposed by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raised a matter last night during the Committee stage of this legislation. My approach to it was to ensure that the Houses of Parliament were given the opportunity to examine the determination made by the Minister if clause 6 were to be approved and if, of course, the consequential amendments which require a positive vote by the Senate were also to be approved. The position we have now reached is, unfortunately, that the proposition put forward by Senator Macklin has been pilloried to a certain extent by the Opposition and perhaps to a lesser extent by the Government on the ground that it is an unusual procedure, namely, that the clause would have required a positive vote of both Houses of Parliament within a particular period to validate the instrument. Whether there was merit in that argument-I could not see a great deal of merit in that argument and that is why I voted for the amendment-the issue still stands. The issue, quite frankly, is whether the Parliament should have the responsibility in some form of overseeing the determination made by the Minister, if the Parliament gives the Minister the power to make a determination. Unquestionably, the people of Australia, if the matter were put to them, would answer in the affirmative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question then remains as to how that can best be done in a manner that is not inconsistent with approaches in regard to subordinate legislation. Indeed, the Senate has been in the forefront of argument supporting the proposition that it should have the right to scrutinise subordinate legislation and, within the appropriate time, to disallow that ordinance. I remind the Senate that it does not take as many members to disallow an ordinance as it does to approve a particular proposition. On reflection, of course, I think that had the whole of the Senate supported the Australian Democrats' proposition, it would have worked in our favour on this occasion, but it could well have worked against us on some future occasion. The time-honoured approach that has been taken in respect of the scrutiny of subordinate legislation, namely, by way of disallowance is one which surely should receive some consideration by the Committee. Indeed, it is my intention now to test the Committee in respect of this issue to see whether, in fact, it is prepared to adopt that approach. I ask that my amendment be circulated. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Page 11, clause 6, after sub-clause (6), insert the following sub-clause:</PARA>
<PARA> '(6A) Sub-sections (1), (3), (4), (5), (5A) and (6) of section 48 and section 49 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 apply to an instrument signed by the Minister under this section as if that instrument were a regulation.'. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Committee that all the arguments that have been adduced by the Australian Democrats in support of their previous motion apply, of course, to my motion. My motion provides to the Parliament, indeed, to both Houses of Parliament, the opportunity to examine the instrument and to disallow it if either the House of Representatives or the Senate chooses to do so. I believe that it is not necessary for me to outline to honourable senators, as they are aware of the provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act in respect of the way these matters are drafted, that the instrument signed by the Minister under clause 6 would, in fact, apply as if that instrument were a regulation and, therefore, would be subject to disallowance by both Houses of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that my proposition will overcome the objection that certain people had to the proposition put forward by the Democrats-though I do not have that objection-that it was unusal and that, in fact, it could have reacted against us in a certain sphere although not on this issue. I submit this amendment to the Committee without further argument. I rest my case on the fact that this is not an unusual proposition. It is, in fact, consistent with what we do with all other subordinate pieces of legislation; that is subject them to the scrutiny of both Houses of Parliament, either House of which is entitled within the specified time to disallow that particular instrument. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the amendment which, although it comes as something of a surprise to honourable senators who have not seen it before, relates to an area in which there is a great deal of interest in the decisions made, many of which are not covered by regulations in such a way that they are, for example, reviewed by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. They are not really looked at by the Senate at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I trust that the Government will accept the amendment because it seems to me desirable that reasonably important decisions such as this should be subject to review by the Parliament. It is important that as much as possible of the subordinate legislation that is given effect by Ministers or statutory organisations be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. I took the view that, in light of the positive way in which the Australian Democrats amendment was presented, it was not of sufficient importance to require that that sort of procedure be followed. However, it is a procedure which should be adopted more in the future. On the other hand, the type of procedure that we have at the moment-that which is more regularly used and is the subject of action by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee of the Senate-ought to be fostered as far as possible. When the issues concerned obviously are controversial, or may affect-as the Regulations and Ordinances Committee criteria provide-the rights and liberties of the citizen, or indeed any of the other criteria set down by the Committee, it would be desirable that such decisions be subject to review. I hope that this amendment, which we now see for the first time, will be acceptable to the Government and that the suggested provision may be inserted in this clause. </PARA>

However, I am able to say that the Government will accept the amendment, which would permit the insertion of disallowance provisions. That, of course, would go a very considerable way towards meeting the wishes of those who want inserted provision for the scrutiny of fees by the Parliament. They would then have available to them the regulatory procedures that are standard to this Senate, and accepted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicated that the Opposition opposed the proposal of the Australian Democrats. It did so because the proposal leaves the issue of fees in limbo. It is inconsistent with the stated undertakings of the Government prior to the last election and I think it goes without saying that, in the circumstances, we would not be attracted by Senator Harradine's proposition. Senator Harradine said his was not an unusual proposition. It was unusual to me until a couple of minutes ago in the context of this debate, but the reality of Senator Harradine's proposition is simply this: For all its shortcomings the amendment proposed by the Australian Democrats, as we noted at an earlier stage, did require an affirmative vote of both Houses of the Parliament for the declaration of the Minister to be approved and have effect. The effect of Senator Harradine's proposal is that there would have to be positive action for disallowance by either House of the Parliament. As I believe Senator Carrick would recognise, to obtain positive action for disallowance, given the crude numbers of the 1981 Senate, would require an affirmative vote of 33 senators. I just point out to the Australian Democrats that that would be the requirement of--</PARA></TALK.START>

It comes, of course, to a question of determination of what the Senate wants. I remind Senator Carrick of events in 1975 and what took place between 1972 and 1975. Numbers have not been unimportant in the Senate. On this issue of the introduction of fees, if we want the possibility of the introduction of fees, if we want students who are seeking to plan careers and so on in terms of post-graduate degrees to be plagued by uncertainty in the future, then the mechanism which has been devised, I think in quite good faith by Senator Harradine, would be the means of creating that uncertainty-very much so. So there is a relationship-if I might put it in this way-between the numbers and the merits in relation to this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button talks about numbers and merits. His judgment on the question of merit, as he put it in his argument, is subjective. I do not believe that he has in any way convinced this side of the chamber that Senator Harradine's amendment brings the world of uncertainty that we see in the amendment that was put by the Australian Democrats. Senator Harradine's amendment takes a much more normal form and clarifies the fact that determinations made under this clause or instruments of the Minister may be disallowed by the Senate. It is in a form which provides that other regulations or decisions by Ministers of a regulatory nature may be disallowed. Insofar as it is then a concession to that power of the Senate, I see it as something which is acceptable and which does not have the world of uncertainty that Senator Button is concerned about-it also concerned me, as I said earlier-and which is contained in the Democrats' amendment. Therefore I believe that not only Government senators but also Australian Democrat senators-indeed, the whole Committee-may readily support Senator Harradine's amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was interested to hear the comments by Senator Macklin about this matter. All of his statements made in support of the amendment that he put forward for the instrument to be the subject of scrutiny in the Houses of Parliament were, word for word, the ones that are appropriate for use in support of my amendment that is now before the chamber. I could read from the Hansard each and every one of the words that Senator Macklin stated in support of his proposition in support of the proposition that is now before the chamber. There is no difference, in essence, between the previous motion which was put forward and this particular amendment. It would ensure the ability of both Houses of Parliament to scrutinise what, as has been indicated, is in reality subordinate legislation. It would ensure their ability to scrutinise the instrument that the Minister would be enabled to determine as a result of the passage of clause 6. Let honourable senators be reminded that the Australian Democrats were prepared, if they were supported in their previous motion, to vote against the deletion of clause 6. Now they are faced with the very real prospect of their desire being fulfilled. By means of this amendment they are faced with the prospect of the Government voting, together with me, to give them what they wanted. Now they say that they are not prepared to accept that and presumably would vote against the whole of clause 6. In my view, as I deliberately stated last night, a distinction ought to be made between the imposition of fees on higher degrees which, if effected, would substantially interfere with the research being undertaken in universities which is so vital to the future of Australia. There ought to be a distinction between an imposition of fees for those degrees and the imposition of fees in respect of people who are doing perhaps third or even fourth degrees at their leisure.</PARA></TALK.START>

We have an opportunity to give the Government the right to ensure that the taxpayers' money, the workers' money, is not frittered away on people who are prepared to use the system, year in year out, until they are about 50 years of age, when they can go on sabbatical leave. I am saying to the Australian Democrats that they have an opportunity right here and now to have the best of both worlds. The Government has said that it is prepared to support this proposition.

That is the only measure on which they are prepared to go to the barricades. Yet they are prepared to allow the sales tax proposals which will impose a burden on the workers to go through. Let me make it very clear that we have narrowed down the area on which the Australian Democrats are prepared to go to the barricades. They are prepared to do it for a handful of people who are getting their degrees on the backs of the working class. The Australian Democrats are not prepared to go to the barricades on the other question-that of sales tax-which is a very real issue not only for the workers but also for the university students. The Australian Democrats and myself have received reams of representations from universities and other institutions in respect of the sales tax issue. The students must spend all of their days writing letters. I appeal to the Democrats and to just one member of the Australian Labor Party to get up and to support this amendment.

One could imagine regulations being brought in prescribing certain classes of degrees and so on and categories of students who would have to pay fees.

I am not too sure that I would agree in passing with what Senator Harradine has said about all these layabouts who run around getting three or four degrees. It is hard enough work getting one. I do not really believe that there are too many people who laboriously work their way through degree after degree purely for the sake of getting their fees paid for them. I just cannot believe that this is a big issue. After all, students have to support themselves through this time and frequently they cannot get a job. I cannot believe that is really an issue which is at stake. I think that the number of people who are the so-called professional students who go on getting degrees one after another is rather small in real life. Senator Evans admits to being one of them. He arrived in this place eventually, but I do not know whether that is an argument for people taking large numbers of degrees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To take a more serious view of this matter, the Australian Democrats are fully aware that the Government is taking a false direction in education and it is doing it for ignoble reasons of political expediency. It wants to show somebody-I do not know who; perhaps some extreme right wing person somewhere-that it will economise or cut down in some way and that we will save some money. How much money will be saved? How much money? I have talked to people in universities about this and it appears that by the time they have gone to the trouble and expense of collecting these fees we will be lucky to have $3m a year from them for this country. What are we sacrificing? What is the Government proposing to sacrifice for that? It has decided in its wisdom that this country is to become a banana republic of the worst sort; we are going to discourage people from going on to further and higher degrees. We are not going to compete in the world of modern technology. We are not going to do what every other modern Western society is doing and make it as easy as possible for people to educate themselves to their fullest potential. Oh no, we are not going to do that. We are going to say to these people: 'We are not going to allow you to do that; we are going to make it hard for you'. </PARA>
<PARA> That will be at the stage where a graduate, perhaps in his twenties and who may be married with a family and who is feeling the economic pinch, feels that he might go on and obtain a further or higher degree. The Government is going to say: 'You are going to be positively dissuaded from doing this'. But there is one section that the Government is not dissuading and that is the people whose parents have enough money to support them to enable them to get through. That is what this debate is really all about. If we in this country are to compete in the future in the world of modern technology we must have a situation in which we educate as many of our young people as possible to their highest potential. We have to make every opportunity available to them to do it. The Australian Democrats see that we have a responsibility in this matter. We perceive it and we will not shirk it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise because of recent rhetoric which seems to be utterly self-contradictory. We heard Senator Mason say that if we introduce fees for higher degrees that will decrease the number of students coming to universities and we will not be on a par with other countries which are so much better than us. But, on the other hand, he says that there is not much money involved in it-only about $3m-so perforce only very few students can be affected. So that we have no doubt in the world about the situation, the argument that is running is that things are done better in other places and that we ought to learn from overseas. I will look at where we could learn from. In Belgium fees are charged for first, second and higher degrees. In Canada fees are charged for first, second and higher degrees. In France fees are charged for first, second and higher degrees. In Italy fees are charged for first, second and higher degrees. In Japan fees are charged for first, second and higher degrees. In the Netherlands fees are charged for first, second and higher degrees. In the United Kingdom fees are charged for first, second and higher degrees. In the United States of America the situation is the same. Incidentally, the fees in those countries are much higher than what has been argued here. There have been two arguments and I will let them fall. The arguments have been that if we charge fees we will be putting Australia in a detrimental position compared with countries overseas and yet there is clear evidence that the majority of overseas countries charge fees, and much higher fees.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to two issues, one raised by Senator Harradine and one by Senator Carrick. The substantive point that Senator Harradine raised was in relation to people running around and getting additional degrees. He linked that with the possibility of a determination which may be able to avoid that situation and still allow genuine people to proceed on to second and higher degrees. I have personally put to the Government the proposition about whether they may be able to do such a thing and the Government's response was that that is administratively impossible. I believe that that in fact is probably a correct answer. In other words, we would not be able to get such a determination on the Government's own admission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In reply to Senator Carrick, I would certainly believe that an additional course in comparative education would be useful. The point was raised that a large number of countries with which we like to compare ourselves charge for first, second and higher degrees. That certainly is the case. Unfortunately we are not speaking from the same base line. From the end of the Second World War until the present time, some of the countries mentioned by Senator Carrick have funded education at a per capita rate in excess of four or five times our contribution. We have underfunded education woefully for years. Now we are saying that we do not need to give special advantages to our citizens to allow them to become educated. Other countries have established a benchmark. They have managed to get their population educated. The United States of America has managed to educate over 50 per cent of its population in tertiary instututions. However, the number of people attending our tertiary institutions is dropping every year. Imagine that-in a growing country our numbers in tertiary education are dropping every year. Somebody might like to stand up and contradict that. That is what is happening in this country; that is the reality of tertiary education in this country. I believe we have to get our priorities back into perspective. We are talking about our own citizens and our own country. We have to give special advantages to our citizens in an area in which we know investment will pay off-and it pays off handsomely in education every time. That is why we put money into pre-schools, primary schools, secondary schools, colleges of advanced education, tertiary and further education colleges and universities. We do so because it pays off every time. Every dollar we put in we get back double. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is one other important aspect of the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill 1981 to which I think the Committee's attention should be drawn. It is best described by the Minister's words in his second reading speech:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill provides funding consistent with the decisions taken by the Government for the rationalisation and consolidation of resources in higher education. </PARA>
<PARA>That passage goes on to deal with colleges of advanced education and leads into another passage in the second reading speech which announces a plan whereby funds for 1982 for a number of colleges of advanced education 'for which acceptable consolidation arrangements have not yet been received, have been included in the legislation in a national unallocated reserve'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister is saying that certain amalgamations of colleges and, in certain instances, of colleges and universities should take place. If they do not take place the normal funding for those colleges will not be available in the next year, 1982, and the moneys which would normally be appropriated to those colleges, or universities in particular cases, would be paid into what is called an unallocated reserve. </PARA>
<PARA> In a sense I think it is a fairly efficient means of doing business if one wants to bring about a quick result in relation to particular matters. I want to draw the Committee's attention to the consequences of that result and to the way in which, in a sense, it was arrived at. Of course, it was not arrived at by the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) in any educational context. It was arrived at by the Review of Commonwealth Functions in the context of an ideological exercise which had nothing specifically to do with education, educational functions, questions of access to education and educational aims. The Victorian Minister for Education, Mr Hunt, referred to the report as being unilateral, blunt, insensitive and ill-considered and disclosed no appreciation whatever of the problems involved for staff, students and institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is to those matters that I wish to refer briefly. If one looks at the razor gang exercise in which 30 colleges of advanced education were selected as a result of flicking through the Tertiary Education Commission's report, then one sees, in a sense, the ineptness of the exercise. One would have thought, for example, that in any comprehensive educational plan, as distinct from ideological stunt, dealing with rationalisation and amalgamation of colleges, a number of highly expensive single purpose colleges such as the Queensland Conservatorium of Music, the Orange agricultural college and the Victorian pharmacy college might have been considered. But if one looks at the role of the Tertiary Education Commission in relation to amalgamations of institutions one sees the sorts of guidelines which initially the TEC recommended. In its report for the 1982-84 triennium it made the following points: That teacher training numbers needed to be reduced; that the TEC was not prepared to allow proliferation of liberal arts courses to take up the slack; that the colleges needed assistance to diversify into business studies and technologies; and that where it could be shown to result in genuine economies and more viable institutions the TEC would support the integration of colleges. Finally, it recommended that flexible plans and options for colleges to amalgamate and diversify be investigated and completed by 1984. The TEC went on to recommend that colleges be given additional funds in the form of temporary development grants to tide them over the transition period. </PARA>
<PARA> That was the advice of an expert body which was given prior to the decision of the razor gang. It is advice which is calculated and planned to achieve amalgamations of colleges over effectively a three-year period. I must say on behalf of the Opposition that we have no objection to the amalgamation of a number of colleges, having regard to excess capacity particularly in the teaching profession. Indeed, Senator Carrick will remember that two or three years ago I discussed this issue with him when he was Minister for Education. We have no objection to the criteria and suggestions of the Tertiary Education Commission for amalgamation. It is quite clear that in a sense at least they are rational decisions based on a concern that student intakes should be directed more appropriately into areas of study which are of more relevance in the current economic climate and indeed to the future of this country; that a proliferation of unnecessary courses should not be encouraged in order to help colleges to survive in circumstances in which they should not survive; and so on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Based on educational grounds. I am glad that we are in agreement on that point. All those things were recommended by the Tertiary Education Commission. I believe that at that stage those propositions of the TEC would have had the support of anybody seriously concerned about education and a national government approach to education. They certainly would have had the support of the Australian Labor Party. There is no doubt that there was a proliferation of colleges in the 1960s and early 1970s which in a sense with hindsight was undesirable. Of course, it has been recognised by educational authorities because a process merger and amalgamation has taken place, admittedly at a slow pace. The consequences of ignoring the recommendations of the TEC report and embarking on the exercise upon which the razor gang embarked are: A lot of turmoil and distress amongst colleges, the students and staff of colleges and, in some senses, universities; and a lot of concern about their future which would have been totally unnecessary if the advice of the TEC had been taken at an earlier stage. Of course that was not done; the so-called razor gang entered the field with the sorts of results that Mr Hunt, the Liberal Minister of Education in Victoria, described.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of colleges, of course, are still badly affected by the situation. The Institute of Early Childhood Development in Melbourne, which comes to mind, is a college which has performed a highly specialist and, I think, a very highly regarded role in Victoria. I am not saying that the Institute of Early Childhood Development should not be persuaded to go into some form of amalgamation with another college in Victoria. What I am saying is that an institution which has provided a unique service and has been very highly regarded in Victoria should not be steamrollered, in the way that it is by the effective arrangements in this legislation, consequent upon the razor gang's decision, to rush to a decision about amalgamation with some other college. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the difficulty. A variety of suggestions have been made about Hawthorn and Deakin University. I think it is necessary that such a college should go through a process of adjustment, but it should have time to do it. Very grave difficulties are being experienced by an institute such as that, and there is a lot of community concern that it should be forced into this situation. I do not know what the Minister's intentions are about the Institute of Early Childhood Development, amongst other institutions, at this stage. Certainly I know that I wrote to him three or four weeks ago about the matter and have had no answer to the specific questions I raised in that letter. That is a matter of concern. Of course, the Institute of Early Childhood Development is not the only one involved. Other institutions both in Victoria and elsewhere, are similarly concerned. There are cases where the Government in the State in which an institution is situated has indicated its opposition to the proposals which have been suggested by the Review of Commonwealth Functions. The fact that the State opposes the proposition, when the Commonwealth pays for those colleges, does not necessarily mean that the program should not go ahead. It does mean that it should be considered in a rational way, in the way in which the Tertiary Education Commission first suggested.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> More recently, a Tertiary Education Commission report on progress on consolidation in advanced education was given to the Minister for Education on 4 July this year. It sets out the progress of some of the proposals. I think it is to the credit of a number of institutions concerned, and in part to the credit of the Commonwealth Government, that some of those proposals have already successfully gone ahead. In respect of those which have not, a very difficult situation has arisen, and it is one which should be appreciated and accommodated by the Government as soon as possible by an announcement of its intentions. The position, certainly as far as many of these colleges are concerned, is highly confused, and that is a cause of concern. In respect of that confusion, there is an apparent lack of communication, either between the State co-ordinating authority and the college or the state co-ordinating authority and the Commonwealth Government, which is highly undesirable in what should be a smooth operation. The entire suspicion one can have about this is that it is another example of rather ad hoc and hasty planning to which the Tertiary Education Commission has now become a party in the sense that it is the instrument of Government policy in relation to this matter. It is not a satisfactory planning exercise and it has an expedient and cosmetic nature about it which is, as I say, undesirable. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other matter I wish to mention is the sort of matter we ought to be debating in this place in discussing such legislation. I refer to the proliferation of teacher training institutions which took place and what the real demand for trained teachers is likely to be in the decades ahead. It is a matter which Senator Macklin, I think, touched on in an earlier part of this debate. I do no more than point to the difficulties which have been caused and hope that the Government, at least in relation to colleges such as the Institute of Early Childhood Development, Hawthorn, Frankston, and the Melbourne State colleges, being institutions which are in my State, will have a little more patience and care, if it is the Government's will that they do amalgamate, at least in seeing that the amalgamations are accommodated in a more planned and steady way than is possible under the proposals currently before the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition opposes the passage at this stage of clause 3 of the Non-Government Schools (Loans Guarantee) Amendment Bill. The purpose of the Bill is twofold. It extends the eligibility of guarantees for Commonwealth loans to proposed, as well as existing, non-government schools in the States and, as well, enables such guarantees to cover interest payments. These new provisions are in addition to present provisions which relate to the repayment of principal moneys obtained to finance approved building projects at non-government schools. The Opposition does not oppose the second of the new provisions. However, at this stage it does oppose the extension of the scheme to proposed or new schools. I must make it clear that our opposition will not affect established school systems such as parish systems because it is not a requirement that their loans be guaranteed by the Commonwealth Government. The non-passage of this clause does not mean that new schools which lack sufficient community support would not go ahead. It does mean that their loans would not be guaranteed by the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We oppose the extension of Commonwealth loans to any new or proposed school because there is throughout the education community a great deal of disquiet amongst parents, teachers and educationists about the curriculum and nature of some new schools which have emerged recently. The registration procedures of State education departments should control the educational standards of schools which can obtain registration within their systems. However, at this stage that is not the case. In some States registration procedures merely relate to health standards and the provision of physical facilities. They do not address satisfactorily questions of curriculum, how the children are taught, the nature of the philosophy of the school and so forth. A great deal of concern exists in the education community about the proliferation of schools which have what one could kindly describe as an eccentric curriculum and teach values which many in the Australian community would regard as divisive and anti-democratic. The State governments are similarly concerned about the proliferation of these schools. At this stage State Education Ministers recognise that the current procedures for registration of the schools are inadequate. That recognition is demonstrated by the fact that they have set up a working party to examine those procedures. The Opposition believes that it is irresponsible of the Federal Government to encourage and facilitate new schools, many of which have curricula of questionable educational benefit, while such a review is taking place at a State level. When State procedures are revised and updated the Federal Opposition will be happy to reconsider its stance on this Bill. We are happy to see diversity in education. We are happy to see Commonwealth laws extended to non-government schools which have a valid educational curriculum and philosophy. However, until we can be assured by State education Ministers as a result of their review, that this is the case with all the schools that gain registration we will oppose clause 3, which extends loan guarantees to new and proposed non-government schools.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I regard this as an important matter. I should make it perfectly clear that the Australian Labor Party has always insisted that the Schools Commission was the wise and prudent body whose advice on matters relating to schools and matters such as this would be acceptable. Let me read the comments of the Chairman of the Schools Commission in relation to the Non-Government Schools (Loans Guarantee) Amendment Bill and specifically on the points that have been raised. He stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commission considers the loans guarantee scheme to be not a separate program but rather an integral part of the overall building and equipment program for non-government schools. Loan guarantees are available to assist those schools that need to complement a capital grant with repayable loan moneys. Also, the scheme provides a means by which some support can be given to a proposed school development which, though worthwhile, may not have sufficiently high educational and financial need (relative to other applications) to attract a capital grant within the very limited funds available. Accordingly, the same procedures apply for consideration of applications by Planning and Finance Committees and the Commission, regardless of whether a project is ultimately recommended for either a grant or a loan guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to new school developments, Planning and Finance Committees are required to examine proposals very carefully. In addition to the normal assessment of education and financial need, the criteria of public demand, existing availability of student places, seriousness of purpose of sponsors and viability apply to new school proposals. Planning and Finance Committees must be provided with convincing evidence to support the projected enrolments being claimed by the proponents of a new school and they are required to consider-as far as can be estimated-the effects on enrolment structures at existing schools (including government schools). The probability of a new school being registered by the State is also fundamental to the Commission's consideration of a capital proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>The Schools Commission planning and finance committees were set up by the Whitlam Government as the key recommending bodies with regard to new schools. The Chairman of the Schools Commission has set out the considerations that the Schools Commission bodies and the Schools Commission itself have laid down. Clearly, what is now being said by the Labor Party is that it is rejecting the very mechanism that it has supported over the years. It is saying that a body which has a wide community base, being made up of prominent people who are familiar with and understand the very situations to which Senator Ryan has referred, is not a body that is eligible to give advice. It is inconceivable to the Government that the Labor Party would resist the evolution, the development, of new schools based upon the fact that they have to pass the tests that are required now. </PARA>
<PARA> On the one hand the Labor Party has said that the States do not pay sufficient attention to the matter and on the other it has said that all State Ministers are concerned that the registration procedures should be strengthened. The fact of the matter is, as stated in the letter from the Chairman of the Schools Commission, the planning and finance committees are bodies with a degree of expertise and they have been relied on in the past for recommendations. They have to examine all the criteria to which Senator Ryan has referred and they understand any dangers that might be inherent in the legislation. Fundamentally the Schools Commission was based, in its new and extension programs for schools, on the idea that the planning and finance committees were expert bodies in this task. The Labor Party is denying them an essential part of their role. I commend the Bill to the Senate as it stands. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be supporting clause 3 of the Bill. I believe the problems raised by Senator Ryan have some substance and have caused some considerable concern in a number of States in relation to a variety of schools. However, the problem with opposing this clause is that it would also unfortunately oppose schools which do have-while they are outside a systemic system-wide community support. I am thinking of one school in particular in Queensland that I believe was the subject of some discussion with the Minister and, indeed, was one of the prompters in relation to this Bill. That school is not a systemic school, however it is extremely well founded within the community. I have spoken to the governing council of that school and it has extremely well documented books.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that some of the fears that Senator Ryan has raised may be able to be allayed not necessarily in the polemic way suggested by Senator Carrick but by the fact that the Schools Commission has, in the time it has been operating, set up some fairly stringent guidelines in relation to allowing these schools through. I believe-I have not seen any evidence to the contrary at the moment-that the Schools Commission is not capable of handling that type of filtering work that it has undertaken to date. I believe we should be very careful in any move that we take which may prevent recognised groups within the community which have wide community support and which are able to, in fact, induce a financial institution to give them a loan. This is not a loan from the Government, this indeed is a loan from some other type of financial institution that is guaranteed by the Government. I believe there are two fall-back positions: Firstly, the scrutiny that is currently applied to all these schools by the Schools Commission and, secondly, the fact that the financial institutions are unlikely to put up a loan. These loans, of course, must be fairly large to be able to substantiate or establish even a most modest school in today's terms. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there are currently available sufficient safeguards in the community to allay some of the fears that were expressed by Senator Ryan. I support her on one point, that is, the growing concern within the community at the divisiveness that is entering into the school area between private and government schools. I hope that it may be possible for all parties to meet together and try to take us back again one or two years to when both of those groups of schools were working co-operatively and effectively together in promoting the education of the citizens of this country. I hope that the recent types of rancour and movements that we have seen in some government policies may not continue so that the good work that was taking place up until recently may be re-established and the accord between those groups will progress. I believe my own State is the last State left where there is any co-operation between the parent groups. I believe that is a disastrous situation and one which we must all regret. I believe that if we can give some support to those various groups to bring them back together that would be to the betterment of this country. The Australian Democrats will support this Bill in its entirety. We hope that the Schools Commission will maintain its scrutiny of those types of loans that come forward. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise tonight the matter of the closure of the Box Hill Community Youth Support Scheme group. It is a matter that has caused great consternation to people in that area. Several members of parliament have received complaints about this rather high-handed action. I think it is ludicrous that the Box Hill CYSS group has been suspended and is facing termination when the Government intends to issue new guidelines in February. There is no doubt that the Box Hill CYSS group has been one of the successes in Victoria, especially in the metropolitan area. The operation in that suburb is known as 'Shopback'. In 1981, 156 people were enrolled there, which is a far greater number than that of many other CYSS groups in Melbourne. The average monthly participation in that group is 45 people. The average daily attendance is 25 people. The number of participants who so far have gained jobs in 1981 is 47. At least 16 people have been involved in the work experience program that has been instituted and about 22 are involved in community service. These figures compare very favourably with many metropolitan CYSS groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Box Hill and Nunawading area has many special problems; namely, there is a lot of fighting amongst street gangs, there is a very high proportion of unmarried mothers and there are great problems in accommodating homeless youth. The Shopback in Box Hill has tackled all these problems head on. It has reduced the amount of gang warfare in that area. It has run education courses using eight sessional teachers on a one-to-one basis. It has instituted work experience programs and sex education courses. It has had very close links with the job centre in that area. It has managed to provide dental and medical services to the participants of the scheme. It has even published its own newspaper which is called 'Street Talk'. </PARA>
<PARA> The success of this dynamic CYSS group is based on very active and experienced project officers who have been given complete support by a very involved committee. Too often one finds in CYSS groups that the project officers are too young to be able to control and develop programs. In the case of Box Hill, there were very experienced people. They have had a wide range of experience in social welfare work. Nearly all of the members of the Box Hill CYSS committee have been active in social welfare in the Box Hill-Nunawading area. Why then, one might ask, has the Box Hill CYSS group been suspended? I believe it has been subjected to a campaign of smear and innuendo and that the State CYSS committee's decision to suspend it was based on misunderstanding and false information. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not asserting that the Box Hill CYSS group has had no problems in the past. The main criterion by which it should be judged, however, is how effective it has been in the community. I intend to examine the background of the Box Hill CYSS suspension. I hope that the Government might be able to resolve the matter within the next few weeks. Throughout the whole of 1981 the committee repeatedly asked for a joint meeting with the State CYSS committee which controls all the CYSS groups in Victoria. The State committee refused, but it did send a field officer out to the Box Hill area on two occasions. At the last meeting the field officer attended a discussion about the future guidelines in response to a request from the new Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, Mr Neil Brown. The committee pointed out that education was a key to employability. The field officer insisted that education was outside the guidelines and said that the State committee would not give Shopback more than $30 a week for educational or sessional teachers. The organisation received $60 a week in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> On 2 October the chairman of Box Hill CYSS was notified by Mr Graham Harris that the State committee on 1 October suspended Shopback from 9 October and was recommending termination to the Minister. When asked for reasons the executive officer of CYSS, Mr Mike Sullivan, said that they were being sent. On Wednesday, 7 October, a letter was received saying that Shopback was suspended due to critical reports being received. When asked what the appeal procedure was, the executive officer told the chairman that there was no appeal procedure but that the Committee could write to the Minister and the State committee. At 4.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 7 October, Mr Graham Harris, who had refused to tell individual members the reasons for the suspension, agreed to disclose these to the whole committee. He said, having been approached by the State committee one week before its meeting on 1 October, that he wrote saying that he thought the project was no longer viable. When pushed for reasons he cited bad Press, police problems and difficulties with a Box Hill Council youth worker. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these matters had been discussed at length at the committee meetings at which Mr Harris had been present, had offered advice and had contributed to the discussion and decisions made. The background to the State committee's decision appears to be that the Nunawading North neighbourhood centre from where the original people started off the CYSS group, had an undesirable influence on the committee. Yet only the chairman, who does not have a vote, and two other members of that committee come from the Nunawading neighbourhood centre. The chairman of the CYSS group is a technical and further education teacher at the Box Hill college. That college, through the Principal, Geoff Fountain, has supported the work of the neighbourhood centre because Mr Fountain knows of the value of its work with unemployed people. </PARA>
<PARA> I am disappointed to think that the major report on this group has come from a fairly young and inexperienced public servant when compared with the experience in social welfare of people who are involved on the ground. He seems to be, I think, biased against the neighbourhood centre. This person has solicited critical comments from two or three members of the Box Hill CYSS committee and has used these to show that the project was in serious trouble. When confronted by the Box Hill CYSS chairman, Bruce Stewart, it became apparent that the State committee had been seriously misinformed. At no time was any criticism checked with the chairman of the Shopback committee. Every endeavour seems to have been made to bypass him and the whole committee. No evaluation of the aims, methods and results of the project was carried out. Mr Harris was asked to form a new committee and start a new project before the current committee was even informed of its suspension. </PARA>
<PARA> The State committee will of course not change its decision and the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs is naturally loth to go against the decision of the State committee on the basis that the committee had threatened to resign if he overrode its decision. I must say at this point that the Minister, Mr Brown, has been sympathetic in this matter but of course takes his advice from the State committee, whether the decision was made on good or bad information. </PARA>
<PARA> What were the reasons used by the State committee? The main one was problems with the police. On 24 June the chairman of Shopback wrote to the Minister of Police, the Chief Commissioner of Police and the District Superintendent of Police asking for an urgent meeting to discuss lines of co-operation between police and the Shopback staff. The letter made an official complaint, carefully documented, concerning the behaviour of police who entered the participants door, ignored the project officers and teachers present and started questioning participants. Be it a school or any other organisation, it is normal when police officers enter premises for them to go through the normal and proper channels of seeing the people in charge first. The police concerned were members of the Criminal Investigation Bureau from Box Hill who had arrested some of the ex-members of Shopback. The point at issue was the professional responsibility of adults at Shopback. Shopback received adverse publicity when a local newspaper reported a court hearing in which it was alleged that members of Shopback had been drinking on the premises of Shopback and then had stolen a car. Most of this was erroneous reporting. The facts are that the drinking occurred in a carpark adjacent to Shopback. There is a strong directive that no drinking shall take place on Shopback premises and certainly none took place on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> Several reasons have been given for the suspension of Shopback. The suspension letter quoted serious criticism from Mr Graeme Harris, the Commonwealth Employment Service and the police and adverse Press publicity that followed some of these criticisms. Only Mr Harris admitted to writing anything, and that was that the project was simply no longer viable. The manager of the CES and the police have denied making any criticism to the State committee. On 19 October some of the Shopback committee members had a cordial and fruitful discussion with Superintendent Plant, who agreed to reissue instructions that the police were to go to the office door and ask for the project officer. The committee instructed the project officers to co-operate with the police and to follow the instructions. So the problem with the police has been solved, but CYSS is still suspended. The State committee further told the chairman of Box Hill CYSS that Shopback did not have enough local support. The chairman detailed practical support from 95 groups and individuals in the Box Hill area. I seek leave to have a document showing this incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA> On Thursday, 1st October, the State C.Y.S.S. Committee suspended funding for Shopback C.Y.S.S. Box Hill from Friday 9th October. This is just two weeks after Cabinet promised C.Y.S.S. would be funded until February 1982. Reasons were not given. The letter from C.Y.S.S. Chairman, received 48 hours before closure, stated that highly critical reports were received from the C.E.S., the Victorian Police, and the local M.H.R. Mr Graham Harris. The Committee was never consulted concerning such criticisms. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has asked the State Committee to continue the project until a full evaluation has been carried out and the Committee has a chance to answer criticisms. The Manager of the C.E.S., Mr Wayne MacDonald, denied having made any criticism of Shopback to the State Committee. He said that the C.E.S. and Shopback have a very good relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> 3 The Victorian Minister of Police has arranged for a Senior Police Officer to meet with the Committee to work out lines of co-operation. (A request made originally by the Committee on 24th July.)</PARA>
<PARA> 4 Mr. Harris, the member for Chisholm, indicated to the Committee, of which he is a member, that he has told the State Committee that the project was no longer viable. He was unable to give clear reasons why he thought this or why he had not raised such matters at the monthly meetings. He expressed interest in starting a new C.Y.S.S. project with a new Committee and new Project Officers. Committee members feel that their professional integrity has been slighted. They understand that C.Y.S.S. projects are sometimes criticised and attacked in public. State Committee should properly investigate such criticisms to see whether they are true or malicious. </PARA>
<PARA> Such high handed ''No Discussion'' tactics make a mockery of asking local Committees to run Youth Support Schemes. If funding can be suddenly withdrawn without consultation, evaluation or appeal, who would feel safe or respected. </PARA>
<PARA> As Chairman of Shopback I am concerned that the professional integrity of the Project Officers has been maligned. I want to state, as a trainer of youth leaders with 26 years experience in youth work, that Mary Dykes and Jim Nippard are experts at their job. </PARA>
<PARA> Shopback stands by its record of helping unemployed people in Box Hill and Nunawading. </PARA>
<PARA> The community stands to lose an invaluable support service. I hope the community will express its support to the Minister of Employment, Mr Neil Brown, Parliament House, Canberra. </PARA>

<PARA> The federal member for Chisholm, Mr Graham Harris, has closed Shopback-the Box Hill CYSS-single handed. </PARA>
<PARA> He has refused to tell the committee of 10 other people why it has been closed. The committee represents a widely based community support and includes the Manager of the C.E.S. in Box Hill (Mr Wayne MacDonald), the Principal of Box Hill Technical College, (Mr Geoff Fountain) and the Community Services Officer of the Box Hill Council (Mr Hal Ranger). Also on the committee are the Assistant Direct of C.A.E.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The next charge was that there had been serious mismanagement inasmuch as a bank account, No. 4, was held under the name of Nunawading Neighbourhood Centre rather than under the name of Box Hill CYSS. This was held against that group. There is no allegation that any of the money was mismanaged. Anyone who knows the operation of CYSS would know that projects get a grant and any other money spent must be fully documented with receipts before money is made available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have already mentioned that one of the problems cited was failure to co-operate with the police. Another criticism was that the committee was divided. Mr Graham Harris was the only member who has really voiced criticisms of the committee. Those criticisms were that the place had had bad Press reports or bad relations with the police. All other members were prepared to keep working and asserted the worth of the task and their support for the project officers. I turn to the question of adverse publicity. I think most honourable senators present would have some sympathy with complaints about misleading Press reports. I have already referred to the one about the police and the court case. On several occasions confidential matters such as a report that the group would be suspended or the views of the State committee were deliberately leaked to the Press, which sensationalised them. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I should like to make about the suspension of the Box Hill CYSS is that when finally pressed the State committee said that the group had not kept to the guidelines, but it did not specify one instance of the group having transgressed the guidelines. There is no doubt that the Box Hill CYSS has been the victim of rumour and innuendo. It has been assassinated on the basis of misinformation, and our local Federal member has not assisted in this process. I point out, of course, that this group encompasses two Federal electorates, neither of which is Labor. The honourable member for Deakin, Mr Alan Jarman, has been most supportive and most helpful of this CYSS group and is still supporting it. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I would like to make, in conclusion, is that it is unfortunate that one of the best working CYSS groups in Victoria is under suspension and under threat of termination. I believe that this really has come about because of misunderstanding. I hope that the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, Mr Brown, will intervene and re-establish the group at least until February, when the new guidelines will be brought down, and that it is then deemed desirable to introduce a different type of CYSS scheme. However, the point at the moment is that Shopback is closed, the unemployed people who were being helped there have been turned away, and that this has put an extra degree of social work pressure on churches and other groups in that community. I hope that the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs will look again at the matter and ask the State CYSS committee to do a proper evaluation on the success or failure of that CYSS group. I do not think that an evaluation should be based on misinformation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw the Senate's attention to a disgraceful situation which has come about in the town of Northhampton, north of Geraldton in Western Australia. I particularly wish to draw this situation to the attention of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Peter Baume, who also represents the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) in this chamber, as this situation concerns the irresponsible behaviour of a member of the medical profession towards his Aboriginal patients. Northampton is a small town about 50 kilometres north of Geraldton. It has only one doctor, Dr R. Hutchinson. The Aboriginal population in Northampton is about 75 and, like the majority of Aboriginal people in this country, many of them live in underprivileged circumstances and on low incomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is an unfortunate but well recognised fact that Aboriginal people throughout Australia do not enjoy the relatively good health enjoyed in general by the non-Aboriginal population, and the Aboriginal people of Northampton are no exception. When they are ill the Aboriginal people of Northampton have little choice but to go to Dr Hutchinson, the sole doctor in the town. Their only alternative is at Geraldton, some 50 kilometres south, where there is an Aboriginal medical service and a hospital. However, expense and difficulties of transporting sick people the 50 kilometres to Geraldton have prevented many Northampton Aboriginals from utilising this alternative. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the 1 September changes to the health care system, it was the practice of Dr Hutchinson to bill patients directly and, in the case of his Aboriginal patients, not to use his discretion to declare patients disadvantaged and send their bills direct to Medibank for payment. I must point out that at this stage my information is that Dr Hutchinson has never refused to see a patient because he was in debt to him. However, over the last two years several Aboriginal families have built up considerable medical bills which they have been unable to pay. Six cases have come to my attention so far. They are: Colleen Drage and Maurice Newgie, who have five children aged between six months and six years; Horace and Laurel Drage, a middle-aged couple with no children; Fay and Clayton Drage, who have four children; Victor and Marjorie Mourambine, who have six children of their own and are fostering another child; Stewart Mongoo and Joan Drage, who have six children; and Maxine Drage and Dennis O'Dene, who have five children. In all six cases, the families are battling to meet financial commitments and to maintain a reasonable standard of living. In all cases the breadwinner of the family has at some stage during the last two years been out of work and in receipt of social security benefits. In one case the family is in arrears with a hire purchase company and is having difficulty in maintaining rental payments on the family home. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of these families are in arrears with their doctor's bills to the extent of several hundred dollars, and the doctor involved, Dr Hutchinson, has proceeded with legal action to recover his money. Therefore these Aboriginal families now have to cope with visits from debt collection agencies, summonses, and appearances in court. These families are being pursued by the law only because they have committed the crimes of being poor, being sick and being black. Between them they support 27 children and by the look of their medical accounts, which I am prepared to table if the Minister wishes, they do not enjoy a high standard of general health. Two of the men involved, Mr Clayton Drage and Mr Victor Mourambine, are attempting to repay their medical debts in instalments from their meagre incomes. When situations such as these come to my attention, I cannot help but feel outraged that Aboriginal families should be put through such hardships unnecessarily. These people, under the Government policy operating at the time, were entitled to 'disadvantaged person' status and thus to free medical care. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because they were on unemployment benefits. Their income levels, according to the Government's criteria at the time, entitled them to disadvantage benefits, but the doctor refused, for his own reasons, to accord them such status and consequently billed them. They have been denied their entitlement under previous Government policy to free medical care and now face legal proceedings and possibly gaol. I consider that this situation is a stinging indictment of the health care policy of the Government and its effectiveness in looking after Aboriginal people. I say that because such a situation would not arise if we had a universal health care system such as the Medibank scheme which was in force under the Labor Government. While the current Government insists on running down public health services and forcing people to rely on the private sector, such situations will continue to arise. I do not think the 1 September changes to the health care system will alter the situation for a large number of Aboriginal people who, for reasons that I am sure will be well known to the Minister, will not apply for a disadvantage health card.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I raise this matter this evening because I would like the Minister to indicate to the Senate what he is prepared to do to assist the six families whose positions I have outlined. In the majority of cases the medical items involved in the outstanding bills are not items which are scheduled at over $20 and which, therefore, would have been payable by Medibank for any uninsured person. Will the Minister continue to allow these six Aboriginal families to suffer the extra burden of trying to pay outstanding medical bills for which they should never have been liable in the first place? Will he allow them to go through the insecurity and the anxiety of legal proceedings and possibly imprisonment for these outstanding bills or will he take some action to have the cost of these bills met by the relevant Commonwealth authority? These are the questions I put to the Minister this evening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two senators have contributed to the adjournment debate tonight. Senator Robert Ray has set out a problem in relation to the Box Hill Community Youth Support Scheme project. As I listened, I think he provided considerable detail about the problems facing the project. I think there is enough detail for me to pass that problem on to the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) without much embellishment at this time. I understand that what he wants me to do is to draw the problem to the attention of the Minister and to seek the Minister's reconsideration of the decisions which have been taken. I will undertake so to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Ryan has raised, I think it is fair to say, on an ex parte basis at this stage a problem in a town in Western Australia and asked what I intend to do about it. I suppose that as a first step I had better do what anyone would want to do, that is, seek from the doctor his account of what has happened and his side of the story and try to put together, from what Senator Ryan has said and from what the doctor may say, a composite picture of what has gone on. It might be appropriate to send to the doctor a copy of the Hansard report, to seek his comments urgently and then to make my decision. </PARA>
<PARA> My understanding is that the new arrangements for disadvantaged persons no longer depend upon any assessment by individual medical practitioners. Irrespective of whether people will or will not apply, there is now a capacity for people to be classified on the basis of their financial need-to say to the doctor that they are disadvantaged people and they have been so classified. Of course, to that extent they are better off now than they were before. They can now claim that kind of classification. As I say, I am not prepared to comment on an ex parte basis, but I hope that all medical practitioners will seek to offer treatment where it is needed, especially when they are the sole practitioners in a town; that they will recognise the special needs of Aboriginal people for health care; that they will recognise the special problems facing Aboriginal people; and that they would approach matters such as the ones outlined by Senator Ryan in a compassionate and reasonable way. It is for that reason that I want to know from the doctor himself whether there is another side to the story. If I obtain that information, I will pass it on to the honourable senator. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Statistics kept by my Department show that since July 1977 there have been 33 prosecutions for offences involving trafficking in fauna. Those statistics do not indicate whether or not the species concerned were endangered but a guide to the detection of instances of trade in specimens of endangered species may be obtained from the fact that there have been 1124 seizures of such goods. As indicated in an answer to Question No. 1168 the overwhelming majority of offences against the Customs (Endangered Species) Regulations are committed in ignorance of the law and forfeiture of the goods in question is usually considered sufficient penalty.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Individual values are not recorded for seized specimens of endangered species. In fact, values of goods involved are usually indefinite. Many such goods have been disposed of by offering them to Museums for display or scientific study or to the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service for display and as aids in lectures or for training purposes. The remainder are still held in Queen's warehouses.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Almost without exception, seized specimens of endangered species were taken from passengers returning or arriving from overseas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 28 October 1981:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Did the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Viner, undertake to the House of Representatives in his second reading speech on the Aboriginal Land Rights Bill, on 4 June 1976, that the Bill would provide machinery for Aboriginals in the Northern Territory to obtain inalienable freehold title to traditional land outside reserves, including pastoral properties owned by Aboriginals or bodies such as the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission on behalf of Aboriginals.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Did the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act enable Aboriginals to make a traditional land claim to two categories of land namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) unalienated Crown Land; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) alienated Crown Land in which all estates and interests not held by the Crown are held by or on behalf of Aboriginals.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Did Mr Viner reaffirm the policy of the Government to provide for traditional land claims for both categories of in the latter half of 1978 in a series of articles in the Northern Territory News later published as an official booklet of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs entitled 'Land Rights in the Northern Territory'.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Is the policy of the government on Aboriginal land rights in the Northern Territory still the policy expanded by Mr Viner in the Parliament and in the Department booklet.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Is the land available to be claimed under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 limited to Crown Land in which no white person has an interest.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Under the provisions of that Act, is it the Aboriginal Land Commissioner who hears the traditional land claim required to consider and comment upon any detriment that may be suffered by any person if the land claim succeeds.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Is the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 operating successfully to provide some justice to Northern Territory aboriginals, and a system whereby those aboriginals can deal systematically and reasonably with outside bodies such as mining companies which may wish to engage in activities on aboriginal land.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Was it the intention of the Government, with the passing of the Northern Territory Act 1978, that the vesting in the Northern Territory Government of the interests of the Commonwealth in Crown Land would be subject to the rights conferred by the Commonwealth on Aboriginals by the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) And was this understood and accepted by the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and his Government.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) Did the Chief Minister in a letter to the Chairman of the Central Land Council and the Northern Land Council, dated 24 August 1978, state that it was 'not the intention of the Northern Territory Government to attempt to avoid the provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) Did the Chief Minister, on behalf of the Northern Territory Government, in a letter to the Chairman of the Land Councils dated 24 August 1978 undertake not to deal with unalienated Crown Land the subject of a traditional land claim before the Aboriginal Land Commissioner under the Land Rights Act in a way that would be prejudicial to the land claim.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) Has the Northern Territory Government broken that undertaking on the following occasions:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) by extending the town boundaries of Darwin to an area greater than the size of London in order to defeat land claims;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) by the Northern Territory Minister for Lands, Mr Robertson, on 11 May 1981, purporting to alienate a substantial area of the Lake Amadeus land claim although it had been lodged 12 June 1980 well within the two year period covered by the undertaking;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) by granting grazing licences over areas of land the subject of land claims and then arguing to the Aboriginal Land Commissioner that the grant of grazing licences amounted to an alienation of land;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) by opposing the claim to Utopia Station a pastoral lease held by the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission on behalf of Aboriginals and raising technical arguments which were rejected out of hand by the High Court of Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) by the Northern Territory Minister for Mines, Mr Tuxworth, in response to a letter, dated 28 October 1980, from Mr J. W. Semmens, the Manager of Operations of Peko Mines in Tennant Creek, promising Mr Semmens that he would alienate land at the very time that a claim over that land was being heard by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner; and</PARA>
<PARA> (f) by threatening to alienate unalienated Crown Land under claim unless the Land Councils acceded to his demands to alter the basic principles of the Land Rights Act.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) Is the Minister aware that these actions are considered by the Land Councils to be serious acts of bad faith by the Northern Territory Government.</PARA>
<PARA> (14) Has the Minister expressed his concern about or disapproval of these actions to the Chief Minister Mr Everingham.</PARA>
<PARA> (15) What action has the Minister taken to censure the Northern Territory Government about such breaches of solemn undertakings and to redress the wrongs that have occurred as a consequence.</PARA>
<PARA> (16) Did the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Chaney in announcing an inquiry by Mr Rowlands, Q.C., in November 1979, to examine the practical implementation of the Lands Rights Act, expressly state that this examination was to be 'without detriment to the basic principles of the Act'.</PARA>
<PARA> (17) Has the Northern Territory Government declined to make any submissions to Mr Rowlands; if so, was this because the Northern Territory Government did not wish to subject its views on the Act to the independent inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA> (18) Has the Northern Territory Government mounted a concerted campaign to erode the fundamental principles of the Land Rights Act since the Rowlands Report was released by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on 18 November 1980.</PARA>

<PARA> (24) Has the Minister arranged for a series of discussions to take place between representatives of the Northern Territory Government and the Land Councils to discuss the operation of the Land Rights Act.</PARA>
<PARA> (25) Have the parties met on 17 March 1981, 7 April 1981, 11-12 May 1981, 13 August 1981, 25 August 1981, 7-8-9 September 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (26) On 13 August 1981, did the Chief Minister Mr Everingham, the Minister for Lands, Mr Robertson, the Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Taylor, and a senior officer of the department, Mr Gray, present draft proposals providing for the amendment of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 to prevent land claims to areas of unalienated Crown Land once used as stock reserves or stock routes, and to pastoral properties owned by or on behalf of Aboriginals.</PARA>
<PARA> (27) Did the Chief Minister Mr Everingham on 13 August 1981 tell the Land Council representatives that his draft proposals were the Northern Territory Government's 'last word' and threaten that if the proposals were not accepted by the Land Councils the Northern Territory Government would 'go its own way' and had prepared legislation which it would pass the following week.</PARA>
<PARA> (28) Did the Minister, and departmental officer Mr Gray, advise the Land Council representatives on 13 August 1981 that they believed the Northern Territory Government would act to alienate some or all of the unalienated Crown Land under claim.</PARA>

<PARA> (30) Did the Minister and Mr Gray advise the Central Land Council meeting on 12 August 1981 and the representatives of both Land Councils on 13 August 1981 that the Northern Territory Government had the legislative power to alienate unalienated Crown Land under claim, and that it would be most unlikely for the Commonwealth Government to act to disallow such action.</PARA>
<PARA> (31) What has the Minister done to prevent such action by Mr Everingham.</PARA>
<PARA> (32) Will the Government permit the Northern Territory Government to alienate Crown Land which is already under claim; if not, what steps will the Minister take to ensure that the Northern Territory Government does not carry out its threat to retrospectively eliminate current claims which are awaiting hearing.</PARA>
<PARA> (33) Did the Chairman of the Northern Land Council on 9 September 1981, Mr Jerry Blintner, state that the Council had only accepted the proposals because it was being threatened although the Northern Land Council resolved on 24 August 1981, to accept in principle the draft proposals prepared by the Northern Territory Government and Department of Aboriginal Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA> (34) Did the Central Land Council, on 25 August 1981, neither accept nor reject the Northern Territory Government-Department of Aboriginal Affairs proposals but stated that it wanted to continue negotiations with the Northern Territory Government in order to find solutions to any real concerns and reach agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> (35) Has the Central Land Council put proposals that would preserve the right to move travelling stock across former stock reserve or stock route areas should they become Aboriginal land.</PARA>
<PARA> (36) Do these proposals satisfy the express concern of the Northern Territory Government.</PARA>
<PARA> (37) Do these proposals have the support of the Minister and; if not, why and why has the Minister of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and Mr Gray not expressed support for these proposals.</PARA>
<PARA> (38) Did the Northern Territory Government and Department of Aboriginal Affairs draft proposals of 13 August 1981 propose that Aboriginal groups who purchased pastoral leases would obtain perpetual leases that would not be subject to forfeiture.</PARA>

<PARA> (40) Was the Minister advised that this was the system of so called perpetual lease that was being proposed before urging the Land Councils to accept it.</PARA>
<PARA> (41) Has the Minister asked Mr Everingham what he meant by his offer of perpetual leases, and if so, what was Mr Everingham's reply.</PARA>
<PARA> (42) Did Mr Gray, the Minister's principal advisor know that the system of so called perpetual lease was subject to the above limitations when he advised the Minister of the suitability of the Northern Territory Government proposals.</PARA>
<PARA> (43) Did Mr Gray advise the Land Council representatives on 7 to 9 September 1981 that the Northern Territory Government is to be treated as a sovereign government in its own right.</PARA>
<PARA> (44) Was Mr Gray authorised to make this statement.</PARA>
<PARA> (45) Will the Government treat the Northern Territory Government in Aboriginal Affairs as a sovereign government in the same way that it treats Queensland and West Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (46) Will the Government permit the Northern Territory Government to go its own way and take action to defeat the existing rights of Aboriginal people under the Land Rights Act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (53) These questions relate in the main to negotiations being conducted between the Northern Territory Government, the Commonwealth Government and the Aboriginal Land Councils in the Northern Territory. These negotiations are directed at reaching some consensus, if possible, in relation to possible amendments to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 and relevant Northern Territory legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 8 September 1981, (Hansard, page 498) Senator Button asked me a question without notice concerning the leaking of the 1980-81 Budget. In the course of responding to the honourable senator I undertook to seek some further information and pass it to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have now consulted with the Treasurer and with the Attorney-General and we are of the view that it would not be appropriate for an Australian Federal Police report on unauthorised disclosure of information from the 1980 Budget to be tabled or otherwise published. In this regard, the Attorney-General has made a number of points:</PARA>
<PARA> A police report on such matters is in no way analogous to the judgment or report of a judicial officer. A police report is made for the purpose of prosecution or administrative action in relation to an offence investigated, and not for the purpose of informing the public.</PARA>
<PARA> Having regard to the confidential basis on which the police often obtain their information, publication of such a report may prejudice future activities of the police.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, a police report may contain matter defamatory of individuals.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 22 October 1981, (Hansard, page 1534) Senator Haines asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications. The question relates to the South Australian State Emergency Service and, quite possibly, to State emergency services in other States. I preface my question by pointing out that these organisations are staffed mainly by volunteers and are funded largely by the States, in which they provide a very valuable community service, but they are inevitably short of money. Can the Minister say whether Telecom Australia is pressing the South Australian State Emergency Service for the payment of licence fees for the radios that the organisation uses in its work, thereby depriving it of much needed funds? If in fact Telecom is pestering the South Australian SES or any other SES for the payment of these licence fees, will the Minister consider that these organisations provide and the limited state of their finances?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Wireless Telegraphy Regulations specify fees payable for radiocommunications licences. State Emergency Services (SES) in common with most other users are required to pay those fees. The fees in respect of SES tranceivers are set at $22 per unit allowing the SES to licence land mobile tranceivers and base station tranceivers for $22 instead of paying licence fees of $36 and $56 respectively that apply to other land mobile users.</PARA>
<PARA> As part of its 'user pays' philosophy, the Government has decided that radio frequency management will be completely self-supporting financially, that is, those who use radiocommunication services must pay for them directly rather than the general taxpayer subsidising functions of Government. This means that any concession in fees to radiocommunication users like the SES must be paid for by some other radiocommunication user. Consequently the Government considers that the SES and other like services should seek sufficient funding to pay for licence fees just as it does for other goods and services.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McLaren and Senator Walsh asked me a number of questions relating to Income Equalisation Deposits on 27 and 29 October 1981 (Hansard, pages 1624 and 1805). I undertook to seek further information and draw certain aspects to the attention of the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has provided the following further information in answer to the honourable senators' questions:</PARA>
<PARA> The interest rate on Income Equalisation Deposits was increased as a result of the general increases in interest rates since the rate on Income Equalisation Deposits was last set in August 1980. The Government considers that Income Equalisation Deposits provide an effective means of reducing the variability of income from primary production.</PARA>
<PARA> During 1980-81, 5,653 Income Equalisation Deposits were made. Although precise figures as to how many individuals actually hold deposits are not readily available, it might be expected that the total number is in excess of the above figure. Some 200,000 individuals would be eligible to hold income equalisation deposits, if they so chose.</PARA>
<PARA> In line with the recommendation of the Committee of Inquiry concerning Public Duty and Private Interest, Ministers provide me with a written statement setting out any relevant pecuniary interests or benefit that they have. In addition, at meetings of Cabinet and its committees Ministers are required to disclose to their colleagues any interests which they have or which they know a member of their immediate family has, which conflict or might reasonably be thought likely to conflict with their public duty as a Minister. Ministers who disclose such interest only take part in the discussions in question with the agreement of their colleagues. Consistent with the recommendations of the Inquiry it has not been the practice to make these statements or disclosures public.</PARA>
