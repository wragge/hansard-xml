The genuine warmth and even at times the deep shades of sentimental affection which they expressed sometimes contradicted their public utterances about me. I can assure honourable senators that they were deeply appreciated by my wife and me and I have no doubt that they hastened my recovery. I thank those honourable senators for their messages of good will.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate of the Australian Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the State of Tasmania respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the plan by the Australian Postal Commission to downgrade postal and mail services throughout Australia, will place in jeopardy the existing services and the security of the mails by:</PARA>
<PARA> Downgrading a large number of official post offices;</PARA>
<PARA> reducing the number of post offices open for business during the lunch period;</PARA>
<PARA> reducing the number of street posting boxes;</PARA>
<PARA> delaying telegrams by reducing the number of delivery offices;</PARA>
<PARA> downgrading post office services by employing untrained and unqualified staff; and</PARA>

<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that the Australian Government will take immediate action to prevent the Australian Postal Commission implementing any plan which will downgrade the postal and mail services of the citizens of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled the petition of the undersigned citizens respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That it is clearly apparent that Australian society is becoming more polarised-that the rich at home and abroad are becoming richer, profiting from Australia's mineral wealth, whilst pensioners and the disadvantaged, some three million people, are becoming a race apart.</PARA>
<PARA> That, of necessity, the Federal Government take action that all Australians share the wealth of their country by the transfer of resources to income security, health care and housing. Therefore, your petitioners urge that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. All pension and benefits be raised to at least 30 per cent of the National Average Male Earnings seasonally adjusted.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Removal of the means/income test on the Pensioner Health Benefit imposed by Federal legislation 1973.</PARA>
<PARA> Reintroduction of Medibank in so doing restore all Australians to equality of citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. To alleviate Australia's shortage of housing stock within the capacity of people to pay (rental and ownership) the Federal Government immediately inject $200 million into State Housing Authorities, which will, in addition, alleviate unemployment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 26 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. That the decision by the Federal Government to introduce fees at the Repatriation General Hospital, Greenslopes, was made without prior consultation with medical staff at that hospital and implemented at short notice.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. That fee introduction will place the hospital in the untenable position of having to compete with the State's free hospital system.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. That this competition will result in the substantial loss of specialist medical personnel and community non-entitled patients, both of whom are complementary and vital to maintaining the standards of excellence that this hospital has achieved.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. That the consequence of such losses will be a deterioration in health care standards to veterans in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, call upon the Government through the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to declare a moratorium on the introduction of fees at the Repatriation General Hospital, Greenslopes, until the full ramifications of this decision are studied more closely and the patients and staff are allowed adequate time to prepare for any financial changes.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) That residents of densely populated suburbs in the vicinity of the Brisbane Airport and residents of other suburbs in the flight path of international and domestic jets are experiencing an unreasonable degree of aircraft noise.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Further, that these same residents will be subjected to prolonged bouts of such aircraft noise if a decision is taken to extend the curfew at both the domestic and international airports.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) That this decision has been foreshadowed on two occasions as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) In Submissions to the Public Hearing held by the Public Works Committee of this Parliament in regard to Stage One-Redevelopment of Brisbane's International Airport: these submissions proposed an extension of the existing curfew when the new runway is completed (approx. 1986).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 122 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that the introduction of tuition fees for post-graduate and second degree students will:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) severely limit access to such levels of study. The ability of a student to pay tuition fees will be the main criterion of entry to such courses. The restricted availability of Commonwealth post-graduate scholarships and the difficulty of finding part-time work in employment related areas further restricts the ability of post-graduate students to pay tuition fees.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) result in higher attrition rates in post-graduate and second degree studies. Recent surveys have indicated that up to 50% of students would be unable to continue their studies if tuition fees at the level of $1,000 per year were introduced. Inability to continue study is both a personal tragedy and a waste of the community's resources.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) limit Australia's capacity to cope with technological, economic and social change. Many degree students who will have to pay tuition fees undertake further study to upgrade their qualifications to cope with changes in their area of employment. Many are forced to undertake retraining in areas outside their current employment because of declining job opportunities in such areas due to economic change. Further study for many students will bring no financial benefit but simply allow them to extend their contribution in the course of their work. For example, thousands of teachers have undertaken further study to gain expertise in such areas as migrant education, remedial literacy and numeracy teaching, curriculum development and so on.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) further restrict access to such study for women students. As a result of the abolition of tuition fees the proportion of women students in tertiary education has increased significantly. Mature age women students have benefited by the opportunity denied them when they left school.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) seriously undermine Australia's research effort. Approximately 22% of Australian research takes place in tertiary institutions. The bulk of Australia's basic research is undertaken in universities. The introduction of tuition fees threatens Australia's capacity to cope with major structural change in the economy.</PARA>

<TITLE>Tertiary Education Fees</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that the introduction of tuition fees for post-graduate and second degree students will:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) severely limit access to such levels of study. The ability of a student to pay tuition fees will be the main criteria for entry to such courses. The restricted availability of Commonwealth post-graduate scholarships and the difficulty of finding part-time work in employment related areas further restricts the ability of post-graduate students to pay tuition fees.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) result in higher attrition rates in post-graduate and second degree studies. Recent surveys have indicated that up to 50% of students would be unable to continue their studies if tuition fees at the level of $1,000 per year were introduced. Inability to continue study is both a personal tragedy and a waste of the community's resources.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) limit Australia's capacity to cope with technological, economic and social change. Many degree students who will have to pay tuition fees undertake further study to upgrade their qualifications to cope with changes in their area of employment. Many are forced to undertake retraining in areas outside their current employment because of declining job opportunities in such areas due to economic change. Further study for many students will bring no financial benefit but simply allow them to extend their contribution in the course of their work. For example, thousands of teachers have undertaken further study to gain expertise in such areas as migrant education, remedial literacy and numeracy teaching, curriculum development and so on.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) further restrict access to such study for women students. As a result of the abolition of tuition fees the proportion of women students in tertiary education has increased significantly. Mature age women students have benefited by the opportunity denied them when they left school.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) seriously undermine Australia's research effort. Approximately 22% of Australian research takes place in tertiary institutions. The bulk of Australia's basic research is undertaken in universities. The introduction of tuition fees threatens Australia's capacity to cope with major structural change in the economy.</PARA>

Has the Minister noted an article in the Australian Financial Review of 4 November entitled 'NSW Government growth centre costs leap' in which the New South Wales Auditor-General is reported as indicating, firstly, that the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation is carrying real estate on its books at inflated values and, secondly, that the Corporation registered a loss of $7.3m in 1980-81-a 5.3 per cent increase on the previous year's figure of $6.95m, thus raising the Corporation's accumulated deficiency by 28 per cent from $25.8m to $33.12m? Finally, has the Minister noted the statement in the article that the comments of the New South Wales Auditor-General 'are particularly serious as they amount to a qualification of the group's balance sheet, meaning the accounts have failed to get a clean bill of health in a commercial sense'? What action has the Department of National Development and Energy taken, or does it intend to take, to safeguard the Commonwealth's financial interests in the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation in view of the disastrous comments made by the New South Wales Auditor-General?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not see the article to which the honourable senator has referred. However, I will search it out, study it and if necessary look also at the New South Wales Auditor-General's report. But I do report to the Senate and to Senator Lajovic that last Friday I attended, with my two State colleagues, a meeting of the ministerial council of the Albury-Wodonga growth centre in Albury. We had before us for consideration the report of a review committee which was set up at my instigation and which comprised officers of the two State governments and the Federal Government. That report had been the subject of wide representations by the public. Indeed, after its submission 100 copies of it had been circulated and response invited. I have to report that, as a result of the deliberations on that day, the general findings of the review committee were adopted. That will mean a very considerable devolution of activity throughout the growth centre; that many of the functions of the Corporation will be undertaken essentially by local government itself; that a lot of infrastructure transfers will occur; that the enterprise itself will undertake a number of functions; and that land not essential for use by the Corporation will be disposed of in an orderly fashion. So, a thorough look will be taken at the whole of the procedures of the growth centre. I should stress that the Government is committed to the development of the Albury-Wodonga growth centre and that I am delighted that there should have been complete agreement between the three governments as to the procedures to be followed for the next three years.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Government has made clear its policies in that regard. The Government will be well aware of whatever statements it has made regarding revenues obtained in that area. The Government has been entirely solicitous of the families in Australia. Indeed, in the recent Budget it made a number of reforms in that regard. It will keep those in mind. The Government has one overwhelming principle in mind in all its budgeting, and that is that the best way to help the Australian families in terms of their welfare and prosperity is to keep inflation down and to bear down on interest rates. Nothing could be more beneficial to the Australian family than that. Of course, as honourable senators will know, in terms of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development comparisons Australia continues to be a front-runner in success in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of the full context from which Senator Chipp has quoted. I certainly will refresh my mind on it. The Government has made it clear that it will use moneys from oil revenues to increase benefits to families and, indeed, it has done so. As we are talking of extra money revenues, let me make it clear that in the course of this year the money revenues to the Budget will be in the order of $220m less than was foreshadowed in the Budget, due to the results of industrial unrest in the oil industry and the shipping industry. Even if the increase in oil revenue from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries price rise from 1 January were taken into account, there would still be a shortfall of about $125m in oil revenue by 30 June. I think that should be kept in mind. So there will not be more revenue; there will be less than we foreshadowed in the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; There were street disturbances in Noumea following the annual Noumea street fair. These resulted in 90 arrests, mostly of Melanesian people. It is unlikely that any Australian tourists were involved, as far as the Department of Foreign Affairs is aware. I am not aware of any Australians being injured at that time. Whilst this occasion has given rise in previous years to small scale disturbances, the level of trouble this year has been considerably more serious. The French Secretary of State for Overseas Territories has called on all New Caledonians not to allow themselves to be drawn into unacceptable actions. He said that the French Government was open to dialogue and that it would make a political response to the Melanesian problem. On several occasions the Australian Government has repeated its support for the principles of self-determination and independence of the French Pacific territories. We hope that the South Pacific Forum countries' delegation to Paris later this year, to be led by the Fijian Prime Minister, will lead to movement by the French Government towards accepting independence as a desirable goal for the French territories. That is all the information I am able to supply on this matter. I will refer Senator Watson's question to the Minister and see whether he has any further response to make.</PARA></TALK.START>

In view of the poor record of the Romanian Government on human rights matters, I ask the Minister: Firstly, will she give to the Parliament an undertaking that the Australian Government will keep in close contact with Viscreanu and the Romanian Government to see that the undertakings are honoured; and, secondly, will she forthwith report to the Australian Parliament any breaches of those undertakings?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; That matter was given very careful consideration by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs before the decision was made not to grant refugee status to Mr Gheorghe Viscreanu. Recognising the matters raised by Senator Missen, I advise that it is a fact that some sections of the Romanian community in Australia have expressed doubts about Mr Viscreanu's future well-being. We have, through the Australian Embassy in Belgrade which is accredited to Romania, made arrangements to maintain regular contact with the Romanian authorities and for the Australian officials to seek to visit Mr Viscreanu from time to time. The well-being of this young man is of concern to us, but his application for refugee status did not have within it the usual provisions concerning actions which are expected to be undertaken at the time that such status is granted.</PARA></TALK.START>

If I can report anything further from time to time I will see that the Senate is advised. Before we asked the young man to leave, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs did obtain from the Romanian Government an assurance that Mr Viscreanu would not suffer in any way.

If further action is needed, I will see that Senator Missen is advised of any further action taken by the Australian Government.</PARA>

Whilst the Minister does not have the details of individual accidents, he feels that it would be reasonable to assume that some of the fatalities that have occurred in Queensland from time to time may have been due to bad roads. The deficiencies of the road system in Queensland have, I believe, been due largely to problems with the State Government not allocating sufficient funds from time to time for the construction and upkeep of the roads generally.

In this time has the Minister taken any part in consultation or conciliation processes with the union?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that the dispute which is at present afflicting my Department does arise from bans which have been imposed in a small number of offices over a period of some 12 months. Those bans have applied to work with respect to the recovery of overpayments, certain statistical collections and, in a limited number of cases, the servicing of inquiries involving members of parliament or the Minister. The matter has been approached with patience. A number of complaints have been made by the union which are alleged to lie at the heart of the dispute-complaints about accommodation, training and staff ceilings. With respect to all those matters the Department has given serious attention to areas of concern. For example, the Government has allocated additional moneys within the last few months to ease accommodation problems in some offices where it was certainly thought there were grounds for complaint and concern. Action by the Government is continuously being taken with respect to training. But as recently as about a week ago the Public Service Board agreed that part of the temporary ceiling cover, which was found not to be necessary for the continued servicing of the health benefits function which we have recently assumed, should be maintained by the Department during this year to enable us to undertake a greater training initiative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to staff ceilings, the Government has taken a very careful line in the Department of Social Security. The matter has been reviewed on a number of occasions. Staff ceilings, which were around 9,000, when we allow for adjustment of functions in 1976, stand at around 11,500 today with additional temporary cover being available for the recently assumed functions and for training. As I indicated a few minutes ago, training is to be continued. So far as the bans are concerned, the union did seek a meeting with me and I indicated in writing in August last that I would be prepared to meet with the union, although in general I regard matters such as conditions in and the administration of my Department as being the responsibility of those charged under the legislation with the administration of the Department. Given that some decisions of the Government such as staff ceiling decisions impinge on that, I indicated that I was prepared to meet with the union but not while bans were in place.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as the recent activity is concerned, I think it was some weeks ago that notice was given by the Director-General that the bans would not be tolerated beyond this week and the request was made that they should be lifted. In fact bans are not applicable in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory. It is only in New South Wales and Victoria that relatively small meetings involving a few hundred officers have voted to maintain the bans. Where bans have been applied there have been stand-downs over recent days and as a result there have been some walk-outs in sympathy. The number of officers affected by the walk-outs and bans totals about 1,000, with a considerably smaller number being involved today. Of course, I very much regret that we have reached a point at which a small proportion of our officers are affected in this way. I understand that it is extremely unhelpful to our clientele and to our achieving the welfare objectives of this Government.</PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the bans have been applying for 12 months. We cannot have a situation in which people simply choose to do the work that they believe they are entitled to do to make their point. The Government, after a very patient approach, was of the view that stand-downs should occur. They have occurred. I trust that the normal good sense of the Department's officers will be manifested at tomorow's meetings and that there will be a return to work. I stress that the great bulk of the Department's officers, both in the past and over the last few days, have loyally served the interests of the Australians that they are employed to serve. I am sorry that a small minority of officers have caused the disruption which is inconveniencing some of our beneficiaries.</PARA>

It is true that the Government has a very real and practical sympathy for the people of Poland in their present plight. The matter of the nature of support is under consideration by the Government in terms of aid generally and the nature of the aid. I am not able, as a matter of immediacy, to specify that support. I hope that that announcement can be made at an early date. I certainly have a sense of urgency about it, and so does the Government. As to the question of donations being tax deductible, I am aware that there are throughout the community in Australia a number of undertakings to raise money and materials. I will make sure that the Treasurer and the Cabinet give that matter consideration.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kilgariff's question is of considerable importance, particularly to those hundreds of people in the Northern Territory who depend upon the uranium industry for their employment and also to those hundreds of thousands of people overseas whose only source of peacetime electric energy is uranium. The recent refusal by waterside workers in Darwin to handle yellowcake for shipment has come under the notice of the Government. It is quite irresponsible. I am pleased to see that the Northern Territory Government and uranium producers have chosen to grapple with the problem in a positive way with a view to future exports of yellowcake out of Darwin proceeding without disruption. There has been consultation between the Northern Territory Government and the Federal Government. The waterside workers' action is all the more difficult to understand because it is designed to cause operational difficulties to an industry which is a major employer of union labour in the Northern Territory. I am sure that it has won very few friends in Darwin in the past few weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out that not only the Commonwealth Government but, under section 143 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, any interested organisation or person may apply to the court for cancellation of a union's registration. The matter can be taken up by people in the Northern Territory also, if they wish. I am encouraged by the initiatives being taken to facilitate yellowcake shipments out of Darwin. The Federal Government is prepared to do what it can to ensure that Australian uranium producers are in a position to deliver to their overseas customers. That has always been our position and it remains so.</PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the International Energy Agency at its meeting in June pointed out that the world could not solve its essential and growing energy hunger without more and more dependence upon energy generated from peacetime nuclear sources. It therefore called upon nations to make it clear to their communities that the production of uranium, its mining, milling and refining, would be necessary, so that the people of the world could maintain their living standards and so that there could be economic and political stability. Australia has a major responsibility to the world to help people to preserve their living standards and to prevent destabilisation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of the global arms race and the failure to make any progress in disarmament generally throughout the world has created in world public opinion a sense of unease and concern that is rising almost daily. Almost six months ago in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald headed 'A man of peace forecasts tragic finish in weapons race', it was reported that the former United States of America Ambassador to Moscow, George Kennan, said that his Government had gone mad. The article continued:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After studying United States-USSR relations for 53 years, he was certain the two great super-powers were on a collision course. Not just a war, but a nuclear war. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that public opinion is growing apprehensive and fearful at what seems to be a headlong and inevitable drift towards an unwinnable nuclear war. We did not heed his remarks. In an article published only several days ago it is interesting to find the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA> Washington-Three nuclear scientists have warned that the US is headed towards a nuclear war under the misguided assumption that such a conflict can be won. </PARA>
<PARA> 'The US and the Soviet Union are on the path to nuclear war', Professor Henry Kendall said at a news conference yesterday when plans were announced for a national convocation to be staged on 150 college campuses on November 11 on the threat of nuclear war. 'We want to shake the country out of its indifference to the drift toward nuclear war', Professor Kendall added. 'Scientists have to share their knowledge of the nuclear peril and speak out about the steps that have to be taken to control it. The risk of such a war is real, and it is increasing.'</PARA>
<PARA>His remarks were added to at the same time by Mr Herbert Scoville, the president of the Arms Control Association and technical director of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project during the post-war atomic tests. He said that President Reagan's concept of a window of vulnerability was misleading and dangerous. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The idea that the US has a weak nuclear deterrent force is just absolutely false. The idea that we are weak and must become stronger in order to negotiate with the Soviets is just an excuse to get more weapons. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Labor Party believes that the issue of nuclear war transcends all other issues facing humanity. Therefore we believe that there ought to be a debate on this issue. I remind the Senate that on the last day of sitting of the House of Representatives the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) tabled the report of the Australian delegation to the 1981 session of the United Nations Committee on Disarmament in Geneva. Honourable senators will see that the report underlines the main features of the matter of public importance we are discussing today. The report dealt with a number of issues: Nuclear disarmament and the cessation of the nuclear arms race; effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear weapons states against the use or threat of nuclear weapons; and a comprehensive program of disarmament. But, as the Australian delegation's report stated, there was a 'lack of progress on the item of prime importance to Australia; a comprehensive test ban and inconclusive work on other agenda items'. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It must also be recorded that the general atmosphere in the Committee has been more political than in the past, with much time devoted to political advocacy and correspondingly less to actual substantive negotiations. In the view of the Australian delegation these unfortunate developments in 1981 are attributable to factors external to the Committee. There are major substantive difficulties yet to be resolved in connection with each of the agenda items, but there are also serious prospects of making progress as soon as the general international climate so permits. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Committee's estimation it was hostage to the tense international situation and its work in forwarding the process of peace and disarmament would get nowhere until that situation of international tension, distrust and rivalry was changed. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the climate of international relations is very cool and very bad indeed. This has undoubtedly been exacerbated by the backward and cold war remarks made over the last 12 months of the Reagan Administration in the United States. This brings me to the first point of today's matter of public importance-the tension heightening role of the new United States Government. Over the weekend just past we heard reports of statements from the Reagan Administration suggesting the possibility of a so-called limited nuclear war in Europe. In this case we understand that, according to reports in the Melbourne Age of 7 November, the United States Secretary of State, Alexander Haig, told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee meeting that there were 'contingency plans in the NATO doctrine to fire a nuclear weapon as a warning for demonstrative purposes'. Washington has currently got its propaganda wires a bit crossed because Secretary of Defense Weinberger then denied that such a plan existed. It has become clear that such a proposition is and has been within the context of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation strategy. This is even more alarming when taken alongside President Reagan's statement of 21 October this year in the New York Times. He is reported as saying that he 'could see where you have the exchange of tactical (nuclear) weapons against troops in the field without it bringing either one of the major powers to pushing the button'. Again, in this case President Reagan was referring to Europe as the potential site for this limited use of nuclear weapons and, of course, Europe sees itself as expendable in this super-power rivalry. </PARA>
<PARA> All governments in Europe, regardless of their political colour, are apprehensive and concerned, and why would they not be when it is admitted that the two super-powers themselves have 16,000 million tonnes of TNT which is equivalent to one and a quarter billion Hiroshima bombs? That is the state of the arms race that exists in the world today. </PARA>
<PARA> We have confusion from one of the major powers not clearly defining how it sees the current disagreements and difficulties between the super-powers. We have President Reagan referring to Europe as the potential site for this limited use of nuclear weapons. In current thinking it is clear that the United States is building up to the stage where it is willing to use nuclear weapons in the European theatre against Soviet and Soviet-backed forces. It believes that this use of a nuclear armoury will be controlled and that there is no chance of such a conflict escalating into a full-scale nuclear holocaust. In taking this position the Reagan Administration has finally abandoned the old concept of a nuclear balance between the major powers, the concept of mutually assured destruction commonly described in strategic and military terms as MAD. Surely, it is aptly and appropriately named MAD. Under this concept both the United States and the Soviet Union, subject to each other's nuclear arsenal, would destroy each other in a nuclear conflagration. Therefore, neither country would make a move. </PARA>
<PARA> Now President Reagan believes nuclear war can be controlled. Further, he believes that with a sufficiently developed nuclear capacity an all-out nuclear war can be won by the side with an efficient first-strike capability. Hence he believes there is a need to develop on the one hand tactical nuclear weapons such as the neutron bomb, which can be used in supposedly small-scale conflicts, and on the other hand strategic, large-scale weapons such as the MX or Cruise missiles which aim to knock out completely the Soviet armoury. This is in contradiction to the expressed view of President Brezhnev, which must be rejected of course by the conservative viewpoint, that the Soviet Government pledges itself never to be the first government to press the button, that there will be no winner in a nuclear conflagration. Today I contend-the experts are behind me-that the Reagan concept of limited nuclear war is a false concept, an impossibility. With the extent of nuclear weapons available to both nuclear powers, not forgetting the nuclear cababilities of many of the smaller powers, there is no doubt that the small-scale use of nuclear weapons in Europe, as has been suggested by President Reagan and his aides, would soon develop into an all-out nuclear war. Moreover, the development of tactical and strategic nuclear weapons such as those announced this year by President Reagan can only further the race towards the building of an even more horrifying store of potential destruction. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look for a moment at some of the comments by people who should know something about these matters. Admiral Gene La Roque, formerly a senior member of the nuclear planning group which is charged with the task of assessing United States and NATO nuclear requirements, earlier this year, about the time that George Kennan made his comments, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Some military men feel that a nuclear war once begun, can be controlled and limited even within the theatre. But I have never seen a reasonable plan to control a nuclear war. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will remember the late Lord Mountbatten and his comment:</PARA>
<PARA> I cannot imagine a situation in which nuclear weapons would be used as battlefield weapons without the conflagration spreading. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr George B. Kistiakowsky, a science adviser to United States Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson and one who took part in the development of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs, backs up this statement. He recently claimed:</PARA>
<PARA> As an inevitable consequence of a limited nuclear war between nuclear superpowers, the holocaust would come. </PARA>
<PARA>I have referred to George Kennan, the famous United States diplomat, foreign affairs adviser to successive presidents and ambassador to the Soviet Union. He is reported to have said:</PARA>
<PARA> Every President of this country, from Dwight Eisenhower to Jimmy Carter, has tried to remind us that there could be no such thing as victory in a war fought with (nuclear) weapons. </PARA>
<PARA>These are all moderates, conservatives, military men, scientists and diplomats saying these things. Many of these things have been said in the United States itself. These people make it clear that the arms race is, unless halted, a race to destruction. They underline the absolute foolishness of the current United States Government policies. Is it any wonder that in past months we have seen nearly two million people demonstrating in the streets of the various capitals of Europe against the arms race and the threat it poses to peace in that region? Is it surprising, for example, that in the last two years the membership of Britain's Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament has increased tenfold, to 30,000? There is no doubt that there is mass apprehension concerning the escalation of the arms race, particularly the nuclear arms race, and the aggressive policies of the super-powers. </PARA>
<PARA> The current arms race has five features that I wish to discuss. First and foremost at the moment is the new development of United States nuclear capacity. Despite the fact that President Reagan has been forced to reduce planned military increases for budgetary reasons, he has announced the go-ahead for the following: The construction of the high radiation neutron bomb; the development of the B1 bomber to replace the current B52s by 1986; the development of 100 multi-warhead MX missiles for deployment in existing missile silos by 1984-and those of us who saw that reported on television were very much concerned indeed; the construction of large, more accurate sea-launched Trident II missiles by 1989; the upgrading of international air surveillance; and the deployment of Pershing II and Cruise missiles by NATO forces in Europe. This represents probably the most substantial development of United States arms since the cold war period of the 1950s. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, I can anticipate the response of the conservative opposition when faced with these facts. 'What about the Russians; what about the Red menace?' they will cry. In effect, that was the defence offered by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) of the United States President's decision to go ahead with the neutron bomb. I should make it clear that the Australian Labor Party does not defend the Soviet Union's position. Let me be unequivocal about that. The super-powers have contributed to world tensions, but to devote all of one's criticism to the Soviets while ignoring the United States arms build-up is to be blind and hypocritical. Today it is the United States that leads the arms race, and historically it has always been so. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a table which underlines my point. It is taken from an article by Andrew Mack in the October issue of the Asian Defence Journal entitled 'The Soviet Threat: Reality or Myth?' It shows that the United States leads, and has always led, in the arms race in terms of innovation. If one examines the figures in the table it becomes clear that the United States leads in terms of total nuclear warheads as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Secondly, we should nevertheless point to the Soviet's upgrading of its own nuclear capacity. In this light, its deployment of 250 SS-20 missiles, each containing three nuclear warheads aimed specifically at European targets, is of special note. Also, the Soviet's untenable occupation of Afghanistan has contributed, for a whole number of reasons, to world tension. Thirdly, the breakdown in the SALT II negotiations exemplifies the tenseness of the situation. Once again the blame must be laid at the door of Mr Reagan because, despite the signing of the agreement, his Administration and the United States Congress have refused to ratify SALT II. Afghanistan cannot justifiably be used to halt this important step in the peace progress. Mr Kennan makes the point that the Soviets have lost more than they have ever gained as a result of that intervention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My fourth point relates to the failure of the strategic arms limitation talks. President Reagan will not go ahead with arms limitation talks until he feels that the United States is in a position of real arms superiority; hence the current United States arms build-up. That is hardly, we believe, a way to negotiate peace. Fifthly, side by side with the arms race of the super-powers, we face a huge arms build-up around the world. As Time magazine noted in its issue of 26 October, this involves a nuclear arms build-up in countries such as China, Israel, Pakistan, France, Libya, Iraq, South Africa and elsewhere, as well as a conventional arms build-up in countries too numerous to name. It is a build-up that is being facilitated by the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the USSR supplies 30 per cent of arms sales to the Third World while the United States supplies some 45 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> How has the Government responded to the international arms situation today? It has responded irresponsibly and one-sidedly. There is no doubt that one of Australia's most important alliances is its alliance with the United States. The Labor Party recognises that fact and believes that we should use that relationship creatively. The present Government does not do that at all. It merely kow-tows to every move of the United States Administration. Friendships should never be on the basis of one country meekly following the strongest. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a relatively new United States Government, one which, as I have already noted, has changed considerably the course of United States foreign and arms policies. Yet there is no flexibility in our Government's approach. Its approach remains one of passiveness and mere acceptance. For example, when President Reagan moved ahead with the development of the neutron bomb, the response of our Prime Minister was one of unequivocal support. The response of the Minister for Defence, Mr Killen, to reports of renewed talks between the United States and Soviet foreign ministers due for November was similar. According to the Australian of 27 September, all he could do was talk about 'Soviet expansionism'. That was hardly a suitable response to what are probably the only positive developments on the arms limitation front at the moment. We in the Labor Party, on the other hand, welcome and encourage the talks while recognising the transgressions in which both sides are engaged. </PARA>
<PARA> When China set off its nuclear missile in the Pacific last year, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> Having in mind the capacities of other super powers, it is natural that China, as a large, great and proud nation would want similar capacities. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly the mentality of the arms race. Its philosophy is: 'If the other side has it, we want it too'. This is endorsed by our Prime Minister. The disarmament policy of this Government is in reality a shrug of the shoulders. It says: 'Go ahead. We won't protest; we won't bring any pressure to bear'. Government spokesmen in this debate will no doubt quote the Prime Minister's statement to the United Nations Special Session on Disarmament in July 1978 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The first focus of the program of action for arms control and disarmament must be on issues of nuclear arms control. My Government's position is clear and unequivocal. We oppose further escalation of the nuclear arms race. We oppose the spread of nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> First, the nuclear weapons powers must take effective action to limit and reduce their nuclear arsenals. Second, there must be an end to nuclear testing in all environments. Third, the international non-proliferation system must be strengthened. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the voice fades in the distance, I remind the Senate and the people of Australia that we are debating a matter of public importance relating to 'the effect of the accelerating global arms race'. I draw attention to what I think is one of the most astounding speeches I have heard in this place-the speech by Senator Gietzelt. The key to his speech was a sentence which he repeated, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today it is the United States that leads the arms race and historically it has always been so. </PARA>
<PARA>He repeated that statement; they were his words. In fact, his speech for the first 13 minutes was an attack upon the United States of America and the American arms buildup. Then, with seven minutes remaining, he suddenly remembered that he had better say something about the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us test this situation. Senator Gietzelt's thesis is:</PARA>
<PARA> Today it is the United States that leads the arms race and historically it has always been so. </PARA>
<PARA>The people of Australia ought to know the facts. The facts are that for a decade the spending of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on strategic nuclear arms has been three times that of the United States. In the same period, Soviet spending on conventional weapons has been double that of the United States. The armed forces of the Soviet Union outnumber those of the United States by more than two to one. While the United States has replaced some of its land-based missiles with the multiple warhead, the Minuteman III, the United States today has the same number of intercontinental ballistic missiles that it had in 1967. The United States has deployed no additional nuclear ballistic missile carrying submarines since 1967. The United States has deployed no new heavy strategic bombers since 1962. Indeed, the B52 bomber fleet has been reduced from 935 in 1956 to less than 350. On the side of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, over 300 SS18s, each with multiple warheads, are now deployed. Each of these is capable of carrying at least 10 warheads and each missile has a destructive capacity exceeding 200 times that of the Hiroshima bomb. The Soviet Union last year launched the largest strategic missile submarine in the world, the Typhoon. Recently a Russian submarine was found within the waters of a Swedish naval base, purportedly carrying nuclear weapons. The Russians have consistently outspent the United States in the area of military hardware and have clearly pursued, and continue to pursue, an aggressive foreign policy which does not stop at the occupation of independent countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Against those facts-they are capable of proof-the whole of Senator Gietzelt's speech was completely unfounded. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Today it is the United States that leads the arms race and historically it has always been so. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, he built up a series of concepts, putting into President Reagan's mouth words that do not exist. Of course, America does not believe that anyone can win a nuclear war. Of course, that is a rejection. It is not true that America is willingly pursuing a collision towards war. America today is carrying the burden of peace for the free world. That is something we ought to be supporting; that is something we ought to be praising, not sneering at and distorting. It is no use trying to put words into President Reagan's mouth because he has decided upon the construction of the neutron bomb in a limited capacity. The fact of the matter is that the Soviet armed forces, both in manpower and in armour on the ground, so greatly outnumber the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation forces that the capacity of the Soviets to overrun Western Europe and, indeed, the free world is immense. In the view of the Americans the only way to stop that is to have effective deterrents. If the armed forces are outnumbered two to one in a conventional way, there must be deterrents. The United States is not an aggressive force. The United States is a country which, like the United Kingdom of the past, is now carrying the burden of peace for the world on its shoulders. I remind the Senate of the enormous distortion of Senator Gietzelt's speech. He deliberately misconstrued the size, nature and growth of the Soviets and, indeed, almost forgot their existence, in pouring out his vindictive attack against America. One of the sad things about the Opposition is how much its members can show and reveal their hatred of all that is American. It is tragic that this should be so. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the substance of this matter. The Government shares the concern expressed in the community at the current state of international tension and at the prospects for escalation of the arms race. The need for practical measures on arms control in order to restrain the arms race is greater today than at any time in world history, but the need to protect the free world from war today is greater than at any time in world history. We do not get protection from war simply by ignoring the buildup of potential opponents. We do not get protection unless there are policies on security. The international political climate is difficult and grows steadily more difficult. Events in Afghanistan and Poland illustrate the problems we face. The Government maintains, nevertheless, its strong support for the goal of disarmament and the negotiation of balanced and verifiable measures of arms control. The Government continues to give the highest priority to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. There can be no question of our outstanding support for the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the measures deriving from it. We are actively promoting the conclusion of a treaty outlawing the testing of nuclear weapons by all states in all environments. </PARA>
<PARA> Our commitment to disarmament and arms control goals not only is pursued in the interest of world stability but also is firmly based upon Australia's national interests. A stable world is important to us all. When we face the continuing development of military preparedness by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Warsaw Pact countries, and unless those countries can be joined with us and our allies in genuine disarmament, we must balance our ultimate goal of world disarmament with preparedness against the exercise of military power by others. It is to be recognised that the present international climate is not favourable to the achieving of balanced and verifiable arms control treaties. A firm climate of confidence between states is an essential basis for progress towards agreements on arms control. Yet the trends in Soviet power growth continue unabated. </PARA>
<PARA> So concerned is our ally, the United States of America, that it recently took the unprecedented step of releasing a booklet by Caspar Weinberger entitled Soviet Military Power. I direct the attention of the Senate and the public to that booklet. It shows that from a defensive Soviet military establishment 20 years ago there has been a movement to a development which possesses strong offensive capabilities today. The booklet, written in low key, clearly documents development in a way which shows how the Soviet Union has systematically eliminated its vulnerabilities, improved its ability to attack swiftly and extended its naval range and air force punch. In the West we see well-intentioned protest movements opposing military preparedness; yet those protest movements ignore the fact that peace can come only if both sides desist. It is not sufficient for one country or group of countries to lay down its arms in the face of an increasing threat from others. </PARA>
<PARA> It is regrettable that those who sincerely seek disarmament may be forced to remain prepared. Australia has been very active in promoting disarmament and it is not a cause for apology that we should also have to look to our preparedness. Indeed, military preparedness ought to be-on occasions it seems to be-a bipartisan concept. Mr Hayden made it clear in recent remarks on defence that he subscribes to this view and the Australian community at large accepts the necessity for our defence to be strong. All that said, it simply remains to give some examples of the Government's concern to pursue the ultimate goal of disarmament. The first Special Session on Disarmament of the United Nations General Assembly took place in June 1978 and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcom Fraser) represented Australia, as Senator Gietzelt mentioned. This is an indication of how seriously this Government views disarmament: The Prime Minister made a major speech in which he emphasised Australia's goals of disarmament. It included three main points. I use his words:</PARA>
<PARA> The nuclear weapons powers must take effective action to limit and reduce their nuclear arsenals . . . There must be an end to nuclear testing in all environments . . . The international non-proliferation system must be strengthened . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Australia is a member of the United Nations Comittee on Disarmament-and an active member. The Committee is a single multilateral negotiating forum in the disarmament field. On 29 October the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) tabled in Parliament the report of the Australian delegation to the 1981 Session of the Committee on Disarmament. In doing so, he noted that the report provided a readily accessible and authoritative account of the major disarmament issues being discussed internationally. He said that he believed the report would be a positive contribution to discussions on disarmament, but observed that the main reasons for the unfavourable international climate in regard to successful negotiation of disarmament and arms control measures were, largely, the Soviet Union's extensive armament program, the instability which the Soviet Union had created by its invasion and occupation of Afghanistan and the Soviet Union's support for Vietnam's invasion and occupation of Kampuchea. Mr Street welcomed the discussions on the theatre nuclear forces in Europe which are to begin shortly between the United States and the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is preparing actively for the second Special Session on Disarmament, which is to be held in 1982. At the second special session we are hopeful of significant progress being made in the three goals already mentioned and we will be continuing to promote the development of a comprehensive convention banning chemical weapons. Honourable senators will be only too well aware of recent indications that chemical weapons have been used in Afghanistan. This indicates the urgency of drawing up a comprehensive and fully verifiable treaty. The Australian Government's opposition to the testing of nuclear weapons by France in the Pacific is well known and has been consistent for many years. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me repeat that disarmament cannot be one-sided. Action by the Soviet Union could provide a basis for greater international confidence and have a very welcome effect on the international climate. Let me illustrate this, as I have done, by referring to the enormous buildup of arms by the Soviet Union. I again remind the Senate of this book. I must say that while listening to Senator Gietzelt I was mindful of a comment by Michael Barnard in the Age newspaper recently. The article was headed: 'Not so much doves as lemmings'. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> And what's more (to resume last week's theme) there is in the West today an ultimately suicidal public tendency to suspect the very worst of our friends and the very best of our enemies. </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing could have illustrated that more than the speech today by Senator Gietzelt. He spent 13 minutes on a virulent attack upon America and in saying that the arms race is the creation of the Americans. In the remaining seven minutes he reminded himself that the Soviet Union existed. Then, again, we heard the words that the United States leads the arms race today and historically always has done so. That is an utterly false statement indeed on which to base an utterly false attack. Michael Barnard went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The clarity and reasoning which encourages consensus and enables political or any other form of leadership to function effectively is largely gone. </PARA>
<PARA> A blinding example of this failure to comprehend, of public susceptibility to misrepresentation, is the response to President Reagan's recent remarks on nuclear warfare. Asked whether he believed it possible for there to be a tactical nuclear exchange without it necessarily escalating to full-scale strategic nuclear warfare, the President replied, ''I don't honestly know'', and then proceeded to outline a contingency in which he considered a limited exchange might occur. </PARA>
<PARA>The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> In very short time the canard was around-especially in Western Europe where Left-liberal media, unilateral disarmers and Soviet ''peace'' fronts had a field day-that a grossly insensitive US was prepared to fight a limited nuclear war at Europe's expense. </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing could describe the error, the distortion, of Senator Gietzelt's speech more than that. Let me put this together. Clearly, Senator Gietzelt's speech was built upon the premise that the United States was leading, moving ahead and the pacesetter in the arms race and had always been. I systemically set out to describe the fact that for a decade the spending of the USSR on strategic nuclear arms had been three times that of the United States; that in the same period Soviet spending on conventional weapons had been double that of the United States; that the armed forces of the Soviet Union outnumber those of the United States by more than two to one; that while the United States had been steadying its number of projectiles there had been a significant increase in the number in Russia; and that there had been a buildup in the Soviet Union's naval fleet and air force. All those things are in contradiction of what Senator Gietzelt said. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that the two mighty powers today, the USSR and the USA, are unhappily and tragically for the world locked into a condition which has been described as peace by mutual terror. I refer to peace maintained by the threat by one to the other of retaliation after the first strike in nuclear warfare. One of the ugliest concepts mankind can have is that one has to defend oneself by making it impossible for the other fellow to obtain total victory at the first strike. If that is so, it is necessary for America-it is necessary for the free world also for whose defence America takes the weight of the burden-to build itself up to be a force capable of deterrence. </PARA>
<PARA> I reject entirely any suggestion that America has an aggressive role in this world or that it will unwittingly provoke war by its actions. America has not caused the Afghanistan situation. America is not causing the problems in Vietnam and Kampuchea. America is not destabilising many parts of the world. The fact is that the Soviet influence throughout the world is aimed at destabilisation. I have pointed out that Australia is pledged to nuclear disarmament; that is, to restrict the arms buildup, to achieve arms limitation and to ensure that nuclear weapons do not proliferate throughout the world. We are one of the main countries in the world which lays down stringent rules against proliferation of nuclear arms and weapons. It is an astounding situation that a member of the Labor Party can mount a speech which, except in latter moments of repentance, entirely puts the blame upon America and sees America as the great pacesetter in arms. This goes against all the facts of modern day history. America has a tremendous burden to carry in ensuring the peace of the world. We should be advising it, helping it and being a friend, albeit a critical friend if necessary. We should never forget that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the accelerating global arms race. In dealing with that subject I do not want to enter into a discussion about goodies and baddies. We are all very good at that; we learnt it in the Boy Scouts. We should not be carrying on that sort of debate in the Senate in 1981. Of course, Senator Carrick is a past master at it. What we are concerned about is the very low profile which the Australian Government adopts in relation to peace and disarmament. If we are to have a serious debate about it, it is ridiculous for the Leader of the Government to say that the United States Government, for example, is not guilty of any kind of aggressive action. Of course the United States Government is guilty of aggressive actions in international affairs. It was guilty of aggressive actions in Guatemala. It still props up in Guatemala a corrupt and extremely regressive government, and it does so with military force. It is guilty of at least partial aggression in El Salvador, an aggression which has aroused the condemnation and criticism of two countries, Canada and France, which Australia said were essential to the Sinai peacekeeping force. They have a view which is totally different from that of the United States Government on the situation in El Salvador. The Australian Government has no view at all because although the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is concerned to project himself as a world statesman he does not have a world view on these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sort of thing which precipitates a debate of this kind is growing community concern about world peace. I speak perhaps only for myself when I say that I am immensely concerned about these matters. I am concerned about the team of geriatrics in the Kremlin whose positions on these issues were determined in the 1950s and still remain the same. I am concerned every time I see President Reagan on television. He might scare the hell out of the Russians but he also scares the hell out of me. I am very concerned that the President of the United States should hold some of the views which he apparently holds. We in Australia would be very thoughtful and careful if we recognised that fact. We should be concerned about the lack of a world view by the United States on these matters. We should be concerned in this Parliament that our Government does not follow the United States up the same drain pipe on every conceivable occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Carrick in his contribution to this debate gave no evidence really of Australia's international involvement in disarmament questions. He confused the issues of military preparedness and disarmament-military preparedness for what; disarmament for what? They are the questions which have to be considered and they cannot be glibly confused as they were by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I think also it is quite extraordinary to say in a debate of this kind that we know what we are up against because of Afghanistan and Poland. If Senator Carrick knows what we are up against because of Afghanistan and Poland I would have expected a more intelligent approach from the Australian Government. Because the approach from the Australian Government was to try to stop us participating in the Olympic Games. That has had very little effect on what has happened in Afghanistan. In relation to Poland, I would have expected a more thoughtful and generous approach from the Australian Government than the one which has so far been shown. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hardly extravagant in my view to regard arms limitations as a matter of life and death. This Government's record on these questions does not match its rhetoric at any time. There is a lot of talk, not much action. I think we have to look at the size of the problem before we determine an appropriate attitude for a country the size of Australia to take. In 1980 Russia and the United States spent over $200,000m on armaments. With the election of the Thatcher Government in England in 1979 and the Reagan Government in the United States in 1980, defence expenditure has risen sharply in both of those countries. The defence priorities, not the expenditure, are in a sense the most alarming thing. All three governments have a predeliction for new machinery but there is evidence to suggest that in many cases this is sheer folly. The Reagan Administration is pressing ahead with the MX missile system. This is alleged to be an urgent priority because the Russians could destroy existing Minuteman silos in a first strike and so go unpunished by the United States. That presupposes, as the British Guardian pointed out a couple of weeks ago, an efficiency in the Russians beyond credibility. There are 1,052 missile silos containing the Minuteman missile. If ten of those silos were untouched-only ten-by a Russian pre-emptive strike the United States could still deliver a 10 megaton strike on the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics from those ten silos alone. That is, it could deliver 666 times the force of explosion which took place at Hiroshima. The United States would still have that sort of nuclear capacity if that situation arose. So if we talk about punishment in a nuclear context, which seems to me to be a crazy sort of expression to use, that is the sort of punishment from which the United States could obtain some obtuse and bizarre satisfaction. If all the silos of the United States were knocked out in a first strike by the USSR, the United States nuclear submarines alone have a strike capacity equivalent to 21,000 Hiroshimas. </PARA>
<PARA> The British, of course, are following a similar pattern at the moment under their present government in relation to the Trident missile. The assumption again is that the present Trident missiles do not provide an adequate deterrent. The United States has decided to employ the cruise missile, the neutron bomb and to go ahead with the B1 bombers which will cost $100m apiece. I mention these things not to get involved in that sort of war games argument about who has the most weapons or who can in a multiplicity of times most destroy the other, but merely to illustrate how governments in a sense are mesmerised into making irrational decisions by the cry of rearmament. That is really the essential thing about this debate, whether we are to be mesmerised by ex-actors in the United States or by geriatrics in the Soviet Union-depending on our predeliction-into believing that this enormous strike capacity has any relevance to issues relating to the determination of international affairs and the future of humanity in any constructive way. </PARA>
<PARA> What can Australia do in this context? First, there is a need to have a clear and comprehensive policy on disarmament. Secondly, we should take every international opportunity to explain and advocate that policy. Thirdly, within Australia we should mobilise people and opinion to work for disarmament, particularly and urgently nuclear disarmament; and I do not mean unilateral disarmament. I do not think the Government has any clear or comprehensive policy on disarmament at all and it does not take every opportunity it can to advocate disarmament. One of the great failures of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting-CHOGM-in Melbourne was the failure to make a stronger statement on disarmament, and in that sense CHOGM was a lost opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> There are more recent examples of the failure of disarmament policy. For example, I refer the Senate to President Reagan's words a few days ago which suggested that the United States had accepted the concept of a limited, winnable nuclear war in Europe. Immediately the story broke the Government of West Germany demanded a full explanation and rebuttal of the President's reported words. I mention this because it is necessary, if we are to talk seriously about this issue in the Senate, to face up to the fact that this is a matter of enormous concern on the continent of Europe. The aberrations, as some conservative spokesmen might like to call them, of what we have seen on television about nuclear disarmament concern in Europe are not going to go away under the present policies, because President Reagan not only scares the hell out of the Russians and out of me but he also scares the hell out of millions of people in Europe every time he makes pronouncements of the kind to which I have just referred. When Dr Helmut Schmidt, the Chancellor of West Germany, demanded an explanation of the President's words, Australia of course said nothing-the mouse that roared on this issue. We must not forget that if a nuclear war broke out, it would be a matter of concern to us in a strategic and very direct sense as well as a matter of concern in relation to the whole of the human race. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately that view of the President of the United States which brought such concern a week or two ago is not shared by the whole of the United States Congress. Senator Frank Church, the former Chairman of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in Canberra on 21 October:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no such thing as limited nuclear war. Any nuclear exchange would quickly escalate out of control. Any talk of limited nuclear war is unreal. </PARA>
<PARA>What I am concerned about in this debate is that nobody should go away with the view that our allegiance to and friendship with the United States involve us in accepting some of the more bizarre propositions which stem from that country, because once the possibility, the notion, of winnable nuclear war has been sold we are a tremendous step down the road towards making nuclear war not only a possibility but also a probability. I think it is a matter of grave concern that not only this Parliament in discussing this issue but also the media in Australia have been prepared to give credence to some of those bizarre notions of limited nuclear war. It is good to think that some Americans in high places do not believe those things; it is terrifying to think that others do. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thing I would be concerned that Australia should do is to seek official or unofficial membership of the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues which is headed by Olaf Palme, a former Premier of Sweden. Membership of that Commission includes many distinguished persons from East and West and others from the Third World. We ought to be a member of that Commission. It is working to support and to publicise the United Nations Special Session on Disarmament. The recent American offer to make a formal proposal soon for a nuclear free zone in the Middle East, a constructive suggestion from the United States, is something which the Labor Party has welcomed and which the Government of Australia ought to be welcoming as an initiative. We ought to be committed to those sorts of policies in every field of potential world conflict. To the best of my knowledge that American proposal drew no support whatsoever from the Australian Government. To say the least, that was a major political and diplomatic omission. </PARA>
<PARA> I should point out that, while calling for disarmament, most of our major allies are supplying vast conventional armouries to smaller countries, yet very little is heard diplomatically from Australia on such arms agreements. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute says that the Soviet Union supplies 30 per cent of arms sales to the Third World. The United States, not to be outdone, provides about 45 per cent of arms sales to the Third World. In the past 10 years arms sales to the Third World have totalled something like $US60 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> This country has a long and shameful history of overdependence on other powers in relation to defence and international matters. The Labor Party wants to see a more independent approach to those issues. We believe that not only would such an approach mean a safer Australia, but also it might, with some imagination and initiative on behalf of Australian governments, lead a little more to the possibility of a safer world. It is not just a question of the safety of Australia. Ultimately and more importantly, it is a question of Australia having the capacity, the imagination and the initiative to play a more independent and constructive role in ensuring world peace. If some of the suggestions which have been made during this debate were followed by the Government, we believe that that may be a practical possibility. If we are to continue this debate, do not let us do it on the basis of goodies and baddies but rather on the realities of world power and the possibility and prospect for peace in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a matter of public importance put by Senator Gietzelt in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The lack of concern by the Government regarding the effect of the accelerating global arms race. </PARA>
<PARA>The one point Senator Gietzelt made with which I can agree whole-heartedly is that the accelerating global arms race is a matter of critical importance. It is possibly the most critical of all matters that this Parliament could be debating. The only matter which is perhaps of greater importance is the reasons for the accelerating global arms race, the reasons why, regrettably, the United States of America in particular has been forced in recent times to accelerate its arms build-up. Those reasons were expressed in detail by our leader, Senator Carrick, in his speech. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter before the Senate refers to the Government's lack of concern. It is my submission that, if that is analysed, it will be found not to be so. In fact, in the whole of Senator Gietzelt's 20-minute speech he made only one point on that issue. He was critical of the Australian Government for it not being sufficiently critical of the United States. I submit to the Senate that an examination of the performance and the attitude of the Australian Government in relation to the arms build-up shows a real and meaningful concern and shows that Australia can play a role in this critical area. We all accept that Australia is not a major world power. We do not have the power to influence others by force, to take a certain course of action, but there are other ways in which we can make a worthwhile contribution. An analysis of the material shows that Australia is playing that role. </PARA>
<PARA> In this debate I particularly wish to refer to the report of the Australian delegation to the 1981 session of the Committee on Disarmament, which took place in Geneva between 3 February and 21 August this year. That report was brought down in this Parliament only last week. What is outstanding from that report is the real contribution that Australia can make in this critical area. I shall give some background on the Committee on Disarmament, for those who are unfamiliar with it. It arose out of the 1978 Special Session on disarmament of the United Nations General Assembly. The Committee consists of 40 member nations. Australia sought to be on it. It sought to make a contribution through that Committee and that, in itself, shows a concern for the critical work that can be performed by the Committee. It has met in the years since 1978 and has brought down annual reports. Reports have been submitted by the Government to the Parliament. As I indicated, the latest report was submitted only last week. </PARA>
<PARA> The work of the Committee is carried out under a number of heads. In the plenary session, it dealt with the two critical issues of the nuclear test ban treaty and nuclear disarmament. It has also broken up into four working groups which deal with four particular issues. The first issue is negative security assurances, which are assurances from the nations which have nuclear arms to the majority of nations which do not have them. A second working group deals with the frightening subject of chemical weapons. A third working group deals with the even more frightening subject of radiological weapons-a subject which is so frightening that the Committee has been unsuccessful in defining the potential of radiological weapons or even what they are. The fourth working group is considering a comprehensive program for disarmament. As I indicated, this Committee is a positive way in which a country of Australia's influence and size can make a worthwhile contribution to this debate. That is exactly what the work of this Committee has done over the years. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer the Senate to the opening speech made by Mr Walker, who headed our delegation on the Committee. The speech is included in the report brought down before the Parliament last week. Page 39 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> For Australia, two issues on our agenda are of outstanding importance; they are those concerning a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty and a chemical weapons convention. </PARA>
<PARA>He indicated that he wanted to say a few words on both subjects. With regard to the first subject, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's commitment to work for the prohibition of all nuclear test explosions in all environments for all time is well known and was once more made evident at the thirty-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly. We see such a treaty as the most readily achievable measure that would offer effective and practical assurances to the international community against the dangers of continued testing, against the further growth of existing nuclear arsenals and against the extension of nuclear weapons to other countries. We place high value also on the contribution which such a treaty could make to reducing regional tensions in many parts of the world, and on its other many benefits. Australia believes that this is an appropriate, indeed an urgent, issue to be tackled by this Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>That was part of the address made by Mr Walker on behalf of this country to that international body. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia expressed concern that the tripartite working group on this subject had not been able to make the progress which we regard as desirable. Nevertheless, we are not prepared to let the matter rest at that stage. Although we expressed disappointment, we said that we could be doing other things in the meantime. We said that we might usefully start work on the international and administrative arrangements for an international network of seismic stations to verify compliance with a future test ban treaty. That is an example of Australia, in a situation in which the major world powers are having difficulty in reaching an agreement, taking a positive stand and putting an attitude that in the meantime we can do something worthwhile. The Senate might be interested to know that, in saying that, we were supported by Japan, Canada and a number of other countries although, regrettably, not by the majority. Nevertheless, we are playing a lead. </PARA>
<PARA> In a related activity, a group of seismic experts has been meeting under the auspices of the Committee for the last few years to examine some of the technical issues. We have made a contribution in that regard. The Australian representative on the seismic experts group, Mr Peter McGregor, was at the conference and continued to make a contribution. In fact, in one area we are leading the group's work, and that is the area to investigate the possibility of using the existing world-wide communications network of the World Meteorological Organisation to transmit messages containing seismic information such as would be needed for international verification of a comprehensive test ban treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> We confirmed again that we are prepared to play a critical role in relation to this most important issue. That is an example of Australia showing concern, not a lack of concern as is indicated in the wording of the proposal put forward for discussion by Senator Gietzelt. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia is taking the lead, as Senator Teague says. The other area in which I think we can argue that we are also taking the lead before this Committee on Disarmament is the working party on chemical weapons. If I may continue to refer to the speech by Mr Walker, as set out at page 40 of the report, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other priority item is a chemical weapons convention. Here too, as with the test ban, the need for effective action is urgent. Delay, for whatever reason, carries awesome risks for the international community and for the inhabitants of our planet. </PARA>
<PARA> We know from the expert advice we have heard that many countries have the potential to manufacture chemical weapons. We know-press accounts abound-of reports of large arsenals of chemical weapons and the training of troops in their use. We know the pressures this causes for other countries to arm themselves in turn with even more fearsome new chemical weapons. The one hope of avoiding the chemical arms race which now threatens is to negotiate and put into place a chemical weapons convention. Such a convention must have reliable and convincing verification provisions if it is to provide the security which could remove the rationale for any country to arm itself with these weapons. </PARA>
<PARA>There again Australia is taking the lead. In the previous year, on Australia's initiative, the Committee on Disarmament set aside a few days for informal meetings with technical experts. Again that was done on our instigation. What is almost exciting from Australia's point of view, I think, is that delegations from other countries such as the Netherlands were coming to the Australian delegation and suggesting that the procedures we have previously set up should be continued at that last meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> Page 20 of the report details some of the work that we have done on the limitation of chemical weapons. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian delegation was one of the most active delegations in all aspects of the Committee's work on Chemical Weapons. It contributed extensively to the Working Group's examination of the Chairman's draft elements. </PARA>
<PARA>That was an attempt to set up a draft convention. The Australian delegation produced working papers which were put to the Committee. We took a particular interest in the question of ensuring that the Committee would have access to expert advice. We provided our own experts. The Australian expert, Dr Freeman, participated in all of the meetings. The Australian delegation was also at pains to make arrangements for the chemicals weapons experts of different countries to get together outside the official Committee and working group meetings. Again Australia was taking in this awesome field of chemical weapons a lead in limiting chemical weapons for the benefit of all mankind. This was done by the Australian Government that the Opposition supporters in this discussion are attempting to criticise. </PARA>
<PARA> The action of the Australian delegation was not limited to only those fields. I refer honourable senators to the working party on radiological weapons. Honourable senators can see at page 26 of the report which was brought down last week that the working party and the Committee on Disarmament as a whole adopted a device, advocated by Australia in the previous year, to handle the Soviet wish for a full debate and the creation of a subsidiary body on the general topic of new weapons of mass destruction. The Soviet proposal was not accepted. Again, Australia took the lead. Instead of such elaborate and time consuming treatment, Australia instigated informal meetings at which experts from the Warsaw Pact countries were able to put forward their views. I put it to the Senate that that again is an example of Australia taking a lead, showing a major concern in this critical area. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Working Group on the Comprehensive Program of Disarmament, perhaps the most critical of all the working parties and undertaking the most critical of all the work being done by the Committee on Disarmament, again Australia is making a contribution to a world body set up by the United Nations to look particularly towards ways of arms limitation in the world, and at ways whereby the world can reach a situation of nuclear disarmament and stop nuclear tests. In this area Australia is making a major contribution. Under the heading 'Comprehensive Program of Disarmament' the report of the Australian delegation states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian delegation was active in support of these efforts, in particular in helping to draft two conceptual Western papers and in advancing wording for particular items in a draft Comprehensive Program of Disarmament . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In these areas I believe we can be proud of the contribution that Australia is making and of the attitude of our Government in ensuring that such a contribution is made. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I draw to the Senate's attention the fact that when it came to drawing up the final annual report of this international Committee, Australia was nominated by the Western Group to participate in the drafting of that final accord. If ever there was evidence in the international community that Australia's contribution in this most critical area is being recognised that must be it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance we are discussing concerns not the armaments race in the world generally but 'the lack of concern by our Government regarding the effect of the accelerating global arms race'. I think it is appropriate for us to consider the world background so that we can assess the scale within which we are working. It reveals that although Australia's spending on defence is considerable and increasing it is puny on the world scale. Of rather more importance are Australian attitudes towards both the military policies of other countries and, perhaps less obviously but of no less importance, the implications for the world of the mining and sale of Australian uranium. Perhaps the most impactive and memorable single background fact about global arms spending is that in 1980 world-wide military expenditure amounted to more than $1m for every minute of every day. Caspar Weinberger, the United States of America Secretary of Defense, has warned Americans that they may have to get used to the idea of spending 50 per cent of gross national product on weaponry for the armed forces. One-half of all research carried out in the world is on military projects. The World Health Organisation has estimated that the eradication of malaria from the world would cost less than one-thousandth of the world's annual military spending. The Brandt report on development states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The cost of a ten-year program to provide for essential food and health needs in developing countries is less than half of one year's military spending. </PARA>
<PARA>When these facts are taken into account and the tragic implications that they have for the world really sink in it emerges as vitally important that individuals and nations of good will should do all that they can to encourage the reduction of this sort of spending even to some small extent. Even a fraction of a percentage taken off that rate of spending would, of course, be of enormous value elsewhere. Yet we find that on 19 February 1980 the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), speaking on Afghanistan, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> As well as these immediate measures, and of greater importance, long-term policies to match Soviet power and staying-power must be formulated. </PARA>
<PARA> An indispensible element in that process must be the redressing of the trend in the military balance. </PARA>
<PARA> In this, as in other aspects, the main burden must fall on the United States. President Carter has already announced a series of measures which will strengthen the armed forces of the United States and, what is also very important, will increase their flexibility and their capacity to respond quickly to crises. But if the main burden falls on America, it is entitled to look for supporting measures in other countries that value their independence and the maintenance of world order. Other developed countries, including Australia, must respond. In this respect the recent decision to modernise and strengthen NATOs theatre nuclear weapons system is important. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Carrick said earlier in this debate that the blame for the arms race falls equally on the Soviet Union. There is no doubt whatsoever about that. The issue of which of the zonal competitors contributes most to the problem is debated enormously in the world, but that is not a matter for debate now. One thing that is beyond doubt is that the Australian Government has more influence in Washington than it has in Moscow. I think this is highly relevant to the discussion we are having at present. I regret that I cannot recall in any of the defence statements made by the Government recently any policy initiatives aimed at influencing the United States away from military solutions. There have been a number of pious platitudes, but these have always been generalities and have never really come to specifics in any region where some constructive thinking might have been appropriate. Even those pious platitudes are thin on the ground. The general theme continues to be one of agreement that the only way to maintain peace is constant escalation of the weapons war. The Australian Democrats cannot accept that this is a rational or reasonable point of view; nor that it should be carried to the extent that the Government carries it. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact remains that even very small reductions in spending on armament could make the funds available for a profound improvement in the overall human condition. Perhaps the strangest irony of all is that while the wealth of the world is being spent to such a ludicrous extent on arms the conditions are encouraged which lead to the risk of more and more conflict. Poverty, deprivement and disease are hardships which do not, as the Victorian moralists say, improve the human character; far from it. They debase the human character. The hungry, deprived man is a desperate man. He can be persuaded to resort to arms only too easily. We have seen most terrible lessons of this kind in the last decade or two in both Asia and Africa. In virtually every case the armaments which destroyed and killed in those areas were provided by one or other of the zonal competitors of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot, as Senator Carrick has done, merely look at the question of armaments as being competition between two zones. There is a malicious, evil and thoroughly powerful and integrated force in the world which is there to provide arms to all who want them and to exploit misery, poverty and discord wherever they can be found. People for whom more might well have been done by the world and could easily be done by the world are merely being given a gun. We subscribe to policies which do not give the hungry man food but instead place a gun in his hand. All the major nations of the world subscribe to these policies and most of the middle powers of the world do not seem to worry very much about them. Everybody wrings his hands over the latest bloodbath in Africa or Asia but very few people stop to reason that that might not have happened at all had it not been for the escalation of the world arms industry.</PARA>
<PARA> As one of those who feel very badly about the predicament of the people of East Timor, I would like to look briefly at its relevance to this debate. It is, indeed, very relevant to this debate. The invasion and conquest of East Timor was a classic example of the naked use of armed force. There was no other justification for it. Indonesia has no historic, geographic, ethnic or cultural basis whatsoever for any claim to East Timor, and never has had. The matter was wholly based on the fact that Australia and Portugal-the colonising powers-were going through periods of political crisis and the opportunity was seen by the generals in Jakarta to grab East Timor. It was really as simple as that. Because of internal problems, Indonesia was looking for some sort of foreign adventure which would enable some form of what it would like to call discipline to be applied to the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that Indonesia had and has the arms to conquer a small neighbouring country and to keep down its people by force of arms. As a result, perhaps one-third of the people of East Timor have died, and more will die yet. Indonesia is apparently intent on continuing the military solution there, even to the extent of a final act of genocide against the East Timorese people. Events in East Timor at this moment confirm that viewpoint, but the key point in the context of what we are now discussing is that Australia has approved of and accepted what is happening in East Timor. I have asked many questions here on this issue and each time I have been told that Australia regards East Timor as a part of Indonesia. East Timor is a part of Indonesia to the extent that she has been made that by the cynical and consistent use of armed force. Australia officially shows a lack of concern for the result of that use of armed force which is equally cynical and consistent. We set ourselves a dangerous precedent in this regard, I feel, and one which we might regret deeply in the not too distant future. It is not too late, I think, to mend our ways. Many thousands, possibly tens or hundreds of thousands, of Australians want the Government to tell Indonesia plainly that the continued military assault on the East Timorese people is an unacceptable use of force and that the end of military measures there and an act of self-determination would be in the best interests of all concerned, including the Indonesians themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The next major lack of concern by the Australian Government towards the arms race in the world is shown in its apparent determination to mine and sell uranium in large quantities, knowing full well that, in spite of so-called safeguard agreements, a great deal of that uranium will inevitably end up in nuclear weapons. I think things that are going on in the world now make that fairly plain. Small nuclear weapons are being built in countries using so-called peaceful nuclear reactors. This proliferation, I think, will be one of the most worrying and troublesome problems that the world will face in the decades to come. It is a fact that so-called peaceful nuclear reactors-the power reactor, the thing which was going to provide power that was too cheap to be metered and which in other circumstances could well be a useful thing to the world but with which we have this terrible dilemma about its inevitable association in the future with the most appalling means that are in use in armed force-can be readily manipulated to produce weapons grade plutonium at a rate faster than that of a fast breeder reactor. The word 'fast' in that device, of course, refers only to the speed of the neutrons. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact also that many of the nations now interested in nuclear power reactors want them not to produce electricity but to provide the means by which to obtain for themselves a nuclear armoury. Those countries are, of course, such bastions of democracy-I speak sardonically-as Libya, South Korea, Argentina and Pakistan, countries notorious for their irrationality and autocracy and, in some cases, their apparent willingness to cause trouble outside their own borders. Much of the spread of nuclear power through the world is now to nations such as those, several of which are already known to be in the process of making nuclear weapons with the product of those reactors. There is no doubt at all that this is happening in the world and will continue in the future at an accelerated rate. What kind of nuclear weapons will they make? It will not be the balance of terror, fusion weapon-the hydrogen bomb. None of those countries have the sophisticated technology to make those things. Instead, they are wishing on the world in large quantities, and in even larger quantities in the future, the small, dirty fission-type weapon which was used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki-the atom bomb, the crude primitive atom bomb with its high rate of fall-out and its contamination of the atmosphere in ways which last for tens of thousands of years. </PARA>
<PARA> I will briefly sketch an unpleasant scenario for the future which the proliferation of these weapons, inevitably associated with the spread of nuclear power, is likely to produce. We can see a process of gradualism in which decade after decade more and more of these weapons are used in regional wars. The word is getting around the world especially now that it is possible to have a limited nuclear war. The major zones of the world are encouraging this viewpoint. We will inevitably, I suggest, see a world in which these armouries of fission weapons are used. We will see the results perhaps only on our television sets but inevitably the deadly cloud of fall-out will increase. The radioactivity each time one of those weapons is exploded will affect every person on this globe. We see a hideous world in which the rates of deformity and cancer become so high that eventually through this process of gradualism every family on the planet will be affected by those weapons in one way or another. This is not a nightmare dream of the future but a reasoned and only too likely result of the continued development of nuclear power. We have shown in the world already that we cannot control the proliferation of plutonium, that we cannot prevent its being used for nuclear weapons, regardless of any safeguard agreements or anything of the kind. If Australia continues to export uranium and to encourage the world to this lemming-like rush to the precipice I think we will regret it within our own lifetime. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement is made that if we do not do it others will, but let me give an analogy. There is in Australia plenty of good hilltop country on which we could grow opium in large quantity. We could use the same logic-if we do not supply it somebody else will. I submit, Mr Acting Deputy President, that such logic is not good enough in any honest country. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to make a few points concerning the Government's defence policy, such as it is, particularly that which concerns the aircraft carrier which the Government seems so bent on purchasing at higher cost and which the Australian Democrats for the past two years have opposed over and over again. I am glad to see that the Australian Labor Party now also opposes that ridiculous purchase and takes the view that we should not have weapons such as an aircraft carrier, which apparently is designed mainly for foreign adventurism and flag flying. If all nations possessed only those arms reasonably necessary for their defence most of the problems created by the world arms race would disappear. Australia can provide an important example in this regard. In so doing we would also be providing rationally for our independence, for our ability to defend this country in all circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take part in this important discussion this afternoon on what has been described as the lack of concern by the Government regarding the effect of the accelerating global arms race. Of course, I certainly do not agree that there is any lack of concern on the part of the Government about an accelerating global arms race. Nor do I believe that any Australian of any political view would take the stance that there was nothing to be worried about in such a circumstance. What we have to do responsibly this afternoon is identify whether the sort of arms race that exists in some measure today is in the ultimate the greatest determinant in finally establishing a sensible and peaceful approach to the problems that confront this world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I recall that earlier in this discussion Senator Button referred to military preparedness as being necessary to ensure ultimate disarmament. He alleged that there was a measure of confusion in people's minds between military preparedness and disarmament. I want to make the point-it occurs to me as being of some significance at least-that the history of mankind over many centuries, including indeed in the twentieth century, has been a permanent illustration of the fact that military unpreparedness is certainly a determinant of war. If one looks at the situation in Europe in the period prior to 1914 one finds that a massive European power was able basically to bring about one of the most tragic and destructive wars in mankind's history largely because there was no preparedness, either mental or physical, on the part of others to withstand it. Regrettably, less than a generation later, in 1939, once again a massive power-physically, mentally and philosophically as well as from the point of view of military capacity-rose and roamed across Europe. At that stage again the rest of the world was totally unprepared, physically and mentally, to withstand that serious threat. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the result? As I recall the years 1939 to 1945 they represented one of the most tragic eras in the history of mankind, an era marked by the greatest destruction and physical deprivation that man had ever known. I suggest that one of the significant contributing causes-although not, of course, the only one-of that disaster and of the previous disaster in the first 50 years of this century was the unpreparedness, mental and physical, of the rest of the world to withstand a massive force. Consequently I do not believe it is illogical to assume that one of the determinants of peace in the future will be our determination to maintain a force, a capacity to defend ourselves, which is in every sense relevant to the sort of force that may conceivably oppose us. I make the point that military unpreparedness is almost a guarantee of military disaster, even though ironically throughout history very often those who were unprepared in the beginning may ultimately, for all sorts of reasons that have been suggested, run out as, in a sense, the victors-if indeed there are any victors in these massive conflicts. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1945 there have been wars-relatively minor wars-but there has been a period of relative peace. In that period there has been a determination, I believe, by the major powers to keep within cooee of each other from a point of view of military capacity. I am not suggesting that this is not a sad situation. Of course it is a sad situation, but if it creates a circumstance whereby we have a capacity to move on in relative peace, to discuss and examine the problems-political, social and economic-that confront the human race, then it serves a very real purpose indeed. I believe it is impossible for any sensible person to allege that there is a lack of concern in this Government-I hope the same applies to the mind of any Australian-about the accelerating global arms race. Of course there is a concern. We must determine that it shall not resolve itself into international conflict, but at the same time we have to realise that on the evidence of history there is more chance that we will survive by having a power at our command which is comparable to any power that is likely to oppose us. Indeed, to suggest a lack of concern in this Australian Government or in any Australian Government infers a total lack of appreciation of the history of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first 40-odd years of this century we suffered World Wars I and II to which I have already referred. They were events of massive suffering. We suffered problems in conflicts in Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam. We have taken part in peacekeeping forces in many places around the world-in Korea, Cyprus, the Sinai and so on. The concern of this Government for peace is a genuine concern and this Government seeks continually to find a resolution. The history of this Government's attempts to find that resolution have been very clearly outlined by Senator Hill, who spoke previous to me. He defined specifically the areas involved and the attitudes that Australia has taken in a continuing and increasing search for international control of armaments-in particular nuclear armaments-and chemical warfare. Our involvement in wars-regrettably, we have had a number of such involvements-has never been to seek sovereign power or territorial gain. Our involvement in war, I believe, genuinely has been an involvement that has sought to establish and maintain a measure of freedom for human beings wherever they may be. That is an important matter to keep at the back of one's mind when looking at Australia's involvement in the control of warfare problems in the current period and in the future. We in this country are and have been, and I would say will remain in the foreseeable future, a trading nation of great significance. The whole of our economy, the whole of our social and economic structure, is based on our capacity to succeed around the world as a trading nation. Indeed, we have been and are successful, and our capacity to remain that way is largely determined by our capacity to contribute to the peaceful solution of problems around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet another reason why this country and this Government are significantly determined that, within their power, they should contribute to the maximum to peace around the world is surely the nature of our resources. We are producers of food, of fibre and of energy resources which are needed around the world by developed and developing countries. We have an obligation not only to establish those resources, to develop them and to make them available to the world that needs them, but also to play our part in seeking to maintain and establish a peaceful circumstance in which those sorts of commitments can be made. I suppose it is an irony, but it is a fact, that in order to secure a real measure of peace one has to be prepared. This has been a painful lesson of history and I have referred to a number of cases during my remarks this afternoon. As I observe it, there is no realistic alternative. Regrettably, when the forces around the world that oppose each other on all sorts of grounds-social, philosophical and economic-recognise that none of them can win, that they are equally strong, then and perhaps then only will we have realistic, proper and constructive discussions to solve the sorts of problems that are relevant to all people everywhere. If we are to ensure that this world continues to develop not by revolutionary but by evolutionary processes and to have within it a measure of permanency, then, perhaps regrettably but nevertheless certainly, we have to establish the sort of power that will make our side of the fence a deterrent to those who seek to establish a sovereignty and a territorial right over other peoples, wherever they may be. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said all that, let me just for a moment refer to the sorts of efforts that Australia seeks to make traditionally in the field of international disarmament. Throughout the existence of the United Nations, the Government has sought to establish through that body, in which the Government has taken a leading role, the control of nuclear arms, chemical warfare and the like. Madam Acting Deputy President, as my time to speak has run out, I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The one hundred and ninety-first report and the one hundred and ninety-second report, which are being tabled today, are unusual in that they have resulted not from any specific inquiry or examination but rather from the Committee's long-standing interest in efficient and economical public administration. The one hundred and ninety-first report is a handbook which covers matters administered by the Treasurer (Mr Howard), the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) and their respective departments. It explains, in concise and readable form, the procedures by which the Commonwealth accounts for the public moneys and other assets which are under its control. The handbook explains the financial documents presented to Parliament, the classification of Budget information, the monthly statement of Commonwealth Government financial transactions, the various Commonwealth accounts and funds and the management of Commonwealth cash accounts within Australia and overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The handbook follows essentially the pattern of a previous publication which was issued by the Department of Finance in 1977, but has been updated and revised to take into account, in particular, the change brought about by the 1979 amendments to the Audit Act 1901. The Committee wishes to take this opportunity to thank the Department of Finance for its considerable assistance in the preparation of this publication. In tabling this handbook in the form of a report to both Houses of Parliament, the Committee is convinced that the wider circulation it will receive should substantially contribute to an expanded awareness of the processes by which Commonwealth funds are receipted and expended. The Committee further believes that this report will prove to be a valuable and convenient reference source for senators and members and others in the general community. I conclude by saying that this report and the one hundred and ninety-second report, which will be presented shortly, continue the Committee's philosophy of bringing wider notice to financial and management issues in the public sector. In so doing, it would welcome a dialogue with any person or organisation that believes it could make a contribution to these matters. I commend the report to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Committee's one hundred and ninety-second report on statistics takes, as its starting point, the 1974 report on the Integration of Data Systems known as the Crisp report. That inquiry identified three major deficiencies in data systems: Poor co-ordination of statistical collections; inadequate communication between producers and users of statistics; and poor accessibility to data that was collected. Unfortunately many of these problems remain in 1981.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of the Crisp report the Australian Bureau of Statistics Act 1975 was passed to establish the Australian Bureau of Statistics as a statutory authority charged with co-ordinating statistical systems in Australia. However, the Act appears to have failed in its central purpose because the Bureau's powers are not sufficient. A suggestion made by the Committee in this report is that the Bureau's powers be clarified and strengthened. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a widely held view abroad in the business community that collections of basic economic data are, in some areas, wholly inadequate. In this regard I refer honourable senators to an article in the Australian of 19 October 1981 where a Sydney stockbroking firm, Dominguez and Barry, had to research such sources as Reserve Bank bulletins, Budget Papers, as well as ABS figures to determine the average per capita public debt, as the Government publishes no such figures. The article quotes these brokers as calling upon the Government for better statistical information on State and Federal borrowings and that currently information in this area is very poor. </PARA>
<PARA> This paper addresses, in part, this problem. It also discusses the advantages of allowing the Bureau access to identified taxation data on businesses as a way of reducing the respondent burden for statistical collections. Access to taxation data, particularly businesses, was recommended in the 1974 Crisp report. Both the Bureau and the Australian Taxation Office sent representatives to assess the systems of tax access for economic statistics operating in Canada and the United States of America in 1979. Surprisingly, no results of the joint investigations by the Bureau and the Taxation Office have yet been presented to the Treasurer (Mr Howard).The proposed access to tax data is supported by the Australian Law Reform Commission, the Australian Taxpayers Association and the Confederation of Australian Industry. It is to be hoped that this discussion paper will stimulate debate on this sensitive issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, on the question of accessibility to data, it is pleasing to note the Bill introduced on 15 October 1981 by the Treasurer to amend the Census and Statistics Act to allow census data, with personal identifiers removed, is to be made more widely available. The Crisp inquiry in 1974 had recommended even wider changes to this Act. These recommendations were endorsed by the Crawford report on structural adjustment. The Law Reform Commission also recommended certain liberalisations in 1979 and some of these have been accepted by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is still concerned that accessibility to data collection is not optimal, and that savings can be made by reducing duplication of collections and making more useful data more widely available. Of course, increased accessibility carries with it the danger of infringement of privacy. The Committee is very conscious of this danger but feels guidelines put forward in a recent Law Reform Commission discussion paper, entitled, 'Privacy and Personal Information', will provide adequate protection in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to one other issue raised in the report; that of the paper burden imposed on business by government. This was the subject of a recent interdepartmental inquiry but the outcome of that study disappoints the Committee. We feel that more can be done in this area and suggest that initiatives recently taken overseas, particularly in Canada and the USA, deserve serious consideration in Australia. The Committee believes that one initiative that would have a positive effect would be a central register of all statistical collections and for the Bureau to be given suitable powers to authorise and advise on the form of statistical collections by other government instrumentalities. The Committee hopes that the issues raised in this report, and the suggestions made, will encourage a wide-ranging discussion on matters that impact very heavily on Australia's overall economic performance. I commend the report to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make a few personal remarks about the report and the three deficiencies which the Committee found to be the most glaring and the most important to be acted upon-the poor co-ordination of statistical collections, the inadequate communications between producers and users of statistics and poor accessibility to data that was collected. An Act was passed in 1975 to establish the Australian Bureau of Statistics as a statutory authority charged with co-ordinating statistical systems in Australia; unfortunately that has not happened. As was stated on page 13 of the report, the Act places obligation for such collection on the Bureau rather than on departments. Unfortunately, the Bureau has not taken the necessary action to clarify its powers and the Committee found that completely unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> The ABS attitude to the whole process of collecting statistical data is very stubborn; the Bureau believes that it has the answers to all the questions. The data collected by the Bureau is not as complete or as reliable as it ought to be. Small businesses which have to supply innumerable statistical data to the Government or to government departments consider that collection an imposition which is very costly to them. I believe that the ABS should do something about it. It should compile a register of all statistical data collected by various bodies in this country and make it available to all those bodies which would like the information but would not know where to find it and might therefore start a collection of data which might be a duplication of data already somewhere in the files but which nobody knows about. I hope that the report, which is a discussion paper, will lead to some positive action by the ABS to improve the collection and dissemination of data in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the reports. </PARA>
<PARA>I merely make one brief comment. These reports have been presented in the Senate two weeks after they were presented in the House of Representatives. I think it ought to be a matter of procedure that reports are brought down in the Senate on the same day as they are brought down in the House of Representatives. Such an arrangement would enable some enlightened and timely comment to be made on reports. </PARA>
<PARA> A practice has been developed by those in charge of business in the Senate of not permitting reports of committees to be brought down on a Wednesday, which is broadcast day. However, some very important reports are brought down in the House of Representatives of a Wednesday, which does not happen to be that chamber's broadcast day. I suggest that committees-in this case the Public Accounts Committee, which is a very important Committee-should be allowed to bring down their reports on any day. It is necessary for matters to be debated at the time reports are brought down because in many cases they attract considerable public interest. I took the step of moving that the Senate take note of the reports to ensure that the reports are placed on the Notice Paper for debate at a later stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I concur with the remarks made by Senator Georges. I think it is almost intolerable that senators who are members of the Public Accounts Committee should be now discussing these reports almost a fortnight after they were tabled in the House of Representatives. After all, the Public Accounts Committee is a joint committee made up of senators and members and Senator Georges is the Deputy Chairman of the Committee. We have had to wait almost a fortnight for these reports to be presented and we are now going through the farce, if I may put it that way, of a senator asking that the reports be printed when in effect they actually have been printed as a result of decisions made in the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Members of the House of Representatives and the Senate carry out a lot of important work as members of Committees. They put in long hours of work. I believe that the reports of committees are of a high standard and have long term implications for the society which we serve. Therefore, I am concerned that far too little time is given to debating important reports made by Senate committees. I would certainly like the situation changed to ensure that the reports of joint committees are tabled in both Houses on the same day. I am concerned because reports such as the ones we have before us are far-reaching.</PARA>
<PARA> Statistics are important to government and the cost of preparing information for government is very high. Certain businesses are rather sceptical about the number of collections in which they are asked to participate. The recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee in this respect are not without some controversy, but I believe that they represent a marked improvement on the existing situation. I believe that we must look to upgrading the status of the Australian Bureau of Statistics because at the moment it is very much under the thumb and direction of the Treasury. I believe not only that it must be given a greater co-ordinating role but also that it must be given a greater degree of independence. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Commonwealth Government financial administration handbook will make a major contribution to the understanding by the electorate of what goes on in this place, how money is appropriated and how it is spent. I therefore welcome its presentation and I hope that it will be given wide distribution. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, I present the reports relating to the following proposed works:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Construction of working, living and area facilities for Army and Navy personnel at Watsonia, Victoria and upgrading of airport facilities for the introduction of domestic wide-body aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a brief statement relating to the reports. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Public Works Committee's report on the upgrading of airport facilities at a number of airports for the introduction of wide-bodied aircraft is the first report on this reference. It makes recommendations on works at Coolangatta, Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. A second report will be presented early next year in respect of work at Adelaide and Hobart. In the limited time available to the Committee since the reference of this work on 27 August 1981, the Committee has not been able to schedule a hearing in Adelaide, from where a substantial number of submissions have been received from local organisations and the public. A public hearing will be set down for December. In order to avoid any substantial delay in completing the work at Adelaide, the Department of Housing and Construction will be proceeding with detailed planning of the Adelaide work. The Committee has been unable also to complete its examination of the proposed works at Hobart. These works also will be included in the second report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is concerned at the number of works being referred to it which are deemed urgent. For instance, the works at Watsonia for the Department of Defence which are reported on today are required to be completed by the end of 1982. This arises from the transfer, in late 1982, of the Army Apprentice School, to which the Army School of Music is administratively attached, from Balcombe to Bonegilla. This move has been planned for some years so that the consequential requirement for accommodation and facilities for the Army School of Music has been known for quite some time. Other recent references to the Committee have also had a similar degree of urgency-for instance, the references on facilities for wide-bodied aircraft, for further dredging work at Brisbane Airport and for the upgrading of the international terminal building at Brisbane Airport. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is required by the Public Works Committee Act to report to the Parliament as expeditiously as possible. This it does. The average time between reference of a work to the Committee and presentation of the Committee's report is some three months. Three of the reports presented today and during the last sitting week were, in fact, completed in two months from the date of referral by the Senate. When it is taken into account that the Committee allows at least one month on each reference for the receipt of public submissions, the Senate will readily understand the pressures put on the Committee when a number of works deemed urgent are referred to it. The Committee attempts to fit in with the Government's works program. It does all that it can to avoid delays to works. The Committee is not, however, prepared to compromise its scrutiny of referred works. It is felt that if the Government can reduce the number of references involving urgent works by better planning or by earlier reference to the Committee, the scrutiny of public works expenditure entrusted by the Parliament to the Public Works Committee will be facilitated. </PARA>
<PARA> In its report on the upgrading of airport facilities for the introduction of wide-bodied aircraft, the Committee is critical that a number of the works at airports had been commenced in 1980-81 without reference to the Committee. These works totalled some $6.08m although no single work at any airport was in excess of $2m, the cost requiring reference to the Public Works Committee. However, certain of these works have pre-empted effective committee examination. The situation at Perth Airport, for instance, clearly demonstrates this point. During 1980-81, works totalling $1.9m were commenced involving both a departure lounge, and an arrivals lounge and baggage handling area. Part of the proposed works for Perth Airport now being reported on involve extensions or adaptions to these earlier works commenced last year. In effect, the domestic terminal development has been decided and commenced without scrutiny by the Public Works Committee or without the opportunity for comment by the public, by local government or by other interested groups. In fact, I feel that had the Public Works Committee considered the works, the current situation in the new arrivals area, where there are no toilet facilities, may well have been avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee understands that the works were required urgently to facilitate the introduction of wide-body aircraft by Trans Australia Airlines. But it cannot accept that proper investigation by the Committee would have unduly delayed the works. The Committee is heartened by the following comments of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) in his second reading speech on the Public Works Committee Amendment Bill 1981:</PARA>
<PARA>It is understood that the Committee was particularly concerned with cases where major works costing over $2m have been phased in over several years with small projects-below $2m. These projects have either escaped committee scrutiny, or if referred to the Committee, have been referred at a stage where proper committee investigation has been pre-empted by the work already done. The Government expects work totalling over $2m to be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, and will do all it can to ensure that all works required to be examined by the Committee in accordance with the Public Works Committee Act will be so examined. I have assured the Committee that should it wish to examine any work below $2m the Government would treat any request sympathetically, and would facilitate committee investigation of any such work. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I thank all members of the Committee for their industry and dedication during this year. This year has been a very busy one for the Committee and the work load on members has been heavy. All members have responded and worked well. I thank them for their help. In particular I thank the two vice-chairmen throughout the year; Senator Melzer in the first part of the year and, since July, the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Les McMahon). Similarly, I extend the thanks of all Committee members to the staff of the Public Works Committee. They have been of great value to the Committee and the Committee's work has been possible only because of their loyalty and dedication. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was honoured to have the opportunity of leading the Australian Parliamentary Delegation which visited Hong Kong, China and Japan from 30 June to 18 July of this year. We considered that the purpose of our visit was to express the interest and goodwill of the Australian Parliament and people towards China and Japan and to gather there information about the political, social and economic conditions that exist in those countries in order to be able to report to this Parliament. I consider that the Delegation was extremely beneficial in providing an exchange of views and in improving relations with those two countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our primary concern was to strengthen the relationships that have developed with China and Japan and to find out what difficulties and problems now exist in our relations with those countries. The program enabled us to meet with government officials and representatives of industry, commerce and the professions. The role of Australia in the Pacific area is welcomed by China and Japan and the development of an independent future role is being watched with special interest. The success of the Delegation's visit to China was primarily due to the generous and hospitable manner in which the Delegation was received by the Chinese Government. It should be noted that this was only the second Parliamentary Delegation to visit China. The first Delegation visited China eight years ago. I would like to draw the particular attention of the Senate to one of the recommendations of our Delegation. That was that in future Australian delegations should be sent to China on a regular basis-say every three years-and that future delegations visit China only rather than two or three different countries. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Delegation I wish to express our gratitude to the Australian Commission in Hong Kong and the Australian Embassies in Beijing and Tokyo for the assistance they provided throughout our visit. I would also like to pay tribute to the fine spirit of co-operation shown by all members of the Delegation. The members were: Senator Ron Elstob, who is here tonight and who will probably want to say something after me; the Honourable Bill Morrison, who was deputy leader; the Honourable Evan Adermann; Mr Ted Innes; and Mr Grant Chapman. I think I can say that we functioned well as a team and effectively represented Australia in the two countries we visited. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to add a few brief remarks of my own about what we saw in China in particular. In Japan we were treading a well trodden path. In China we were in a country which not many know much about and in which we, I am sure, saw some things we had not recognised were there before we went there. I would like to say something first about the economic situation in China. China admits that it has an inflation rate of 5 per cent. Some people suggest it might be as high as 20 per cent. It also has a significant youth unemployment problem. Nevertheless, the Chinese people in the streets certainly look well clothed and adequately fed. What the Chinese have clearly succeeded in doing is distributing a very low per capita national income equitably. In fact, the distribution of income is as equitable as we have managed to achieve in this country. I think we all know that we have one of the most equitable distributions of income in the world. For instance, as an example of the equitableness of China's income distribution, in China a factory worker gets about half as much as a factory manager in take-home pay. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The after tax situation in Australia is very close. A manager gets about twice as much as a shop floor worker after tax. Admittedly, in China the fringe benefits are relatively more valuable. The manager of a factory in China gets a car. That is also the case in Australia, but of course in China everyone else has a bicycle. In Australia everyone else has a car. The equity of income distribution in China is as good as it is in Australia and I think we should recognise that.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was making the point that it is relative because of the fringe benefits. A manager earns about double the earnings of a factory worker. The distribution of income after tax is about the same as that in Australia. People could argue whether it is the same or worse. Nevertheless, we should not have the impression that income distribution in China is absolutely flat. It is about the same as in Australia and I think the Chinese deserve credit for that. Their real problem is that their productivity is deplorable. A shop floor worker in a factory gets about $40 a month. A bicycle-all bicycles in China are black, by the way-costs $160. It take four months for a factory worker to buy a bicycle. In Australia it takes a few days. In China, because of productivity, it takes three to four months and that is the dominant problem of the Chinese. If they want to solve their difficulties they have to find some way in which they can create incentives to work harder or more efficiently. The Government of China is well aware of this problem and is doing what it can to solve it. I doubt whether the Chinese can solve it within the present structure. They may do so. It is the real problem which they are trying to tackle, but they have structural problems in overcoming it. It may well be fortunate that their productivity is so low. If China, with one billion people, could match what has been achieved in productivity by Chinese communities elsewhere in Asia-in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore-it would economically dominate the world. This is the central problem: how to raise its productivity to a reasonable level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point on which I wish to make a personal remark concerns foreign affairs. We had very frank discussions with senior Chinese officials on the Soviet Union, Vietnam, Kampuchea, Taiwan and Hong Kong. I think there is a danger of euphoria in some quarters in Australia that there is a miraculous coincidence of views between our foreign policy and that of China. It is true that our views on the Soviet Union and Vietnam in some areas are the same. Nevertheless, we must recognise that although our trade with China will certainly grow, China has a very long term view of history. Its foreign policy is, quite properly, devoted to the interests of China. Its interests will by no means always be the same as ours. We must recognise that. We must not be carried away by euphoria because of an apparent coincidence in our attitudes and China's attitudes in particular areas. Our foreign policy and China's foreign policy will not always be the same. Its interests and ours are different. Its interests are China; ours are necessarily Australia. Despite those remarks, the trip to China was one of enormous fascination for me. The Chinese people are a charming, wonderful and hospitable people. It was a great privilege to lead a delegation to their country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I visited China in 1975 and again this year with the Australian delegation. A great deal of change had occurred between 1975 and this year. In October 1975 I saw the end of the Cultural Revolution, which I believe set China back some 50 years. Now that China has resolved its earlier problems I believe it will get around to solving the many difficulties that beset it. As we learned, not only can China capably feed her own people, she can also house and clothe them. For a nation with 1,000 million people, that is a gigantic job. What impresses me is the way the Chinese behave towards each other. Their behaviour is a delight for any Australian to see. Each Chinese, I believe, feels and thinks that he is his brother's keeper, and I think that has been the salvation of China. This long tradition of the family has helped China through all her difficulties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Hamer said, China has difficulties in the manufacturing industries, but it excels in handicraft. The Chinese produce the finest embroidery and handwork in the world, and it is in this area that they should look seriously at exporting. Later, when more knowledge is gained and more technology is introduced, undoubtedly China will improve its performance in the manufacturing industries. I agree with Senator Hamer that at present China's performance in this area is very poor. </PARA>
<PARA> The members of the Australian delegation visited many areas, and the one in which I was interested was Shanghai, the shipping area. I feel that China will have to improve her ship-handling methods if she is to improve her export trade. The goods China exports throughout the world will have to arrive on time, and most certainly China will have to look to improving the handling of ships in the major ports. China's containerisation methods are not up to world standard, and perhaps Australia could give the Chinese some valuable advice in this area. I agree with Senator Hamer that it is imperative for Australian politicians to visit China regularly. We also should issue invitations to the National Chinese People's Congress for its members to come regularly to Australia. Australians get on very well with the Chinese, and it is important to create dialogue with them, not only in trade but also in foreign affairs. Although Australia is not a major military power our credibility in the Asian area is very good and I believe Australia should exercise some influence in this area and try to reduce tension. I think that the more Australian politicians go regularly to China the better for all concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a great delight for me to visit China once again. I found the Chinese most friendly. They welcomed the delegation and could not do enough for us. Certainly there were things with which we all disagreed. The Chinese thought that the Pol Pot regime was not too bad. Undoubtedly, we in this country think that the Pol Pot regime is probably the worst regime in the history of the world. Nevertheless, we had a great deal to talk about and a lot of ideas to exchange. China needs to import and export. As I said, it is important for Australian politicians to go to China regularly, to make contact with the Chinese Government and to improve our relationship. I ask the Government to consider this matter seriously. It would be in the best interests of all countries if we improved our relationship. I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government opposes the motion which has been moved by Senator Missen for the postponement of intervening business until after the consideration of an item of General Business which he has described as being urgent and important. The motion arises from a matter which was put before the Senate by a report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in November 1978. Pursuant to the procedures which were initiated by this Government, which require a formal response to parliamentary committee reports, there was a formal response to the Committee's recommendations on 22 November 1979, and that, of course, was almost two years ago. So, this proposition has been before the Senate since November 1978. As the Government's decision not to support the proposition has been known to the Senate since November 1979, it is a little difficult to see how the matter can be described as urgent and important in the sense that it should take precedence over the consideration of the business of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is, of course, a practice in the Senate whereby private members' business is normally dealt with on Thursday evenings. That is a practice which is not always honoured in this Senate. It is true that towards the end of a session it is not uncommon for the Thursday night to be taken up by Government Business. The most appropriate time, I suggest, for the matter to be before the Senate is the time which is normally reserved for private members' business. It is a little hard to see, when one looks at the importance of the legislation over which the honourable senator is seeking precedence-I refer to the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill 1981, the Australian National University Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1981 and the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill 1981, as well as the other items which are listed-and at the hour of the day, that this is a matter of such urgency that it ought to be given priority over that business. For those reasons the Government suggests to the Senate that it would not be appropriate for intervening business to be postponed. If the Senate is minded to deal with this particular motion, among all the items of General Business which are before it, then the appropriate thing would be for time to be reserved on Thursday evening under General Business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs which brought down the report in favour of this chamber assuming a role in the scrutiny of Bills and proposed laws being dealt with by the Parliament I rise briefly to support Senator Missen. I believe that here we have an essential strengthening of the role of the Senate. Honourable senators will know that the Australian Labor Party is committed to the Senate as a House of review, a properly limited role as a House of review, one that does not extend to the bringing down of the Government which retains the confidence of the House of Representatives. I believe that we would be doing ourselves a disservice in this chamber and doing the whole Parliament a disservice if we postponed once again an opportunity to strengthen that review function, a function which merely alerts the chamber to the possibility that proposed laws may, indeed, offend civil liberties, confer undue discretions on administrators and such matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the time that has elapsed since the tabling of the report, a matter alluded to by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), is in fact already to our shame. Certainly, the response by the Government 12 months-a procrastinating, dilatory 12 months-after the tabling of the report, was totally inadequate, totally negative and conceded none of the points made by the Committee. It is perhaps somewhat to our shame that 24 months have elapsed since that government response. The matter is not before the chamber. I believe that to postpone the deliberation further will weaken rather than strengthen the proper role of this chamber. For that reason I strongly support Senator Missen. </PARA>

<PARA> On behalf of the Government the Minister for Administrative Services has made a reference to the Grants Commission to review its report on State Tax Sharing Entitlements of June 1981. The matter has been settled with the Premiers with a view to having the Commission's Report available for consideration at the June 1982 Premiers Conference. The Commission has been asked to report by 31 May 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The report was the work of an enlarged Commission, consisting of the Chairman, and two part-time permanent members, and three associate members. With the lapsing of the enabling legislation on 30 June last, the appointments of the associate members lapsed also. State Governments have expressed the view that for the purpose of the review, the Commission should have the same composition as for the report. This Bill will enable sufficient appointments to be made for the Commission to be constituted on that basis. As the Act presently stands the Commission is limited to four members in addition to the Chairman. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment will also open the way to make appointments for any other inquiries the Commission may be called on to undertake. Currently the Government has decided to request the Commission to undertake an inquiry into the finances of the Australian Capital Territory, and the amendment will permit the appointment of further members specifically for that inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill combines two measures relating to health expenditure. First, it provides for an amendment of the National Health Act 1953 to increase the general patient contribution for pharmaceutical benefits. This was announced by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech. The other matter I foreshadowed as Acting Minister for Health in the Senate on 16 September relates to the supply of pharmaceuticals in public hospitals under the new health funding arrangements. Honourable senators will be aware that these arrangements came into operation on 1 September this year. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the increase in the general patient contribution for pharmaceutical benefits I draw honourable senators' attention to clause 3 of the Bill. That clause will increase from $2.75 to $3.20 the maximum amount that approved pharmaceutical chemists may charge for the supply of a pharmaceutical benefit under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This increase will take effect from 1 December 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> As in the past, pensioners holding a pensioner health benefits card and their dependants will not be charged for pharmaceutical benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly no charge will be made for sickness beneficiaries holding a health benefits card, and their dependants. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now over two years since the patient contribution was set at $2.75 and this increase of 45 cents is broadly in line with movements in prices and incomes since then. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the supply of pharmaceuticals in public hospitals. Under the new health funding arrangements, annual grants are paid to each State pursuant to the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981 for the provision of health services by the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The grants include an amount towards the cost to the hospitals of supplying pharmaceuticals to all patients. The amount is related to the expenditure by States for pharmaceuticals under the previous hospital cost sharing agreements which in most States expired on 30 June this year. To synchronise with the new health insurance arrangements the agreements continued without formal agreements until 31 August. </PARA>
<PARA> The States are being funded for pharmaceuticals under the new arrangements to the extent that can be justified by past experience. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the National Health Act there is an alternative provision whereby hospital authorities could be reimbursed for their expenditure on pharmaceutical benefits. Section 94 authorises the approval of hospital authorities to supply pharmaceutical benefits and those authorities are entitled to a reimbursement at a level determined by the Minister under section 99. </PARA>
<PARA> This arrangement operated until the commencement of the Commonwealth/State cost sharing agreements in 1975. Under those agreements States had agreed not to claim under section 99. </PARA>
<PARA> In States where those agreements are no longer in force it is again open to those hospitals which have been approved to claim reimbursement. Clause 4 of the Bill would allow the Minister to revoke those approvals. In the absence of such a provision there would be no legal impediment to a duplication of funding as regards pharmaceutical benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> As Acting Minister for Health I announced that the amendments would allow the revocations to take effect from 16 September. I have written to State Health Ministers and advised them of the intention to introduce this amendment into the House. </PARA>
<PARA> As it is desired to provide discretionary powers to suspend or revoke approvals of hospital authorities it is intended that such power should rest with the Minister for Health. As a consequence it is appropriate for the power to approve hospital authorities to also rest with the Minister. Clause 4 of the Bill would effect a transfer of the power to approve hospital authorities from the permanent head to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Button moving the following motion:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate declares that it is in accordance with the Constitution for the Senate to amend the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill 1981 by rejecting clause 6 of the Bill, and by leaving out other provisions of the Bill relating to the power of the Minister to make determinations under clause 6, or alternatively for the Senate to amend clause 6 of the Bill by requiring that any instrument signed by the Minister thereunder be approved by resolution of both Houses of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>This matter arises from a number of comments and suggestions which emerged in the course of the debate on the education Bills, and particularly the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill when they were dealt with a couple of weeks ago, as I think most honourable senators who were present in the course of that debate will be aware. The matters having been raised by way of suggestion and, indeed, in some instances by way of half-hearted argument, if I may so describe it, by Government senators-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not from Senator Teague, no. The matters having been raised, it is desired by the Opposition that the issues be resolved before the Committee stage of the debate on this Bill is proceeded with. The reason is quite simple: If we proceed to the Committee stage of the debate the Senate could well be locked in wrangles for a very long time. In some ways I share Senator Chaney's concern to have the Government's business expedited and not delayed for a great length of time while those sorts of wrangles take place in the Committee stage of the debate on this Bill and, if necessary, in the Committee stage of the debate on one of the other Bills with which the Senate has to deal. I have accordingly sought the suspension of Standing Orders so that the issues which are set out-almost enumerated-in the motion which I have moved be resolved without delay and before such wrangles are allowed to proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government opposes the suspension of Standing Orders for the moving of the motion foreshadowed by Senator Button. It might on the face of it appear to be an attractive proposition that the Senate deal with the undoubted difficulties which could arise in the Committee debate by seeking to cover the matter in a motion of this sort. I would be grateful if I could catch Senator Chipp's attention because his vote will be very important on this matter. I would like to keep him to the undertaking that he will listen to the debate and then cast his vote. Senator Chipp, I do very seriously address my remarks to your corner of the chamber as well as to the honourable senators behind me and those in front of me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The position is that there is a prima facie attractiveness in the idea of clearing the decks of what might be seen as the arguments which could be mounted during the Committee stage by having a general statement or a declaration by the Senate which would cover the points of difficulty. It seems to me that there is at least one fundamental flaw in the approach which is adopted by the Opposition; that is, the wrapping up of quite separate propositions in this motion. I think it is quite possible for a different attitude to be taken as to whether it is in accordance with the Constitution for the Senate to reject clause 6 of the Bill and to leave out other provisions of the Bill relating to the power to make determinations under clause 6. It is quite possible to take a different attitude to the attitude one might take as to whether it is within the constitutional powers of the Senate to amend clause 6 by requiring that any instrument signed by the Minister thereunder be approved by resolution of both Houses of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of that dichotomy this is not a particularly satisfactory way of dealing with the undoubted difficulties which can arise in this debate. For that reason I think it would be better to deal with this matter in the normal way and to go into the Committee of the Whole. Should there be a move not to approve clause 6, to deal with the issues that arise on that or should there be an amendment-I understand there might be one from the Australian Democrats-in the terms that are foreshadowed in the second part of the motion, we could deal with those arguments separately. Otherwise, we are likely to take up a good deal of the time of the Senate in trying to sort out what is, in effect, a dual proposition on which I think, with the greatest of respect, there could be two views. It would be difficult, therefore, for some honourable senators to support the motion on the basis of their disagreeing with part of it. For that reason-as well as for the reason that I think the matter would be dealt with in a more orderly way generally if we simply follow the normal procedures of the Senate-the Government opposes the suspension of Standing Orders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will be supporting the suspension of Standing Orders to enable Senator Button's motion to be debated and voted upon. It is important for the Senate to clarify its own attitude in relation to money Bills, those Bills which it sees as money Bills and which could be amended, or those Bills in relation to which it is able to make only requests. It is somewhat disingenious of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) to suggest that we could take the matter later rather than now. Obviously the procedure by which we deal with this particular item is important. If the Standing Orders are suspended and the Senate expresses its viewpoint in relation to this Bill in that debate, we hope the Senate will clarify its position on a variety of other Bills, some of which have already been presented to this House and some of which are yet to be presented. The Government is engaged in a variety of activities some of which are directed at embarrassing the Australian Democrats in relation to our pledge to the electorate. We will support the suspension of the Standing Orders to enable us to engage in that debate at this time so that we can clear the decks for this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is exactly the role he is playing out tonight. If he were genuine in advancing procedural reasons why it might be more appropriate for some other course to be followed then the one that is suggested in Senator Button's motion tonight, he would readily acknowledge to this chamber that if the procedural proposition before us now is in fact supported and we move to a substantive debate on the question as to whether it is appropriate for declarations of this kind to be made, it is perfectly open for the Government to move by way of amendment the severance of that part of Senator Button's motion which apparently it does not like and have that, in fact, treated differently from the part it does like. The justification he has advanced for not having the matter dealt with at all by way of a substantive debate on this motion does not carry any credibility when he retains that procedural option to move an amendment to Senator Button's motion to secure the result he wants to achieve.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Senate declares that it is in accordance with the Constitution for the Senate to amend the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill 1981 by rejecting clause 6 of the Bill, and by leaving out other provisions of the Bill relating to the power of the Minister to make determinations under clause 6, or alternatively for the Senate to amend clause 6 of the Bill by requiring that any instrument signed by the Minister thereunder be approved by resolution of both Houses of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>These education Bills, if I might use a loose expression, have been floating around now for some time. A number of propositions have been advanced and canvassed in relation to those Bills. It has been part of the burden of the Government's case-as I understand it, 'Stepp'd in so far that, . . . Returning were as tedious as go o'er' in these constitutional questions relating to the powers of the Senate-to suggest that the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill 1981 is a money Bill which is not amendable. Let me say, firstly, that that is best illustrated by a comment made by the Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, during the brief debate we had about the suspension of Standing Orders to allow this motion to be debated. Senator Chaney, in the course of his comments about that matter, suggested that the Opposition had made a mistake, as it were, by marrying two propositions-one relating to the direct rejection of clause 6, which gives the Minister a power to make a declaration imposing fees, and the other, which is now identified with the Australian Democrats, in effect by way of amendment requiring the Minister to obtain the assent of both Houses of Parliament to any declaration imposing fees. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that, in the course of debate when the Senate discussed these Bills previously, not only was it said by at least one Government speaker that the Government doubted the constitutional validity of rejecting clause 6 of the Bill, as has been the intention of the Opposition since this legislation was first introduced, but also the argument was canvassed by Senator Missen, as a Government senator-amongst others-in the context of the debate, that the proposition encapsulated in the amendment to be moved by the Democrats was not constitutional. That was argued on behalf of the Government. In response, we put both these matters in the motion of which I gave notice when the Senate previously discussed these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is any substance in the Government's argument, it arises from section 53 of the Constitution which deals with the powers of the Houses in respect of legislation and proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys or imposing taxation. Section 53 of the Constitution provides that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation, or proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think it will be argued that this legislation is for the ordinary annual services of the Government; I do not think anybody would suggest that. It is not legislation which is even within the constitutional power of the Government. To argue that it has anything to do with the ordinary annual services of the Government would in those circumstances be a bizarre argument indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is any strength to be gained from the provision in section 53 of the Constitution, upon which these bizarre notions which are being floated in an effort to muddy the waters about the constitutional power of the Senate are based, it arises from the next paragraph which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill provides appropriation in respect of the functioning of universities and colleges of advanced education throughout Australia. Clause 6 of the Bill provides that the Minister for Education shall have a discretion in relation to the imposition of fees. If clause 6 is passed by the Senate, the Minister may never exercise that discretion. If he does not exercise that power of discretion, there is no question of his effecting, as it were, a proposed charge or a burden on the people. The Bills appropriate money for universities and colleges of advanced education. Nothing in clause 6 of this Bill has anything more than the most remote and tenuous connection with the imposition of any additional charge on the people. It is basically for those reasons, and consistent with the view that we have put about the powers of the Senate since the changed numbers came about, that the Opposition argues the proposal contained in the motion. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one other point. The Government, throughout this debate, has been looking for ways of saying that these are money Bills and that nothing can be done to amend these Bills. The suggestion has arisen only in the context of the Government's trying to reinforce a legislative program which is not the legislative program put to the people of Australia at the last election and trying to prop up and confuse the issues relating to this important question of the imposition of fees for second degrees in universities and colleges of advanced education. Of course, what flows from all that is the issue of the Government's credibility in relation to this argument which has been advanced, quite contrary to what was put in the context of the last election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government opposes the motion which has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Button, mainly because it requires the Senate to declare 'that it is in accordance with the Constitution for the Senate to amend the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill 1981 by rejecting clause 6 of the Bill, and by leaving out other provisions of the Bill relating to the power of the Minister to make determinations under clause 6'. The Leader of the Opposition stated in his argument in support of the motion that there was only a remote and tenuous connection between clause 6 and any proposed charge or burden on the people. I think there is only a remote and tenuous connection between that argument and the facts of the matter. I would have thought there would be far less interest in this provision if in fact it was genuinely thought in this chamber or elsewhere that there was little or no connection between what is provided in clause 6 and proposed charges or burdens on the people. The fact of the matter is that clause 6 is central to the Government's ability to do what has been clearly announced, which is to pass a portion of the burden of the cost of tertiary education back to those who are doing second degrees.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not debating the point raised in that interjection. I am addressing the quality of clause 6 and what part it plays in the legislation which is before the chamber. As I said, that clause is central to the reduction in the charge or burden which is on the people with respect to tertiary education. Admittedly this is a relatively small proportion of the total Bill because it relates to that small minority of people who are doing second degrees, but it is quite clearly central and essential to the extent of the burden which rests upon the taxpayers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to refer very quickly to the scheme of the Bill. Clause 6 is the clause to which the motion relates. Clause 6 (1), in part, states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Minister may, by instrument in writing . . . determine that each student who . . . undertakes at a relevant tertiary education institution studies of a kind specified in the determination should be charged by the institution, for each year in respect of which he undertakes studies of that kind, tuition fees at such rate (not exceeding $1,000 per annum), or of such amount (not exceeding $1,000), as specified in, or calculated in accordance with, the determination. </PARA>
<PARA>There are, of course, limitations placed on those students for whom fees can be applied in the later parts of clause 6. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer now to clause 8 which, in common with other clauses which relate to other parts of the tertiary education system, gives the relevance of what is provided in clause 6 to the question of what charge or burden is going to be on the people. Clause 8 (1) provides:</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to each university specified in Column 1 of Schedule 1, there is payable to the State . . . for the purposes of financial assistance in relation to the expenditure of the university for university purposes in respect of a year to which this Act applies, the amount specified in Schedule 1 . . . reduced by such amount (if any) as the Minister determines under sub-section (2) to be the total of the appropriate tuition fees charges of that university in respect of that year. </PARA>
<PARA>Later clauses of the Bill provide for similar provisions related to courses in advanced education institutions and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> If one then turns to the appropriation clauses of the Bill one begins to see the relevance of section 53 of the Constitution which was referred to by Senator Button. Clause 51 of the Bill provides as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Consolidated Revenue Fund and the Loan Fund are appropriated as necessary for the purposes of this Act. </PARA>
<PARA>So there is a general appropriation under clause 51 of moneys for the purposes of the Act and the amount of moneys, as I have previously indicated, are those amounts which are set out in the schedule reduced by those amounts of the determinations under clause 6. Section 53 of the Constitution, to which reference has already been made, provides that where there are laws appropriating revenue or moneys-that is clearly relevant to this law which expressly in its terms does that-the Bill shall not originate in the Senate. Of course, this Bill has come from the House of Representatives, as it must. It goes on in the third paragraph, the paragraph essential to this argument, to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. </PARA>
<PARA>The effect of an amendment which would remove clause 6 would clearly be to ensure that the maximum amounts which are provided in the Schedules to this legislation would be the amounts which would have to be appropriated. Clearly if clause 6 remains in the legislation and becomes part of the Act, the amounts appropriated will be less than the amounts which are provided for in those Schedules. So it is in fact an argument of sophistry to suggest that the deletion of clause 6 will not result in an increased charge or burden upon the taxpayers of Australia. Of course, it must. The minimum amount of the Commonwealth expenditure under the Bill will be increased by the deletion, because if it is deleted there can be no reduction of the figures which are set out in the Schedule. It is the view of the Government, as it is the view of its advisers, that in fact the deletion of clause 6 would breach the third paragraph of section 53 of the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware, having now heard a number of these arguments in the Senate, that to some extent the logic of the argument is all very well. The late Senator Kennelly was reported to have said: 'Forget the logic and give me the numbers'. To a very great extent, whatever the logic of the position may be and whatever the strict legal position may be, it is possible for the Senate to carry whatever resolution it likes, including a resolution saying that black is white. But I suggest to the Senate that if one examines the provisions of this legislation and looks at the provisions of section 53 of the Constitution, one sees that it is clearly beyond the power of the Senate to remove this clause and that, therefore, this motion should not be passed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be supporting Senator Button's motion. I would like to outline the reasons why, because I believe not only the numbers but also the logic will be with Senator Button's motion. It is not an argument of sophistry, though it is an argument of technicality. May I just go through basically what the position is in relation to this Bill. The Constitution provides that the Senate may not amend any Bill so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. This has been interpreted to mean that the Senate cannot amend any Bill to increase the amount of money appropriated in that Bill or to increase the expenditure which would be required by that Bill. Those were the points that I believe Senator Chaney was making in his speech when he maintained that this was that type of Bill. However, that is not the case for a very simple technical reason that I will come to in a moment. Basically the argument revolves around clause 6 of the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill. Clause 6 says, in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Subject to this section, the Minister may . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The technicalities of saying 'he will' or 'he may', I do not think I have to explain to the Minister, but that clause actually says 'the Minister may'. It does not impose fees. It says that the Minister may impose fees. The removal of clause 6 from this Bill and the consequential removal of other provisions in the Bill associated with clause 6 do not have the effect of adding to the appropriation made by the Bill. Such amendments have the effect only of taking away from the Minister a power to determine the fees, if any, to be charged by institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, quite simply, the Bill is designed to set up a mechanism whereby the Minister may, if he so chooses and if the Government so wills, direct institutions to impose fees. Therefore, the appropriation associated with this Bill is the total amount without any reference whatsoever to the fees. The removal of the power of the Minister does not necessarily mean that the appropriation made by the Bill will be increased. It simply prevents the Minister from taking action which would have the ultimate effect of reducing the appropriation. That is a technical situation. Certainly we are arguing a technical matter here because we are arguing a number of items in relation to what the Senate may or may not do. I think it is not appropriate for the Minister to gloss over the fact that this Bill does not impose fees but merely allows the Minister to do so if he so chooses, and therefore the appropriation associated with this Bill is settled. If some subsequent action on the part of the Minister, and empowered by this Bill results in a reduction of that amount it would be at the Government's prerogative if this Bill were passed. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the first part of Senator Button's motion one will see that the logic certainly is with him and not with the Government. I am indebted to Senator Button for adding the second part, although we would still maintain that, regardless of whether this Bill did increase those fees, the amendments I have already circulated do not bear at all on the appropriation, raised or lowered; they refer only to the determination and the mechanisms in relation to the determination. Therefore, we are indebted to him for including them for completion. I believe that others may be included to give a rounded view of what the Senate may believe is possible for it to do in relation to these Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make one final point. We have taken exception already to the Government's introducing into its money Bills or Bills which otherwise are associated with money and charges certain new policies which it has not put to the electorate at any stage, which it has not tested. It now seeks to use the mechanism of tacking on to introduce new policies in what otherwise are Bills for the appropriation of moneys or, as with this Bill, making grants to universities. The compact that was made in 1967 in relation to money Bills has, I believe, stood until now. That compact was, I believe, a very important breakthrough. Indeed it was a compact drawn up solely by Government senators. In the section in relation to new policies they make a rather enlightened comment. They say that they consider that, as far as possible, the first provision for new policies should be in such a way as not to include them in Bills for other than the ordinary annual services of the government. They went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> If such a practice were adopted, Parliament would be protected from the possibility of appropriations for any new policies not being readily identifiable in an omnibus appropriation Bill. Members of both Houses could then approach a consideration of the annual appropriations sure in the knowledge that only appropriations for services already approved were included . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, in any new policy such as this, there ought to be a separate Bill, a separate debate and a separate resolution of this House and the Government should not seek, as it has done here and with other Bills, to tack on to other items-in this case items of incredible importance to this country-its new policies. We hope that in future the Government will bring in its new policies and let them stand or fall on their merits without seeking to entangle in its otherwise devious schemes the future of tertiary education in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As much as I and the Opposition admire the late Senator Kennelly, I would not wish it to be thought for a moment that in supporting this proposition tonight we are proceeding simply on the cynical assumption that if the numbers are likely there is no need to fuss about the logic. We have the logic on our side in this matter and I endorse everything in that respect that has been said by Senator Macklin. Perhaps even more can be said to make it absolutely clear for the record that there is no tinge of cynicism in the Opposition's intellectual support for this proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I begin by saying that on the face of it it is really quite extraordinary that an amendment expressly designed to reduce one form of burden or charge upon the people, namely tertiary fees, should be ruled out of order or argued to offend a provision of the Constitution on the ground that it amounts to an increase in a burden or charge upon the people. Sometimes we are so blurred by lawyers' convoluted reasoning that we overlook readings that stare us in the face in sections of this kind. It is some topsy-turvy, Alice in Wonderland-or Shirley in Wonderland-reasoning, on the face of it, to read the key provision in section 53 which states: 'The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people' and to say that by seeking to delete a charge or a burden on the people-tertiary fees-we are acting in breach of that provision. </PARA>
<PARA> To get the argument going in the way that Senator Chaney does one has to rely on a much more convoluted chain of lawyers' reasoning. One has to say that it is not a matter of the amendment itself increasing the burden; rather, it is a matter of the amendment-the removal of the provision in this case-creating conditions whereby more money may need to be spent pursuant to an appropriation than would otherwise be the case. That may in turn necessitate more money being raised by way of taxation. That is the way in which the clause has to be read even to begin to understand Senator Chaney's argument. Is that a proper way to read the provision? Does it have that kind of application so as to rule out constitutionally a direct amendment of the kind that has been proposed by the Opposition tonight to clause 6?</PARA>
<PARA> It is probably the case that that paragraph of section 53 operates so as to bite upon propositions to increase appropriations in some way. It is obviously the case that the paragraph we are talking about cannot be intended to apply to an attempted exercise by the Senate in increasing taxation, because attempts to increase taxation by this chamber are explicitly ruled out by other parts of section 53. Clearly, it is probably the case that the paragraph means that a fee or a licence charge, as distinct from a taxation provision which is the subject of a separate description in section 53, cannot be directly increased. If we in this chamber attempted to increase a fee or a licence of any description we would probably be in breach of this paragraph, so it clearly bites to that extent. It is clearly also the case that this paragraph of section 53 which provides that the Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people applies at least to certain categories of Appropriation Bills. It does not apply to appropriations for the ordinary annual services of the Commonwealth, because elsewhere in section 53 any playing about with those sorts of Appropriation Bills is expressly forbidden, but, of course, there are other categories of Appropriation Bills, that is, extraordinary or permanent Appropriation Bills, including the kind of Appropriation Bill we have before us tonight to provide for a States grants appropriation for tertiary education. It is probable that this paragraph in section 53 has some potential application to Appropriation Bills of that kind, so as to rule out the possibility of the Senate directly increasing an appropriation in a Bill of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> To this extent I am with Senator Chaney, and the force of his argument which, on the face of it is implausible, begins to gain some momentum. I and, I suppose, the Opposition agree with page 671 of Quick and Garran, which is the test usually applied on these occasions, that while the Senate can vote to reduce on appropriation of the kind that is in issue in a States grants matter of this kind, it cannot vote to increase it. We accept that we could not fool about with any of the scheduled provisions to this Bill for the Townsville College of Advanced Education or any other institution so as to increase the amount appropriated for any particular tertiary institution or the total amount. That much is clear, but a question remains. It is the one to which we do have to address some logic in turning our attention back to clause 6 of the Bill which seeks to enable the Minister to set fees by way of Executive determination. Is the Senate, by deleting this clause, doing anything to increase the amount of the appropriation? Here I think the points that were taken by Senator Macklin and others in support of Senator Button's proposition are in fact well made. </PARA>
<PARA> The language in this key paragraph of section 53 says that the Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. What is implied by those words is some direct nexus, I would suggest, between the Senate amending the proposition in question and the actual increase in the appropriation that is involved. There is no such direct nexus here because clause 6, as Senator Macklin has very clearly said and as Senator Chaney completely ignored in his presentation, is not a mandatory provision. The clause does not require a determination that tertiary fees be set. It is left entirely within the discretion of the Minister. He may impose fees. There is no certainty that he will impose fees even under this Government if its political courage fails it over the next few months if it does happen to get this Bill passed. If this clause does stay in the Bill it is possible that the Minister will take no action. If he does take no action no financial consequenes of any kind will follow from the retention of this clause or equally from its removal. </PARA>
<PARA> But of course it will be said, as it was said by Senator Chaney-I do think we have to follow the next stage of the argument-that we have to look at clause 8(1.) of the Bill which requires that the grants to tertiary institutions be reduced by the amount of any fee which does happen to be imposed pursuant to that determination if it does happen to be made. That means that if a fee is not imposed the grant from the Commonwealth under the appropriation will have to stay at the ceiling level that is provided in the Schedule and so the argument goes that accordingly the taxpayers will to that extent be disadvantaged. But I think there are two propositions which count against that reading, bringing us within the scope of section 53. The first is that moneys have already been appropriated by this Bill up to a ceiling level. No additional appropriation could be contemplated as a result of fees in fact not being imposed. The Government cannot increase the appropriation above the level which is already provided for by the text of this Bill. Of course there is no suggestion that anything involved in the Opposition's amendment that is proposed to clause 6 will amount to such an increase in the actual dollar sum of the appropriation beyond the ceiling level that is set. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that needs to be made about this is that clause 8, as is the case in respect of clause 6-and I think this point again was made by Senator Macklin-is entirely discretionary too. It is not obligatory upon the Government or whoever is administering this scheme in fact to reduce the amount of the appropriation that is in fact directed to the State in question in the event that a determination is made and fees are in fact imposed. It is just creating the possibility for that to happen. One might say as a practical matter that there is a likelihood that it will happen as a matter of Government policy but it is not a direct nexus. There is not a direct flow from the imposition of a fee to the reduction of the appropriation-the direct grant to the institution-by that amount. It is our argument that there would have to be that direct relationship if one is even to begin to get an argument going relying on that paragraph in section 53. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other thing I want to say relates to precedents, such as they are, in this area. I suggest that such precedents as there are and as we have been able to turn up are of no help whatsoever to the Government. It is true that the matter was debated very early in the life of the national Parliament back in the 1901-1903 session as recorded by Geoffrey Sawer at page 31 in the first volume of his Australian Federal Politics and Law. There was a debate on a sugar bounty Bill, a long and learned and eventually somewhat inconclusive debate. During that debate various propositions were put down and uncontested on either side to the effect, for example, that if a particular appropriation came forward to the Senate providing for a single track railway between two cities-presumably interstate-and the Senate insisted on changing the basis of the authorisation so as to provide for a double track there would be such a direct nexus between that policy change and the obvious additional appropriation that would be necessary that that would amount to a burden on the people such as to bring it within the scope of that paragraph in section 53, such as to make it not something that was able to be put by way of amendment but only by way of request. So we have a suggestion in one of those very early debates that a sort of circumstance could apply in this way. But I suggest that that is of no help to the Government tonight considering the facts that are before us. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, there was another debate in 1932-the only other early precedent which seems to exist anywhere-involving the Financial Emergency Act. Senator Colebatch moved an amendment which was passed by the Senate. Without going into all the sordid and boring details, there was an amendment to a gold bounty Bill whereby the gold producers were guaranteed an additional income supplement by way of bounty even if the international price of gold fell. Clearly, that was contemplating a direct additional drain on the Treasury. By virtue of that amendment the House of Representatives quite understandably jacked up about that. It said: 'You cannot do that by way of amendment. That offends the paragraph in section 53'. The Senate accepted that argument. Those seem to have been the only two early precedents. Both of them give some sort of nourishment to the notion that that paragraph in section 53 can bite in certain circumstances where one is doing something which necessarily inexorably would result in an increased appropriation. But I suggest that neither of them helps the Government tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been able to turn up one other example which directly hinders the case that the Government is moving tonight. That is an argument which arose under the Social Services Amendment Bill of very recent memory, in this place on 27 April 1976, involving a small matter of funeral benefits. It may be recalled that this Government, with its usual delicacy and sensitivity, proposed to remove the funeral benefit that was payable to pensioners. There was then a successful excise, that may be recalled by some honourable senators, in this place to remove the particular provisions in the Social Services Amendment Bill which enabled the removal of the funeral benefit. An argument was assiduously mounted, not in this chamber but in the Press and all round the place, to the effect that, as part of the psychological warfare that preceded this enterprise it was, in fact, unconstitutional for the Senate to do this. It was argued that anything that would retain the payment of funeral benefits would thereby amount to an additional drain upon the Treasury beyond that which was contemplated by the Government's legislation. As such it was the kind of thing that could not be advanced. When Senator Grimes got up in this place to move, as he did in the Committee stage on 27 April 1976, that the Bill moved by the Government be amended so as to retain the provision for funeral benefits there was not a bark from the Government benches. There was not a suggestion raised-</PARA>

<PARA>There was doubt as to whether the Senate had the power to take out a clause which would have resulted in the removal of the funeral benefit payment. I have checked this out technically. That was the context in which the matter came before this Parliament. It demanded an affirmative vote in order to remove the benefit-an affirmative vote which was made by the Senate. The suggestion had been canvassed all round the place that it was not constitutionally competent for the Senate to make such an affirmative vote except by way of request. But when it came to the point, because the Government knew that it would be defeated on the issue and did not want to be seen to be raising a churlish procedural point, the Government remained silent. It did not take the constitutional point which it claims tonight is so clearly available to it. The reality of the matter is that the Government's conception of constitutional law and constitutional propriety shows to this chamber a flexibility that is reminiscent of the morals of an old whore. It will do absolutely what is necessary to advance an argument to suit its immediate political cause, whether or not it believes in the intellectual integrity of the particular argument that is thus being advanced. On careful rational analysis such as I have endeavoured to advance, along with Senator Macklin, this provision and the way it has been applied in the past there is simply no logical justification or foundation for the argument that the Government is seeking to con us with tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly simply to refute a statement made by Senator Macklin that the Government had in some precedent way tacked on fees conditions to a money Bill and that there was something unusual about it. I suggest that evidence will show that that is not so. The facts are that Commonwealth grants to the States for education purposes are classified as section 96 specific purpose payments and provided through States grants legislation. Any requirement by the Commonwealth that particular policies should be followed has been implemented by attaching conditions of grants to those specific purpose payments. This practice has been adopted in relation to a wide range of policy issues in previous States grants education legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of particular significance in regard to tuition fees is that it should be noted that the 1973 amendment to the States Grants (Universities) Act included a provision, as a condition of grant, that required the States to ensure that tuition fees would not be charged at universities and colleges of advanced education or in regular technical and further education courses. That, I think, was a Whitlam Government amendment. The provisions in the present States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill for the limited reintroduction of tuition fees are consistent with that approach as that Bill places an obligation on the States to ensure that relevant institutions do not charge any student fees 'otherwise than in accordance with the conditions' set out elsewhere in the legislation. Any claim that the Government is tacking on to a money Bill matters which are not properly in a money Bill therefore clearly is inaccurate. The Government's proposals in relation to the limited reintroduction of tuition fees and the other matters of policy in this Bill are being treated in a way which is entirely consistent with the approach taken for many years in States grants legislation in the education area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think what Senator Carrick has said requires an answer. He has said certain things are so but I do not believe he has demonstrated that is the case. The question of the application of section 53 is much more important than this Bill. It transcends it because it is a general principle which may affect the Senate in years to come. Basically what can happen, going on Senator Chaney's logic, is that the Government can take almost anything-most things in this world cost money-and set it against an appropriation in a money Bill and then say that because things cost money and the relevant legislation is not passed the appropriation will be increased, or not reduced, as in the case of this Bill. I suggest that that is a totally spurious interpretation of section 53 of the Constitution, and if it were permitted by the Senate it would create a situation where the Senate virtually would surrender all its powers to debate or discuss anything. I think it really goes to that reasoning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to take another couple of examples which occur to me in a non-legal sense. For instance, if there were an amendment in the Senate preventing the sale of a Commonwealth asset, that would cost the community more. Would section 53 apply to that? An amendment requiring even a single hour's work by a public servant could be said to cost the public money and that some appropriation somewhere might have to be increased to cover it. Would section 53 apply to that? It could be said that an amendment improving some piece of defence equipment which might cost a trifling sum more would increase an appropriation. Is the Senate then not to deal with any of these matters?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a motion by Senator Button which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate declares that it is in accordance with the Constitution for the Senate to amend the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill 1981 by rejecting clause 6 of the Bill, and by leaving out other provisions of the Bill relating to the power of the Minister to make determinations under clause 6, or alternatively for the Senate to amend clause 6 of the Bill by requiring that any instrument signed by the Minister thereunder be approved by resolution of both Houses of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I propose to move an amendment to that motion. Before I do so, I just refer briefly to some of the matters that have been put forward in support of that proposition and indicate that I would have thought that the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill was a Bill under the provisions of section 96 of the Constitution. Section 96 of the Constitution provides:</PARA>
<PARA> During a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that that is pretty plain. That can be related to section 57 of the Constitution and the proposition that has been put forward by Senator Button in respect of the power of the Senate and in respect of paragraph 3 of section 53 of the Constitution which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. </PARA>
<PARA>I concur with what Senator Button said. Part of the proposition, of course, is to include a provision wherein the Minister may make a determination. But, as Senator Button said, he may not. </PARA>
<PARA> Seeing that we are carrying a motion as to our powers, I thought that we might add another one. Therefore, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion add: ', or alternatively for the Senate to divide the Bill so as to incorporate in a separate Bill the provisions relating to the imposition of certain fees by tertiary institutions'. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that it is very important that the Senate at some stage makes a declaration that we can assert our right under paragraph 33D of our Standing Orders to divide a Bill in the Committee of the Whole. This proposal, of course, was foreshadowed by me during the debate on the sales tax measure. Whilst this matter still remains on the Notice Paper, it will be revised when the sales tax measure comes back to this chamber so as to enable honourable senators to exercise a vote to ensure that parts of the Bill thus divided will be rejected in accordance with the majority wishes of the Senate. It is to be hoped that those honourable senators who are prepared to go to the barricades over this addition of tuition fees will support that proposition and, of course, ensure the blocking of the sales tax provisions on essential commodities. I think it is important for this Parliament to assert its rights in respect of this proposed law and to assert them by including and agreeing to that addendum to the motion. It goes without saying that at any stage the Senate has the right to make requests to the House of Representatives on this or any other Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill, which is now before the Senate, appropriates some $2 billion for the support of universities and colleges. Clause 6, which relates to the partial reintroduction of tertiary tuition fees, as has been indicated by the second reading speeches that we have heard, is controversial and there is now before us a motion that it is constitutional for the Senate to amend the Bill, and in particular to delete clause 6.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, the debate is about the interpretation of sections of the Constitution in deciding whether the motion in relation to clause 6 may be passed. If the debate leads the Senate to accept the motion presumably the Senate fortified by that acceptance, would go on to amend clause 6 or even to delete it, thus taking from the Bill the provision which would impose a partial reintroduction of tertiary tuition fees. It is not a light matter because it is estimated that the passage of clause 6 would lead to the raising of $8m in fees in the calendar year 1982. Moreover, after a period of three years-the fee will not be imposed on any student who is currently enrolled for a post-graduate or second degree, or a diploma; only a student first enrolling today and meeting the criteria set down will be liable-we will come closer to a steady state situation in which according to Government estimates, the revenue to be raised annually will total $20m. Clause 8, as Senator Evans has shown, specifies that that $8m revenue derived in 1982, or the $20m estimated revenue derived in 1984, will be deducted--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Evans" NAMEID="VD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May be deducted.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand clause 8 to say that it will be deducted-from the moneys appropriated by this Bill. Thus, if we deleted clause 6 we would be changing the burden on the people. The revenue of the Government would be diminished by $8m for calendar year 1982 and $20m for calendar year 1984.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button and Senator Macklin argued that clause 6 did not impose any such burden; that it merely gave power to the Minister to make a determination and that such determination would impose the burden. They argued that therefore it was quite within the terms of section 53 of the Constitution for the Senate to deny to the Minister the power to make such determination. I regard that argument as entirely tenuous and not sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely we can come to the principle of the matter, which is that this is the provision that gives the Minister the power to impose such a fee. I believe that therefore the argument put forward by Senator Button and Senator Macklin falls flat. I am not at all impressed by it. Senator Evans did not take that line. He first tried to argue that the fees themselves were a burden upon the people; that by denying the Minister the power to levy such fees upon this small proportion of tertiary students we would be lessening the burden upon the people. I think that is rather Irish. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whether it is Welsh, Irish or Dutch, I point out that there is an imposition on the people in one way or the other. Senator Harradine has raised the question of section 96 of the Constitution. I understand that this Bill is based upon the powers given in the Constitution to this Parliament to grant financial assistance to States on any condition that the Parliament sees to be fit. On that argument, if that were the only section in the Constitution that had any relevance at all to this matter, then section 96 of the Constitution would allow the Parliament to pass this motion. Section 96 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit. </PARA>
<PARA>However, it is still my view that section 96 of the Constitution does not deny section 53 of the Constitution. I am not arguing now with Senator Harradine. Section 53 still stands and still should be the guide in this matter. The key paragraph is the third paragraph of section 53, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. </PARA>
<PARA>That paragraph may be interpreted one way or the other. Several lawyers have preceded me in this debate. I do not profess, as some of them do, to be an expert on the various precedents of interpretation of the Constitution on this matter. Having sought in my speech to debunk the arguments put by Senators Button and Macklin and half of what Senator Evans said, I believe that the case rests entirely on the third paragraph of section 53 of the Constitution. It is on that question alone that I believe that we ought to determine the motion by Senator Button that is before us. I repeat that the third paragraph in section 53 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate may not amend any proposed law-</PARA>
<PARA>Including the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill-</PARA>
<PARA>so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that to so amend the legislation would require in the year ahead of us an extra burden or charge on the people of Australia of $8m, or in three years time an amount of $20m. It is for that reason and that reason alone that I oppose the motion moved by Senator Button. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to indicate that the Government proposes to oppose the amendment moved by Senator Harradine and to outline briefly why that amendment is to be opposed. There are two grounds on which the Government does not find the amendment acceptable. The first is constitutional grounds. Effectively, a division of the Bill would achieve the result which we say, under section 53 of the Constitution, should not be achieved by amendment or deletion of a section. If the Bill is split it ceases to be a single Bill and each of the new Bills is, by definition, discreet and an amended form of the former Bill. The reality of that is borne out by the fact that the Senate could choose to deal with the separate Bills in whatever way it chose. It could pass both; it could reject both; it could reject one and pass one and so on. Each of the Bills is different in substance from the original. If, therefore, one accepts that section 53 precludes the amendment of a proposed law, it also precludes the splitting of a proposed law in the way which might be proposed in this case. Quite apart from that, the problem that I think the Senate would face in splitting a Bill of this type is that the clauses which relate to the charging of fees are truly an integral part of the Bill. There are, of course, very few precedents for the procedure which is being suggested as being appropriate by this amendment. The Standing Order is, of course, a fairly bare provision. It simply says that there may be a splitting of the Bill. If one looks at Erskine May's Parliamentary Practice one will see some reference to the division of Bills. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . such an instruction is in order only if the bill is drafted in two or more distinct parts, or else, comprising more than one subject matter, lends itself to such division into parts. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the heading 'Impracticable division of bill', it states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . an instruction to divide a bill into two or more bills is only in order if the bill is drafted in two or more distinct parts, or else, comprising more than one subject-matter, lends itself to such division. </PARA>
<PARA>If one looks at the actual structure of this Bill, one will see quite clearly that a whole series of provisions flow and follow from clause 6. I think the precise number of amendments which would be required by any deletion of clause 6 would be--</PARA>

In terms of practicality, I concur with the observations put by the Minister and say that we do not think that the third proposition is a practical one in the context of this Bill. I know that Senator Harradine has cherished this concept, taken it to Japan with him and brought it back again. We understand his nurturing of the concept over recent weeks.

First of all, I think the quality of a debate can be judged not always so much by the things which are said in it but rather by the things which are not said in it. Let us look at the point at issue in relation to the constitutional power and the provisions of clause 6 of the Bill before the Senate. This issue has not been dealt with by Government spokesmen. It is simply that clause 6 of the Bill provides:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Subject to this section, the Minister may, by instrument in writing signed by him, determine . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It provides that he may determine that fees be charged. The paragraph of section 53 of the Constitution upon which every speaker in this debate has relied states simply:</PARA>

This proposed law, clause 6 of this Bill, is not a matter which goes to that question at all. It is an enabling provision which would give the Minister a discretion which he may never exercise.

<PARA> I am indebted to Senator Carrick for his entry into the debate. He suggested in reply to Senator Macklin that nothing would be further from this Government's mind than tacking this provision onto this Bill; that nothing would be further from the mind of this Government of the utmost probity than to indulge in a naughty little trick like that. Let us look at this Government's record on fees. Time and again in this place Senator Carrick has assured the people of Australia that the Fraser Government would not introduce fees. What did it do about overseas students' fees? Senator Carrick gave an undertaking that no fees would be imposed on overseas students. How did the Government slide out of that undertaking? It slid out of it by calling them visa charges instead of university fees. The Government could not stick to its promise so it went about imposing fees by the tortuous route of imposing visa charges on overseas students coming to Australia. They were called visa charges instead of fees because the Government had promised again and again that it would not introduce fees for overseas students. That was a slippery tactic that was relied upon on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> On this occasion, the Government would take any step possible to break a commitment which was made by its Minister for Education prior to the last election. That is the context of the whole debate tonight. This is not really a debate about constitutional power. It is a debate about the Government's credibility and that is the context in which the debate has been conducted tonight. It is just interesting that that note of humbug should be revealed in the context of this debate. As I have said, the real issues on the constitutional point have not been addressed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Page 11, clause 6, after sub-clause (6), insert the following sub-clause:</PARA>
<PARA> (6A)(a) An instrument signed by the Minister under this section shall be laid before each House of the Parliament within 5 sitting days of that House after the signing of the instrument. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Any instrument which is not laid before each House of the Parliament in accordance with paragraph (a) shall be void and of no effect. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) An instrument laid before each House of the Parliament in accordance with paragraph (a) shall be deemed to have been revoked at the expiration of 10 days after the instrument has been laid before both Houses of the Parliament unless each House of the Parliament has by resolution declared that the instrument is approved. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe the proposition in this amendment is one of principle; that is, that when we seek to delegate important areas of legislation such areas should in fact be overseen by the Parliament so that any action taken can be revised. I believe that the need for and the value of parliamentary control over legislation are accepted and have been accepted by this chamber. I believe that the elected Parliament should retain the ultimate responsibility for the law. The Executive, of course, has a different approach to the law than that of the Parliament. It tends to regard administrative convenience as the principal criterion of government. Administrative convenience, of course, is a necessary and legitimate aim of government. Nevertheless, we believe that parliamentary control should be brought to bear on all delegated legislation so that the legitimate rights and liberties of the citizens, which are the responsibility of the elected members of parliament, are protected. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular method that is incorporated in the amendment I have moved is the strongest form of parliamentary control of delegated legislation that exists in the Westminster system, and that is the affirmation by Parliament. The point of the affirmation is a simple one, and that is that the Government has to put any instrument signed on the Notice Paper, it has to provide for time for debate, and it has to put its reasons to the Parliament as to why it wishes to engage in some particular activity that is allowed under the legislation. The point in relation to clause 6 is that if the Minister wishes to impose fees-we have already had a fairly extensive debate about the fact that this is merely a discretionary clause and does not mean that the Minister is going to do anything-when the amounts he wishes to charge are settled, the Parliament will debate the issue and make a decision in relation to the determination made by the Minister. In other words, Parliament will have control over the legislation, particularly in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I am indebted to Senator Missen for drawing my attention to the conference on delegated legislation held here last year at which members of the Commonwealth parliaments met and discussed this issue at some length. One of the interesting points raised by members of the delegation from the House of Commons was that they tend to use this approach of affirmative resolution in relation to the imposition of financial charges. It seems to me that this is an appropriate point to bring before the Parliament the suggestion that we ought to move from the method which we currently employ to the much more forceful and stronger method of affirmative approval of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to quote a rather interesting point made by Senator Evans at that conference which I believe applies not only to the Government but also to parties aspiring to be in government. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that executive governments, however brave they have been when in opposition, and the bureaucrats who serve them, will mount a rear-guard action unto the death when it comes to resisting really significant reforms of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that we will have a fight to the death actually to get such a reform, but I believe this is an appropriate point at which to start the debate. Our amendment has been moved in the spirit that this is obviously an area of extreme importance to the community. It is one upon which the community is divided as to its worth or otherwise; it is one upon which this House has already shown it is divided as to its worth. It seems to me appropriate that, if the Minister is to make determinations under this clause, they should not stand alone but should get the support of both Houses of Parliament before they become a charge on the citizens of this country. I commend the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment on this amendment. I appreciate that Senator Macklin has raised a question which, in a broader context, I think is quite important, namely, the idea that affirmative resolutions might be used more extensively. We have used them on very rare occasions in some of the legislation of this Parliament, and it is true that the Conference on Delegated Legislation which met here last year and the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, of which I am Chairman, strongly urged that they should be used more often in the Parliament. But I think they should be used in important areas and with regard to important questions, and I am not sure that this is a suitable occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question here, as I understand it, is not whether fees should be imposed but whether by this clause the Minister should be empowered to make determinations, with the secondary question-whether they will come into operation-to be determined by the Parliament. it is fairly obvious that there is objection to this provision, and I have a great deal of sympathy with that objection. But I do not think it is necessarily right to suggest that this is an appropriate occasion on which to apply an affirmative resolution. Of course, one understands that, when a party has members in only one House of the Parliament, such a proposal natural would have a little more attraction because it would then be in the hands of either of the Houses to take the action and it would have to be approved by both Houses. But I suggest to the Senate that this is not an important area so far as this decision is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision whether the clause stays will obviously be made here and elsewhere. A situation in which there would be power to require the making of declarations which will then have to be debated again in both Houses is, I think, an unnecessary addition to the way in which the process should be performed. I do not think that this is a suitable occasion for the application of the affirmative method. I do not want my opposition to this proposal to be taken as my saying that I do not think it should ever be used. I think it should be used much more often, but it should be used on important questions on which it is necessary and desirable to have the opinion of both Houses of the Parliament. For that reason, I do not think this is the right occasion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate on behalf of the Opposition that we will not support the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats. We have many reservations about the argument put forward by Senator Macklin that this is a suitable occasion on which to apply the principle of delegated legislation. We do not consider that this is an appropriate use of the power of delegation. We consider that it would be a most clumsy and cumbersome machinery for arriving at a certain end. As well as our machinery reservations, of course, we cannot support the amendment because it does not contradict the purposes of clause 6. The amendment continues within the legislation the power to impose fees on tertiary students, and the Federal Opposition is opposed to that provision. So I indicate on behalf of the Opposition that we will not support Senator Macklin's amendment. We will continue our outright opposition to clause 6 and we will vote accordingly. I indicate too that, in order that the legislation be workable without clause 6, the Opposition has prepared and had circulated a series of amendments which are consequential on the deletion of clause 6 and which I will move on behalf of the Opposition at the completion of the Committee stage of the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I can see the reasoning behind the proposed amendments to clause 6. It is to provide to the Parliament the ultimate scrutiny of precisely what form the instrument would take. However, I would differ with the proposer of the motion, Senator Macklin, as there is merit in something that Senator Missen said. I understood him to indicate that there is a responsibility on both Houses of Parliament. If there is one group of persons in only one House, it can be seen that that group would seek to have incorporated into legislation safeguard and watchdog provisions which would ensure that it would have a final examination of the proposal. If there were a watchdog provision similar to that which is provided for regulations and ordinances, namely, that within 15 days of them being laid on the table either House of Parliament may disallow them, I think that would be a neater way of dealing with this matter. However, on balance, if the Bill is to go through in its current state, I agree that the Parliament ought to look at the instrument or, if that is not possible, it should at least get some indication from the Minister as to precisely what would be included in the instrument. At this stage I think I would support the proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is necessary for me to indicate that I have had discussions with quite a number of people about the proposed reintroduction of fees for second degrees and post-graduate study at universities. I have been impressed by the submissions that have been made to me by representatives from the University of Tasmania and from the Students Representative Council in that State. I also have been particularly impressed by a letter which was sent to me from the chairman of the School of Physics at the University of Melbourne, Professor E. G. Muirhead. I would like to read this letter to the Senate because I think it is important for some distinctions to be drawn. Professor Muirhead wrote about the reintroduction of tertiary fees and said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Senator Harradine,</PARA>
<PARA> I am reminded of your concern for this matter by the recent article in THE AUSTRALIAN HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPLEMENT . . . and hope that you might find the following information both relevant and significant. </PARA>
<PARA> This School of Physics-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the University of Melbourne School of Physics. </PARA>
<PARA>trains postgraduate students for both M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees. It is the largest Physics postgraduate school in Australia with approximately 60 students at present. Of these, ten (10) students are pursuing their studies without scholarships. There is an annual intake of about 5 such students. Many of these subsequently gain a postgraduate scholarship as a consequence of demonstrably superior performance as researchers. All students in this 'unsupported' category subsist on money earned from up to 6 hours/week in part-time teaching as tutors or laboratory demonstrators, yielding approximately $1,500 p.a. </PARA>
<PARA> This amount has to be supplemented by support from parents, or other part-time jobs, etc. It should be noted that students on scholarships also seek this remuneration in order to supplement the inadequate level of postgraduate awards which have not been indexed for inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been universally accepted that postgraduate students have reached such a level of competence at the attainment of their B.Sc. (Honours) degree as to be contributing a most significant amount of research within each university department and consequently merit a living allowance. The situation has something in common with the scheme of apprenticeship training. In each case there is something to be gained by the individual, the employer and ultimately society at large. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to many of us a wholly retrograde step to single out this small group of students for maximum discouragement as a consequence of the proposed re-imposition of fees. One immediate effect of the latter will be to significantly reduce the annual intake of students in this category by an amount which can only be guessed e.g. in our example from the present 5/25 or 20% p.a. to perhaps 2/22 or 9% p.a. This will occur at a time when there is a demonstrable need for physicists in our technologically based society. All the evidence available to us, both from surveys reported through the Australian Institute of Physics and from the follow-up histories of our own graduates indicates that they find congenial employment consistent with their qualifications. There remain two points which ought to be given weight in considering this matter of fees. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not read those points. The letter goes on to the question of providing a further tax base for those people who do post-graduate work. It states that in their future employment they will be able to contribute substantially because of their enhanced income ability. It then refers to undergraduate records and so on. I seek leave to have the rest of the letter incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>1. Any small immediate financial gain through their imposition is likely to be offset by the long term reduction in taxation revenue due to a reduced number of graduates who over their professional working life would have more than repayed the community for the direct cost of their university course(s) either through increased productivity or higher levels of personal income tax, or both. The cost-effectiveness of the proposed scheme should first be established. </PARA>
<PARA>2. The background of the group of initially unsupported postgraduate students is of interest. Their undergraduate records are better than average (65-70%) which partly explains their inability to obtain a Commonwealth Postgraduate Award (or equivalent University Postgraduate Award) for which considerable weight is given to the level of the third year results in the B.Sc. course. Their subsequent history in the B.Sc. (Honours) and M.Sc. years, in which research is a large component, shows that the majority mature and develop considerably and finally complete good quality M.Sc. or Ph.D. theses which compare very favourably with those produced by those on awards. While our sample of students may be small I am confident that the conclusions drawn will hold for the group at large. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion therefore may I commend for your consideration and concern the very negative consequence of the proposed tertiary fees both for Australia and for a significant number of postgraduates who do not derserve to be penalized relative to their peers. </PARA>

The fourth category of post-graduate students will have already applied for assistance in competition with successful students from the first three categories. Having missed out, they will seek to continue with post-graduate studies. One could even say that they are fifth category. Only those who are newly coming into that category will attract the fees. Those currently enrolled in post-graduate study who have not got a Commonwealth post-graduate award, a university research grant or a significant scholarship will not have fees imposed on them either.

<PARA> (5) Does this company have a number of subsidiary companies operating in Australia concerned with various medical areas including insurance, medical management and rehabilitation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1), (2) and (3) Approvals given to U.S. firms to invest in private hospitals in Australia up to 4 March 1980 are set out in the answer to Senate Question No. 2024, (Hansard, 4 March 1980, p. 537). Since that date approval has been given to Hospital Affiliates of Australia Pty Ltd to acquire the Bundoora and District private hospital, a 70-bed medical/surgical hospital near Melbourne. One other approval was given for a further acquisition by Hospital Corporation Australia Pty Ltd but this proposal was not implemented for commercial reasons. Hospital Corporation Australia Pty Ltd has also recently advised the Government that it has withdrawn from the Noarlunga District private hospital project at Christies Beach, South Australia. The only other private hospital known to have foreign equity in it is the President Private Hospital in Sydney, owned as to 25 per cent by Commonwealth Industrial Gases Ltd (see answer to Senate Question No. 2552, Hansard, 20 May 1980, p. 2544). All proposals by foreign interests to invest in private hospitals have been examined in consultation with the relevant State health authorities. All such proposals have been approved subject to conditions that the companies concerned meet the requirements of relevant health authorities and introduce a minimum of 35 per cent local equity into their Australian operations.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The INA Insurance Company of Australia was incorporated on 17 October 1978. The name of this company was changed to Insurance Company of North America (Australia) Ltd on 24 November 1978.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Insurance Company of North America (Australia) Ltd's legal representative has advised that Hospital Affiliates Australia Pty Ltd which is wholly owned by the company's U.S. parent, owns five private hospitals in Australia. However, the U.S. parent has, subject to Australian Government approval under the provisions of the Foreign Takeovers Act, reached agreement to sell these hospitals to National Medical Enterprises Inc. of the U.S.A. The company is also planning to establish a new subsidiary to provide rehabilitation services on a consultancy basis.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) and (7) In relation to the Commonwealth's powers and responsibilities medical services should be only those that are reasonably necessary for the adequate medical care of the patients concerned. This principle is set out in the definition of 'excessive services' in the Health Insurance Act. The principle applies to services provided by private practitioners, which are eligible for medical benefits, or to services provided in other situations, such as in hospitals or health centres. The Government has taken a number of initiatives to control the provisions of unnecessary services or fraudulent claims. My Department has developed a large computer based fraud and overservicing detection system which facilitates the identification by officers of medical benefit services of various providers, which require further investigation to determine whether they were or were not excessive services. The same investigations can also bring to light fraudulent claims by patients or providers of medical services. These arrangements apply to any providers of services, whether they be solo medical practitioners or health services vertically or horizontally integrated. The Government's concern is for the best use of the resources available consistent with the welfare of the patients.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) and (9) When foreign persons seek to operate Australian-owned private hospitals it would appear necessary for them to lease, hire or obtain a grant of rights to use assets of an Australian business. Such arrangements are covered by the provisions of section 21 of the Foreign Takeovers Act 1975 (the Act).</PARA>

<PARA> (b) the proposal, if carried out, would have the result that-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) in the case of a business not controlled by foreign persons-the business would be controlled by foreign persons; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) in the case of a business controlled by foreign persons-the business would continue to be controlled by foreign persons, but those persons would include a person who is not, or would not include a person who is, one of the foreign persons first referred to in this sub-paragraph; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) that result would be contrary to the national interest, the Treasurer may make an order prohibiting the entering into of the proposed arrangement or prohibiting the termination of the existing arrangements as the case may be.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised by the Department of the Treasury that they are unaware of circumstances whereby private hospitals could become foreign controlled through the circumvention of section 21 of the Foreign Takeovers Act. The Treasury Department has also been advised by the three U.S. companies operating private hospitals that they are not operating hospitals not owned by them.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>

<PARA> No Government has ever adopted a policy of expanding the number of staff in the Taxation Office (or any other revenue collecting agency) to the point where every dollar of revenue capable of being collected each year is collected.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) and (b) The report of the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program (NTEHP) which was tabled in the Parliament on 1 April 1980 provides details on these points.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The success rate of the mass treatment programs conducted by the NTEHP in reducing the prevalence and severity of trachoma was assessed by the rescreening of groups at risk. This matter is also explained in some detail at page 157 et seq of the aforementioned report.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) and (b) The total number of adults and children who have undergone treatment for trachoma and other eye disease since the completion of the NTEHP's Australia-wide survey is not known. In general, such activities constitute a part of general health care provided by State and Northern Territory health authorities and for which separate statistics are not available.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) There are difficulties in assessing the success of the treatment programs because of the many factors operating. In hyperendemic areas, and in environments characterised by inadequate clean water supplies, housing and sanitation, it is obvious that treatment programs can only provide temporary relief, because such conditions imply the existence of a continuing pool of infection. In addition, the prevalence of trachoma is affected by such factors as treatment coverage of the community, which in turn is affected by the degree of compliance and the degree of mobility within, and between communities (e.g. untreated newcomers to a community can be a source of reinfection). Thus, it should be borne in mind that any satisfactory interpretation of prevalence statistics is dependent on isolating and analysing these many associated variables. The health authorities in the Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia have provided the following details:</PARA>
<PARA> Northern Territory-As explained in answer to Senate Question 294, Hansard, 26 March 1981, page 868, the Northern Territory Department of Health has a special program which concentrates on children in Aboriginal communities. In situations where the disease is hyperendemic prevalence cannot be monitored by a system of individual case notifications. However, recent surveys have indicated a definite decrease in the severity of infections, and the Northern Territory Government has been actively promoting a five-year plan to upgrade water supplies and other basic services in Aboriginal communities.</PARA>
<PARA> South Australia-The South Australian Health Commission has advised that as a result of its programs adults have shown a general improvement in vision, often with the aid of spectacles, and children have shown a considerable decrease in incidence of trachoma from 26 per cent (in the NTEHP survey) to an estimated 7-12 per cent in 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> Western Australia-Community and Child Health Services has advised that in 1980 when its team saw 1776 children in the Kimberleys alone, the prevalence of trachoma there had decreased to 32 per cent. (The NTEHP in its survey of that area found a prevalence of 52 per cent, which was a decrease of about 40 per cent from the prevalence found by Professor Mann in her survey some 20 years previously.) Likewise, in the Murchison region there has been a decline in prevalence to 50 per cent in 1980-81. (The NTEHP found 64 per cent for this area, which was a decrease of 20-32 per cent from the prevalence found by Dr Eksteins in a survey some 20 years earlier.) It is uncertain whether this gradual decline in the prevalence of trachoma should be mainly attributed to treatment programs or environmental improvements, but it is probably due to a combination of both.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) (a) and (b) In most States trachoma and eye health programs are integrated into general health care programs.</PARA>
<PARA> In Queensland, for example, there are routine screening programs for visual acuity in primary school and pre-school children. Also, children under fifteen years in areas served by the Aboriginal Health Program are periodically screened by a variety of conditions by public health nurses. Apart from examination for discharging eyes, more specialised eye examinations are not performed, but public hospital facilities are available for diagnosis and treatment of trachoma and eye disease of adults and children.</PARA>
<PARA> In South Australia there is a co-ordinated program (comprising the South Australian Branch of the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists and the Aboriginal Health Unit of the Health Commission) for both Aboriginal adults and children. This provides thrice yearly visits by ophthalmologists to remote communities to assess and treat eye conditions. Visiting generalist doctors from the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress Medical Service, Alice Springs, from Ceduna and from Adelaide also monitor eye conditions. In addition to the above, children recevie a thrice yearly ntibiotic treatment regime, under specialist supervision, administered by Aboriginal Health Unit staff resident in remote communities.</PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Territory Department of Health operates a trachoma control program which was explained in some detail in response to Senate Question No. 294, Hansard, 26 March 1980, page 868.</PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia in 1981 the Western Australian Eye Health Programme Co-ordinating Committee was formed. The Committee consists of representatives of the WA Branch of the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists and the WA Public Health Department. It has been extended to include Aboriginal representation from the Perth Aboriginal Medical Service, the Aboriginal Advisory Council and the National Aboriginal Conference. The Committee has met to formulate the policy and plans for the program in Western Australia and has been financed by the Community and Child Health Services Branch of the Public Health Department. The surveillance and treatment program for trachoma is conducted in each region by a team consisting of medical officers, a field nurse and Aboriginal health workers. Records are kept at district and regional offices. Visiting ophthalmologists and opticians are specialist members of the team. The Eye Health Program provides treatment and management for other eye diseases. In addition, the Lions Club also conducts glaucoma and amblyopia screening clinics at large regional centres, and these are free, and open to the general public.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the control of trachoma (and other infections) all health authorities emphasise the need to upgrade the poor environmental conditions, expecially inadequate water supplies, which exist in many Aboriginal communities. To assist in overcoming these environmental deficiencies, the Commonwealth Government has agreed to commit $50m over a five-year period to an Aboriginal Public Health Improvement Program. $8m of this has been allocated for 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) In recognition of the need for additional eye-health services, a proposal is currently being developed by the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists. This is being based on the specific requirements for ongoing care in each area.

<PARA> Will the Minister take urgent action to protect the jobs of meatworkers and other country people who depend on meatworks for their livelihood by introducing a quota on livestock exports in the form of a ratio of live animal to processed meat exports, as the present tendency toward live meat exports from Australia is causing abattoirs to face one of the poorest seasons on record.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Carrick</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Trade and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is acutely aware of the current difficulties being faced by the meat processing industry and of the impact this is having on country people where rural meatworks are involved. However to attribute responsibility for the problems faced by abattoirs to livestock exports is to misunderstand the causes of the current problems and the nature of the livestock trade.</PARA>
<PARA> The present circumstances facing the processing sector must be seen against the general decline in cattle numbers over the last five years and the consequent fall in abattoir throughput. The causes of this decline are complex, but include the recent drought and competing prospects for alternative enterprises such as grains and wool.</PARA>
<PARA> However there is no doubt that a major factor in producer decisions to reduce herd size was the restrictive action taken against imports in our major markets in the mid 70's.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has undertaken a major effort, on behalf of the meat industry, to negotiate improved market access for beef, especially in MTN agreements with the United States of America, Japan, Canada and the EEC. These agreements provide a more stable and secure framework for the future development of the Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA> It would be a mistake to assume that in the current situation, processed meat could simply be substituted for livestock exports. Consumers in the Middle East, for example, have a strong preference for fresh killed meat. If the Government were to interfere in this trade in the manner suggested the most likely result would be a fall-off in the live trade without any consequent increase in the volume of carcase meat from Australia taken by that region.</PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, the closer trading links forged with the Middle East through the development of the livestock trade has probably been a major factor in the expansion of our meat trade to the region. In the decade to 30 June 1980, sheepmeat exports have increased from 11,415 tonnes to 71,907 tonnes and exports of beef have also grown from 1,213 tonnes to 34,760 tonnes over this period.</PARA>
<PARA> This is not to say that the Government is not sympathetic with the present difficulties in the meat processing industry. While the need for rationalisation has to be faced squarely, the Government is prepared to examine carefully any constructive proposal to assist meat processors.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) On 27 May 1981, legislation containing new general anti-tax avoidance provisions was introduced. Those provisions apply to arrangements entered into after that date and are designed to strike down tax avoidance schemes of a blatant, artificial or contrived kind.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The new anti-avoidance legislation has effect in relation to schemes entered into after 27 May 1981, that is, about one month before the end of the 1980-81 year of income. As income tax collections in 1981-82 are based on assessments for the 1980-81 income year it was considered prudent and necessary to make some allowance in the 1981-82 Budget estimates for short falls in collections that could result from tax avoidance activities that took place before the effective date of the new anti-avoidance measures. This allowance was $300m-$220m for individuals and $80m for companies-and reflects the experience in the 1980-81 financial year in relation to identified tax avoidance schemes that had operated during the 1979-80 income year.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Rank-General Electric Housewares Pty Ltd of Notting Hill, Victoria has advised my Department that in May 1981 the company had raised with the AMWSU the situation involving seven process workers who had been on long term workers' compensation because of tenosynovitis, but that at no time had there been any suggestion of the company issuing dismissal notices to these employees.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Rank-General Electric Housewares has informed the Department that due to a misunderstanding between the parties over the employment of the seven employees, a mass meeting of about 500 employees (AMWSU members and others) occurred on 24 or 25-6-81. That meeting decided to commence a stoppage on 26-6-81 in the belief that the seven process workers could face dismissal. Normal work was resumed by some employees on 2.7.81 with the remaining employees returning the following day. This resumption was achieved on the basis of an agreement under which the company agreed to:</PARA>
<PARA> introduce a health rehabilitation program on an ongoing basis;</PARA>
<PARA> introduce immediately a health program (training and awareness) to be coordinated by an ergonomist;</PARA>
<PARA> union representatives conducting a survey of employees in connection with job design and job rotation which is to be examined and discussed with management.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Rank-General Electric Housewares has advised that there have been no dismissals of employees because of tenosynovitis and that the future of the seven employees in question will be reviewed following their completion of the new rehabilitation program.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Broadly speaking, legislation concerning unfair dismissal is a matter for the States. For constitutional reasons, the Commonwealth's legislative powers in this area are basically confined to its own employees.</PARA>
<PARA> At common law, there is no special protection of the employment of injured workers. Such persons are in the same position and have the same remedy as workers who claim to have been unfairly dismissed, which is to sue for damages; although NSW and SA have provided additional remedies legislatively.</PARA>
<PARA> The position of injured workers has also been dealt with in awards and agreements reached in many industries between employers and unions that provide for the payment of accident pay to employers on workers compensation. The accident pay is designed to make up the difference between the level of workers compensation and the award rate that would have been received if the worker had not been injured.</PARA>
<PARA> A worker's entitlement to accident pay under an award or agreement exists generally as long as he/she is entitled to workers compensation even though his or her employment may have been terminated. Provision is made in both awards and agreements that prevent the employer terminating the employment of an injured worker to avoid the payment of accident pay. Breaches of federal award provisions are actionable under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904. Breaches of private agreements may be sued for at common law.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Director of the Industrial Relations Bureau has advised me that the Bureau does not have details of and has not investigated the incident. I understand that the Bureau's policy is to conduct inspections of all respondents to federal awards as frequently as possible to ensure that those respondents are complying with their award obligations. In addition, the Bureau does investigate specific complaints of alleged breaches of the Act, regulations and of awards.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The Director has indicated to me that upon receipt of more specific information the Bureau would examine the matter to determine whether there may have been a breach of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act or regulations or of a federal award.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am aware, as is my Department, that in his report to Parliament for 1980-81, the Auditor-General noted the level of unrecovered payments under the various schemes of student assistance. He also noted my Department's advice that debt recovery work would be restricted in 1981 due to the withdrawal in May 1980 of services previously provided by the Australian Federal Police Force, reductions in staff ceilings, and the need to give priority to the processing of applications for payment. The Federal Police no longer undertake, on the Department's behalf, work involving the location of debtors and the collection of evidence for use in prosecutions activity. The police continue to be involved in cases of fraud or other criminal action.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) The Auditor-General did not make any reference in his Report, to the amount of money which has not been returned as a result of restricted debt recovery work. It is not possible for my Department to estimate the amount involved. When Federal Police services were withdrawn, the Auditor-General noted that some 450 cases involving $300,000 in overpayments were returned unactioned to my Department's State Offices. These 450 cases represent approximately five per cent of the total cases and approximately ten per cent of the total amount involved in outstanding overpayments.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) to (6) Following the withdrawal of the services of the Australian Federal Police Force in May 1980 there was interdepartmental discussion about possible alternative measures and a review is being undertaken of debt recovery procedures. In the meantime, my Department has engaged, on a trial basis, the services of mercantile agencies to locate debtors, but not to pursue debt collections. The remainder of the debt collection process continues to be carried out by my Department with its available staff.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Accidents which have occurred at the animal disease centres at Pirbright, England and Plum Island, United States of America with foot-and-mouth disease are as follows:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) It was recommended (recommendation 4(a)) in the main report of the Public Inquiry into Income Tax Zone Allowances (which was tabled on Budget night) that urban areas in Zone A with populations in excess of 25,000 should be changed from Zone A to Zone B. Mount Isa is one such urban area. The Government's decision on this and certain other changes in the zone rebate arrangements recommended in the main report will be announced shortly.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There is no suggestion that the particular recommendation was directed specifically towards Mount Isa. The basis for the recommendation is set out in paragraph 5.8 of the report, that is:</PARA>
<PARA> '5.8 From observations and discussions by the members of the Inquiry during visits to the zone areas it became apparent that once a town reached a certain population size it was able to provide an acceptable level of services and facilities which tended to increase as the town grew thereafter. This observation was substantiated by various written submissions received. It has been suggested that there should be a designated size for a population centre at which it is deemed to be able to provide sufficient services and facilities to offset at least to a substantial degree the disadvantages of remoteness. This would mean that resident taxpayers in a population centre of the designated size located in Zone A should receive benefits applicable to Zone B while resident taxpayers in a population centre of the designated size located in Zone B should receive no benefits from zone allowances.'</PARA>
<PARA> (3) It has been put to the Government that a reduction in zone rebates would make it increasingly difficult to attract qualified people to Mount Isa, just as it was submitted to the Inquiry that zone allowances were needed to encourage employees to move to remote areas generally. On the other hand, it was stated in the Inquiry's report (paragraph 4.30) that ' . . . . at public hearings, witnesses generally agreed that a decision to establish a major project in a remote area would not hinge on whether there was an appropriate zone allowance, and that employers had a responsibility to attract labour to remote areas, and (paragraph 8.9) that 'The Inquiry believes that in the overall scheme of things zone allowances have not had a significant impact on resource allocation, particularly labour mobility'.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) It was in recognition of the problems of people living in the remoter areas that the Government initiated the recent inquiry into the taxation zone allowances.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Iron and Steel Dumping Evaluation Committee was established to facilitate the submission of evidence of alleged dumping in relation to mill products of the iron and steel industry.</PARA>
<PARA> In taking this action the Minister said he was conscious of the considerable levels of excess capacity in the iron and steel industry throughout the world, and that many developed countries had acted to control imports and influence prices. These actions by other countries carried with them the risk of diverting exports of iron and steel products at dumped prices to Australia, with a consequent threat of injury to the Australian iron and steel industry.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Committee acts as the complainant and submits evidence to the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs for possible initiation of anti-dumping action. It is for the Department, as distinct from the Committee, to independently evaluate the evidence, to determine whether a prima facie case has been made, and to carry out overseas inquiries if appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the complainant role of the Committee it is not appropriate for sectors of the industry other than manufacturers to be represented on the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is, of course, a matter concerning the administration of the income tax law and the Commissioner of Taxation was asked for his comments. The Commissioner explained, by way of background, that it is a long standing policy of the Australian Taxation Office to issue all assessments as quickly as possible after lodgment of returns particularly where a refund of tax is involved. As far as circumstances permit, returns are dealt with in the order of receipt.</PARA>
<PARA> Returns received from salary and wage earners early in the financial year are generally processed within 4 weeks. However, over the full course of a year the average time taken from the date of receipt of a return until a notice of assessment and refund cheque is forwarded to a taxpayer would be in the order of 6 to 8 weeks.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner said that 109,670 'salary refund' returns were lodged at the Brisbane Taxation Office during the first three weeks of July 1981. The following table shows progressively, the number and percentage of assessments issued in respect of these returns at fortnightly intervals from 7 August 1981.</PARA>
<PARA>  %  August 7  98,034 89.4  August 21  102,848 93.8  September 4  105,358 96.1 September 18  106,943 97.5  October  108,228 98.7</PARA>
<PARA> There are several reasons why some assessments take longer to complete than others. These include:</PARA>
<PARA> the quotation of incorrect file numbers by taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA> the need to closely examine some returns because of the nature of the income disclosed or the deductions or rebates claimed.</PARA>
<PARA> the need to contact taxpayers to obtain further information or to query a particular claim.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 19 August 1981, (Hansard, page 50), Senator Sibraa asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Communications, a question without notice concerning Australia Post's acceptance of new mail contractors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia Post is required, under the terms of the Postal Services Act 1975, to pursue, where practicable, a financial policy to enable it to meet all operating costs from revenue and to contribute at least half the amount required for capital expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA> Against this background, Australia Post continually reviews its services, including rural mail deliveries, to ensure that they are carried out as economically and efficiently as practicable, and that resources are used to the best advantage.</PARA>
<PARA> Before a contract for a mail delivery service is advertised, Australia Post assesses the order of costs which could be involved in performance of the particular service. This assessment is taken into account in considering the suitability of tenders received.</PARA>
<PARA> Prescribed procedures of particular importance in selecting a suitable tender at a satisfactory price, under the competitive public tendering system, follow:</PARA>
<PARA> Every consideration is given to a re-tender from an existing contractor who has held a contract for some years and has given satisfactory service over that period. In these circumstances, Australia Post may apply a loading (up to a prescribed maximum), to the tender prices quoted by other tenderers, to take account of the expertise and demonstrated satisfactory service of the longstanding contractor.</PARA>
<PARA> If the lowest tender received is so low that it would appear to preclude the satisfactory operation of the service, the tenderer is interviewed and given the opportunity to withdraw or to revise the tender. (Australia Post's assessment of an acceptable price depends to some extent on whether a contractor proposes to carry mail exclusively or in conjunction with other freight. In the latter circumstance, a lower price would be expected.)</PARA>
<PARA> If a new tender is lodged, all other tenderers are invited to re-tender also. If the tenderer confirms the price, however, and it is clear to Australia Post that it would not be possible to provide a satisfactory service at that price, then the next lowest tender may be considered. If the price submitted by that tenderer were considered too low also, the process described above would continue until an acceptable level is reached.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to price considerations tenderers are assessed in terms of suitability to conduct the advertised service in a competent manner. Particular efforts are made also to ensure that the tenderer is fully informed of all of Australia Post's requirements before a contract is let. If the lowest tenderer is not considered suitable, the process described above continues until a suitable tenderer can be found.</PARA>
<PARA> Within Australia Post, mail contracting matters are dealt with by field management. If Senator Sibraa knows of any case which he believes should be investigated, Australia Post would be pleased to have the matter reviewed.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> In response to House of Representatives Question No. 1157 (Hansard, 3 June 1981, page 3068) I stated that the Left Word procedure has a number of service shortcomings. These included Telecom's inability to ensure the message reached the wanted party. A common situation was that on receiving word that he/she was required, the person concerned would originate an STD call to the calling party nullifying the original call. Studies showed that more than fifty per cent of all calls using the Left Word procedure were outstanding at the end of a day.</PARA>
<PARA> These problems have been overcome by the Try Again procedure, where the operator ascertains when the particular person is likely to be available, and makes follow-up attempts to bring the call to a successful conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA> It is Telecom's policy to notify its customers of operating changes only in cases where an existing service is withdrawn, or where all subscribers are affected by a major change to existing procedures.</PARA>
<PARA> In this change of practice the Left Word procedure has been replaced by what is considered a much better service to subscribers both in terms of ensuring that the called party is made aware he/she is wanted, and that the call is connected at the earliest possible opportunity.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 August 1981 (Hansard, page 319), Senator Sibraa asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since we are nearing the end of the International Year of Disabled Persons I wonder whether the Minister is aware of how popular the new pushbutton telephone is to those disabled people, such as the blind, who have always experienced difficulty with the normal dial telephone. Is the Minister also aware that the additional rental and changeover charges for the pushbutton telephone are in excess of $70, which is prohibitive for most pensioners who are anxious to acquire one? What action will the Minister take to enable all disabled persons to acquire a pushbutton telephone free of charge or at a nominal cost?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> As a general principle it is more equitable for the cost of concessions for disadvantaged sections in the community to be borne by all taxpayers rather than just Telecom customers. This is in line with the recommendations of the Vernon Commission of Inquiry into the former Australian Post Office and the approach that has been adopted in the case of the telephone rental concession for eligible pensioners, which is funded by direct appropriations to the Departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs which in return reimburse Telecom.</PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, since 1978 special concessional rates have applied for Touchfones provided in cases approved by the Department of Social Security where the facility is required by a disabled person undergoing a rehabilitation program sponsored by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. In such cases the Department of Social Security meets the $20 once only charge and $28 installation fee (the latter applicable only where a change of instrument is involved), and Telecom waives the additional $24 annual rental.</PARA>
<PARA> As you are aware Telecom already provides some concessions for the disabled, for example, a one-third discount on rental and installation fees for certain facilities designed for the benefit of the disabled. However, Telecom is not presently in a position to offer further concessions such as Touchfones to disabled persons on the basis suggested.</PARA>

<PARA> I refer the Minister representing the Treasurer to the decision in last week's Budget to amend the sales tax Acts and to place glace fruits in the schedule of items attracting a 17 1/2 per cent tax to correct a so-called anomaly or inconsistency. Is it true that in general foodstuffs are exempt from sales tax and that on page 19 of the Budget Speech the Treasurer specifically excluded food from the new imposition? Does the Government decision therefore create and not correct an inconsistency? Is it true that this decision was taken without industry consultation or advice? Is it also true that appeal provisions under the sales tax legislation will not operate before 1 January 1982 although the increased taxes operate immediately, ensuring that effective relief may not be available to this industry and others until it is too late? Since the industry is vital to South Australia's Barossa Valley and Murray River areas, and since such a hefty tax increase will have disastrous effects on sales and the demand for both fruit and labour in an industry which is worth $3.5m to the South Australian economy, will the Government undertake to reconsider these two ill-considered decisions?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> With the exception of confectionery and beverages, foodstuffs for human consumption have been exempt from sales tax for many years.</PARA>
<PARA> In the Budget Speech it was indicated that the existing exemption for foodstuffs would not be affected by the 2.5 per cent tax proposed for a range of goods that are currently exempt.</PARA>
<PARA> The decision to include glace fruits among the goods classifiable as confectionery places them on an equal footing with crystallized fruit which is also specifically classified as confectionery. This removes an inconsistency which previously existed.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government did not consider it necessary to consult the industry about the elimination of an unintended inconsistency in the law.</PARA>
<PARA> The appeal procedures referred to involve a proposal to give taxpayers a right of objection and appeal to the classification of goods under the sales tax law where that classification is in doubt. That proposal was released for public comment on 20 August 1981 but is not, at this stage, the subject of legislation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 15 September 1981 (Hansard, page 720) Senator Robert Ray asked me, as the Minister representing the Treasurer, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I preface my question to the Minister for Finance by saying that in the recent sales tax increases the Kit Kat biscuit produced by Rowntree Hoadley Ltd was redefined as confectionery. This product has previously been exempt as a wafer biscuit but is now subject to a 17 1/2 per cent sales tax. Is the Minister aware of the burden imposed on Rowntree Hoadley by broadening the sales tax? Is the Government concerned at the probable sacking of 50 to 75 employees by that firm? Can the Minister guarantee that there will be a re-examination of the interpretation of the Kit Kat as this product is defined as a biscuit in every other country in which it is produced? Finally, as the Australian Customs Tariff defines Kit Kat as a biscuit, does the Government intend to deal with this anomaly?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasury has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> On 15 September 1981 Senator Ray asked a number of questions about sales tax payable on Kit Kat biscuits. One question was related to the treatment of Kit Kat biscuits as confectionery for the purposes of the sales tax law when for Customs Tariff purposes they are regarded as biscuits. I said at the time that I would ask the Treasurer to look into this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised by the Treasurer that the different classifications of Kit Kat under the sales tax and Customs Tariff laws are not inconsistent. Customs Tariff serves a completely different purpose to sales tax. The particular Customs Tariff item refers to biscuits including chocolate coated ones.</PARA>
<PARA> The sales tax classification of 'Kit Kat' does not turn on any identity it has as a biscuit. There is no specific exemption from sales tax for biscuits. Biscuits may qualify for exemption under a general provision, item 35C in the First Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act, which exempts foodstuffs for human consumption. Confectionery is excluded from the exemption under item 35C and, as a result of the recent amendments to the sales tax law, confectionery is defined to include goods marketed as confectionery or consisting principally of confectionery. Thus any foodstuff, including biscuits, which is marketed as confectionery or consists principally of confectionery does not qualify for exemption under item 35C.</PARA>
<PARA> Kit Kats are marketed as confectionery in competition with other confectionery lines. It was regarded as anomalous that Kit Kats were exempt when competitive confectionery lines were taxable. The anomally has been removed by making Kit Kats taxable along with other comparable lines which are marketed as confectionery.</PARA>

State authorities are aware of the economies and educational advantages to be gained by interstate co-operation in the external studies field of TAFE and considerable sharing of resources already exists.

<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the report of the Australian Academy of Science. The Academy of Science report was similar to that of the Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS) Working Party in the United Kingdom which published its report 'Lead and Health' in 1980, in attributing less than a quarter of the lead absorbed by adults and less than one-tenth of the lead in children directly to airborne lead.</PARA>
<PARA> The Academy also attributed an unspecified proportion of lead intake in children to lead in dust, a large proportion of which in urban areas comes from airborne lead settling out. Although the Academy is not specific about how much lead comes from dust, it can be calculated from the figures in the report that under certain circumstances this may even be close to the amount absorbed from both food and air.</PARA>
<PARA> The National Health &amp; Medical Research Council (NH &amp; MRC) recommended limits for lead in foods in 1960 and, after discussions with the food industry, has since reduced the amount permitted. The most recent reduction of lead permitted in food was approved by the NH &amp; MRC in October 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> This reduction means that the maximum permitted concentration of lead in infant foods is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) the lead content of infant foods in containers other than tin plate must not exceed 0.3 mg/kg;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) for those infant foods packaged in tin plate containers the mean level of lead in ten samples must not exceed 0.3 mg/kg and the lead content of any single sample must not exceed 0.8 mg/kg.</PARA>

<PARA> I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of today which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The editor of a partly Government-owned newspaper in Zimbabwe which disclosed that North Korean military instructors were in the country has been sacked.</PARA>
<PARA> The editor . . . reported in the Umtali Post that a large contingent of north Koreans was near Umtali and accompanied the story with a critical editorial.</PARA>
<PARA> Will the Minister ascertain and inform the Senate whether that editor was sacked because the article was accurate or because it was inaccurate, and what would be the Australian Government's attitude if it were agreed that North Korean military instructors are in Zimbabwe?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to this matter the Zimbabwean Minister of Information Dr Nathan Shamuyaria made the following statement in the Parliament of Zimbabwe on 17 September:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The former Editor of the Umtali Post, Mrs Maitland-Stuart, was appointed to that post and that paper before it was purchased by the Zimbabwe Mass Media Trust. After the purchase last January, she and other Editors were told that they would be replaced as and when new Editors were identified. She was due to retire at the end of this year.</PARA>
<PARA> However, on Friday 7th August, as the honourable member Mr Butler has said, she published the following editorial, which I would like to quote for the information of honourable members. It was titled: 'Sinister Trend'.</PARA>
<PARA> Foreign troops are now based in Manicaland. The arrival in Inyanga this week of North Korean soldiers, understood to be the first of a large contingent, is a sinister development. What have they come for? How long will they be here? We would have thought that Zimbabwe had a big enough army of its own for the defence of this country, without requiring help from anyone, least of all foreigners from Eastern Asia. There are now Cubans in Angola and Ethiopia, Koreans in Zimbabwe, East Germans in Mozambique, Chinese in Tanzania and Zambia, to name a few. Is this the freedom Africa seeks? We see it as neocolonialism of the worst kind. The Minister of Defence must tell us all why the Koreans are here.</PARA>
<PARA> That was the Editorial-</PARA>
<PARA> Now firstly, the Editorial was inaccurate in several essential respects. We called her to Salisbury to ascertain the sources of her information. She was not called in to be dismissed, but to be questioned on the inaccurate facts in the Editorial. For example, there was no large contingent of Koreans coming to Inyanga. The Minister of Defence had announced that 106 instructors had arrived to train the 5th Brigade. There was no intention to use the Korean personnel across our borders in Mozambique. The statement that was published on the front page of the same paper which prevoked the editorial which stated that Koreans were to be used across the border. Why has she not questioned the presence of British officers who are training the national army, and as Comrade Mudzingwa has said, why did she not question the presence of South African troops in the country. We felt she had used words in the sense of a military occupation.</PARA>
<PARA> I indicated to her at that meeting that the editorial had adopted a South African line in opposing the presence of any personnel from Eastern Communist countries. There are no Chinese in Zambia or Tanzania or East Germans in Mozambique in the sense of military occupation. There are, of course, Embassy staff and experts in various scientific fields, in each case, especially in the case of Zambia and Tanzania British pesonnel are far in the majority in those countries. She has not questioned that.</PARA>
<PARA> But it is the South African thinking behind this editorial of opposing the presence of any personnel from any countries other than Western Europe. As a non-aligned nation, this view is diametrically opposed to our own view. We welcome and interact with all nationalities, especially those who supported us in the patriotic war of national liberation.</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the editorial was racist, again betraying a basic South Africa attitude. Examine the phrase which was in the editorial I have just read saying, 'least of all foreigners from Eastern Asia', implying foreigners from Western Europe or America would be tolerable. This editor had not opposed, as I said earlier, the activities of the South African army in Angola nd Mozambique. This racist thinking is totally unacceptable to the Government of independent Zimbabwe.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister and I made our views known about Mrs Maitland-Stuart to the management of Zimbabwe newspapers and to the Mass Media Trust, which owns the majority shareholding. Taking our views into acount, the management decided to terminate the services of Mrs Maitland-Stuart. I should stress it was not the Government which dismissed her-we merely made our views known loudly and clearly. The Chairman of the Mass Media Trust, Dr Sadza, was as appalled as we were by the views of the Editor. He informed us that he would be consulting with his fellow Trustees with a view to taking action they thought appropriate. In turn they instructed their representatives on the Board of Zimbabwe Newspapers to take the action they thought appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government and the Mass Media Trust are at one that fifth columnists and racists must be weeded out of our newspapers and Mass Media Institutions. Only those honourable members designing to undermine the state can condone such actions and activities.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we cannot be told about the freedom of the press. We are in the process of establishing, since we came into power, a free press in the country. There has never been a free press because journalists were detained and some died in prison. One of our most outstanding journalists, Comrade Edison Sithole, an eminent writer, disappeared at the hands of the members opposite. I am only recounting facts of which we are all aware and which are well documented. When we took over the Ministry of Information there was the well-known practice of censorship. At one time the members opposite had 14 information officers working as censors on newspapers. So that newspapers could not print anything which they wanted without passing the eyes of the censors. We have no censors and that is why people like Mrs Maitland-Stuart can print the kind of things she did. As I said in my statement that is why we made our views known and I am glad the Mass Media Trust acted accordingly.'</PARA>
<PARA> The above statement is self-explanatory and not one to which the Australian Government has anything to add.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the other matter you raised concerning the presence of North Korean instructors in Zimbabwe, the Australian Government's attitude is that the decision of the Government of Zimbabwe to accept the North Korean offer of military training is entirely a matter for that Government and is consistent with its policy of non-alignment. Mr Mugabe has said that other units of the defence forces of Zimbabwe will continue to be trained with the assistance of the British Military Training Team, in accordance with the agreement between the Governments of Zimbabwe and the United Kingdom.</PARA>

His question concerned the reason why the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation (AMLC) has not granted an export licence to Phil-Bai International Pty Ltd and whether this will mean that the company will source its meat from New Zealand for export to the Philippines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> In December 1979 the Philippines Government established Phil-Bai, a state trading organisation, to undertake the import of meat and livestock from Australia and New Zealand. Phil-Bai is controlled by the Philippines Bureau of Animal Industry. Following this decision, a company, Phil-Bai International Pty Ltd, was established in Australia with 90 per cent Philippine Government and 10 per cent Australian interests.</PARA>
<PARA> In July, 1980, Phil-Bai International applied to the AMLC for export licences for meat and livestock. The application was refused on the grounds that the Corporation was opposed to granting an Australian export licence to the purchasing arm of a foreign Government sole import agency. This general policy of the AMLC is designed to protect the interests of the Australian industry in dealing with foreign sole importing agencies by preserving for the Corporation the right to step into the market itself as a sole seller so that it can, if necessary, deal with a sole buyer on equal terms.</PARA>
<PARA> As Phil-Bai has been able to arrange purchases of meat in Australia and arrange with licensed exporters to export the meat to the Philippines, the policy decision by the AMLC has not materially affected Phil-Bai's commercial interests. A number of Australian meat exporters have expressed satisfaction with the trading links they have established with Phil-Bai. There does not appear to have been any significant diversion of trade away from Australia to New Zealand because of the AMLC's action. Total exports of meat to the Philippines from Australia in 1980-81 were around 4,800 tonnes, compared to 5,300 tonnes for 1979-80.</PARA>

The Government's policies, which are designed to maintain a climate of economic growth and improved opportunities for business, are therefore a pre-requisite for the creation and growth of firms in these industries.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator will be aware that Australia already has a developed microelectronics industrial capacity including the production of computer equipment and the development of systems and applications software.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian computer industry will benefit from the Government's recent decision to give preference to Australian products in government purchases of microelectronic equipment and other high technology goods. Moreover, the broader question of assistance to the computer industry will be referred to the IAC by early 1982 to provide time for a review of assistance measures prior to the expiration of the ADP Bounty Act in 1984.</PARA>
<PARA> At the technical level, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has established a research group to develop integrated circuits which exploit more fully the potential for miniaturisation of electronic components. If successful, the results will greatly assist Australian industry in gaining a share of the burgeoning range of applications for microelectronic technologies.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government also expects to receive in the near future, a report from the Australian Science and Technology Council on the microelectronics industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator will recall that the Government has appropriated nearly $50m for industrial research and development incentives in 1981-82. In this regard, computer manufacturing companies are eligible to receive grants under the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act. Of the $23m provided under the Act in 1979-80 for project grants, nearly $1m was allocated directly for Industrial R&amp;D in the fields of computing and microelectronics. Under recent amendments to the IR&amp;D Incentives Act, computer software research and development is also eligible for project grant assistance. However, such activities must relate directly to the development of new products or new or improved processes employed in manufacturing, mining or certain on-site construction operations. In addition, further $1.9m was spent in the fields of computing and microelectronics under the public interest provision of the IR&amp;D Incentives Act and through Industry Productivity Improvement Programs administered by the Department of Science and Technology.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also assisted in promoting community awareness of the benefits and opportunites offered by high technology products. An example of this is Information Technology Week which was sponsored by the Department of Science and Technology in conjunction with the Australian Computer Society during August this year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 September 1981 (Hansard, page 981), Senator Primmer asked me the following question, without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry in the Senate:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) Has the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry noticed media reports of the discovery of further meat switching at a Melbourne meat works?</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Is the company named-Steigers Meat Supply Pty Ltd of Northcote-the same company mentioned by me on 8 March 1978?</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Had the company prior to March 1978 been the subject of a police investigation over allegations of a similar nature?</PARA>
<PARA> (d) What, if any, Department of Primary Industry surveillance has been kept on the company in the intervening years?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The incident reported in the media concerned the cancellation of the export registration of Steigers Meat Supply (Aust) Pty Ltd (No. 775) on 23 September following the detection of horsemeat in product labelled Establishment No. 775. All product was impounded and the Australian Federal Police asked to investigate.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Steigers was one of the companies mentioned in a report by the then Commonwealth Police. This investigation was requested by my Department following wide-ranging allegations in June 1977 by Mr J. Gilbertson, Chairman of the Meat Exporters Association of Victoria and Mr W. Curran, Secretary of the Victorian Branch of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union that meat from non-export works was being exported. No specific allegation was made of species substitution. As a consequence of these investigations, Mr G. Egan of Bambra Export Pty Ltd was convicted of offences under the Customs Act.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) In early 1979, the number of full time inspectors supervising the operations of Steigers was increased from one to two. Inspectors allocated to Steigers have been selected because of their experience in boning operations and were instructed to be alert to any indicators of illegal activity. Although allegations have been made in the past, investigations of the premises by inspection staff during pre-operational hygiene inspection over a long period have failed to reveal any indications of out-of-hours activity.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 14 October 1981 (Hansard, page 1163) Senator Robertson asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In view of the meeting of the International Bauxite Association in Australia this month will the Minister put down a statement on this country's policy towards the IBA's objective of a uniform price for bauxite? In the statement will the Minister reconcile the policy towards the IBA with the Government's public commitment to the North-South dialogue?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Trade and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The objectives of the International Bauxite Association are set out in the Agreement establishing the Association. The objectives do not include any reference to the development of a uniform price for bauxite. For the information of senators, the objectives embodied in the Agreement which Australia ratified in 1974 are:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to promote the orderly and rational development of the bauxite industry;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to secure for member countries fair and reasonable returns from the exploitation, processing and marketing of bauxite and its products for the economic and social development of their peoples, bearing in mind the recognised interests of consumers;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) generally to safeguard the interests of member countries in relation to the bauxite industry.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's attitude on pricing of bauxite and alumina are set out in the Minister's Media Release of 8 January 1979.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's consistent policies on the pricing of mineral exports are well known and are not considered to be contrary to the Government's commitment to the North-South dialogue, nor are they considered to be out of line with the objectives of the International Bauxite Association.</PARA>

<PARA> Is the Minister aware that it was reported in the Queensland Press that the Australian Workers Union is about to rejoin the new guard of the Labor Party? It was also stated in the same Press article that the AWU would pay a $50,000 fee to rejoin the Labor Party. Will the Treasurer assure the Senate that tax will be paid on this money by either the AWU or the Labor Party? Further, will the Treasurer consult with his colleague the Minister for Industrial Relations to ensure that all rank and file members of the AWU are agreeable to this money being paid to the Australian Labor Party?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that, because of the secrecy provisions of the income tax law, he is unable to provide information concerning the payment of tax by particular organisations. By way of general comment, however, the Commissioner advised that the income of all bodies or associations corporate or unincorporate is liable to tax but section 23 (f) of the Income Tax Assessment Act specifically exempts the income of a trade union and the income of an association of employees or employers registered under any Commonwealth or State Act, or under any law in force in a Territory being part of Australia relating to the settlement of industrial disputes.</PARA>
