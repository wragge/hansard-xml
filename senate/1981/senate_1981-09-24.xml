<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate, in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned at proposed future hydro-electric developments in South West Tasmania. As this area is on the Register of the National Estate it is therefore of national concern and your petitioners humbly call upon the Senate to conduct a Senate inquiry into South West Tasmania. A Federal inquiry has been recommended by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation.</PARA>
<PARA>Your petitioners therefore humbly call upon the Federal Parliament not to allocate funds or allow funds to be raised for development of roads or dams in the South West of Tasmania but rather to provide such funds as would enable the preservation of this area. This is a national issue and therefore Tasmanians should not be made to bear any financial burden resulting from its preservation.</PARA>

<PARA> To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the projected repeal by the Queensland State Government of the Aborigines Act 1971-1979 and the Torres Strait Islander Act 1971-1979 will almost certainly lead to the degazettal of all Aboriginal reserves in Queensland, as happened with Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>
<PARA> That, if the Aboriginal communities from these reserves are placed under similar shire council legislation on fifty year leases, they will be exposed to serious encroachment on their land by mining and tourist interests.</PARA>
<PARA> That, on past evidence, these interests will clearly have the full backing of the Queensland Government and the rights of Aboriginal people to land rights and self-management will not be granted by that Government.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Commonwealth Government has the constitutional power to legislate and acquire land for Aboriginal people since the amendments to the Constitution in 1967, but it is your Petitioners' sincere belief that it has already failed in its duty before the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Aboriginal people of Queensland have stated that they want land rights and self-management.</PARA>
<PARA> Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should make use of its constitutional and legislative powers to grant full land rights and self-management to the Aboriginal people of Queensland.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Social Security.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Acting Minister for Health. Has the Minister received a request from the South Australian Health Minister, Mrs Jennifer Adamson, for the Commonwealth to assist with funding for an initial three-year period of the provision of a resident family visitor, through the Child, Adolescent and Family Service, to be stationed at Mount Gambier in South Australia? As there is an urgent need for the provision of a family visitor who would be working in close co-operation with the parents of children with special needs, general practitioners and other professional people, I further ask: If there has been no such request from the South Australian Minister, will the Minister treat my question as an urgent request from the many concerned parents living at Mount Gambier and in surrounding districts for the provision of this much needed and worthwhile service?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly as Acting Minister for Health I have not received a request of the kind to which the honourable senator referred. Whether the Minister whom I represent had previously received such a request I am not able to say at this time. I imagine that South Australia would be concerned if there were people in the Mount Gambier area with special needs. I imagine that the State of South Australia would be looking at ways in which it could order its own priorities, in the light of available funds, to meet those priorities as it thought best. The new arrangements made by the Commonwealth will give the States greater flexibility in the use of funds provided for health matters. If no request has been received I say to the honourable senator that his question would serve to put me on notice, but in fact it would require a formal request from the State Minister before I could assume that South Australia had asked in any official way for this service to be provided.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Acting Minister for Health and draw his attention to an article which appeared in the Australian of 10 September relating to an address given by Dr Trefor Morgan of Melbourne's Repatriation Hospital to a scientific meeting of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. Will the Minister comment on this report and, in particular, Dr Morgan's claim that about 70 per cent of our community has an excessive salt intake? Does the Minister agree that the use of salt in foodstuffs must be more carefully controlled in an effort to reduce excessive salt intake and the risk of hypertension within the community? If so, what action has been taken by the Government to alert the community to the dangers of excessive salt consumption? What consideration will be given by the Government to introducing legislation similar to that currently being studied by the Reagan Administration, which requires the salt content of food to be shown on containers?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="979" SPEAKER="Baume Sen The Hon P.E." NAMEID="ME4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the doctor to whom Senator Missen is referring is Dr Trefor Morgan, who came from the golden year of medicine at Sydney University. He is an expert in hypertension. I have seen the article. The matter of salt intake is important, and its relationship to the development of hypertension is being better understood. It is presently under consideration by a working party of the National Health and Medical Research Council, which is working on the general subject of sodium in the Australian diet. Dr Morgan is the chairman of that working party, which is currently finalising its report for presentation to the National Health and Medical Research Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Without wishing to pre-empt any recommendations that may be contained in the working party's report, I can say that most Australians consume an excessive amount of sodium, usually in the form of salt-sodium chloride. There is a growing concern about the excessive consumption of salt in the Australian diet as sodium has been linked to the development of high blood pressure in susceptible persons. I understand that those susceptible persons are estimated to constitute up to 20 per cent of the Australian population. The importance of high blood pressure is as it relates to strokes and other diseases of the cardiovascular system. Notwithstanding that the relationship between salt intake and high blood pressure has not been established absolutely, I do agree that Australians should moderate and reduce their intake of salt and that the matter of more adequately controlling the use of salt in foodstuffs such as bread should be examined. The Department of Health has taken action to alert the community to the dangers of excessive salt intake. The Department's well-publicised food and nutrition policy recommends a reduction in the community's intake of salt. The Department has also drawn up a set of eight dietary guidelines for Australia to improve the nutritional health of the community. One of these is to reduce the intake of salt. A publication Dietary Guidelines for Australians, which includes advice to the community to use less salt and gives practical suggestions as to how this can be achieved, is presently being printed.</PARA>
<PARA> As to whether we should insist on the declaration of salt content on packaged foods, the National Health and Medical Research Council has already recommended that ingredients of packaged foods should be declared on the label, in descending order of proportion. The recommendation includes a requirement as to the declaration of added salt and has been referred to the States and Territories for adoption. Indeed, several States have already incorporated the recommendations in State food regulations. The question of the declaring of the specific sodium content of packaged foods, as suggested by Senator Missen, is presently under consideration by expert committees of the National Health and Medical Research Council. Obviously, the recommendations from the Council, coming from a Federal body, are a matter for consideration by individual States and Territories, as to possible incorporation in State legislation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LF4">Senator COATES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for National Development and Energy. What is the Government doing to settle the dispute between technical and supervisory staff of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority and the Public Service Board over the payment of a $17 power station allowance? Is the Minister aware that as a result of the dispute no maintenance has been carried out on power station plant for six weeks and that if plant breaks down it will not be repaired? Is the Minister also aware that a continuance of the dispute will mean that there will be no flood control of the record snow melt-off and that already water is being wasted and power output is presently down by 25 per cent? In view of the urgency of this matter and the fact that the New South Wales and Victorian State Electricity Commissions cannot now close down plant for maintenance, will the Minister use his best endeavours with the Public Service Board to ensure that this dispute is settled with expedition?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If, indeed, the whole community used its best endeavours to encourage the officers involved to lift their bans-a significant omission from the honourable senator's question-the dispute would have been before the arbitral authorities and would be settled by now. The real nub of the problem is that those who believe in the arbitral processes should say to those who have imposed the bans: 'You have access to the settlement of your dispute straight away. If you will lift your bans and carry out a normal day's work, the arbitral authorities have undertaken to consider the matter immediately'. I emphasise that point. The matter has been before the Public Service Board; it has been before the arbitrators. It is a tragedy that there should be a dispute at all. It is utterly competent for the matter to be dealt with in a civilised way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is perfectly true, as Senator Coates has said, that as a result of the dispute there has been a 25 per cent decline in the output of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority, but that decline is not because of any lack of capacity in the arbitral process. It is because workers are still imposing bans. I believe that, as with Mr Gallagher and the Builders Labourers Federation, we should look at the real problem. I do not want in any way to exacerbate the situation. I believe that it ought not to have occurred. I say to those in the community who are concerned with this dispute, and to the officers involved in it: 'Lift your bans. You have the arbitral process in place. It will be settled'. There is no doubt in the world that it is a very bad thing for Australia to be losing this capacity. I have never believed that a handful of people, however right or wrong their dispute, have the right to hold the rest of Australia to ransom on such matters. Because of their ability to reduce the capacity of the scheme, to alter the flow of water and to offer some threat of flooding if there were to be a heavy melt-off, they must take on themselves a very heavy responsibility in terms of their behaviour. When these kinds of disputes are mentioned in this place we ought to state both sides of the equation. The Australian community is one community; it is not polarised.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and concerns the call of the Minister for Transport for all local and international vessels in Australian ports to dress ship tomorrow for World Maritime Day. Is the Minister aware of reports that Panama may ban Australian registered ships from the Panama Canal because of Australian union bans on ships of its registry? Is the Minister aware of the supplement to the Daily Commercial News dealing with strike status in Australia? Is the Minister aware that that report on Australian strikes has now reached three pages in length and lists 113 strikes in Australia which are either current or pending and that those strikes are creating great disruption to Australian trade and commerce? Finally, in the light of those circumstances, will the Minister consider instructing Australian ships not to dress ship tomorrow but to wear their flags at half-mast as a warning that irresponsible militant trade union action is destroying our shipping industry?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that the Government is very concerned about the situation in the maritime industry, particularly the problems occurring at the moment with the maritime engineers. Certainly the difficulties facing Australian shipping as a result of the strikes to which Senator Lewis referred are creating significant difficulties for Australian industry and no doubt are having significant economic effects, not only in the short run but also in the longer run. Senator Lewis referred in particular to the 113 strikes which are current or pending in the maritime industry. Those, of course, are damaging in the extreme to our industrial situation. Senator Lewis was concerned about the dressing of ships. I think we can address ourselves to that matter by remembering tomorrow what difficulties those problems are causing to Australian industry. It is of the greatest importance that I refer the question to the Minister and obtain an early reply for Senator Lewis. In fact, I will endeavour to obtain some immediate information about the Minister's attitude to the strike situation before the end of Question Time today.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans was courteous enough to give me just before Question Time, or some time this morning, a copy of the question he planned to ask. I have been able to obtain a copy of the answer to question on notice No. 253 and to study that answer. I have not been able to obtain the other papers in the time available. Senator Evans referred to a letter of 22 October 1980 written by one of the acting area officers of that time. The reply which I gave to Senator Evans in answer to the question on notice outlines the approach that my Department takes in these matters. That is the position. I made it clear that there are difficulties in providing fixed capital improvements where the groups do not live on reserves or where they do not have security of tenure. The reason is obvious and I think it was set out in the answer: If in fact we provide fixed improvements they become the property of those who own the land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I indicated also that the Aboriginal Development Commission was considering an application for land from the Kroonull Community. I will ask my Department to provide me with the other papers which have been referred to by Senator Evans. If those papers were talking about a request for assistance for fixed improvements, a reply in the terms quoted would be consistent with the Department's approach. If the request was for other forms of aid, it would not be consistent.

At that time-I think this is correct-the kinds of procedures that take place were made known to the committee. I might say that, in some of the communities in which I move, when there are expressions of concern about the presentation of some material on this form of radio it is generally seen to be the non-Labor side that is disadvantaged. I think the perception of disadvantage may depend upon the position from which one comes. Many people may have a slightly paranoid view of the way in which any news is presented.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose that my question to the Acting Minister for Health follows somewhat on the answer the Minister gave about salt a little while ago. However, it relates to something a little different. The Minister may remember that on previous occasions I have asked whether the Government would request State governments to require by law that the percentage of alcohol in alcoholic drinks be put on the labels of the bottles in which they are contained. Has the Minister any up to date knowledge of the present situation? I ask this question because many people who choose to drink alcoholic drinks would like to know the strength of the drink they are consuming. I realise full well that, if the percentage of alcohol were put on the label, some people might choose a very strong drink instead of a very weak one; but I still think it would be an advantage because it does appear from the total quantity of light beer that is being consumed that many people in this country wish to consume alcoholic drinks which have a low alcohol percentage.</PARA></TALK.START>

The benefit that flows to the consumers in the long run from knowing exactly what products they are purchasing and the constituents or components of those products is one against which I do not argue. The recommendations of the National Health and Medical Research Council, to which I referred earlier, related to the labelling of food packages. As far as I know-but I can check this point-they did not relate to the labelling of alcoholic beverages. I can certainly undertake to find out whether there is more up to date information on this matter. I agree with Senator Townley that if people did know in detail about the products they were consuming they could choose either one with a greater content or one with a lesser content of any particular component.</PARA></TALK.START>

Further, would it be possible for those Druids contributors subsequently to be paid out of this pool?

These regulations ensure that the funds which operate today are operating in a way that is to the benefit of contributors. For example, it is essential that funds are not able to announce unrealistically low contribution rates that might lead to the failure or closure of the funds. We had a problem not so long ago when Medibank Private announced some rates which had not been approved. Medibank Private had to revise its rates as a result of its being required to follow proper procedures. All these procedures are designed to serve the benefits of contributors.</PARA></TALK.START>

I will pass on the honourable senator's suggestion for a commission of inquiry, but I am not certain that that is the best way to ensure what I am sure he is after, that is, that contributors to health insurance funds be protected and secure in obtaining the protection they are seeking through health insurance.</PARA>

Secondly, no doubt the Minister is aware that often families with young children need several prescriptions for, say, two children, which at the moment amount to quite a sum of money.

They are doing this as they fear that the amounts which they have in their bank accounts may prevent them from continuing to receive a full rate age pension because of new legislation which has been suggested in this Parliament. The Minister would be aware that if age pensioners hold large sums of money in their homes they run the risk of having their savings stolen, and perhaps even face the risk of personal injuries from someone who assails them to steal their money.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not had reports of the sort that the honourable senator refers to in his question. I certainly agree with him that it is most undesirable for aged people in particular to have large sums of money in their homes because, obviously, that is a temptation to people who might wish to get access to that money. It would be a serious matter. The announcement which I made on the night of the presentation of the Budget was that the Government would be strengthening the legislation which already exists in the social security area and which provides that deprivation of income for the purpose of obtaining pension can be taken into account by the Director-General in assessing the rate of pension. That matter is still under detailed consideration. In light of the honourable senator's comments I will ensure that the earliest possible announcements are made, which will calm fears. I would say-and I think this is quite clear-that the Government's intention is to aim at artificial schemes which have been mushrooming of late.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always a wise course for any honourable senator to make sure that something has occurred before asserting that it has. The Government has given no such instructions at all. That part of the question as asked is, of course, without merit. I understand that the police had issued some instructions, which were police instructions. The Commonwealth Government has made it perfectly clear that where human life is concerned, whether a person is an ordinary Australian or a top dignitary in the world, he or she has equal rights to his or her safety and dignity. Let me repeat: There will be no question of giving priority of safety or protection of any kind in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, let me address myself to the question of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. The first thing that has to be an assumption is that Australia, as one of the 43 member nations of the Commonwealth, ought to regard it as a tribute to be the host country. Secondly, in a democracy it ought to be our proud responsibility and our privilege to ensure the best facilities for the people and their total protection. Quite clearly if we are to have 43 nations with all their entourages, with all the accommodation that is necessary-perhaps some thousands of actual bedded accommodations-and with all the infrastructure, we are asking of necessity for the meeting to be held in a major city. Therefore, I am utterly surprised that anyone would query why Australia would not hold CHOGM in a major city of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> I turn to why the Meeting is being held in Melbourne. It is to the eternal discredit of a section of mankind that terrorism today walks largely in an uncivilised way across the world scene. It is to our eternal discredit that in a democracy we have to take steps that we ordinarily would not take to ensure that the greater or lesser people of this world may walk the scene with their lives safe and secure. On that basis we accept the responsibility of holding the conference, we accept the need to hold it in a major city and we are proud to bring 43 heads of government together to talk about major things such as world hunger and the North-South dialogue. I thought that, instead of looking at pimples on our nose, the thrust would have been: 'Is it not good that we are facing up to the great problems of mankind?' I think we ought to be ambassadors promoting the success of this conference instead of nit-picking.</PARA>
<PARA> We will certainly give equal protection to all human beings who walk in this country. Nevertheless, the police in the compass of terrorism have to make major decisions from time to time involving human lives. Honourable senators should have some sympathy for the decision-making responsibilities of the police in such a situation. We should, as the main target of our attack, be rejecting the ugliness of terrorism.</PARA>

For instance, if a machine were bought last year but such a purchase would not be required this year, the amount was adjusted. In other words, the 3 per cent reduction in this item is a reconciled figure of the one-off situations that occurred last year and not this year and what may be required this year; for instance, a contracted arrangement for some machinery, fittings or something that is required this year. The Department of Finance, when looking at the requirements of each department, took into account these items that had a special application in one year or the other.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague Senator Baume has indicated, as was mentioned by the honourable senator, that assistance is being given to this program through the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. It may be that that particular program has been brought to my attention; I am not absolutely sure. I am not particularly embarrassed by that. Only last week I received advice from, I think, the Social Welfare Research Centre of the University of New South Wales that there are in Australia 37,000 voluntary organisations performing good works in the social welfare field. I find it difficult to keep in touch with them all. I believe that Senator Peter Baume has only 1,000 organisations which are funded through the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. The question raises a serious issue. Petrol sniffing is a problem in a number of isolated Aboriginal communities. It is one which, as I know from experience in my previous portfolio, does not lend itself to either easy diagnosis or easy treatment. In other words, some quite similar communities have problems with petrol sniffing; others do not. The people whom I have met and talked with, who have worked in this field, seem uncertain about the precise ways in which best to deal with it. That is not to say, however, that it is not of great value to have people in the field making an effort concerning it. I will ask my Department to check what applications have been received from that particular organisation. I have some passing recollection of a reference to a petrol sniffing project.

I have a copy of the Prime Minister's comments made a week ago at Question Time in the other place. The points made by the Prime Minister in response to a question asked by Mr Lionel Bowen are these:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is some information that I can give the honourable gentleman. The honourable gentleman will know from earlier indications that have been given in the Parliament since Tony Joyce was shot in November of 1979 that representations to the Zambian Government have been made on a number of occasions. I wrote to President Kaunda on the day on which news of the shooting was received seeking information. Subsequently, the Acting Foreign Minister wrote to his Zambian counterpart to establish the outcome of investigations undertaken by the Zambian authorities. Tony Joyce was a fine man and a credit to his profession. His death was a great loss. We were all concerned, naturally, to know how and why this tragedy occurred. Earlier this year President Kaunda wrote to me personally about the matter. The President pointed out that Zambia was under attack at this time from Rhodesia. As a result Zambian military and security units were deployed to guard economic and strategically important installations throughout the country, working under highly explosive and very difficult conditions. Movement within the country was restricted and under security control. Investigations conducted by Zambia have not identified the individual or individuals responsible for the shooting. There are different accounts of what happened. It seems unlikely, because of the difficulty and uncertain circumstances prevailing at the time, that the issue will ever be fully resolved.</PARA>
<PARA> In his letter to me President Kaunda very sincerely expressed his regret that Tony Joyce, who was merely carrying out his normal duties, was caught up in this unfortunate situation and lost his life on Zambian soil. I spoke to Mrs Joyce at the time of Tony Joyce's death and conveyed the Australian Government's condolences and my deep personal regret. Since I received President Kaunda's letter I have spoken to Mrs Joyce again and conveyed the sentiments expressed by the President. Tony Joyce's death has been a matter of great sorrow for his family and his friends and I am sure that all honourable members would join with me in expressing again our sincere sympathy to Mrs Joyce.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the Prime Minister's comment which I think covers the points that were raised. I think the honourable senator asked whether this matter could be raised again at the meetings next week. I think, in view of the correspondence and the communications between the President and the Prime Minister, that such an approach would not take the matter any further than the response of the Prime Minister last week was able to do.</PARA>

The ACTU has sought a full return to work to allow negotiations to proceed or at least a lifting of the bans on oil supply vessels. Additional exemptions have been given by the marine engineers in this regard. The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has been heavily involved-again, I indicated that in response to honourable senators' questions yesterday and today-in seeking a resolution of this very damaging dispute. The Government continues to support the Commission in its endeavours and to urge all parties to accept its rulings.

Copies of the card will be issued on request and there will be no need for dependants to justify their need.

<PARA> I would like to clarify the situation which currently applies to migrants. At the moment new migrants are required to apply for a card. Arrangements are in train for overseas posts of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, which is responsible for the issue of migrant visas, to provide, at the same time as the issue of a visa, an application form for a health card. On the presentation of this form to a regional office of the Department of Social Security in Australia a card will automatically be issued. These arrangements should be in operation at overseas posts in four weeks time. With respect to that matter, and the lesser degree of the automaticity of the application of the card, the problem is that the Government does not supervise the date of entry of migrants. It does, of course, control the issue of visas but those visas, once issued, are open for a considerable period and the migrant makes his or her own decision about method and time of entry. For that reason it is necessary for the application to be lodged on arrival in Australia so that the full six-month entitlement can be obtained.</PARA>

The Government's welfare housing programs are directed at the needy who unfortunately cannot gain access to housing on the private market. That those policies are working is evidenced by the waiting list for public market housing which now stands at about 86,000, compared with about 104,000 in June 1975.</PARA>
<PARA> As is usual at Budget time, there has been extensive lobbying for additional funds for welfare housing, including representations by the Victorian Minister of Housing.</PARA>
<PARA> These representations do not adequately recognise that welfare housing is a joint Commonwealth-State responsibility and that the States can, if they wish, use their general revenue funds made available by the Commonwealth to their welfare housing programs, where they see this as a priority.</PARA>
<PARA> While full details are not yet available from all States, it is clear that some States have increased their Budget outlays on housing and, most importantly, are further developing innovative schemes such as interest subsidies to make more effective use of available funds.</PARA>
<PARA> I also remind the honourable senator that States have available to them surpluses and revolving funds arising from past Commonwealth involvement in the operation of their housing programs, which are estimated to be a further $160 million in 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is not considering increasing funds available for welfare housing. It announced that it is providing $262.2 million in 1981-82 and this amount is set out in the Budget documents.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth's allocation for funding for welfare housing, combined with the resources available to the States for welfare housing, and the policies contained in the 1981 Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, are a responsible package aimed at efficiently providing the needy with decent housing.</PARA>

First of all, I just say that I did not make that statement. What I did say-and I stand by it-is that next we will be able to export radioactive beef to America. The reference to radioactive hamburgers was a flair from the pen of a very talented journalist. In answer to the question, Mr Nixon said that I would be better off going back to Breakfast Creek and having a couple of drinks. I believe the statement by Mr Nixon does very little for his portfolio and very little for the other place. In relation to the matter that was raised I do wish to validate the point that I made in relation to exporting radioactive beef.

Secondly, the Wardens Court in Charters Towers took evidence. In summing up the evidence, the Warden said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Stockpiling of ore will present a problem if there is exposure to the weather with subsequent leaching of toxic substances into the environment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish also to incorporate in Hansard the Warden's report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Application has been made by Minatome Australia Pty Ltd for a Mining Lease No. 893 over an area of 2035 hectares situated at Ben Lomond East in the Charters Towers Gold and Mineral Field, for the purpose of mining for Uranium, Molybdenum, Copper, Lead, Zinc and Silver and also for the carrying on of mining operations. The applicant already holds a Mining Lease No.827 over an area of 128 hectares at the site, which was granted on 27th March 1980. Since 5th August 1975 the applicant has held an Authority to Prospect No. 1543M over an area which encompasses both M.L. 827 and M.L.A. 893. </PARA>
<PARA> An objection to such Application has been lodged in accordance with Section 21 (8) of the Mining Act by Adrian JEFFRIES on behalf of the Townsville Regional Conservation Council on the following grounds-</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Until it can be shown that it is in the public interest to grant a mineral lease over the area, no such lease should be recommended. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Impact Assessment Study for the proposed mining development which was produced by Minatome Australia Pty Ltd in relation to Mining Lease Application No. 827 is an inadequate document which contains insufficient information upon which to base a proper assessment of the impact of this proposal. As the Federal Government is currently examining this proposal, any hearing with respect to this Mining Lease Application should be adjourned until the company produces an environmental impact statement that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. The toxic and noxious wastes from the proposed mine will have a deleterious effect on the surrounding environment and on the health and well being of mine workers. In particular it will render unusable a significant portion of the Charters Towers Gold and Mineral Field for use by future prospectors and adventurers due to the presence of long term dangerous waste products. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. That it is not in the public interest that a lease be granted permitting the mining of uranium until such time that it is shown that the processing, distribution, uses and disposal of the mined product do not cause unacceptable deterioration in public health and the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. The granting of the said mining lease will result in a diminution of outdoor recreation and environmental education resources already scarce in the Townsville area. </PARA>
<PARA>The applicant's purpose of obtaining this Lease is for the establishment of the major facilities associated with the mining treatment plant for the treatment of the ore mined from M.L. 827. Also for the construction of access roads, dams, water supply, power line, storage dams, evaporation ponds and pipelines thereto and storage sites for tailings. The area applied for also covers part of the ore body which extends beyond M.L. 827. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 21 (9) of the Mining Act provides that . . . the Wardens Court shall hear and determine the application . . . together with any and every objection lodged in the manner prescribed . . . and that the determination of the Wardens Court upon an application shall consist of a recomendation to the Minister as to whether the application should be granted or rejected in whole or in part. </PARA>
<PARA> Numerous witnesses have been called on behalf of the Applicant and the Objector, many of whom appeared well qualified in respect of opinions expressed. The hearing has extended over ten days and an inspection of the site was carried out by helicopter and motor vehicle. There were numerous exhibits tendered by both sides. </PARA>
<PARA> The case of John Sinclair v. The Mining Warden at Maryborough and Anor, clearly sets out the functions of the Warden in matters such as this. In my opinion the applicant has complied with all the formalities contained in the Mining Act and Regulations preliminary to the hearing in the Wardens Court. I do not consider that any irregularity exists in the making or lodgment of the application or in the marking out of the land applied for, that may give rise to any consideration by me that the application should be rejected under the provisions of Section 21 (11) (a). </PARA>
<PARA> Mere compliance with the formalities of course is not enough and I must satisfy myself on the material before me that the application is one proper for the recomendation of the granting of a Lease. The application covers an area of land which is mainly to be used in the treatment process, and for roads, pipelines, dams, ponds and the like. It also covers an extension of the ore body to the east of M.L. 827. The operation envisaged is a very large one, the shape of the area applied for is very irregular and appears to include only the area reasonably necessary for the mining operation. I am satisfied that the applicant has fully justified the application for such a large area as is covered by the application. </PARA>
<PARA> The grounds set out in the objection overlap in some respects. I am satisfied in relation to ground 1 that the applicant has established that the granting of the lease will be of economic benefit to the community. Of course in the overall assessment of the public interest the benefits provided must be weighed against the detriments, if any, to be caused by the mining operation. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to ground 2 of the objection it is clear that the final detailed engineering planning for the proposed operation has not yet been completed and that the design is in the conceptual state only. The Environmental Impact Study (Exhibit 3) lacks detail and according to the evidence changes have occurred since its preparation in matters such as increased production, alteration in the water management scheme and changes to the treatment process. The proposals for the mining and milling operations are set out in Exhibit 10 and in the evidence of Mr Folwell, Operations Manager. Such proposals have been attacked by the Objector for their lack of engineering detail and the lack of hydrological and geological study which the objector contends is essential before it can be shown that it is feasible to permanently isolate from the environment all dangerous substances produced from the mining operation. It appears to me that the Environmental Impact Study required under Federal Legislation should be available for study before any decision is made on the granting of a Lease. </PARA>
<PARA> Ground 3 of the objection covers three heads-namely any deleterious effects on the surrounding environment, and on the health and well being of mine workers, and the rendering unusable for use by future prospectors and adventurers of a significant portion of the Charters Towers Gold and Mineral Field. There have been tendered in evidence-a copy of the Code of Practice on Radiation Protection in the Mining and Milling of Radioactive Ores-1980, copies of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry Reports, a copy of Rules and Regulations drawn up by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the United States of America in October 1980 which sets out licensing requirements for uranium and thorium milling activities including tailings and wastes generated from these activities. The latter of course do nor represent the law in Australia. In so far as the environment is concerned the proposed method of milling and the disposal of tailings and wastes and their eventual isolation, and the stabilization and rehabilitation of the area appear to conform with conventional requirements. Doubts have been cast by the Objector and the witnesses called on the ability of the Applicant to successfully carry out such proposals in this particular area having regard to some of the unique qualities of the site. The lack of hydrogeological study of the area has been pointed out, and evidence called to show that faulting and fracturing is abundant in the area. This has not been denied by the applicants witnesses who contend that such studies will take place at a later stage when more detailed engineering will take place. The objector has called evidence to show the unsuitability of the clay in the area for use as a sealer in the Evaporation Ponds and Tailing dumps, and also to encapsulate those areas in their final stabilisation. Evidence of the highly erosive quality of the country has been given and of the exceptionally high rainfalls which might be expected from time to time, which it is contended by the Objector would render stabilisation of contaminated wastes and tailings over a very long term impracticable. There is some doubt as to the identity and quality of all the toxic materials which might be expected to accumulate in the Evaporation Ponds during the life time of the mining operation. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears that there must be some seepage or leakage from the Evaporation Ponds whilst they contain water during the mining operation, and that there is also danger of movement of water through the residue in the Evaporation Ponds when mining is finished and through tailings which have been placed in the dump and the open pit. It appears to me that only detailed hydrological and geological study can provide the necessary information on which to base any decision as to the suitability of the sites for the establishment of the Evaporation Ponds and tailing dumps. As to the long term isolation of tailings and wastes it also appears that such study is essential. </PARA>
<PARA> I am satisfied that proper safeguards exist for the protection of the health and well-being of miners engaged in uranium mining such as is proposed and I do not consider that there is any evidence that the proposed mining will have any deleterious effect on the health and well-being of miners engaged therein so long as the Code of Practice is adhered to and all safeguards as provided by relative legislation are taken. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no evidence of any great degree of prospecting activity in the area. The old Argentine workings are some kilometres away. The only areas which could contain long term wastes after mining would be the area of the Evaporation Ponds of some 60 hectares and the area of the tailings dumps and waste rock dump. Considering the extent of the Charters Towers Gold and Mineral Field (which I have calculated at some 3000 square miles) I consider that the area rendered unusable for use by future prospectors and adventurers due to the presence of dangerous wastes would be insignificant. </PARA>
<PARA> I consider that part of ground 4 of the Objection (dealing with the processing of the mined product) is dealt with under ground 3. In so far as the remainder of this ground of objection is concerned in my opinion there is no evidence that the distribution, uses and disposal of the mined product would cause unacceptable deterioration in public health and the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to ground 5 of the objection, the area applied for is very inaccessible and in very mountainous and rough terrain and I cannot see that there will be any real diminution of outdoor recreation and environmental education resources. According to the evidence it is Keelbottom Creek and its environs which are the popular areas frequented by the public and by student groups and these areas are not included in the Lease application. I think that there would be a valid ground for objection under this head only if there was pollution from the mining operations of the creeks and environment in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Having dealt with each particular ground of objection and the conclusions I have drawn on the evidence in respect of each ground it remains to consider the public interest. Clearly the evidence for the Objector has been directed to the public interest not only for the conservation of the area for various public uses but also to ensure that mining operations do not in any way pollute or contaminate the environment generally, the creek systems that drain the area of the mining operations and ultimately the Burdekin River into which the creek systems drain. </PARA>
<PARA> Evidence has been given of the possible movement of toxic metals through groundwater systems and through creek systems, and it seems that no limits can be placed on their possible ultimate destination, except that they would tend to accumulate at weirs and dams. The evidence of the Objectors witnesses does not clearly demonstrate to any accurate degree the quantity of toxic metals or wastes which may escape into the creek systems or the potential threat posed by them. On the other hand the applicant's witnesses have not satisfied me that there will be no escape of any toxic substances, or that any escape would be so negligible as to pose no danger to the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> In his Judgment in the case of Sinclair v. The Mining Warden at Maryborough and Another, Gibbs J. said ''For example a warden may recommend against an application not because he has formed the opinion that the public interest will be prejudicially affected but because he considers that the public interest might be prejudicially affected and that in all the circumstances of the case the application should not be granted until it is possible to say whether the effect of granting it will be prejudicial or not.'' This I feel is the position here. On the evidence I am left in some doubt on the following matters-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The suitability of the site for the Evaporation Ponds, the site of the tailings dump and the open pit as a site for a tailing dump because of the lack of detailed geological and hydrological study to determine the potential of such sites for seepage or leakage of toxic materials into groundwater or nearby creek systems. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) The availability and suitability of clay which may be required as a liner in seepage control, should the necessary study prove such control necessary, and of the clay required for encapsulation of the residue sludge of the Evaporation Ponds and of the tailings dumps, taking into consideration the erosive nature of the country and the size of the area to be lined and sealed off from the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) The possibility of effective long term isolation of any toxic materials contained in the residue sludge of the Evaporation Ponds and in the tailings dumps, taking into consideration the erosive nature of the country, the extremely high rainfall that might be expected in the area particularly during the cyclonic season, and the absence of any ongoing active maintenance during the hundreds of years after mining ceases. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) The quantity and description of all toxic materials likely to be generated by the mining and treatment process and deposited in the tailings dumps and Evaporation Ponds, and the likelihood of danger to the environment which would be caused by any escape of toxic material whether by leakage, seepage or otherwise, and the extent of pollution or contamination likely to be caused in the creeks in the area and in the Burdekin River. </PARA>
<PARA> I am of the opinion that the public interest or right may be prejudicially affected if the Mining Lease is granted at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> This application covers an area where the ore body located in M.L. 827 extends beyond that lease, as well as areas for access roads, power supply, water supply and other facilities connected with the treatment plant. There has already been exploratory mining carried out on M.L. 827 and samples of ore have been stockpiled in the area. I can see no real objection to the mining of ore in this locality and the grant of a Lease over the area containing the extension of the ore body, and other areas for facilities for mining purposes only. Stockpiling of ore will present a problem if there is exposure to the weather with subsequent leaching of toxic substances into the environment. However it is my opinion that it is the treatment of ore in this area and the long term storage of tailings and residues in the area which drains into Keelbottom Creek and ultimately the Burdekin River which are the main matters for concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I recommend to the Minister that this application be rejected in so far as it relates to the areas to be used for the Evaporation Ponds, and tailings dump and the treatment plant and facilities pertaining thereto. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to inform the Senate that Mr Harold Gibson Weir has ceased to hold the office of Commonwealth Parliamentary Librarian. Mr Weir has been absent from duty since early July this year and, on the recommendation of the Commonwealth Medical Officer, is currently on sick leave pending retirement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Weir was first recruited to the Commonwealth Public Service in August 1965 when he joined the Department of Labour and National Service. His first appointment to the parliamentary service was in January 1968 when he joined the Staff of the Department of the Parliamentary Library to establish the Education and Welfare group of the Legislative Research Service. Under his direction that group became a highly effective element in the research service.</PARA>
<PARA> In June 1973 Mr Weir left to take up a position with the Institute of Criminology where he was subsequently promoted to Secretary of the Institute. He returned to the Parliamentary Library in August 1976 as Assistant Parliamentary Librarian and was appointed Parliamentary Librarian in 1978. In that capacity he worked strenuously to ensure that all parliamentarians received prompt and impartial service.</PARA>
<PARA> Under his administration the Department of the Parliamentary Library underwent change and development to a degree probably not known since the inception of the Legislative Research Service in the mid 1960s. During his time as Parliamentary Librarian the resources of the Department greatly increased and there are better career opportunities for staff than ever before. Technical advances have been very considerable and at the national and international level the Department is recognised as one of the best of its kind.</PARA>
<PARA> I greatly regret that ill-health has caused his early retirement. I wish to pay tribute to his most valuable contribution to the working of the Parliament and wish him and Mrs Weir a long and happy retirement.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, the Companies and Securities Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1981, is a further step in giving effect to the Commonwealth's obligations under the co-operative companies and securities scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I am confident that all honourable senators are aware of the co-operative scheme, the four basic elements being:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the establishment of the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the establishment of the National Companies and Securities Commission;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the continuation of existing State and Territory corporate affairs offices; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the attainment of legislative uniformity throughout Australia without requiring the States to surrender or refer any constitutional power. </PARA>
<PARA> Further background information on the co-operative companies and securities scheme is contained in paragraphs 6 to 27 of the explanatory memorandum which has been distributed to honourable senators for information. </PARA>
<PARA> The first stage of the co-operative scheme commenced on 1 July this year when three of the four substantive codes came into operation in the six States and the Australian Capital Territory. These codes are:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the interpretation code;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the share acquisition code; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the securities industry code. </PARA>
<PARA>The Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities is hopeful that the Companies Code will be able to be implemented from 1 January 1982 although this depends to a large degree on the speed with which the remaining legislative and administrative matters can be finalised. </PARA>
<PARA> Background information on each of the four substantive codes is contained in paragraphs 28 to 41 of the explanatory memorandum I have already referred to. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I discuss the Bill itself, I would like to indicate to the Senate where we are heading with the co-operative companies and securities scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> At the last meeting of the Ministerial Council, it was agreed that during 1982 there would be no substantive amendments to the initial legislation. Initial legislation is that contained in the four codes I have referred to as amended up to and including the Bill I am presenting to the Senate today. </PARA>
<PARA> The first reason for this decision is the necessity to give the NCSC, State and Territory administrations and outside practitioners time to get used to the new administrative and legislative structures. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason is that it will provide an opportunity to commence work on the preparation of exposure drafts of the various proposals for reform that have been held over until the initial legislation is in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The aim would be to prepare exposure drafts in April 1982 with a view to seeking public comments between July and October 1982. This legislation would, following consideration by the Ministerial Council, be introduced into the Commonwealth Parliament in the 1983 autumn sittings. </PARA>
<PARA> The parties involved in the co-operative scheme have emphasised the necessity for public consultation. The share acquisition, securities industry and companies codes have been exposed for public comment and debate. The contribution made by interested organisations and individuals has been substantial. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ministerial Council proposes to continue this consultative process where proposals for reform are put forward in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> If these objectives are achieved, I envisage that any amendments introduced in 1982 would cover tidying-up and other non-controversial matters. </PARA>
<PARA>Companies and Securities Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The main purpose of this Bill is to make various minor adjustments to the Companies Code before each State introduces its Companies (Application of Laws) Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> A general outline of the Bill is contained in paragraphs 1 and 4 of the Explanatory Memorandum, and a detailed outline of each closure is contained in paragraphs 46 to 183. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains several editorial amendments to provisions in the Commonwealth Acts under the co-operative scheme. The opportunity has also been taken in this Bill to make some other minor amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has been approved by the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities for introduction into the Commonwealth Parliament. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

It therefore has precedence of all other business. By moving a reference to a standing committee the honourable senator has obtained precedence for her motion.

The order of precedence is Business of the Senate, Government Business and General Business. It is perfectly appropriate, as far as we are concerned, for the honourable senator to seek leave to give a notice of motion for a reference to a select committee because by doing that she will be following the normal procedure in relation to General Business matters.

However, at the request of the Opposition and in what my friend, if not colleague, Senator Evans, persists in calling a spirit of friendship and co-operation, I elected to amend the terms from a standing committee to a select committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the motion can now be debated. The reference proposed is to a standing committee of the Senate. I have some objection to such a reference at this time, although it does not go to the subject matter which Senator Haines seeks to have referred. However, the Jamison Committee of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals, which had a large secretariat, only recently conducted extensive investigations and spent, I think, a couple of years looking at most of the matters the honourable senator wishes to have examined again. I would have some doubts as to whether the proposal for a Senate inquiry is properly based. But that is not my worry because the honourable senator is quite competent to move that the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare look at anything.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But matters of courtesy are involved. The chairman of the Committee is temporarily away from Australia. She will be back at the end of this week or early next week. I think it is entirely inappropriate to seek to force upon the Committee a reference which it has not, as a committee, had an opportunity to examine. I have been the chairman of a Senate standing committee and one of the difficulties is to program a committee's work properly and appropriately. I do not believe that the Standing Committee on Social Welfare has had an appropriate opportunity to look at this matter and decide whether it wants this reference. I cannot comprehend why the Australian Democrats have proposed such a reference without having gone first to the Committee to seek its views and to clear with it whether it was willing to take the reference. All that would be involved would be a brief delay. Surely the Committee should have some say and, at least, a chance to be heard. I have made Senator Haines aware of the fact that Senator Walters is away. I have also made her aware of the fact that I think it is inappropriate to try to force this on the Committee as some kind of urgent matter. It is inappropriate that she should use the forms of the Senate to seek to make this reference now and pick up, apparently some advantage of the moment. If she was seriously concerned about the issue she would have had the courtesy to wait until she can consult with the Committee chairman who will have to have the carriage of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I now advert to what we have just done. Senator Haines changed her course and said: 'All right, let us make it a select committee. Let us use the forms of the Senate to get ourselves precedence on the Notice Paper and then let us try to vary those forms to get a General Business motion up'. I repeat to the honourable senator that if she sought at any stage now to give notice of an intention to refer something to a select committee, which is the normal procedure, we would give leave for a notice of motion to be given. A notice of motion gives honourable senators an opportunity to examine what is being proposed. But is anyone really suggesting that we accept a technique whereby an honourable senator, as Senator Haines has done today, can slip in an amended motion for the establishment of a select committee when, in terms of the Standing Orders of the Senate, due notice has not been given?</PARA>
<PARA> I have not discussed the merit of the matter which it is sought to refer to a committee. It is of no concern to me. No doubt, if given an opportunity, the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare will express a view on its business priorities and on it desire to take the reference. I have been chairman of that Committee. It has a record of producing worthwhile material, but I know that it can take on board only an appropriate amount of work at any time if it is to carry out its duty to the Senate and produce reports of good value. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say one other thing about service on Senate committees. It sits ill with the Australian Democrats seeking a reference to a Senate standing committee when, as I say, it has not cleared it with the committee and has not had the courtesy to wait until the chairman of the committee returns to Australia, and when members of that party will not serve and carry their fair share of committee service. On the eight legislative and general purpose standing committees there are 48 positions. That is a position for almost every senator who is not a Minister, a presiding officer or a leader. The Australian Democrats take two positions on the legislative and general purpose standing committees. Senator Mason is a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment and Senator Siddons is a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce. No other member of the Australian Democrats serves on a standing committee. Yet they have the gall to try to put work on the standing committees on which they will not serve. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines serves on the Standing Orders Committee, but that is not a legislative and general purpose standing committee. On the Estimates committees of the Senate, on which there are, I think, 48 places, I do not believe the Australian Democrats are listed to hold any place. The Australian Democrats are not represented at all on the joint statutory committees. The Australian Democrats are not represented on joint committees. I believe that on most of the general standing committees of the Senate the Australian Democrats are not represented. It simply will not work for the Australian Democrats to have the humbug to try to make work for other senators to do-for them to grandstand, to try to get all the glory of having raised a matter and then ask other senators to do the work. Until they are willing to do their fair share, I suggest the Senate reject this reference. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Peter Baume, has just put on a most extraordinary performance in this place. At the moment I am the Acting Leader of the Australian Democrats. I am maintaining my position as a member of a standing committee of the Senate. If Senator Baume wants to throw around beams or things of that kind, I suggest that he should get himself onto a standing committee. If it is all right for the Acting Leader of the Australian Democrats to be on a standing committee, it is perfectly all right for Ministers to be on them. He has no right to say that he has some sort of exemption, or that we are not fulfilling our places on committees. It is a fact that our new senators have been in this place only a matter of weeks. I should have thought, as a matter of courtesy, that they would have been allowed a little time to study the work that the committees do and, therefore, to be in a position to decide on which ones they can appropriately serve. That has been the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Siddons is a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce. Senator Haines is going ahead to be a member of the Standing Orders Committee. What more does the Minister want? I think the whole argument which he put forward is ridiculous. He is trying to cloud the issue with something that is not relevant to this matter at all. The Australian Democrats are trying to bring into the open a question of great concern in this community. It is an important matter and requires attention. If honourable senators, having read through the suggested terms of reference, go on record as saying that these matters are not important, then they are welcome to do so. I know what sort of reception they would get from the community for having done that.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no question at all from anything that the Minister has said that there should not be a committee to inquire into this area. It is only a matter of the Senate in its wisdom deciding whether it would be better for that committee to be a standing committee or a select committee. Senator Baume has said that that issue must be obscured and clouded because of the Standing Orders of the Senate. If necessary, I can suspend the Standing Orders. The Government does it every day. Let us not have any nonsense about that. The Government uses the suspension of Standing Orders regularly in order to decide what it will do. It uses that technique from day to day. We use it ourselves from time to time. I suggest in good intent that it should not be necessary to have that sort of smokescreen poured over this important matter. Of course, this technique is used by the Government when something comes up which it does not want to have examined. This is the point. The Government does not want to have the question of private hospitals and nursing homes in Australia examined. That is what the Minister is saying: At this stage the Government believes it would be embarrassing to it and so it does not want to have the matter raised. All of the other nonsense that has been said so far is simply a smokescreen. I think that clears the air a little. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to hear further debate on that matter and some assertion from the Government that it does not have anything to hide, that is does not really want to obstruct this inquiry. If it does not want to obstruct it then let us bring it on. Let us talk intelligently and in a reasonable way. Let us get this committee organised. Let us inquire into this terrible situation of so many elderly people and others in this country being exploited through the misuse of private hospitals. Senator Baume knows as well as I do that that is happening. I am sure that in his own private heart he is as deeply concerned about it as I am. Let the Minister level up. Let us be honest about the matter and get the committee going. I have great pleasure in seconding the motion of Senator Haines. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to say a few words because I believe this issue ought to be examined. I support what the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) has said in regard to the matter. The Australian Democrats have to realise that they cannot continue their practice of humbugging about, spending so much time on the development of terms of references for committees and then not be prepared to go ahead and actually serve and do the hackwork of the committee. It has been stated that they require time in which to find their feet. I would have thought that six months or eight months after their election the new senators would have worked out what the committees are doing and what they have done, and that they would have looked at committee reports. They would then be in a good position to decide what service they could do. I regret and have publicly deplored the fact that the Australian Democrats are not carrying out their fair share of the work not only on the standing committees but also on the other committees, such as the Estimates committees. It is all right for them to say: 'We are busy doing something else', but this morning they had the hide to say that the Minister ought to be a member of a standing committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Mason could call himself a shadow shadow Minister. He is a shadow shadow leader. I am not picking on the Acting Leader of the Australian Democrats because I know he has a difficult job to do in all the circumstances. He is setting an example to the troops by serving on a Senate standing committee. But alas, I say to the Duke of Plaza-Toro: Where are the troops behind you? They are not following his example and becoming members of committees as they should be doing. If this parliament and this Senate were to establish more committees a problem would occur in relation to the number of committee staff. As honourable senators know, the number is still ludicrously small.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Mason thinks he can shuffle around 64 senators to serve on a lot of committees without that greatly increasing their already excessive work load, but he should realise that there is a limitation to the number of committees that can be set up and operate effectively. As one who has been the chairman of many standing committees-at one stage, three at a time-I know that it is very embarrassing for a committee to take on a reference and do nothing about it. If a committee puts aside an inquiry for a year or 15 months it is criticised in this chamber. On one occasion my committee took on three or four references because we thought we would consider them in sequence when we could, but a year later people said: 'The Senate demanded that you deal with these matters and you have not done so'. Therefore, we were criticised for it.</PARA>

We must accept that there is a limit to the number of members of the Senate. There is a limit on our abilities and the number of functions we can perform at one time along with other things. The Australian Democrats have to carry out their share of the work of the Senate-not only by making suggestions on matters that ought to be examined but also by rationing the ideas that can be put forward at one time. The Australian Democrats should not expect to impose, as it is trying to do, an inquiry on to a committee when the chairman of that committee is absent. The chairman knows the extent to which the committee could manage another reference. The Australian Democrats should have the courtesy at least to postpone this matter for a period and not to try to force the inquiry on to a standing committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Far be it from me to interfere in a squabble between the conservative forces in this House, but I think I should indicate that on this last day of sitting before a break we have a deliberate attempt at time wasting, I suggest, by the Government and a deliberate misstatement of what is happening. We have humbug, I suggest, on both sides. The situation is that a couple of weeks ago Senator Haines gave notice of her motion that there be a reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare to look into private hospitals and nursing homes. She spoke to me, as both spokesman on health in this place and a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare, about the matter. It is my understanding that she also spoke to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Peter Baume, as he is the Acting Minister for Health. So we have all known about it. I put it to Senator Haines, and I believe Senator Baume put it to Senator Haines, that it was not right to refer the matter to the Standing Committee on Social Welfare because of the absence of the Chairman and because she had not consulted with the members of the Committee. Senator Haines accepted that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Baume knows she accepted that. She then looked at how she could raise this important matter. I suggested-I think she agrees-that the matter would be better referred to a Senate select committee, perhaps a small Senate select committee. Everyone in this place knows that that has happened. It is utter humbug for the Minister and Senator Missen to go on as though they knew that that was not going to happen. Senator Haines, feeling that this matter was important, found that the best way to raise the matter was, in fact, to move her motion in the original way and have it amended to read that the matter be referred to a Senate select committee. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Baume said, she is using the processes of this House to bring up her motion and her reference. To accuse her of humbug and nonsense in doing that is the height of hypocrisy. The Government does that every day of the week in this place. It manipulates the Standing Orders and the order of business to get its own way and to stop debate on other issues. It is only after the crunch has come-as it came last night when the Government realised what the numbers were-that we will debate Senator Ryan's Bill on Queensland Aborigines today. If the Government had the numbers we would not be debating that Bill; it would be manipulating the processes of this chamber to avoid it.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us stop this nonsense of saying that people are being naughty and are manipulating the affairs of the chamber. They are not. They are using the processes to raise what they consider to be an important motion. The matters raised by Senator Missen and Senator Baume are, of course, important. The Australian Democrats in this place have a penchant to raise all sorts of matters they consider to be important. Their Leader has proposed something like 17 Senate inquiries, including inquiries into animal welfare. I must say that I have yet to see the Democrats being willing to take their fair share of that burden. </PARA>
<PARA> By the same token, yesterday I suggested on behalf of the Opposition one way in which we could overcome those difficulties. I suggested that we do what we have done in the past, set up a committee of four senators instead of six-a perfectly efficient method. Senator Missen, who is today complaining about the work load of senators, on that occasion said that that was an outrageous suggestion, that four people could not do the work and that we had to have six people. The Government was willing to use the processes of this place under the Standing Orders to defeat my amendment by insisting on six instead of four. So I withdrew the suggestion of having four people and we ended up with six. </PARA>
<PARA> What will happen and what everybody knows will happen is that another member of the Democrats will move an amendment to Senator Haines's motion to make it read that the matter be referred to a select committee. It may be a clumsy way to go about it but it is the only way the Democrats can go about it in order to bring up this important matter now. I suggest that we let them go about it, let the Senate decide just what sort of committee we will have and not have this nonsense of arguing about standing committees. </PARA>

It is interesting that the issues they are raising are issues that have been raised in the Senate over a period. The Government has not in any way, shape or form reacted to a number of the matters that have been the subject of notices of motion that senators from the Australian Democrats have sought to have the Senate examine. We all recall a very vigorous and detailed analysis of what was happening to private hospitals by Senator Justin O'Byrne. He raised the matter on a number of occasions in this place. What has the Government done about it? It has done absolutely nothing, as in a number of areas we are seeking to have select committees deal with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Shortly I will be seeking to raise the electoral deficiencies that exist. I expect to get some support from the Australian Democrats on that matter. Everybody knows that this Government has had some inquiries into the deficiencies of the Commonwealth Electoral Act but it has done nothing about them other than to have inquiries. It has not been prepared even to make available to the Parliament the subject of its inquiries. It recognises the deficiencies that exist in that Act. Of course, in the area of private hospital care very serious exploitation is taking place of people who have nobody other than governments to protect them. The Government is deficient and is falling down in its responsibilities to these people who are being ruthlessly exploited by the private hospital system, most of which is owned by medicos, by people involved in the medical care area. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that because when I was in local government I knew that numerous applications for the erection of private hospitals came from local medicos who were seeking further ways in which they could invest their tremendous accumulation of capital. We know that a multiplicity of private hospitals has grown into the system As former Senator Justin O'Byrne pointed out, we are now faced with a foreign invasion of our private hospital system. What better way is there to examine this problem and to find out what really are our social and parliamentary responsibilities than to have a select committee inquiry? We can agree with some of the observations that have been made by Senator Missen. We know that this suggestion will impose an increased work load upon senators. But there are areas in which those of us who are already overworked are prepared to be even further overworked in order to carry out our responsibilities in--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator GIETZELT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have the assurance of the Democrats on this matter because they feel strongly about it as, indeed, does the Australian Labor Party. The Fraser-Anthony Government in its death throes is not doing anything about a whole variety of areas of concern to the Australian community. It is prepared to have the Parliament rise three weeks earlier than has ever happened before. It was prepared to extend the Senate sittings in the May-June period in order to get legislation passed before the views of the electors were expressed on the result of the change in the political composition of this place; but now the Government is proposing to have the Senate and the House of Representatives rise early in November-not because there is not work to be done but rather that it cannot face the political reality, the political dissension that exists in the ranks of the Government parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, in areas such as medical care people in the private hospitals suffer because of the lack of Government attention. I am surprised at Senator Baume. He is an honourable senator for whose identity with health care matters, because of his own participation in the medical profession, I have a great deal of respect. He knows as well as many other medicos what is going on in private health areas-exploitation of our community. It seems to me that it is just humbug and hypocrisy to suggest that the motivation of some honourable senators is suspect because they want to take up these matters. We in the Labor Party will find someone on our side of politics to serve on this committee, as indeed will the Democrats. If the Government is not prepared to provide somebody that will be to its disadvantage. We will be insisting that staff be made available for these select committees and these extra commitments so that the committees fulfil their proper role. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard a lot, even from Senator Missen in times gone past, about the role of the Executive, the role of the Senate, and the role of the Parliament. Surely it is not asking too much in a situation where honourable senators want to undertake a proper examination of areas in which they feel very grave irregularities and deficiencies are occurring, for the Senate to take some steps to examine and carry out a survey of those matters with a view to some rectification. I believe this will be a feature of the work of the Senate, perhaps for the next six years, perhaps even for the next 60 years, and that the Senate will take on the sort of important investigative role that has made the American Senate system so important in American politics. </PARA>
<PARA> No matter what change of government takes place, as assuredly it will in 1983, I will still espouse the same view. The Senate should have an investigative role, not for the purpose Senator Lewis and some other honourable senators suggested yesterday of putting ourselves in a position of being prosecutors and carrying out some sort of persecution of people and issues, but rather to acquaint the Parliament and the Australian people with the gross abuses that are taking place. I suggest that there is prima facie evidence of gross abuse of private hospitals in Australia. Therefore the Australian Labor Party will give support to the motion of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate Standing Orders are to protect honourable senators and to enable them to carry out their duties as best they can. What bothers me about this matter is that it has now reached the stage of being a convention of the Senate that, if there is to be a reference to one of the legislative and general purpose standing committees of the Senate, the reference is first of all mentioned to the chairman of the committee, who then has an opportunity to consider its terms and discuss them with the members of the committee before the motion for reference is carried. That means that when honourable senators see that there is a proposal to refer a matter to a standing committee they need not concern themselves very much about the terms of that reference. They know that if the convention, observed in normal circumstances, has been carried out the usual inquiries will have been made by the chairman and members of the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the other hand, where there is a motion to refer a matter to a select committee, honourable senators know that it has not been considered by the members of the committee and that they need to apply their minds to the matter. That is why the Standing Orders create a situation where notice of the reference can be given and honourable senators have time to consider it. It is not until such time as honourable senators find out that it is not proposed to refer a matter to one of the legislative and general purpose standing committees that they discover they ought to be looking at it. When did honourable senators find out about the proposal in regard to private hospitals and nursing homes? They found out about three-quarters of an hour ago, when Senator Haines sought leave to alter the notice she had given. </PARA>
<PARA> With all due respect to Senator Haines and the Australian Democrats, they seem to be interested in serving only on such committees as may achieve maximum political publicity. If one looks at the seven standing committees of the Senate it will be seen that one Democrat is serving on one of those seven standing committees. On the legislative and general purpose standing committees, of which there are eight, I think there are two members of the Australian Democrat party serving. I do not think an Australian Democrat is serving on any of the eight Estimates committees of the Senate. I do not think a Democrat is serving on the three joint statutory committees, nor is there a Democrat serving on the three joint standing committees. Yet in their motion they propose to lumber with this reference a committee which may have all sorts of responsibilities. I have spoken to one of the members of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare, who said it would not be possible to look at the matter of private hospitals and nursing homes in less than six months. The Australian Democrats have given a notice of motion setting out a whole list of matters, but there has been no investigation by anyone other than themselves as to whether these are the only matters the Committee ought to look at or whether matters are included which the committee ought not to be concerned about. The Democrats have come into the Senate and by a misuse of the Standing Orders of the Senate, with all due respect, endeavoured to get some priority for their motion. I am totally opposed to that misuse of Standing Orders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I have been quite astounded at the sorts of things raised during the debate to date on what I intended to be a quiet little affair. I wonder what would happen if I tried to stir trouble in this place. Before getting to the gist of the matter, I wish to answer a number of points raised by both the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) and Senator Lewis. Much has been made of the fact that the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare, Senator Shirley Walters, is away. I inform the Senate, as I previously informed the Minister, that I spoke to her about this matter very early in the present session. I informed her that the Australian Democrats intended, for a number of reasons, to refer to her Committee the matter of private hospitals, private nursing homes, and discretionary surgery. When I informed her of that she in no way indicated her displeasure or concern over the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has also been continually thrown in our faces that apparently we are not carrying enough of the work load of the Senate. I assumed that honourable senators in this place were more than competent to handle their work load. It seems, however, that they are not. If the assertions of Senator Lewis and Senator Missen are to be accepted, it seems that they see themselves as somewhat inadequate. The Australian Democrats are quite happy to help them out. However, I refer the Senate to a minor anomaly. When I was in this place in 1978 I did just about everything but grovel-in fact, I may well have done that-to both the Opposition and the Government in order to be allowed the privilege, in the six months I was in this place, to have an official position on a Senate standing committee. That was denied me, and instead I took up the option that is open to all honourable senators to attend Senate committee meetings as a committee moves around the country investigating particular matters. In fact, I did that with the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts when it investigated the influence of television on children. I do not for a moment regret the time I put into that. It was a most interesting Committee, and I found it an invaluable experience. </PARA>
<PARA> I have extremely high regard for the work that the Senate committees, both select and standing, achieve for the Parliament. For instance, the work of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare, when Senator Peter Baume was its more than competent chairman, in its investigation of the drug situation in Australia is to be commended. Certainly no slight is intended by me or by my party by the fact that we are spreading ourselves fairly thinly. However, I would point out that, between us, we are on three standing committees and two select committees, and that it is my intention to be one of the four members of the select committee that Senator Macklin has proposed. Thus it seems to me that for five of us to be on six committees when there are only four of us available at the moment is really not doing too badly at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister brought up the question of the Jamison report-the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals. I intend to say a little more later about the comments in that report concerning private hospitals and nursing homes. Whatever submissions were made to the Jamison Commission, its comments on the private sector of the health care system in this country were extremely limited. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, I am somewhat astonished at the strength of feeling that is being indicated on the Government benches over an inquiry which I feel-my feeling is shared by members of the Australian Labor Party-is of considerable relevance to the Australian people. I deeply regret that what I feel is a serious question relating to health care in this country is being turned into a political football. It is implied that in our terms of reference we beg the question and make assertions or come to judgments. That is not so. I would have thought that anybody who made even a cursory glance at the terms of reference would see that we have bent over backwards not to prejudice the question in any way. Rather, we leave it entirely to the committee to decide. A great deal has been said, especially in the last few months, about our health care system, about the doctors who are involved in it, about the hospitals and the nursing homes where it is practised, and about uses and the occasional abuses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems to me that health care is in a similar box to education in this country. It should not be in the position of constantly being inquired into, argued about, changed, manipulated and politicised. Nevertheless, that is what is happening. As with education, health care should be strictly a non-party political matter. Again I refer to the fact that our terms of reference reflect an attempt to make the inquiry non political. Unfortunately, within the health field, there is opportunity for a small minority of people to make vast sums of money out of the system as it operates at the moment. If this is not actually to the detriment of other people, at least it is not greatly assisting them. In view of this we have moved for this inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the interest of expediency and of reaching a decision on the matter before the sitting is suspended for lunch, I shall restrain my eloquence and say, simply, that we have moved this motion in response to increasing expressions of concern in the community about the ownership and operation of private hospitals and private nursing homes, recognising that the majority wish being tainted by criticism which, one hopes, is applicable only to a few. The motion also has been moved in response to disturbing disclosures in the Press, the Bulletin in particular but other areas of the printed medium as well, concerning increasing numbers of deaths from tonsilectomies performed on young children, the alarming increases in other forms of so-called discretionary surgery and the apparent lack of adequate consultation between doctor and patient. Finally, we have moved it in response to recent changes in the health insurance area which clearly will support the private sector. Since taxpayers are supporting that sector through the Consolidated Revenue, the payment of subsidies and so on, we maintain that the public has a right to know what it is supporting. </PARA>
<PARA> To achieve those ends it is essential that a thorough and specific investigation be undertaken into the ownership and operation of private hospitals and nursing homes, the scope and degree of government assistance to those hospitals and nursing homes, and the acquisition of statistics, which are extremely hard to acquire or get out of anybody at all at the moment, on discretionary surgery in Australia.

<PARA> That the following matter be referred to the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs:</PARA>
<PARA> Continuing oversight of the implementation of reports of the Law Reform Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>I feel I must make a brief comment on this matter, particularly on the origins of the proposal for parliamentary oversight of Law Reform Commission reports, in view of the fact that what is sought by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs is a continuing reference in regard to the matter. The Committee in its report entitled Reforming the Law, tabled in the Parliament in May 1979, made a series of recommendations involving the Parliament in the processing of law reform proposals put forward by the Australian Law Reform Commission. Among those recommendations, which appear at paragraph 2.60 of the report, were proposals that all reports of the Law Reform Commission, following their tabling in the Parliament in accordance with the requirement under the Law Reform Commission Act 1973, should be referred to an appropriate parliamentary committee. </PARA>
<PARA> It was further recommended that the committee in question should consider and report promptly to the Parliament on whether the legislation proposed by the Commission should be enacted as it stands or should be subject to specified amendments. It was recommended that, if the proposed legislation is merely technical or otherwise non-controversial, the committee should specifically report to that effect. It was recommended also that the committee in its deliberations should liaise closely with the Commission to ensure full understanding of the Commission's proposals and an appreciation of why alternative approaches were rejected and that any proposed amendments are able to be accommodated within the framework of the Commission's Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee's recommendations envisage that the normal obligation on the responsible Minister to respond within six months to a parliamentary committee report should attach also to a parliamentary committee report on a Law Reform Commission proposal. In so doing the Minister would be required to inform the Parliament of the Government's intentions regarding the Commission's proposals. The Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee in its recommendations emphasised that reference of a Commission report to a parliamentary committee should not preclude the Government from acting as quickly as it thinks fit to implement the report. Finally, it was recommended that the committee to whom a Commission report is referred should retain, both during its deliberations and after it has reported to the Parliament, a general watching brief over the progress of that report and should take such action as it considers desirable to prompt the introduction and passage of legislation to give it effect. Those recommendations have not been accepted by the Government, but I think it is important to remind the Senate that we thought that was the ideal type of scrutiny for the purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The Constitutional and Legal Affairs Commitee, in its discussion on those recommendations, pointed out in the report that reference to a bipartisan parliamentary committee was 'perhaps the most frequently recurring suggestion as to the appropriate machinery for processing recommendations of the Law Reform Commission' when a Commission report was tabled in the Parliament. That comment appears at paragraph 246 of the report. Some of the proponents of this suggestion specified the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee as the appropriate body to undertake the review function. The committee scrutiny was envisaged as capable of achieving a number of diverse functions. Many people saw its role as being to prod the Executive into action on those matters unlikely to be accorded high priority because of their technical nature. Such a committee could periodically press the Government department, or departments, responsible for considering a report and preparing a ministerial submission to Cabinet for explanations of progress being made. Similarly, the committee could attempt to ensure that other proposals were not being ignored because of their controversial nature. Among the suggestions made in the report entitled Reforming the Law was the following:</PARA>
<PARA> A particular means by which pressure might be applied to the Executive would be for a Parliamentary committee which had decided to endorse a report of the Law Reform Commission to 'adopt' it for all intents and purposes, thus invoking the procedure presently employed in respect of all reports of Parliamentary committees, namely that the Government undertakes to make a statement to the Parliament within six months of the tabling of a committee report as to the Government's proposed action. </PARA>
<PARA>Among other suggestions was that the report of the parliamentary committee should be expressed in such a form that approval of the report would amount to a motion that a Bill comprising the draft legislation proposed by the Law Reform Commission, as amended if necessary by the Committee, be read a first time. In discussing that recommendation, the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee noted that implementation of such a procedure need not detract from the Government's right to assess independently the Law Reform Commission's proposals, to determine whether to accept the proposals in full or in part and even to determine the priority of legislation. This could be achieved through the Government's control of parliamentary time. It need not allow the legislation to proceed to second and third reading stages. It would nevertheless be obliged promptly to decide its attitude to the legislation and either move to have it processed through all stages, amend it, or oppose it for publicly stated reasons. I stress that that was just a suggestion and of course, it has not been adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> A further possible function to be assigned to the parliamentary committee was that it could certify that particular proposals were not controversial, thereby enabling them to be passed without debate unless any member of the appropriate chamber requested such a debate and the chamber resolved to debate the proposals. The Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee was conscious of the subjective nature of such a certification power and recognised that it should not conclusively determine the course of subsequent debate. It was suggested that if, following an informal certification by the Committee, the proposal was laid on the table for a certain time before a motion to pass without debate was moved members could specify those first, without taking up valuable parliamentary time to do so. The Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee, at paragraph 2.49 of the report, commented:</PARA>
<PARA> Parliamentary debate on a proposal could be expected to be shorter and more enlightened if members of either chamber were able to arrest any doubts about a particular proposal by referring to the report of the Committee which had examined the law reform proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>The Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee still holds the view that a lot is to be gained from the examination by a parliamentary committee of reports of the Law Reform Commission and is prepared to take up that role itself, as was suggested by some people who gave evidence to the Committee during its inquiry into the processing of law reform proposals. We envisage the role as a continuing one to which we will turn our attention as the need requires. It is not contemplated that that will be a matter to which we will immediately turn. We have no particular intention in regard to any particular report of the Law Reform Commission, but we feel that a continuing reference of this nature would be a useful one, not only to draw the Senate's attention to the need but also to draw to the attention of other standing committees and other committees of the Parliament the reports on matters which are in their domains. </PARA>
<PARA> For the information of the Senate I seek to have incorporated in Hansard a document which outlines the current position regarding the reports of the Law Reform Commission which are still awaiting substantial implementation, or rejection, by the Government. It is to those reports that the Committee will direct its attention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will come as no surprise that the Opposition warmly endorses the proposal to refer Law Reform Commission reports to the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. We have been unceasing in our endeavours to get the Government to pay far more serious attention to the reports of the Australian Law Reform Commission than it has been in the habit of doing in the past. We see the proposed mechanism which Senator Missen has outlined as being a very useful way of placing additional momentum behind the reform process. The record of implementation of recommendations contained in Law Reform Commission reports by the Government has been a very poor one indeed. It is true that several reports have been transformed, to a greater or lesser extent, into law to the extent of the Commonwealth's competence to do so. I acknowledge that that has been the case with respect to the two reports entitled Complaints Against Police, the report entitled Alcohol, Drugs and Driving, the report Human Tissue Transplants and, to a partial extent, the report Privacy in the Census. But no legislative action whatsoever has been taken in respect of six other reports of the Commission-the majority of those that have been prepared since its inception, which date all the way back in fact to 1975. I might briefly indicate what those six reports are. For a start there is the Criminal Investigation report which has been the subject of a promise for the introduction of a new criminal investigation Bill based on a modification of the Commission's recommendations. We are supposedly going to see that Bill this session. I will believe that when I see it, given the history of that report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then there is the report entitled Insolvency: The Regular Payment of Debts, which has been languishing in the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs since 1977. There is the report entitled Unfair Publication: Defamation and Privacy which has been languishing in the other limbo of lost causes-the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General-since 1978 with the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) making it abundantly clear this week at an Estimates committee hearing that he would take no unilateral action whatsoever on behalf of the Commonwealth to implement the findings of that report to the extent of the Commonwealth's competence to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1979 report on privacy, the first stage of which has been partially implemented, is still awaiting further legislation which again we have been promised this session, but with the rumours so rife about an early rising of this Parliament this session there must be very real doubt whether that in fact will come to pass. The same applies to the sentencing report of January 1980 which, although largely in interim form, does contain a number of legislative recommendations for immediate implementation which again have been the subject of a Government promise to introduce this session. But again, whether we see them remains very much to be seen. I will believe them when I see them. The Lands Acquisition report of March 1980 has been buried since that time in the bowels of the Department of Administrative Services. I have no idea when it is going to see daylight. Finally, of course, there is the report on insurance agents and brokers of July 1980 on which the Government has taken a firm position, namely, a firm position to reject out of hand-a position which will, of course, be tested by the private member's Bill that I have introduced and which I hope will be coming on shortly for full debate in this House. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I just add that whenever I speak on this subject in public debate, as I have on several occasions, namely the inertia, the lethargy, the failure of will and the failure of nerve of the Government on law reform issues, and again, whenever I refer, as I often do, to that emerging phenomenon known as Durack's law, namely that the prospect of the implementation of any given law reform proposal varies in inverse proportion to the importance of the subject matter and the quality of the supporting argument, I tend to be met with the response from the Attorney-General that I and members of the Opposition who share these views are blindly besotted by the reports of the Australian Law Reform Commission, that we are always urging the Government to implement such reports without the Government exercising any significant independent judgment at all. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that I and the Opposition hold the reports of the Commission and the efforts in particular of its Chairman, Mr Justice Kirby, in far higher regard than obviously do the Attorney-General and this Government. The reports are the product, as has been said many times before, of enormous industry, of a very wide consultation, of many public hearings and of a great deal of input from all the relevant experts in the subject areas around the country. The reports are invariably well and lucidly written and they are certainly held in very high international regard. What I certainly have never said, however-nor to my knowledge has anyone else on the Opposition side-is that these reports should be implemented without any consideration or input from the Government of the day at all. Of course it is the case that reports of this kind from the Law Reform Commission, however carefully formulated and drafted, may well have a political dimension to them which it is entirely legitimate for the Government of the day to consider in the light of its own political priorities. I acknowledge that and I have never said anything different. </PARA>
<PARA> But what is not tolerable is the endlessly recurring situation, with which we have become so familiar, of the reference back to these reports once they are in fact brought down by the Law Reform Commission to the Government departments relevant to them in order that there might be a complete de novo re-evaluation of everything contained in such reports, as if the reports in fact had not been the product of the enormously lengthy process of consultation both with experts and the community or of the enormously careful input of the Commission itself that such reports invariably have. It seems to me that we have a situation of the endless reinvention of the wheel so far as these Law Reform Commission reports are concerned. Our view is simply that much greater respect and regard should be had to the process which underlies the preparation of those reports by the Government-a much greater respect than the Government has been in the habit of giving them. The Government's attitude should be that reports coming from the Law Reform Commission under these circumstances should be implemented. There is a very strong prima facie case for their implementation unless there is some overwhelming and obvious political reason for the Government of the day not doing so. That is not an attitude which the Government has taken in the past. But it is an attitude which may well be encouraged by the machinery establised in this reference. For those reasons we warmly support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to another chapter in the murky serial story of the razor gang which concerns an important facility in my area of New South Wales. The Government announced in its Review of Commonwealth Functions, so called, that the Experimental Building Station at Ryde, Sydney, was to be disposed of. The station which is located on land which is mostly undeveloped is in a prime real estate area of Sydney. Maybe we can expect a real estate developer to submit the highest bid if the station actually goes for sale. That would seem to me to be a logical result of the Government's cynicism and lack of concern for the public interest in seeking to dispose of this highly important and useful public facility which has been established for many decades and without which the cost of building would have been much higher in this country. The station has had an enormous influence in respect of the revision of building standards. Such things as the lowering of the height of ceiling studs were experimented with and researched by that organisation and have had a fundamental effect on the cost of houses. Houses are expensive enough but without the station they would be very much more expensive, and they can be expected to be very much more expensive in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government announced that the station simply would be disposed of. This is charming terminology. It is as though one were simply to take the lid off the rubbish can and drop the station in. However, we now have a little more information about this matter. An advertisement which appeared in the Australian Financial Review of 11 September 1981 is headed: 'Commonwealth of Australia, Sale or Lease of Experiment Building Station'. This is where the dirty deed is provided for in detail. The advertisement states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth's aim is for the EBS to be taken over as a going concern. The successor organisation would be required to demonstrate that it could maintain the EBS's reputation for impartiality and technical excellence and that it would be prepared to continue its role . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I would have been much happier, the Australian Democrats would have been much happier and the people of New South Wales would have been much happier if we had seen a situation in which the Government's set intention had been for the EBS to be taken over as a going concern so that we could be reassured that this organisation would be allowed to continue on its set course and continue the work for which it has been so much noted in the past. But the Government has not done that. It has said that it has an aim. This means nothing. All the rest of this advertisement that is supposed to indicate that the Government is going to maintain the standards of the station, of course, is nonsense because the Government has kept its options open; it has allowed itself an out on the actual means of disposal. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically one would have thought that the valuable and vital work that is being done at the EBS would have been very expensive to undertake, but in fact that is not the case. This establishment costs a modest $1.75m a year which is a mere drop in the bucket in any fiscal or financial terms. We could run this experimental building station for a decade on what the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting is costing. That is the truth of the matter. We have to look at this situation in the light of that comparison. The Australian Democrats believe that the expenditure of less than $2m is very well justified by the scope and success of the work of the station. The running costs could be reduced if fees for certain work done for industry were raised to a more realistic level. I have raised in the Senate before the question of the cost to industry for work done at this facility. A year or two ago I raised a question of what the Atomic Energy Commission was charging for its services. I am glad to see that, perhaps partly as a result of my raising the question, the Government has taken that into account and the Commission will be charging more reasonable fees to organisations which are well able to afford to pay for the services rendered. The same could be done for the EBS. The EBS could probably be put in a situation in which it was running at virtually no cost to the community. I think that would be the ideal situation. </PARA>
<PARA> It might be said that the disposal of the station, as proposed, will have no perceptible effect on the national economy. It will once again merely serve, as with so many of these razor gang cuts, to destroy a useful facility, a valuable and honoured facility. It has done useful things for this country and is respected throughout the world. I will shortly describe some of the work that is done at the station. I spent a day at the station because I thought it was worthwhile. I asked some fairly searching questions of the staff. My impression was that this station is not, with respect to any other area of the Public Service, dragging the chain. It is an extremely hard-working place; a very useful facility with a highly dedicated group of professional people who, for the reasons I shall describe, will not be able to carry out their work with any responsibility if the station is purely put to private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the work at risk includes research into earth walled pise and adobe buildings. This research work is being used all over the world. Third World countries regularly seek information from this station on research into these building materials. Research is being done which the Third World countries cannot do themselves because the research continues over a number of years. Australia's standing in the eyes of Third World countries has been greatly enhanced by this work. The testing has taken decades to set up and it will take decades more before it can be completed. This work is being smashed completely by the Federal Government. I can see no way any private enterprise organisation could possibly finance it. There is no question of charges being made to Third World countries. The Australian Democrats do not believe there should be any charges to them. This is a proper, sensible and useful form of foreign aid which has been of tremendous assistance at the grass roots in many Asian countries in the provision of information to enable people to house themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The station has also provided a useful general information service to council building departments and students. Virtually every architectural student in Australia has had recourse to its circulars. Presumably that service will be discontinued in the future. I would like assurances from the Government that it is not going to be discontinued. In fact, I would like assurances from the Government that everything going on at this station somehow will be continued.</PARA>
<PARA> There is also an excellent acoustics laboratory where much vital and painstaking work has been done into the sound transmission properties of Australian building materials. Valuable research is conducted into the means of preserving historic buildings. Almost every aspect of building has been investigated and researched by this estimable, highly professional organisation. One of the more unusual aspects of its work, but one of some value which the staff at this station did not think was beneath their responsibilities, was discovering some way of removing spray painted graffiti from the sandstone walls of historic buildings in Sydney which were being defaced by irresponsible persons. That work in itself is of very considerable value because it has led to a means of protecting and restoring, without damaging the original structure, buildings which are of inestimable and irreplaceable value to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of housing has become such a critical factor in the lives of millions of Australians that it is absurd effectively to cripple an organisation which for four decades-I repeat, four decades-has played such an important and innovative part in revising housing standards, very often in ways which have reduced costs. More than the $1.75m a year it costs to run gets back to the community. For four decades we have been getting a very good thing out of that place. It has been saving us hundreds of millions of dollars in building costs. It has saved us far more than it has cost to run it ever since it was established. I am interested in the advertisement which states that it is to be sold or leased because I cannot see any conceivable way it could be leased. I think the Government is again just letting itself off the hook. If it had merely said the station would be leased under certain conditions we might have been able to understand its reasoning a little better but the option for the sale of the station must indeed create a situation in which it will be cynically destroyed. No doubt the land around it will be seen to be a high rise area and somebody or other with close association with the Liberal Party will seek to make several hundred million dollars out of it. We will be watching for that sort of situation to develop and if it happens we will not overlook it; we will be raising it perpetually in this place. So the Government can be warned that that situation of exploitation for its friends will not have any opportunity of being achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that if the station is sold, no matter to whom, the appreciable influence the work of the station has had on holding down building costs will no longer be available. If it does carry on its research programs, which is debatable, in any case under a new owner the fruits of that research will have to be paid for at far higher rates than apply now. Perhaps we could accept that, but the point is that once the station is put in the situation in which it has to cope with the profit motive it is unlikely that research will be carried out in the same effective way that it has been in the past. I think it has been proven by organisations all over the world that innovative research organisations which want to go into speculative, innovative and important research which do not immediately make a profit cannot expect a business to take them over and run them at a profit. That is not a criticism of business. It is just irresponsible of the Government to expect that it could work. Business is out to make a profit, and that is reasonable. The Government is wholly to blame for this irrational idea that this station should be disposed of. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most serious aspects of the effect of this decision, I suggest, for the Australian community in the future is the interruption of the very important work that is going on at the EBS into fire hazards of large city buildings and especially the control of lethal smoke movement. If the Government disposes of the EBS and this work is ended-I spent some time waching the complex and painstaking way in which this work was being carried out with the use of quite large equipment-and this country is faced with a Towering Inferno type fire in which people are overcome by smoke or killed in large numbers then the health and lives of those people will indeed be on the conscience of every member of the Government. I think that is not too much to state because the Government has been told plainly that this work is vital, the work is not being done anywhere else and the results of the work could save the lives of hundreds of Australians in the future. I think to destroy that research is an evil thing. It was made obvious to me by the people I spoke to while at the EBS that that kind of fire is only too likely now because of the nature of modern buildings which are a higher fire risk than the older buildings because of their relatively open structure, which enables draughts to go through them quickly, and the extensive use of certain plastics. It is the smoke from those plastics which causes most of the loss of life. As far as I know no other place in Australia can do the work that is going on at this station and I cannot see that any private enterprise organisation could make money out of this research because it is research into the general principles of fire proofing and the movement of smoke. This is most important work. The work that is being done will provide the guidelines-it will take a number of years yet to complete-for how people should move around in buildings where there is a fire, where windows should be located in order to get the smoke out of the building quickly and vital basic matters of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats and I particularly, as a senator for New South Wales, feel that the decision to end the work of this station is a very unpleasant, stupid and unproductive action. It is one of many taken by this Government which in its closing years or months in office in this country has reached the stage at which it is almost crippled or impotent and is unable to distinguish right from wrong and good from bad. That is the most charitable interpretation I can put on it. The Government truly has reached the stage at which frankly it does not know what it is doing. It is despairing at its own infighting It is despairing at its own lack of ideas. It has reached the stage at which it can no longer discriminate between what is good and what is not good for the Australian community and perhaps that is as serious an indictment of it as anybody could make. Perhaps that is the best reason the Government should either smarten itself up or surrender its mandate. I think it has no other alternative. </PARA>
<PARA> It as essential that the Experimental Building Station should be free to carry out the kind of innovative research it has traditionally engaged in and is engaged in now. Its disposal to private enterprise would mean its aims will be reshaped, at best to suit the profit motive, and it will probably be reduced to a mere testing station. At worst, it will be dismembered, undoubtedly sold and disposed of cynically, as I said, to the profit of the Government's friends. </PARA>

<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY STAMP DUTY AMENDMENT BILL 1981</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is the first of three Bills needed to give effect to the proposal announced by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech to increase the rates of stamp duty and similar tax payable in respect of certain instruments and transactions connected with the Australian Capital Territory, including the Jervis Bay Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, by way of background I mention that stamp duty was introduced in 1969 on a range of instruments and transactions in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time, the rates of duty were set at levels comparable with rates imposed by the States on similar instruments and transactions. </PARA>
<PARA> In the intervening years the rates of duty applying to the majority of instruments and transactions dutiable in the Territory have fallen significantly behind those imposed by the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that there is no justification for maintaining this advantage for residents of the Australian Capital Territory over residents of the various States. </PARA>
<PARA> For this reason, and taking into account also the marked growth of Canberra both as a city and as a centre of business, the Government has decided to take steps that ensure that residents of the Territory bear stamp duty comparable to those levied on residents of the States. This Bill and the Bills that follow give effect to this decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the various instruments that are to be subject to an increased rate of duty. </PARA>
<PARA> Cheques drawn or made on a banker at a branch of the banker in the Territory, and other bills of exchange or promissory notes drawn or paid in the Territory, are the first category. </PARA>
<PARA> The present rate of stamp duty on this category of instrument is five cents. </PARA>
<PARA> The rate proposed by this Bill is ten cents per instrument. </PARA>
<PARA> The new rate will apply in respect of cheques drawn on or after 19 August 1981 and to any other bill of exchange or promissory note that has not been duly stamped by reason of having been drawn or paid before 19 August 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> Transitional arrangements included in the Bill will, however, enable bank customers to continue to draw cheques on forms supplied to them before 19 August 1981 without incurring the higher duty. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also proposed that conveyances of freehold land in the Territory and agreements for the granting, transfer or assignment of leases of land in the Territory executed on or after 19 August 1981 will be subject to increased rates of duty. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase will not apply in respect of conveyancing transactions for which an agreement for transfer had been executed by the parties before 19 August 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> For a transfer of freehold land, the present rate of duty is at the flat rate of $1 for each $100, or part thereof, of the value of the interest transferred. </PARA>
<PARA> This basis of duty also applies in respect of a transfer of a crown lease granted for more than five years. </PARA>
<PARA> For other transfers of leases, including crown leases granted for periods of five years or less, the existing rate of duty is the same as I have just mentioned, but it is imposed on the value of the consideration given by the transferee. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining dutiable transaction dealt with by the Bill is the grant of a lease, other than by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> On the granting of such a lease, duty is presently payable at the general rate I have mentioned but is applied to the value of the consideration given by the lessee otherwise than by way of rent. </PARA>
<PARA> For consideration given in the form of rent, duty is imposed at the rate of 30 cents for each $100, or part thereof, in the total rent payable for the specified period for which the lease is granted. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed that the general rate of stamp duty in respect of all of these classes or instruments be increased, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> For every $100, or part thereof, of the freehold value or lease premium the rate is to be-</PARA>
<PARA> $1.25 for amounts up to $14,000;</PARA>
<PARA> $1.50 between $14,001 and $30,000;</PARA>
<PARA> $1.75 between $30,001 and $50,000;</PARA>
<PARA> $2.00 between $50,001 and $100,000;</PARA>
<PARA> $2.25 between $100,001 and $250,000; and</PARA>
<PARA> $2.50 for amounts in excess of $250,000. </PARA>
<PARA>It is also proposed that the duty payable in respect of the rental component of a lease be increased from 30 cents to 35 cents per $100, or part thereof. </PARA>
<PARA> A memorandum containing more detailed explanations of the technical aspects of this Bill and the other two Bills to which I have referred is being circulated to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention that legislation to introduce a Territory Stamp Duty on new and transferred vehicle registrations and on life insurance policies will be brought before parliament later in the sittings. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the present Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY TAX (CHEQUES) AMENDMENT BILL 1981</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill deals with the rate of stamp tax payable in respect of cheque forms supplied or used by authorised banks in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The present rate of tax payable in respect of cheque forms supplied or used by a banker in the Territory is five cents per form. It is proposed to increase the rate to ten cents per form. </PARA>
<PARA> The increased tax will apply in respect of all cheque forms supplied or used by a banker in the Territory on or after 19 August 1981. Existing unused cheque forms held by bank customers will not bear the increase. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY TAX (INSURANCE BUSINESS) AMENDMENT BILL 1981</PARA>
<PARA>This further Bill relates to the rate of stamp tax payable on premiums received by a registered insurer in the Australian Capital Territory, again including Jervis Bay, in respect of certain classes of general insurance business, broadly, insurance other than workers' compensation and third party insurance on motor vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing rate of tax is five per cent of the premiums received in the Territory on Insurance effected in the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed to increase that rate to seven per cent in relation to premiums received by an insurer in respect of insurance effected by the insurer on or after 19 August 1981. </PARA>

<PARA>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY TAXATION (ADMINISTRATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1981</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is the first of four Bills to implement further proposals relating to stamp duties and taxes imposed in the Australian Capital Territory, including Jervis Bay, that the Treasurer announced in his Budget Speech on 18 August 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, in the statements accompanying the Treasurer's Budget speech it was indicated that following a review of the level and scope of the stamp duties and taxes imposed in the Australian Capital Territory, the Government had decided to impose two new duties in the Territory. The first is to be imposed on new life insurance effected in the Territory and the other on new and transferred motor vehicle registrations in the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill and three associated Bills that I shall introduce shortly, contain the provision necessary for the imposition and collection of the two new charges. </PARA>
<PARA> In announcing the new taxing measures the Treasurer indicated that they would apply from 1 October 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> That remains the Government's intention and it is hoped that passage of the Bills will occur in time for the Bills to come into operation on that date. </PARA>
<PARA> Following approval of the Bills by the Parliament they are to come into operation on the date fixed by proclamation. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the substance of the present Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It will amend the Australian Capital Territory Taxation (Administration) Act 1969 to incorporate machinery provisions for the assessment. Collection and recovery of the two new taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme to be implemented to impose and collect tax on new life insurance effected in the Territory is modelled largely on the existing scheme relating to the tax on general insurance effected in the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Persons who carry on a business of life insurance in the Territory will be required to register with the Commissioner of Taxation and lodge monthly returns of premiums received in respect of taxable life insurance business. </PARA>
<PARA> Insurers will pay the amount of the tax payable in respect of that insurance but will be authorised to pass on the tax by recovering it from the persons liable for payment of premiums. </PARA>
<PARA> For the purposes of the new tax, life insurance falls into two broad categories. </PARA>
<PARA> The first category relates to temporary and term life insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> With this type of insurance, the term of the insurance is limited to a specified period and the sum insured is payable only in the event of death, within that period, of the person whose life is insured. </PARA>
<PARA> If the person does not die in that period, no amount becomes payable under the policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Tax is to be imposed in respect of this category of life insurance at the rate of 5 per cent of the amount of the premium payable in the first year of the insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> The second category is life insurance other than temporary or term insurance.</PARA>
<PARA> Included in this category is whole of life and endowment insurance and the amount of the tax is to be calculated by reference to the sum insured. </PARA>
<PARA> For life insurance with a sum insured greater than $2,000 the amount of tax is to be $1 plus 20 cents for each $200, or part thereof, of the amount of the sum insured that exceeds $2,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Where the sum insured is between $100 and $2,000, the rate of tax will be 10 cents for each $200, or part thereof, of the sum insured. </PARA>
<PARA> Tax on life insurance will not be payable if the person whose life is insured is domiciled outside the territory and stamp duty or other similar tax imposed by a state or other territory has been paid in relation to that insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> This exemption is to avoid the possibility of double taxation where a person who takes out life insurance in the ACT is required to pay stamp duty in a state or territory because, for example, he or she lives in that state or other territory. </PARA>
<PARA> An exemption will also be provided for personnel of diplomatic missions of other countries where the other country provides a reciprocal exemption for Australian diplomatic personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the new tax to be imposed on new and transferred vehicle registrations effected in the territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax is to be imposed on the registration of all classes of vehicles, including trailers, that are registered by the registrar of motor vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax will not be imposed where the vehicle to be registered in the name of a person was last registered in that person's name in the Australian Capital Territory or elsewhere in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of the tax is to be calculated at the rate of $2 for each $100, or part thereof, of the market value of the vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA> Persons seeking registrations on which tax is to be imposed will be required to state to the registrar of motor vehicles the market value of the vehicle and to tender payment to the registrar of the amount of the tax payable on the basis of that value. </PARA>
<PARA> The registrar will not register a vehicle if these requirements are not complied with, unless the registration sought is exempt from tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Exemptions from the tax will broadly follow existing exemptions from other classes of ACT stamp duties and taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, vehicles registered to public hospitals, public benevolent institutions, religious institutions, public educational institutions and to diplomatic missions and their personnel of reciprocating countries will not attract tax. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, exemption will apply to licensed motor vehicle dealers in the ACT in respect of vehicles held by them as trading stock for resale. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, it has been decided to provide an exemption for certain disabled persons. </PARA>
<PARA> Disabled persons who will be eligible for exemption are those who would qualify for exemption from sales tax in respect of the purchase of a new vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA> The exemptions from stamp tax will, however, apply to both new and secondhand vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA> A memorandum containing more detailed explanations of the technical aspects of this Bill and the three other Bills to which I have referred is being made available to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the present Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY TAX (LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS) BILL 1981</PARA>
<PARA> This is a further Bill associated with the Australian Capital Territory Taxation (Administration) Amendment Bill 1981, which I introduced a short time ago. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated in speaking to that Bill, tax is to be imposed on life insurance effected in the ACT and the purpose of this Bill is to impose the tax, at the rates declared in the Bill, on two categories of life insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> Tax payable in respect of temporary or term life insurance is to be calculated at the rate of 5 per cent of the premium payable for the first year of cover. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of life insurance other than temporary or term insurance, the Bill will impose tax calculated by reference to the amount of the sum insured.</PARA>
<PARA> For sums insured greater than $2,000, tax will be at the rate of $1 plus 20 cents for each $200, or part thereof, of the amount of the sum insured in excess of $2,000. </PARA>
<PARA> For sums insured between $100 and $2,000, tax will be at the rate of 10 cents for each $200, or part thereof, of the sum insured. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes provision for the exemptions from tax which I referred to earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY TAX (VEHICLE REGISTRATION) BILL 1981</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill, in association with the Australian Capital Territory Taxation (Administration) Amendment Bill 1981 which I have just introduced, is to impose a tax, at the rate declared in the Bill, on new and transferred registrations of motor vehicles and trailers in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax will apply to all classes of vehicles required to be registered, other than those registered to persons or institutions eligible for exemptions that I have already referred to in relation to the previous Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The rate of tax is to be $2 for each $100, or part thereof, of the market value of the motor vehicle or trailer to be registered. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the exemptions to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY TAX(INSURANCE BUSINESS) AMENDMENT BILL(No. 2) 1981</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is the last of the budget package of bills in relation to stamp duties and taxes in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in consequence of the proposal to tax new life insurance effected in the Territory and its purpose is to withdraw an existing exemption from the tax on general insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> The exemption I refer to is in respect of personal accident and sickness insurance which is undertaken solely in connection with life insurance. There is, however, no exemption for personal accident and sickness insurance not connected with life insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> Now that it is proposed to tax life insurance effected in the Territory, there is no longer any case for retaining the limited exemption of life insurance-related accident and sickness insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> All accident and sickness insurance effected in the Territory will now bear the tax rate that applies to general insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be easy for the Opposition to take a negative position in regard to this legislation because it has some misgivings about the various tax Bills which are now being dealt with in a cognate way. They do pose some difficulties for us, but because they also have some positive features the Opposition does not intend to oppose the Bills. However, the Opposition will move an amendment because it has some differences of opinion with the Government in regard to the Bills under discussion. In general, we see the Bills as going a small way towards regularising the situation of revenue collection in the Australian Capital Territory. We are very conscious that the residents of the Australian Capital Territory have expressed in a number of ways their opposition to the Government's proposals. Nevertheless, we see the current system of revenue raising and distribution in the Territory as being ad hoc and iniquitous, and to that extent we agree with the locals. I will therefore be moving an amendment to the Australian Capital Territory Taxation (Administration) Amendment Bill 1981 and, in regard to the Australian Capital Territory Stamp Duty Amendment Bill, I foreshadow the following amendment:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) is of the opinion that-</PARA>
<PARA> (A) it is not appropriate to consider increases or changes in the rates of stamp duty and similar tax in the Australian Capital Territory until the financial arrangements for the Territory have been inquired into and reported on by the Grants Commission, and</PARA>
<PARA> (B) the operation of the Principal Act should cease on 1 July 1982 prior to which all rates of stamp duty and similar State and municipal type taxes in the Australian Capital Territory should be reviewed in accordance with recommendations of the Grants Commission,</PARA>
<PARA> (2) notes that the reference to the Grants Commission promised over 2 years ago has not been initiated, and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) calls on the Government to refer the matter to the Grants Commission immediately for early report'. </PARA>
<PARA>I make it clear that this amendment is not an attempt to defeat the Bill, for a number of reasons. Because the location of the Australian Capital Territory and the relative rates of stamp duty and other charges, such action, if successful, would mean that the Australian Capital Territory would continue to be a tax haven for the signing of documents and the avoidance of stamp duties which normally would be paid in other areas. Of course, we agree with the Government that that has been a loophole which has been exploited particularly by a range of people who are in a position to take advantage of that current tax haven arrangements. The Opposition agrees wholeheartedly with the Government about the problems of tax collection in this country and the endeavours that have been made, albeit to small, to overcome the poblems of tax evasion and organised tax avoidance. The Opposition does not want to encourage a tax haven situation to continue any longer in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> If our amendment is carried it will in no way affect the passage of the Bill. It would be very easy for us to bang the drum and make a lot of noise and express sympathy with those who do not wish to see further charges levied on Australian Capital Territory residents. However, that is not a responsible position to take because we do not have the empirical evidence that ought to be available to us to see whether the increased charges proposed are justified, having regard to a number of factors. The Treasurer, Mr Howard, tells us that the rationale for this latest levy on Canberra people is the need to bring the Australian Capital Territory into line with the States. That is a reasonable argument and we do not quibble with it. However, it is strange that that rationale is not used in regard to other aspects of the Canberra economy. For example, recently Canberra's air fares were increased by 38 per cent when there was a national increase of only 7 per cent. That must be a real burden on the residents of Canberra. If they want to visit Sydney by first class air travel they now have to pay $88 for that privilege. Likewise, Canberra's petrol prices are considerably higher than those just outside the Territory's boundary. I am informed that over the border in New South Wales there is a great difference in the price of petrol, which is an important commodity to the residents of Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government says that it wants to treat Canberra equally with the States, and that is fair enough, it needs to be treated equally with the States on all levels. That is not happening, and that is what causes the Opposition's misgivings about the legislation. The same argument the Government has used is being used to increase rates by an average of 13 per cent, despite the fact that there is an accumulated surplus in the municipal accounts of $6.8m. I remind the Senate that in New South Wales the State Government policy, which local government is obliged to carry out unless there are special circumstances, is that local government rates are limited to annual increases of no more than 10 per cent. An increased burden is being imposed on Canberra people and it is being imposed by the Fraser Government. All of this is happening before the Commonwealth Grants Commission can get down to examining the finances of the Australian Capital Territory. One can say only that a great measure of incompetence is involved in bringing forward this legislation in respect of the charges and levies that are suggested. The Government has failed to give to the Grants Commission the very desirable objective of examining the whole tax structure and income and expenditure structure of the national capital, and the residents who live in it will suffer as a result of the failure of the Government to provide such a reference to the Grants Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> As a matter of urgency we clearly need to have the Grants Commission examine funding in the Australian Capital Territory. I would hope that the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) would give serious consideration to this suggestion, particularly if the Senate supports the amendment which we are proposing. The Opposition and the people of the Australian Capital Territory are concerned about this anomalous position. The point of our amendment is to prod the Government, to force it to accept its responsibilities and get about its business of carrying out a proper economic survey of the funding arrangements for the Australian Capital Territory. These extra charges will add to the cost of daily expenses for most Australian Capital Territory dwellers. Soon they will be demanding to know where this publicly raised revenue is being expended. On the basis of the propositions and views being expressed to honourable senators and to their local representatives, they certainly feel that the revenue is not being collected and spent in an equitable way. </PARA>
<PARA> The maintenance of a tax haven-we hope that question will be resolved by this legislation-is only one aspect of the Bills that we are considering. The maintenance of a tax haven in the Australian Capital Territory will not solve the problems with respect to revenue collection and expenditure to which I am referring. It will not benefit the average resident in the Australian Capital Territory. The closing of the tax haven, which I hope and trust will be the result of this legislation, will put an end to the dealings of unscrupulous business people, speculators, and those who seek to avoid their social and taxation responsibilities. If the Government was being fair to Canberra rather than ripping money from it, it would be doing something more positive to see that we have a proper formula to ensure that we in Canberra get a reasonable share of the revenue that we pay to the Commonwealth of Australia. I hope that the Government will pay attention to these demands. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills that have had their first reading today and which are now the subject of a cognate debate, that is the Australian Capital Territory Tax (Life Insurance Business) Bill and the Australian Capital Territory Taxation (Administration) Bill, are related. That is why we did not object to them being debated cognately. However, some important points ought to be made. We believe that the Commonwealth Grants Commission has a responsibility to meet and consider promises made in relation to the Australian Capital Territory by the Government. It has not done so and we do not know when it will. We are of the view that there has been a dereliction of duty in this regard. The residents of the Australian Capital Territory should not be treated unfairly, as may be the case in respect of these latter Bills with which we are dealing. They should not be worse off because of being governed by the Commonwealth. We should establish equity and equality of administration throughout the Commonwealth. Revenue is raised from Australian Capital Territory residents but they have no say in how it is distributed. Indeed, they have no idea of how it is distributed. I think this raises the very pertinent question of no taxation without representation. </PARA>
<PARA> We know already that in the Australian Capital Territory there is a rising demand for the residents to have a much greater say in the way in which revenue is collected and expended. We think that that is a fair proposition. It ought to have support of the Senate majority. We hope that the views we have expressed, and our misgivings and criticisms, will prod the Government into taking the essential steps which certainly would resolve the difficulties in the minds of the Opposition. It certainly would help in preparing a case that I am sure all reasonable residents of Canberra would subsequently be prepared to support. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a little concerned that in yesterday's Canberra Times there was an article quoting a speech made by Senator Reid in this place about these very Bills. I have looked through Tuesday's copy of Hansard and I cannot find any such speech. I do not know how these things happen. I find it somewhat disturbing that speeches made in this place are not reported in the newspapers but speeches that are not made here are subsequently reported. So we have a most unusual situation which I hope will be rectified by those people who have the responsibility of reporting the events of the Parliament. We want the Opposition's position clearly understood by the residents of the Australian Capital Territory, and I am sure that that would be the view of the majority of the members of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I move the following amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Australian Capital Territory Taxation (Administration) Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave out all words after ''That'', insert: 'consideration of the Bill be deferred until (a) the Senate is provided with detailed comparisons with overall localised taxes and revenue measures applied in the States and the Northern Territory, and (b) the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly is consulted on the application in the Australian Capital Territory of State related taxes and that the Assembly be requested to provide a list of priorities for concessions from State type fees and taxes, in order that the ACT will have comparable rights to choose its own priorities as enjoyed by the States and the Northern Territory'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These Bills concern basically the State-like activities of the Commonwealth Government in relation to the Australian Capital Territory. The Australian Democrats' position is quite clear-that the sooner the Australian Capital Territory moves towards self-government in terms of control over its own domestic affairs, the better. We hold this view for two reasons. First, we believe very strongly that the full notion of taxation without representation can certainly be brought forward in relation to these Bills. That phrase 'no taxation without representation' has caused revolutions in other parts of the world. It probably would not do so here, given the response to the referendum held a couple of years ago. Nevertheless, I think that since then there has been considerable discussion within the Australian Capital Territory. There is a growing acceptance on the part of people in the community of the view that they need a direct say in their own affairs and control over the revenue raising that is undertaken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) relied in her second reading speech almost entirely on the notion that these Bills bring the Australian Capital Territory into line with the circumstances in the States. By and large, if one goes through the Bills in detail, that indeed is the case. The charges and the increases in charges to a large extent meet that criterion. Of course honourable senators are aware that States differ in the amount of taxes that they apply: but by and large the Minister's comment that these charges bring the Australian Capital Territory into line with other States is correct. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it does seem a rather odd type of justification for a government which many times-as short a period as eight months ago when on the election trail-has proclaimed that it is a low tax party. If the Liberal Party and the National Country Party are low tax parties I cannot see how they can rely on a claim that they are bringing these taxes into line with States as reasonable support for increasing charges. One would have thought that the Federal Government may very well have taken up the cudgels in support of its proclaimed low taxation stance; that it would have said that it would not increase charges in the Australian Capital Territory, as a forerunner and as a signal to the states that they should also lower charges in these areas. I think that these Bills, and the reliance of the Minister upon that particular idea, show the rhetoric that goes on so often in this country during election campaigns. What is said is simply rhetoric. It does not correspond to the governance of the country. The sooner those types of slogans that are bandied around are dispensed with the better. At least people would then have a surer base on which to make a decision at the election. </PARA>
<PARA> We are indebted to Senator Gietzelt for raising in the terms of his amendment matters which greatly concern people in the Australian Capital Territory. The Australian Democrats will certainly support the motion that has been moved by Senator Gietzelt that the Senate express the opinion that the Commonwealth Grants Commission's inquiry into the finances of the Australian Capital Territory is long overdue. Once it has completed its inquiry, the citizens of Australia who live here may have the advantage of finding out how much they pay and how much they get back. That ability and privilege is the privilege of every other citizen in this country. The citizens of the Australian Capital Territory alone are deprived of actually knowing what happens with their money and whether they are getting value for the dollars that they pay. </PARA>
<PARA> As we know, the taxes that are raised in these seven Bills will go straight into Consolidated Revenue and that is where they will disappear. They are not marked specifically for the citizens of the Australian Capital Territory. As Senator Gietzelt has argued, unless the Grants Commission actually gets to work on the finances of the Australian Capital Territory we will never know whether the Territory is paying its way. I believe on the evidence, contrary to popular opinion, that the ACT is paying its way and probably paying more into the national coffers than it gets back. I am dispensing with the notional amounts that we find in the accounts that go into other Federal activities in the ACT in the same way as they would not be counted against a State Budget for Federal activities in other States in the Commonwealth. That is my belief, and when the Grants Commission has finally done its homework on ACT finances it will be possible to show that to the rest of Australia. The people of Canberra would probably then not have to put up with claims that they are leeches on the rest of the country's taxpayers. It is for those reasons that one would support the amendment moved by Senator Gietzelt. Given the speech of the Liberal Party Senator for the ACT, I hope that she also will be supporting that opinion of the Senate. From what she said about the report and from what I remember of her speech in the House, I presume that she supports that idea. I expect that she will vote with us in any division which may be called. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter that I think needs to be raised in relation to these Bills is that in them are a number of charges corresponding to States charges. I also point to the fact that this Parliament has a responsibility, in the same way that a State parliament has a responsibility, to promote the growth of the Territory in relation to these charges. For example, in my State of Queensland, the Government is looking at this whole notion of stamp duty and associated charges with the idea of lowering or possibly even abolishing such charges and thereby making the State an attraction to industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we are all very much aware that the ACT has grown basically on finances from the operations of the Public Service. However, there is a growing body of people in private enterprise in the ACT who wish to promote private enterprise here and promote the growth of industries which would then give a diversified base to the economy and would not make the Territory so vulnerable to shifts in policies by this Parliament. At present if the Federal Government sneezes then the whole of the Australian Capital Territory comes down with a very bad attack of influenza. I think the people in private enterprise in the Australian Capital Territory are hoping, in the short term, to reduce that bout to at least a cold. At the moment they are struggling up hill to establish such a thing. </PARA>
<PARA> As I had to mention again last night, one would imagine that a government committed to the notion of private enterprise would be seeking to support that diversification of the economy within the Australian Capital Territory, as it is the duty of this Parliament to do, so that the private enterprise sector can grow and flourish here. However, instead of taking that far sighted view, and a view that we should act in the same way as a State government should act and therefore look at developing a private enterprise base in the Australian Capital Territory, we have an imposition of charges to make the Australian Capital Territory as uninsteresting a prospect to come to as any of the other States. I imagine that when my State of Queensland quite shortly moves in regard to stamp duty it will be necessary to introduce another Bill in to this House removing the stamp duties now being imposed or we will lose the little private enterprise that has been attracted so far to the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Government will look again at its rhetoric in this regard and bring that into line to give some additional incentive to attract to the Australian Capital Territory particularly technological industries, which could be very well based in this Territory and developed. I point of course to the growing problem in the Australian Capital Territory of unemployed youth and the very high percentage of unemployment. Therefore, there is a very obvious need to look at a further diversification of the industry base. I speak in the same way as I would if I were in a State parliament. I believe that unless the Australian Capital Territory can get to the stage of being independent, that is where we are stuck. We have to look at the problem in that way and we have to work on it in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> The House of Assembly has been elected by the people of the Australian Capital Territory to be the democratic voice of the people of the Territory, at least insofar as advice going to the Minister for the Capital Territory. That is enshrined in the Act that set up the assembly. I think we are all very much aware of the political realities in this context. The Australian Labor Party has a majority of members in the Assembly and therefore the Liberal-National Country Party Government has constantly ignored and humiliated the Assembly in its dealings. I suggest that it would be far better if the Government took a broader and a democratic view that, regardless of the political composition of the House of Assembly, it is in fact the democratic voice of the people of the Australian Capital Territory. In the last election the people of the Australian Capital Territory chose a majority of ALP members to express their points of views. That is their democratic right and it should be respected. But all we have had since that election is a denigration of that democratic voice expressed on the part of the people of the Australian Capital Territory. When we come to these Bills we find exactly the same thing occurring-again a denigration of the voice of the Assembly. The Assembly is not consulted. No dialogue takes place with it. The reason given is: 'We know the type of thing it would come back with because there is no clear majority'. I suggest that to take such a view is to take an anti-democratic view and is in fact an insult to the people who voted in members who are in a majority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I thank the Senate. I need to deal with the approach that these Bills ought to be deferred until the Senate receives some information relating to the comparisons of the taxes in the Australian Capital Territory compared with those in the States and the Northern Territory. As far as the foreshadowed amendment is concerned, it seeks some deferral of the measures until there can be consideration by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The Commonwealth Grants Commission has before it a number of inquiries, including the revue of tax sharing arrangements and health grants, as was decided at the June 1981 Premiers Conference. The Commission also has continuing inquiries in respect of special grants apart from the inquiry into the Australian Capital Territory finances. The Government has not taken a decision as to whether the tax sharing inquiry or the inquiry into the Australian Capital Territory finances should have the Commission's first priority. It seems unlikely that the Commission will be able to report on the inquiry into the Australian Capital Territory finances this fiscal year. I want the Opposition and the Australian Democrats to note that: It seems unlikely that the Commission will be able to report on the inquiry into the Australian Capital Territory finances this fiscal year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, the foreshadowed amendment to the proposals which are before us-that is, that we ought to defer consideration of the Bill, believing that we will receive some instant solution from the Grants Commission to the position of the financing of the Australian Capital Territory-is not a realistic proposal in the context of this year's Budget. The Bills before us are Bills arising from the Budget for the 1981-82 year. Certainly, this is an opportune time to talk of the need for an inquiry into the Australian Capital Territory finances. But to suggest that we could defer these Bills, which properly raise revenue and place the Australian Capital Territory into a far sounder comparison with the other States and the Northern Territory, seems to me to ignore the fact that these are Budget Bills of 1981-82 which raise the revenue for the Budget of this year. There is a strong case for increasing stamp duties in the Australian Capital Territory this year. Most of the rates which apply in the Territory have not been changed since they were introduced in 1969. They are generally lower than those which apply in the States. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Gietzelt said that the Australian Labor Party would not support a proposal that would allow the Australian Capital Territory to become a stamp duty haven for the rest of Australia. That would be quite contrary to anyone's attitude with regard to how the stamp duties and other charges in the States and Territories should operate. The stamp duties in the Australian Capital Territory at present apply to a narrower range of instruments and transactions than those which apply in the States. Lower rates of stamp duties in the Territory tend to encourage transactions to take place in the Australian Capital Territory when they would otherwise properly take place in the States to which those companies or instruments ought properly be referred. That is-I think the Opposition said that we should not support this measure-the Australian Capital Territory is a stamp duty haven. Any State that had not increased its normal charges from 1969 certainly would not be regarded as one that was paying its way in relation to the charges which are the subjects of these Bills. To suggest that we ought to defer these Bills until we have considered the comparisons ignores the facts that since 1969 the States have raised their revenue properly from increases in many of the charges that we now apply to the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been representations from the States of Australia that they are against permitting the lower rates of stamp duties to continue since they diminish the States' own ability to raise taxes. Those who want to talk about democracy and all the rest of it would have to take into account the argument that the six States and the Northern Territory have the capacity to deal with instruments, the conveyancing of property, insurance and other matters which are the subject of these Bills. The States raise their charges. To have the Australian Capital Territory as a stamp duty haven would seem to me to be a quite improper suggestion that ought not to be allowed to continue. The States have made strong representations against the Australian Capital Territory continuing at the present level of taxes and charges-or the lack of them, in some cases-that do apply. I think it would be far preferable to accept that there are a number of ways of adjusting the Australian Capital Territory finances, apart from stamp duty charges, that would be available to the Government for consideration when the report of the Grants Commission into Australian Capital Territory finances is received. When we have a report which looks comprehensively at the capacity to raise funds in this Territory we will be looking at the whole range of options. We will not be suggesting that we will not raise taxes and charges that have not been raised since 1969 and regard that as an absolute solution. We will say that the stamp duty charges for the Australian Capital Territory, properly raised in 1981-82 year, will not prejudice any action that might be appropriate once the Commission's report is received. </PARA>
<PARA> It would seem to me that if the Senate were to embark upon that course, it should take note of the fact that a report from an inquiry into the Australian Capital Territory finances would be an appropriate way to deal with future funding of the requirements of the Australian Capital Territory, and it should recognise that the proposals in the Budget of this year to raise the charges and taxes in the Australian Capital Territory are broadly comparable with the State of New South Wales. I cannot see why there ought to be this approach which has been taken by the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. They suggest that in some way we can ignore the fact that these measures are part of this year's Budget and that they are money raising Bills for this year's Budget, and that we should with some gay abandon say that we can delay the Bills until such time as we get a report which is most unlikely to be received this fiscal year. It certainly will not be received in time for these taxes to be applied from the Budget date as was announced by the Treasurer (Mr Howard).</PARA>
<PARA> I have information also with regard to the Grants Commission inquiry. The proposal ought to be resisted for these reasons: The resources of the Grants Commission are limited and, as presently constituted, the Commission will probably not be able to undertake a review of its 1981 report on State tax sharing entitlements and inquire into the health grants while, at the same time, undertaking an inquiry into Australian Capital Territory finances. Therefore, it is a question of priorities. The Government will need to consider which of the inquiries should take precedence. Although the inquiry into Australian Capital Territory finances is a matter of importance and the review of State tax sharing entitlements is a matter of major importance, affecting as it does the six State governments, the comparative priorities that arise when considering these two factors need to be looked at. At this time the Government is stressing that it will welcome a Grants Commission inquiry into Australian Capital Territory finances, however, with the resources of the Grants Commission and the very specialised work that needs to be undertaken with regard to the State tax sharing entitlements and the health grants, it is unlikely that the report into Australian Capital Territory finances would be available this fiscal year. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I most strenuously need to say to the Senate that to deal with this matter in the way in which the amendments propose is to refuse to pass the Bills of this year's Budget. I wish those who embark upon that course to recognise the realities of the course on which they embarked. If they want to go out and tear up some statutory declarations perhaps they had better do so because to embark upon the carriage of an amendment that refuses to pass essential money raising Bills of the 1981-82 Budget has consequences for those who have asserted some of the things we have heard over recent months. I commend the Bills to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take advantage of the first reading of these departure tax Bills to raise fairly briefly a number of matters. I have been persuaded to do so by the contribution made in this place yesterday by Senator Withers about partisan politics and what it is doing to the political debate generally in Australia. I remind Senator Withers that he was the hatchet man for the partisan politics of 1974 and 1975. However, leaving that aside, I wish to refer to certain incidents during the New South Wales elections which show the depths to which the Liberal Party is prepared to go in order to win votes in an hysterical campaign against the Labor Government in New South Wales, and in particular against three candidates that I know personally. It was a campaign of vilification; one that can only be described as despicable, contemptible and the lowest form of dirty partisan politics. I refer to the electorates of Woronora, Miranda and Manly, in which the Liberal Party quite deliberately and carefully set about a fear campaign associated with public housing to try to panic the electors into voting against the Labor candidates in those electorates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer first to a campaign, which honourable senators will remember hit the New South Wales newspapers fairly prominently, about a New South Wales Labor Government proposition to erect public housing in the suburb of Menai, and the very callous and subversive way in which the Liberal Party organisation, including its Leader and the shadow Minister for Housing, were brought into the campaign in the hope that they would panic electors in that area about welfare housing. Some 12 years ago the Sutherland Shire Council, in preparing the local planning scheme, set aside land in the Menai area for the purpose of public housing. That scheme was approved by the Council and by the State Government, but following representations made by two large development companies, Stocks and Holdings and Parkes Development, to the then Liberal Minister for Housing, the section of the plan which provided for public housing in the Menai region was withdrawn. I am prepared to assert that that was done on the basis of donations to the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason the Sutherland Shire Council sought to provide a social mix for the 50,000 people who will live in the township of Menai was that sociologists, town planners, welfare organisations generally and, properly so, local government took the view that it was essential to stop the creation of ghetto and segregation types of housing policies. It was felt that working class people, particularly those on low incomes and those who were not able to provide housing from their own means-and therefore needed the assistance of the Commonwealth and State governments in the form of welfare housing-should not be segregated in certain areas of Sydney but should be spread appropriately throughout the various suburbs of Sydney. In other words, having regard to the balloting system of the Housing Commission in my State of New South Wales, it was felt that they should have an opportunity to live in what can be said to be more salubrious areas, better types of areas, and not be sent out 30 or 40 miles away from the city proper. When the Wran Government resurrected the public housing proposition, the Liberal Party of New South Wales, in a calculated, partisan, political way attempted to panic the people in the Menai region into opposing the proposition. That was done in a chauvinistic, racist, divisive way. Liberal Party organisers, together with some local real estate agents, went about and stirred the locals in that area by suggesting that immigrants, blacks, deserted wives, all the so-called welfare bludgers who normally congregate in the far western suburbs of Sydney, would be put into that delightful area of Menai among all the upper-middle-class types of homes to be erected. </PARA>
<PARA> A similar situation arose in the Miranda electorate where, some 20-odd years ago, the Housing Commission of New South Wales purchased land for the purpose of erecting homes. That was part of a correct planning concept. But the Housing Commission was not able to carry it into effect because the area did not have proper sewerage facilities. The Housing Commission took the view that the development should wait until the area had been properly serviced by the Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board and had been provided with sewerage and water facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> In the electorate of Miranda in the 1950s and 1960s the Labor Government acquired very large tracts of land for the southern expressway. From the north-east to the south-west a large amount of land is publicly owned for expressway development. In that area also the Liberal Party distributed leaflets and conducted a whispering campaign against the Labor candidate, suggesting that the same 'undesirable' type of people would be housed in the area. That was not true. It was known that for the past dozen years under the local councils planning scheme sites had been set aside for public housing and other land had been set aside for future extensions to the southern expressway. What is most alarming about this is that the Liberal candidate, Mr Laurie Power, who is a member of the staff of the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick), was primarily responsible for that despicable campaign in an attempt to win votes for the seat of Miranda. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it dirty, partisan politics of the type to which Senator Withers referred, when people are aroused on an emotional issue, a racist issue, a chauvinist issue, a divisive issue, an issue that ought not to be raised-an issue concerning the incomes of people who cannot meet housing costs. Housing costs are as high as they are as a result of the economic policies pursued deliberately by the Fraser Government over a considerable period of years and pursued prior to that by the Menzies and McMahon administrations. There has been a deliberate policy of restricting public sector activity in both housing and public works throughout Australia. We know from the debates we have had in this place just how much this Fraser Government has cut back State funding for public housing in the current Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the electoral seat of Manly, with which one of my colleagues is intimately associated, and to the same type of slanderous statements made in that area. The Liberal Party candidate for that seat said that slum-type housing developments would take place in Manly if the Labor Government were returned to office in the State election. That sort of propaganda, that sort of calumny, that sort of attempt to play on the emotions of people I regard as despicable and ill-becoming a person acting in a representative capacity in our country. In addition to that, I have had handed to me a copy of a letter which was sent out by the Minister for Health, the honourable member for Warringah, Mr MacKellar, to every elector in the electorate of Manly-some 32,000 of them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. That is the party that does not believe in public funding. This letter is written on parliamentary stationery of the Honourable M.J.R. MacKellar, the honourable member for Warringah, and reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Dear Elector,</PARA>
<PARA> On the 19th September the State Elections will be held. </PARA>
<PARA> Here in Manly, Nelson Meers is the candidate who has proved his ability. </PARA>
<PARA> His record of service to the public is a long one. Firstly as an Alderman, then Deputy Lord Mayor, and finally as Lord Mayor of Sydney he assisted and then guided the development of one of the great cities of the world. None of the other candidates for Manly can match that service. None of them can claim a similar capacity to handle the big jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>He is a man who served in local government. He ought to know something about the importance of a social mix in our society. He ought not to be associated with divisive statements and tactics in order to win votes in an election. Mr MacKellar goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Nelson Meers has taken the time and made the real personal effort needed to properly represent Manly. </PARA>
<PARA>Does that mean that he does not believe that people on low incomes, deserted wives and widows perhaps even our parents who do not have the capacity to live in a home of their own should constantly have their names on the New South Wales housing list, which presently contains 45,000 names? I remind honourable senators that the fact that the list is as long as that is not an indictment of the New South Wales Government, irrespective of its political complexion. All the other States have a similarly long list. That is why all the State housing commissions were so caustic about the cut-back in funding for welfare housing in the present Budget. The Minister goes on to state in his letter:</PARA>
<PARA> He has not only attended meetings and functions of a multitude of community groups, he has also slogged it out, day by day-door-knocking all over the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> Lately, Mr Wran and the Labor Government have been trying to ''buy'' the Manly electorate with all sorts of promises. This has happened as a result of the pressure applied by the fact that Mr Meers is such a good strong candidate. </PARA>
<PARA> Manly needs such a representative in the State Parliament. I urge you to support Nelson Meers and vote for him on the 19th September. </PARA>
<PARA>M. J. R. MacKELLAR Member for Warringah</PARA>
<PARA>Coupled with that is a letter from the Manly Liberal Campaign Committee, signed personally by Nelson Meers. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Resident,</PARA>
<PARA> A number of people have expressed their concern to me about the pollution problem on Manly's beaches. Summer is not that far away and it will bring with it our concern about swimming in a polluted surf. </PARA>
<PARA> I know this is a matter which is of vital importance and it is not good enough for us to have to wait another ten years before sewage is taken out to sea. </PARA>
<PARA> There are quicker and more effective solutions and at the coming election I will be standing on a policy of getting immediate action on this matter for you. </PARA>
<PARA> Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA>NELSON MEERS</PARA>
<PARA>They illustrate attempts made by candidates for public office to play upon the fears of people. Yesterday we saw a bipartisan approach adopted in a debate in this chamber. You yourself, Mr Acting Deputy President, participated in it. Senator Withers expressed a view which is commonly expressed in many parts of our country. The fact is that, whilst he expressed those sentiments, at the same time ignoring the performance of his party and the partisan political dogfights of 1974-75, in Sydney in the weeks immediately preceding the New South Wales election we witnessed the playing of gutter-type politics, politics of the lowest level, politics which ought to be rejected by any decent, right-thinking person. Statements were made at the expense of people who cannot help themselves with housing. People would have to earn an income of about $300 a week to provide themselves with housing. People who could not provide their own housing were placed in a category and regarded by the organisers of Liberal candidates in the New South Wales election as being second class citizens. I believe that that sort of gutter-type politics, partisan-type politics, ought to be deplored by anybody worthy of being a representative in this Parliament or, for that matter, anybody wanting to stand for political office, representing any political party in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -After listening to the speech of Senator Gietzelt I am not sure whether the comments I am about to make are really appropriate. But I want to use the opportunity afforded at the first reading stage of the legislation before us to draw attention to one of our national sports in Australia, namely, the national sport of attacking members of parliament. It was put very plainly and succinctly to me recently by one of my colleagues that Australians love to hate their politicians. When I hear disparaging comments about members of parliament-those disparaging comments are often made by the media, especially the print media-I become concerned. I become concerned not for myself or for my parliamentary colleagues but for those who make the comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If critical comments about members of parliament happen to be correct, they reflect on those who make the comments because it is they who elect their representatives to State and Federal legislatures. If they are not satisfied with the quality of their elected representatives, the remedy is in their hands. At the time of an election they can do whatever they can within the law to have the candidate of their choice elected. When I mention that to some people they bring back what is perhaps an obvious rejoiner. They say: 'The choice we are given at election time is not really an acceptable choice'. If that is so and if some people are interested in having members of parliament whom they can respect, it is their duty to join a political party of their choice so that, through that political party, they can choose a candidate who can represent himself or herself to the electorate. Of course, people need not join a political party; they could stand for election themselves as independents or they could support an independent. I reiterate for those who are dissatisfied that the remedy is in their hands. They would be far better taking some positive action than engaging in continual harping criticism of members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Before proceeding any further I wish to emphasise that I regard most of the criticism of members of parliament as unfounded. All in all, the quality and dedication of the nation's parliamentary representatives is first class. We may disagree with one another in this chamber and members of the House of Representatives may disagree with each other, but the quality of representation is in fact good. I do not usually react to unfounded criticism of this nature because I do not like to give it the dignity of being recognised. Like most members of parliament I accept criticism without complaint. But as an aside, I question why our spouses and children should have to accept the unfounded criticism about members of parliament when they, the spouses and children, have to put up with what is virtually a single parent family status. Perhaps more importantly, however, I do not see why the institution of parliament should be, by inference, subjected to unfounded criticism. But I should not disgress on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> What I intend to raise this afternoon is a current television advertisement which deliberately belittles members of parliament in an effort to boost the sales of a particular company. This advertisement was shown this week on Canberra commercial television. I do not know whether it is still being shown, but it certainly could be. This morning and this afternoon I tried to obtain a transcript of the advertisement, but my efforts were to no avail. I just mention some of the steps that I took to try to obtain the transcript because I am sure that if I do not the company concerned will criticise me for not having done as much as I possibly could to make sure that what I put before the Senate this afternoon is correct. </PARA>
<PARA> As the advertisement was shown on Channel 7 in Canberra I first of all contacted that television station which told me that it could not give me any further information, that in fact, because of the way television commercials are scheduled, it was not possible to pull out the exact advertisement I was interested in. Channel 7 suggested that I contact a certain agency in Wagga which handled the account of the company that I will talk about shortly. I contacted that agency which referred me to RVN2, a Wagga television station, which apparently produced this advertisement. It was suggested to me by RVN2 that the transcript of the television advertisement could not be made available unless it was cleared with the client-the company concerned. That is when I ran into a dead end because the manager of this company was on holidays and his telephone in Wagga did not answer. So at that stage I decided that it would not be of any use trying to pursue the matter further. </PARA>
<PARA> I neglected to mention that at one stage I contacted the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations which told me that it had not heard of this advertisement, that the advertisement had not been cleared through it. I have not actually seen the advertisement but I have been reliably informed about it by members of my family who saw the advertisement on Channel 7 during the week. The advertisement-again I mention that I do not have a transcript-goes something like this: 'When Laurie Oakes broke the story about politicians not working hard, he forgot to report the real reason-they are overfed on Tancred meats'. Some of us may look a little overfed. But perhaps it is going a little too far to refer in a television commercial to a matter which is currently before the House of Representatives Privileges Committee and then to say that politicians are not working hard because they happen to be overfed on Tancred meats. The advertisement mentioned the Tancred specials for the week and what the prices would be. It then made the final statement: 'You don't need a politician's salary to afford this'. Again I mention that I do not have the transcript and I would be pleased to receive one in due course. However, I have given a broad outline of this advertisement. </PARA>
<PARA> The advertisement belittles members of parliament in an attempt to boost the sales of Tancred meat. I must admit that I have not heard of the firm before; it is not a firm that operates in the area where I live. I have certainly heard of it now and probably I am giving it some free advertising. But the company uses the devise of attacking members of parliament for its own commercial purposes. As I outlined earlier, we should accept the fact that members of the Parliament will be criticised. But I do not think we should accept criticism which is put forward to try to boost the sales of a company such as Tancred meats. This advertisement may appear slick to the particular advertising agency which wrote the copy, but I think the copy is really a reflection on the advertising industry. I will certainly be contacting Tancreds-I am not able to do so at the moment because the manager is still on holidays-to suggest that it withdraws this corny and inappropriate advertisement immediately. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EJ4">Senator SIBRAA</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(4.16)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition opposes the Departure Tax Amendment Bill 1981 and the Departure Tax Collection Amendment Bill 1981. This increase in the rate of departure tax is one that one would expect in a banana republic. In fact, it is a very popular tax in a number of the Third World nations where there is no tourism, where people think it is legitimate to sock visitors to the country-businessmen and government officials who are passing through. If one examines the financial position of a number of these countries one may find that it is a legitimate tax but in a country such as Australia it is not a legitimate tax. In fact, in Australia it is a tax on tourists. The Government has given no reason for this increase. It is a straight out tax grab for revenue reasons only. I believe if the Government were sincere about imposing a departure tax that meant something for the tourist industry the receipts from such a tax would go towards promoting tourism in Australia and also towards improving our tourist attractions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation is that $9m has been set aside in the Budget for tourist promotion-and although that is a paltry enough sum, it is an increase of $1m on last year's appropriation-but this new departure tax will generate an additional $18m in revenue. In 1978 when the departure tax was first introduced in Australia we joined 111 other nations which had some sort of departure tax. But in many of those countries, and especially in some of the countries more comparable to Australia, the receipts from that tax are used on the promotion of tourism and the development of tourist attractions. As many honourable senators would be aware, the Australian travel industry opposes the increase. I think all of us have received a copy of the advertisement entitled 'Leaving Australia wasn't meant to be Easy.' in which the Australian Federation of Travel Agents set out in detail its objections to the departure tax increase. I will not go through the whole of the advertisement but I think some parts of its are worth while quoting. The section headed 'The Lucky Country?' reads:</PARA>
<PARA> From October 1 Australia will claim the dubious distinction of having the highest departure tax in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> This isn't just a levy to hit the big tax dodgers and smart-money men. Every Australian over 12 who has saved enough for an overseas trip will pay for the privilege of leaving the lucky country. </PARA>
<PARA> That means an extra $100 on the cost of a simple holiday for a family with three children. </PARA>
<PARA>The section under the heading 'Why make enemies for Australia?' reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government campaign 'Make friends for Australia' was a great idea. Now it's probably just an empty shell. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of sending Australians overseas as happy, smiling ambassadors, today they'll probably scowl. Would you smile if it cost you and your family $100 before you even got on the plane?</PARA>
<PARA> And more's the point, those overseas visitors who do come here will react in exactly the same way when they come to leave. Is this how we're going to make friends for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The advertisement pointed out many other arguments that I will not quote, and in conclusion it states:</PARA>
<PARA> Why not ask the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to drop this restrictive tax?</PARA>
<PARA> Or at least exempt our international visitors from having to pay it. </PARA>
<PARA> It's only going to raise 0.0005% of Budget revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it worth it, to have everyone else sniggering at Australia-the most expensive country in the world to get out of. </PARA>
<PARA>Since the inception of this tax in 1978 it has applied to all people over the age of 18 leaving Australia. It now will apply to people 12 years of ago and over who leave Australia. Why? I think we can legitimately ask why has the age come down from 18 to 12 years. We have got no answer from the Government. I think the answer would be what I said at the start of my speech; that is, this is just another tax grab, another way of raising revenue. The departure tax, since its inception, has raised $49m in three years. Now, in one year, $34m will be raised from this revenue source. Let us look at the position of an Australian family taking perhaps its first trip overseas. It will probably go to New Zealand, the South Pacific or to one of the member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations because it is cheaper to go to those places than it is to have a holiday in some parts of Australia. I think the position was well summed up in an article in the Sydney Daily Mirror on 21 August which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>FAMILIES HIT, MAY CANCEL HOLIDAYS</PARA>
<PARA> Families wanting their first overseas holiday will be hit with federal charges of at least $100 and probably $150 before reaching their plane or ship. </PARA>
<PARA> The penalty for leaving the country was increased in the Budget, with families being hardest hit, and many are sure to cancel their trips. </PARA>
<PARA> Parents with two children, one aged more than 12, will have to pay $120 in new passport fees and departure taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> Two teenagers with their parents will be charged $140 if the children travel on one parent's passport. </PARA>
<PARA> The hidden extras almost equal the lowest air fare from Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>This is where the joke comes in-</PARA>
<PARA>an Apex low season return trip to New Zealand for $236. </PARA>
<PARA>One only has to compare the cost of the trip with the cost of the new charges that travellers have to meet to realise what a farcical situation this is. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> New charges announced in the Budget are $30 for a passport, up $5, and $20 for the departure tax, up $10. </PARA>
<PARA>This departure tax increase will not hurt businessmen who can claim legitimate expenses. They will go on claiming it and the charge can be passed on to their consumers. It will not hurt people who usually travel first class, people who are used to taking trips to Europe, or the regular business class traveller. It will not hurt people who can afford to travel regularly; it will hurt only those people who are struggling to find the money to go on a holiday, and most of all it will affect those people with large families. The departure tax has been increased by 100 per cent but we do not see the same sort of logic being applied to increases in family allowances. As I said before, if the Government were serious about helping tourism it would probably look at introducing a system whereby if there is to be a departure tax that fee could be included in the charge for the ticket when it is sold and the fee would be earmarked for tourism. We could then do away with the wasteful expenses which are incurred by having collection agencies at Australian airports as we have now. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the Opposition believes it is a discriminatory tax which hits those travellers who can least afford to pay it. It has now made Australia the country with the highest cash departure tax in the world. It makes us look like a banana republic. I ask the Australian Democrats, Senator Harradine and those Government senators who are serious about tourism in Australia to join with the Opposition in opposing the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to register my concern in relation to this legislation. Senator Sibraa has raised a number of matters and I do not propose to deal with them at length. Significant sections of the tourist industry in Australia are concerned about the implications of this tax. It is claimed that it is now one of the highest charged by any country. I do believe it is extremely important in Australia's interests and in the interests of the tourist industry that everything possible be done to encourage international visitors to Australia. We have until recently had a declining share of the tourism in the Pacific region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Considerable effort has been undertaken by the Government, by the Australian Tourist Commission and by people involved in the industry to build up confidence, to build up interest and to build up the numbers of international visitors. In that respect there has been, I believe, a very successful campaign. Numbers have been very significantly built up but they are starting to taper off again. I think there are very large markets in some parts of the world which have not yet been fully exploited. The South East Asian market, including Taiwan, is one. As a result of rising prosperity, which enables people to afford to travel and to have an interest in travelling, there is an increasing number of people in that market. Australia is a relatively close destination to those countries. With the prospect of having one of the highest departure taxes of any country Australia is not likely to enhance its developing tourist industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned about whether the mode of collection of the departure tax, by having permanent officers stationed at airports is the most efficient means. Other means are used in other countries. Again, Australia is one of the few countries, if not the only one, to use this method of collection. I understand from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Sir Phillip Lynch, that there has been an interdepartmental committee investigation in relation to the efficiency of this mode of collection and whether there could be cost savings by the introduction of other methods which could result in the tax being reduced. I can only say at this stage that the Government members tourism committee, of which I am chairman, will be exploring those questions further with the appropriate officers from the department involved in that investigation to ascertain whether it is possible to make some change such as that which was suggested by Senator Sibraa and to assess the desirability of adopting some of the other suggestions that have been made from various sections of the tourist industry with a view to relieving the Commonwealth purse of the costs of collection and thereby reducing the tax. I support the legislation with a degree of reservation but in the knowledge and belief that the matter is not finished; it will be further explored. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank the Senate for the debate that has occurred on the departure tax Bills. I understand that the Opposition is opposing the legislation. The Government wishes to see these Bills passed. They are part of the Government's revenue package and part of the Budget. We believe that the additional revenue which will result from these measures will be $14m this year and about $18.7m in a full year. Of course, that is the kind of revenue we require to put into a whole range of social services and other Government activities. There is no doubt that we simply have to raise revenue if we are to spend money on the kinds of services we are being asked daily in this place to support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Representation about the increases have been received from the travel industry, but there is no evidence that tourism has suffered or will suffer from the departure tax or from the higher rate. The tax, which is $20 per person for those aged 12 years and over, is only a small component of total travel costs, by the time one takes into account the cost of fares, accommodation, et cetera. I will say a little more about that in a moment. There is an obvious logic in bringing down the age to 12 years. That is the age for adult ticketing in accordance with airline policy and with the rules of the International Air Transport Association, which puts the adult cut-off point at 12 years. The change has been made to bring the legislation into line. </PARA>
<PARA> I think honourable senators who have expressed concern on behalf of the tourist industry and on behalf of tourism in Australia have made some points that the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) would want to take on board. One point that has not come out and which should be made is that the direct comparison of the departure tax in Australia and in some other countries may not be a valid comparison in each case. </PARA>

Some countries hide their departure tax from people, and some of the amounts involved are quite significant. For example, New Zealand has a departure tax of $35 per adult ticket which the traveller does not know about. He does not know about it because it is included in the ticket price, and that is not made clear. Of course, New Zealand travellers think they are paying a $2 departure tax when in fact they are paying $37 in total.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr President, I wish to make a statement on Constitutional Review. There is a resurgence of interest in the possibilities of constitutional reform. The Governor-General touched on this matter in a widely reported address in Canberra on 1 September. Constitutional review has also been brought into focus by the results of the two referendums held in conjunction with the elections in New South Wales last weekend. Each referendum was carried by a very large majority. One dealt with requiring members of State Parliament to disclose certain pecuniary interests and other matters. The other will extend the maximum period between general elections for the lower House in New South Wales from three to four years. The topic of four year terms is one that has aroused considerable interest in this Parliament. Another subject of discussion has been the possibility of allotting a fixed term to the lower House, so that the Parliament would always run its full term. Some would join the two ideas together, so as to have a fixed four year term for the lower House. However, as I reminded the Senate recently, the two ideas are quite distinct, and they have quite different implications and effects. The Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs has made an examination of the topic of the constitutional qualifications of senators and members. Its 18 recommendations are at present being studied by the Government. Two of the recommendations deal with the topic of pecuniary interests as it affects members of the Federal Parliament. Many of the Committee's recommendations would require amendment of the Constitution if they were to be implemented. The recent public discussion has thrown up a number of issues on which I want to comment. I welcome the renewed debate and the resurgence of interest that lies behind it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Constitutional reform is a matter that must concern everyone who thinks seriously about the future of Australia. The Constitution has been in operation now for over 80 years. In the life of a nation, that is not a very long time. We have to frame our thinking on that basis that the Constitution will regulate the affairs of our country into the 21st century. A number of aspects of our Constitution need to be reviewed. There is the position of the Senate and Supply. At the moment, the Senate has the power to refuse Supply without itself being required to go to the people. In 1975, the situation was able to be resolved by a dissolution of both Houses, under which the people of Australia had an opportunity of expressing their views at a general election. At the Perth meeting of the Australian Constitutional Convention in 1978, a resolution was passed, by a majority of 49 votes to 39, to amend the Constitution so that if the Senate fails to pass Supply within 30 days, there is to be an automatic double dissolution. If the Government is re-elected, it is only necessary for the House of Representatives to pass Supply. The Senate would be by-passed. Interim provision would be made for expenditure of funds to maintain government in the meantime. </PARA>
<PARA> I have dwelt a little on the question of the Senate and Supply, because it is still, in the minds of many, a most significant matter for constitutional review. There are other matters that need review, including those I will enumerate later in referring to the work of Standing Committee D of the Australian Constitutional Convention. However, having made it clear that I think that the Constitution continues to need review, I want to make it equally clear that I completely reject the wild assertions recently made that our existing Constitution is 'unreadable' and that our founding fathers bequeathed to us a federal system that is-and I quote-'at best irrational and at worst unworkable'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, I did not want to attribute that to anybody. Such an exaggerated verdict is demonstrably false. It is also a slur upon those great Australians who drew up our Constitution-Deakin of Victoria, Barton of New South Wales, Griffith of Queensland, Kingston of South Australia, Forrest of Western Australia, and Braddon of Tasmania, to mention just a few. I believe that their work has been crowned with singular success. The constitution they drew up was the birth certificate of a nation. It gave reality to the sentiment of 'a nation for a continent and a continent for a nation'. For example, they ensured that the Constitution could be amended by the Australian people, voting on a federal basis. We take that for granted. By contrast, the present difficulties in Canada in relation to amending the Canadian Constitution show us what a problem this can be. The Constitution-for all the stresses and strains it has undergone from time to time-was a remarkably accomplished document when it was drawn up, and it has served the nation well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next issue I wish to raise is the feasibility of a completely new Constitution. The hope has been expressed that this could be done by 1988, the year of the Australian Bicentenary. That is a very optimistic assessment, having regard to all that would be involved in formulating, discussing, and seeking to get agreement on a completely new Constitution. Many people will think the aim of completely remaking the Constitution is quite unrealistic, and also as more calculated to cause divisions and dissensions within the community than to confirm national solidarity. The fact of the matter is that the case for 'scrapping' the present Constitution cannot be sustained. The Constitution has shown itself capable of being adapted to suit changing social, political, and international circumstances. I mention some of the major developments that have taken place:</PARA>
<PARA> The watershed decision of the High Court in the Engineers case in 1920 upheld the power of the national Parliament to apply its laws to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision in 1942 in the first Uniform Tax Case showed that the national Parliament was able in a time of national crisis to place the finances and revenues of the country on a national footing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Concrete Pipes case in 1971 revived the corporations power of the Commonwealth as a basis for regulating the trading and financial activities of trading and financial corporations and also the activities in Australia of foreign corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Seas and Submerged Lands decision in 1975 laid down the respective constitutional responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the States in respect of off-shore jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is nonsense to assert, as some people do, that there is general agreement that the Constitution is an inadequate instrument for the type of democratic government desired by Australians. The High Court has referred more than once to the silent operation of constitutional principles in the light of which the Constitution can be moulded to serve the nation as it lives, grows and expands. It proved completely adequate, for example, to accommodate Australia's emergence as a sovereign and independent State in the international community. The proper course, and the only practicable course, in my view, is to work for amendments to our existing Constitution. I think we should take some heart from our recent experiences apart altogether from the overwhelming majority in favour of the referendum proposals in New South Wales last weekend. The success rate for national constitutional referendums went from 5 out of 32 to 8 out of 36 as a result of the success of three out of the four proposals that were submitted to electors in 1977. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Constitutional Convention, which was established in 1973, has shown that reforms that have been well thought out are possible. The reforms need, however, to be widely understood and to enjoy general support. It is in this connection that I particularly welcome the initiative of the Law Foundation of New South Wales in establishing a project aimed at initiating a serious national debate on the need for constitutional change. Also, I particularly welcome the following statement by the Director of the Law Foundation, Mr Terry Purcell. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I should emphasise that by backing this project, the Foundation seeks to complement the steps politicans have been taking since the establishment of the Parliamentarians' Constitutional Convention in 1973. </PARA>
<PARA>The Convention also included members of the then Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly. There has been some criticism of the role of the politicians and of the so-called Parliamentarians Convention. The Australian Constitutional Convention held its first meeting in Sydney in 1973. It has since held plenary sessions in Melbourne in 1975, in Hobart in 1976 and in Perth in 1978. It is composed of delegates and representatives chosen by and from Federal, State and Northern Territory parliamentarians and by and from local government representatives and, I think, not just Northern Territory parliamentarians but also ACT Assembly members. One suggestion seems to be that a popular convention might replace the Parliamentarians Convention. The simple fact of the matter is that proposals for constitutional reform can be put to referendum only by an enactment of this national Parliament. I cannot see popular conventions replacing the Parliamentarians Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been made of the popularly elected convention that gave impetus to the drawing up of the Australian Constitution in the 1890s. It is instructive to note that the persons actually elected to that convention were almost invariably parliamentarians, including Ministers. That, I suggest, is why the Australian Constitutional Convention of the late 1890s ultimately succeeded. On the other hand, any assistance from initiatives and discussions outside Parliament can only be to the good. I would not rule out the possibility of interested organisations which undertake such initiatives participating at future meetings of the Australian Constitutional Convention with some kind of special observer status. </PARA>
<PARA> On 2 June last, I told the Senate that the Government would be considering the matter of the next plenary session of the Australian Constitutional Convention. The Government believes that a plenary session of the Convention should take place only when there are substantial proposals which have been sufficiently developed and digested to form the basis of a successful meeting. There is also the need to discuss the matter with State governments. An appropriate opportunity to do so will be taken at an early date. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot emphasise too much that proposals need to be properly developed and digested. In this regard the work currently being carried out by Standing Committee D of the Constitutional Convention, of which I am Chairman, has a direct bearing. The work which was referred to the Committee by the full Convention is not yet complete but I believe it is timely to refer to the various papers that have been commissioned by Committee D. I confirm that that Committee will be meeting in Melbourne on 2 October. I have already mentioned that the Perth session resolved in favour of an automatic double dissolution procedure following the rejection of Supply. Committee D was asked to give the resolution detailed drafting consideration and, on the basis of its discussions and resolutions, a revised draft has been prepared but not yet settled. </PARA>
<PARA> The main features of the revised draft can be briefly summarised as follows: An automatic double dissolution would occur if a Supply Bill is not passed by the Senate within 30 days; if there is a positive rejection by the Senate the Governor-General would have discretionary power to dissolve both Houses. The existing provision for requests to be made by the Senate in relation to money Bills would be retained; passage by the House of Representatives after a double dissolution would be sufficient for presentation of the Bill to the Governor-General for the royal assent; and interim Supply to cover the period of the election would be assured. In addition, the revised draft deals with a number of incidental problems identified in an earlier Standing Committee D report. The suggestion that Supply for more than one year could be obtained at the start of a government's term of office is precluded and the Senate's right to object to the inclusion of extraneous matters in money Bills is strengthened by a procedure which would allow challenges to offending Bills to be instituted in the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal that the maximum term of a parliament be extended to four years is the subject of a paper by Professor Joan Rydon of La Trobe University, in which the historical background of existing terms of Commonwealth and State parliaments, arguments for their extension and the implications of such action are examined. Chief among these in relation to the Commonwealth Parliament is, of course, the question of a change to the term of senators. Also under examination by Committee D is the related proposal for a fixed term for parliaments. The conventions applicable to the operation of the Australian Constitution are also under examination by Committee D in accordance with a request by the Perth Convention. A number of papers have been commissioned on different aspects of this question and honourable senators will be aware that one has already been made publicly available. This is a paper prepared by Dr Cheryl Saunders of Melbourne University and Mr Ewart Smith, formerly a deputy secretary of my Department. That paper sought to identify some of the conventions associated with the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> Other papers have been obtained from Professor Kevin Ryan of Queensland University on the power of the Governor-General to dissolve the House of Representatives and both Houses of Parliament, from Professor Geoffrey Sawer of the Australian National University on conventions governing the appointment and dismissal of Ministers and from Mr Ewart Smith on conventions regulating the relationship between the two Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of its task, Committee D was asked to formulate conventions suitable for inclusion in the Commonwealth Constitution. However, I think it is apparent from these papers that that task may need to be modified since many of the practices and principles that are discussed are clearly not suitable for such treatment. In other cases the problem is really one that demands political resolution before any convention could be formulated. </PARA>
<PARA> Considerable work has also been carried out on a number of other matters. By a majority of 54 to 36 the Perth Convention approved a draft constitutional amendment to confer an advisory jurisdiction on the High Court. Quite independently, the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs made a similar recommendation in its report entitled 'Advisory Opinions by the High Court' dated October 1977. Since the Perth Convention adjourned, further discussions have been carried out between representatives of Committee D and the Senate Committee to attempt to reconcile minor differences between the two recommendations. As a result, a revised proposal has been formulated for consideration by Committee D. </PARA>
<PARA> The representation of Territories and new States in the Commonwealth Parliament was not debated at the Perth sessions Convention but was referred to Committee D for further consideration. A paper by Professor Zines of the Australian National University discusses the proposal that was put forward by the present Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, Mr Ian Wilson, and the proposed amendments that were foreshadowed at Perth. A paper has also been obtained on Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the High Court from Mr Geoffrey Lindell of the ANU as part of the Committee's consideration of the judicial power of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I refer to what a previous Governor-General, Sir Paul Hasluck, said at the opening of the Australian Constitutional Convention in Sydney in 1973. Sir Paul said:</PARA>
<PARA> 'You are to try to find ways in which the Australia of today and tomorrow can best be governed and how the national interest of Australia can best be advanced. I suggest that means finding a way in which one people in one continent will live in harmony, using their skills and resources for the greatest common good and for the strength of the nation . . . You make a constitution or you amend a constitution not for the sense of the document but for the good of a people and the best possible government of a nation. Constitutions are not, themselves, so sacred as to be worthy of worship, but the principles they serve can command continuing reverence. The practical wisdom of the provisions they make can earn abiding respect. Let us be clear about the principles on which we base any proposals for amendment. Let us seek for practical wisdom in shaping them.'</PARA>
<PARA>I respectfully adopt those words of Sir Paul Hasluck. There are no easy solutions. If we expect the Australian people to approve changes to the Constitution, those changes have to be well thought out and properly developed. It is our responsibility, as members of the national Parliament, to do much of the work needed to make those changes possible. It means that we should strive to reach maximum agreement between ourselves on the nature of proposed changes particularly when we are all agreed that some change is necessary. We must consult with State governments and parliaments about the need for such changes, and the proposals need to be widely discussed and understood by the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Constitution will be successfully amended only if there is an agreed view in this Parliament that will give leadership to the people. The experience of 1977 indicates that, where there is substantial agreement between political parties and between the Commonwealth and the States, and especially where the proposals have been endorsed by the Australian Constitutional Convention, there is a better than even chance of these proposals being carried. I seek the support of all senators and members of parliament in helping to carry out our responsibilities for constitutional review. I seek leave to move a motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The process of constitutional reform is so notoriously hard to move forward, and the task of securing the necessary consensus between major parties and interest groups is so obviously difficult that one is grateful for any crumb or skerrick of interest that falls from the Government's table. This statement made this afternoon by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) is, I suppose, to that extent, to be welcomed by the Opposition. It does indicate some kind of continuing interest by the Government in the process of constitutional reform. It indicates a particular interest in some matters of lively interest currently, including that of four-year and fixed term parliaments. It does acknowledge the desirability of non-government efforts presently taking place, especially through the Law Foundation of New South Wales project, to try to generate a serious national debate on the question of constitutional renewal. It does indicate in a roundabout kind of way that the Government will support the holding of another meeting of the Australian Constitutional Convention in due course at some considerable support for continuing activity by the committees and the other functioning units of the existing Australian Constitutional Convention in order to achieve a preparatory foundation for that proposed further meeting of the Convention proper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All that said, it must be stated that the Attorney-General's statement really is a bit of a damp squib. It demonstrates only a crumb or skerrick of interest by the Government in constitutional reform. No sense of enthusiasm or excitement was conveyed by the Attorney-General's statement or the way in which it was delivered. Certainly, there was no sense that the 1988 bicentenary year of this nation really does offer a wonderful opportunity for a major national exercise in constitutional renewal. The Attorney-General gives the appearance of someone who is rather profoundly uninterested in the process of constitutional reform or renewal, not to mention law reform of any other kind, and someone who is being reluctantly dragged to the barrier because the Government does not want to be seen to be lagging too hopelessly behind the momentum which is obviously being generated elsewhere in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of negative, churlish, unconstructive and occasionally just plain silly features of the statement. Let me focus briefly on five of them to satisfy one or other of those descriptions. The first point I mention is the attack made by the statement on my own description of the present Constitution-the Attorney-General did not have the courtesy to acknowledge it as such, although he did put it between inverted commas in the text of his statement-as being 'unreadable' and its operation as being 'at best irrational and at worst unworkable'. I am a fairly robust kind of a soul and I certainly do not mind my arguments being summarised, as they were in the recent issue of the Australian from which the Attorney-General quoted, or being subjected to rational counter-argument, but I really object to them being matched with sentimental platitudes of the kind that emanated from the Attorney when he dealt with this matter because it does not advance the process of debate very far. As much as it hurts all of us-I do not exclude myself from this-if we are to be serious about generating a really significant momentum towards constitutional reform in the years ahead, we will have to bury some of our party political hatchets. We will have to treat each other on this matter, if no other matter in this chamber, with perhaps a little more respect than we are inclined to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I make, in pursuance, no doubt, of treating my opponent with respect, relates to the smug rejection by the Attorney's statement, again without rational argument, of the feasibility of there being any possibility of achieving a completely new Constitution by 1988. As to that, I acknowledge the difficulties. One would have to be a pretty heroic kind of optimist to believe there would be any massive re-writing of that kind of the Constitution, but I remind the Attorney, who I take it does have an historical sense, if no other, of the circumstances which prevailed in 1893, seven years before the turn of the century. That in itself amounted to another watershed date of the kind that 1988 now represents to us. If a brand new Constitution was able to be generated out of the atmosphere of apathy which existed in 1893 and in the context of the waring colonial fiefdoms, all with their own local prides and prejudices, then it ought not to be beyond us now, with all the sophistication and experience of this century behind us, to do the same thing.</PARA>
<PARA> The third point I wish to make relates to the rather breathtakingly cheeky claim by the Attorney that the 1975 seas and submerged lands case was one of the great demonstrations of the effective adjustment through the High Court of Australia of the Constitution to the realities of social and economic change. It was looked at as a purely judicial exercise as matters stood after the determination of that case. What has happened subsequently is that this Government has been party to an unprecedented collusive sell-out in company with the States during 1978, which has had the effect of completely undermining the whole effect of that off-shore sovereignty decision by the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, I issue a cry of protest again about the patronising rejection by the Attorney of the concept of a popular convention as a useful vehicle towards constitutional change-the concept of there being not just a kind of indirectly established representative parliamentarians' convention of the kind we have had limping along since 1973 but rather a notion of having a convention directly elected by the people, on a directly representative rather than an indirectly representative basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Two things need to be said about the Attorney's apparent rejection out of hand of this concept. One is that it seems to overlook the utility of a convention being established on the basis, even if it does turn out to be constituted, as is probably likely, mainly by professional politicians, of acting as a vehicle for the capturing of the popular imagination through direct participation in the process of establishing the thing-getting it set in train and determining who the people's representatives will be. This is an inherent and integral part of that notion. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I make about the Attorney's rejection of the popular conventions model is the more technical one. Of course, it is true that as the present Constitution remains it is the job, and will remain the job, of this Commonwealth Parliament actually to set in train the process of implementing constitutional amendment proposals. The ultimate mode of implementation is the referendum. In order for a matter to be put to referendum there has to be, as things stand at the moment, a Bill passed through the present Commonwealth Parliament. What the Attorney seems to have failed to address himself to in rejecting the utility of a popularly elected convention in this process is the really significant role that such a convention can play, not in the actual implementation stage of constitutional reform but at the stage of initiating proposals and generating widespread acceptance for them. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past a whole variety of mechanisms have been tried as a way of generating proposals for constitutional reform. There has been the existing representative parliamentarians convention. Before that there were royal commissions and joint parliamentary committees; I think at one stage there was a Premiers Conference from which proposals arose, and so on, with other models rearing their heads from time to time. The joy of the proposal for a popular convention-in outline its detail needs much more discussion and refinement before the idea can possibly take shape-is that it does offer a vehicle, as I have said, for capturing a much more widespread community sense of involvement and participation in the process of generating initially those proposals for change. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth and final negative point in the Attorney-General's statement to which I draw attention is what seems to me to be its rather inappropriate enthusiasm-it is the one bit of enthusiasm which does seep through the statement-for implementing in its newly drafted form the Liberal proposal for solving in the future a very vexed problem of Supply deadlocks. That proposal in its newly drafted form was successfully moved by Sir Charles Court at the 1978 Perth Convention. The recommendation that was passed by that 1978 Convention on the Supply deadlock, after a long debate which the Attorney-General will no doubt remember as well as I do, was to endorse the Charles Court version rather than the Whitlam version. That version was, of course, passed by a very narrow majority-on my recollection something like 49 to 39-with a vote on purely party lines. Of course, it is obvious that this issue will continue to be a divisive one within the community. There is no prospect of a hard-line amendment of that kind or of the kind that has been now redrafted in a more precise form in the terms that were mentioned by the Attorney. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was party to the redraft as a member of Standing Committee D. It was a purely technical exercise done by Standing Committee D because it was directed to do that by the Constitutional Convention and to resubmit the draft which tidies up a few loose ends of the Court proposal and improves the Court proposal, technically. That is then for the Convention-or its constituent units-to do what it likes with. I am not objecting to that process having taken place because that was something that was required to happen by the Convention. What I am objecting to is the emphasis that this matter has been given in the Attorney's statement. It rather suggests that that is one of the proposals that the Attorney really does think has some kind of momentum behind it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My point is simply that if that is the kind of proposal that the Attorney is going to get enthusiastic about and if that is what he means by constitutional review being likely to be successful, we really are destined for a hard, bleak and barren time ahead because that is the kind of proposal about which obviously there will be continued confrontation and divisivness in the future. Our responsibility, on the other side and on my side, is to try to find a way through that impasse, to try to find some possible kind of half-way house with which we can solve the acute constitutional dilemmas that we confronted in 1975 and ensure they are not repeated. The half-way house that I will be suggesting to the Senate that it might take seriously in this respect is the concept of the fixed term parliament. I will be moving a private member's Bill within the next few weeks to that effect. In that context we can no doubt have a more protracted debate on this issue than is possible today. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe there is a strong case for rethinking, not just a handful of particular provisions in the present Constitution, which the Attorney seems to acknowledge might be a useful exercise, but rather the whole document, root and branch. I think we need to rethink the institutions of national government in this country as they exist at the moment and the relationships between them. I think we need to rethink the relations of Australia, legally and symbolically, with the United Kingdom and with the monarchy. I think we need to rethink the whole question of our present Federal structure and the division of financial and functional responsibilities between the different levels of government that will no doubt continue to exist in this country in the future. I think we need to rethink the question of whether the Constitution should contain limitations on the power of government at all levels; in particular, of course, in the form of a Bill of Rights to protect the rights and liberties universially acknowledged to be enjoyed, at least in principle, by the citizenry. Finally, I think we ought to rethink the whole question of the machinery of constitutional change, not just as a one-off exercise but to enable a more systematic, thorough-going and flexible process of constitutional change in the future to ensure that we adapt rather more effectively to continuing social and economic changes in the community at large than our Constitution has been able to accept so far. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by referring to one matter in the Attorney-General's statement which the Attorney mentioned in order to endorse, but I fear only in a rather faint praise kind of way; the reference he made to the project recently announced on 10 August by the New South Wales Law Foundation. With the very substantial financial support of that Foundation there is to be set in train-it is now off and running-a major action oriented research project over the next year. It will have two stages. The first is the preparation of a report in book form to be prepared on behalf of the Foundation and the supervising committees by Mr John McMillan, who is in the chamber I am delighted to see. The second stage of the project will be a series of seminars to be held on a national basis in each capital city around the country to launch that book and to present to discussion, at least in rudimentary terms, in initial exploratory terms, the findings and suggestions arising from it. The seminars will be attended by 100 or so, we hope, of the leading opinion makers in this community. The object of setting this project in train is to shift the whole question of constitutional reform back into the square centrepiece of the public stage so that it will, in fact, once again become part of the political agenda in this country. The object of it is to set in train a serious national debate on the possibilities of systematic constitutional renewal, in particular in the context of the target date of 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The support that this project-and others that are growing up around it-is generating in the community at large is perhaps demonstrated, if I can take another moment or so to show this, by the kind of people who have, in fact, demonstrated their support for it. None of them necessarily agrees yet about the substantive reforms the Constitution needs. What they agree about is the necessity, the desirability of this kind of serious national debate being instituted. The project is to be supervised by a small committee, the convenor of which is Mr Terence Purcell, the Director of the Law Foundation of New South Wales. Constituting that committee will be Sir Clarrie Harders, a former Secretary of the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department; Professor Ronald Sackville, Chairman of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission and not a party figure in any sense; Haddon Storey, Q.C., the Victorian Liberal Attorney-General; and me as a Federal Labor Party spokesman on legal affairs. Other members of the consultative committee that were announced when the project was set in train on 10 August are, from the political arena, Neal Blewett, Don Chipp, Bob Hawke, John Hyde, Senators Kathy Martin, Alan Missen and Peter Rae and Frank Walker from New South Wales-a fairly carefully devised balance between State and Federal people and also between both sides of politics. From the universities there is Professor Gordon Reid, a former Sergeant-at-Arms in the House of Representatives and now Professor of Political Science in Perth, and Geoffrey Sawer, whom everyone will recognise as the doyen of constitutional lawyers-now unfortunately retired-in this country. From the law reform-public policy area there is Donald Horne; John Maddison, Q.C., a former Liberal Attorney-General of New South Wales; Professor Jack Richardson, the Commonwealth Ombudsman; and John Valder, the Chairman of the Institute of Public Affairs in New South Wales and a former Chairman of the Sydney Stock Exchange. From the area of business and trade unions there is Paul Munro, now Federal Secretary of the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association, and Robert Holmes a'Court, who scarcely needs further introduction. I am pleased to announce today that the process of adding names to that consultative panel continues. Since that list was announced on 10 August we have had agreeing to participate in the project Sir John Moore, the President of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission; Ella Stack, the former Mayor of Darwin and a very well-known lady in her own right; Franca Arena, a New South Wales activist who has just been elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council; and Sir Laurence Muir, well known both in Melbourne and in the national business community. With this kind of support-not that any of the people I have identified at this stage can be relied upon to agree as yet about anything very much when it comes to substantive reforms, but it is to be hoped that they can agree about the kind of mechanism for change in the future that should proceed-it is clear that there is a very real developing momentum for change at work in the community of the kind that could obviously be no longer ignored by the Government. It is obvious that the matters raised by the Minister's statement require a full scale debate at some stage in this Parliament. I look forward to an early opportunity being arranged between both sides of this chamber for what I hope will be a constructive and full debate to take place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make only a few brief comments on the ministerial statement of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), and I will refer also to some of the points raised by Senator Evans. The Australian Democrats welcome what we see as at least a start to the whole notion of constitutional change within this country. I think probably it is politically appropriate that such a statement should be made at this time, given that yesterday the Senate was involved in exercising certain of its constitutional powers and was debating what and which powers it ought properly to make use of, which powers it has, and how far it is willing to go in exercising them. Since the Budget was brought down the Australian Democrats have attempted to spell out what we consider should be the proper functions of an upper House, and we have tried to delineate how far we are willing to go in relation to those powers. I think we have made a fairly clear statement about our attitude to one of the main items raised by the Attorney-General, that is, the notion of Supply and the role of the Upper House in relation to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall take up some other matters before I come to that. One matter raised by Senator Evans related to the rejection in the statement of the notion of a popular convention. It is the Australian Democrats voted policy that such a convention ought to replace the parliamentary convention. We believe that the parliamentary convention, while exercising itself greatly, tends to be yet another party forum. It would be far better if we could have a popularly elected convention. No doubt its members would be involved also in party politics, but at least those people would not be holding positions within Parliament. In fact, we hope that parliamentarians would refrain from standing for membership of such a convention so that it could go about its task of seeking wider and more popularly based views about what the Constitution ultimately ought to be. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We would not deliberately set about excluding members of parliament but we think it would be better if members of parliament did not stand for membership of such a convention. As we see the situation, parliamentarians have plenty of opportunities to exercise the right to speak to the electorate and to make their points of view heard in this chamber and other chambers within Australia, at both Federal and State levels. There ought to be an attempt, I think, to have a popularly based convention to seek constitutional renewal, to use that rather felicituous phrase. As a consequence of the statement of the rejection of the notion of a popular convention, there is a point on page 7 of the ministerial statement which again attributes to parliamentarians some rather nice things. It would be nice if they were the case, but I do not believe they are. The Attorney-General said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is instructive to note that persons actually elected to that convention were almost invariably parliamentarians, including Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA>He suggested that this was why the conventions were ultimately successful. While it is certainly accepted that politicians and parliamentarians may have a certain range of expertise, that statement almost suggests that politicians and parliamentarians have a monopoly on common sense, and concern about the convention and that they have all the practical experience available in the nation. I suggest that there is a whole range of people within the community, in business, government, the Public Service, and in universities, all of whom have practical experience. I am quite sure that any honourable senators who belong to organisations know that almost every organisation in this land, when it gets itself going, becomes involved in the establishment of its own constitution, and that is always a basis for lively discussion. It is always a discussion in which people in any organisation wish to be involved and to participate. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that to say some type of observer system will be provided is worse than not talking about it at all. Citizens in this land should never be considered mere observers of the Constitutional Convention. These are the basic rules which govern our democracy and they are so important and fundamental that citizens should never be considered to be observers but should be active participants in the formulation, in the debate, and even in the eventual drawing up of proposals for rules. That is why the Australian Democrats in this House and outside have pushed the notion of having a citizens initiative brought forward in this country to allow citizens to intrude themselves into the political arena at whatever time they choose, whether that is acceptable to politicians or not. We will continue to support that notion of the intrusion of citizens into the political arena when they so choose and on whatever basis they wish to come in. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats being a party in the liberal tradition and having a relationship at the moment with other parties around the world as a member of Liberal International-possibly this weekend at our national convention that position will be taken a step further-we have had a continuing interest in the notion of constitutional and electoral change. As a reformist party in that radical tradition, in the correct sense of the word, we will continue to push very strongly those notions of constitutional and electoral change to make sure that the democratic base of this society is as fair and as representative as it can possibly be at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with Senator Evans that there appears to be an attitude in the ministerial statement that the whole thing may bumble on somewhat and that if it gets somewhere then it gets somewhere, but if it does not it does not really matter. I believe that is to throw cold water on what should be an exciting debate which should continually exercise our minds. While there is some faint praise for the suggestion that we ought to look at 1988 not as a target for the final thing but for some type of renewal, nevertheless there is not much in the statement which suggests that the Government is going to take any action whatsoever to bring that about. I believe that is unfortunate. Surely constitutional changes are of continuing importance to a democracy and must be very close to the top of the agenda of a States' House in a federation. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather interestingly, on page 9 of the statement a point is raised on a matter that was brought up last night and will probably come up again and again in the next month or two. I refer to the suggestion that Supply may be obtained for more than one year and also the possibility of strengthening the Senate's right to object to the inclusion of extraneous matters in money Bills. Obviously, the point raised last night by Senator Harradine, which he has given notice he will raise again, is a central point and cannot be ignored in the context of the debate. At the end of the statement there is a point that may not be meant to be an elitist view but certainly reads like one. It is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Constitution will be successfully amended only if there is an agreed view in this Parliament that will give leadership to the people. </PARA>
<PARA>While I certainly accept that the possibility of a constitutional change of any magnitude passing through Parliament unless it has support on both sides of politics, is almost nil, given the result of previous referenda in this country, to suggest that it would be successful only if this Parliament got itself organised and gave leadership to the people turns everything on its head. With the exception of countries where constitutional change takes place under dictatorships, when nobody gets a look in anyway, the whole history of constitutional change in other countries is that almost invariably it comes from the people. It has to be supported and argued through by the people. It is suggested that this Parliament give leadership. To suggest that this document is to be taken as an example of leadership is to suggest that no leadership will be given and therefore no change will be undertaken. The Attorney-General is seeking the support of all senators and members of the Parliament in discharging the responsibility in regard to constitutional change. We certainly pledge our support and hope that in the interim the Attorney-General will make some suggestions, other than those contained in this paper, as to what in fact we are to support, and as to the moves that hopefully he is about to make in exercising the leadership role which, according to his statement, he believes is so important. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to refer to the only constitutional matter that has actually been raised. That is the reference to Standing Committee D of the Australian Constitution Convention and the work that it has done, subsequent to the submission of the special report on the Senate and Supply since 1978. The Australian Constitutional Convention report by Standing Committee D makes extremely interesting reading in the light of what is occurring at present in the Senate. At a meeting in Perth on 28 July 1978 Mr Lionel Bowen said:</PARA>
<PARA> When a government wins at an election and it has a majority, at all times we say that that Government is entitled to govern, it has a mandate. Are we to leave it to the vagaries of what the people think of a Government from month to month or from week to week? You well know that public opinion fluctuates . . . Let us remember the position in 1972; we were faced with the threat of Supply, it was suggested in 1973, virtually warned in 1974, so we had our double dissolution. It was again threatened in 1975-another double dissolution. We lived from year to year since 1972 with the continual threat of a Government never being able to maintain the situation unless it had a majority in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>That expresses very clearly our view that we have no intention of allowing a government to be under that threat from year to year, whether it be a Liberal or Labor government; that it cannot operate effectively as a government if year after year it is under the threat of having Supply cut off. Mr Bowen went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> What about the position in the future, from 1980, where an election can take place for the House of Representatives, certainly would mean, of course, a Senate of a different colour because only half the Senate would be retiring . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Mr Bowen, in his forward-thinking speech at that convention, pointed out that the type of problem that occurred in 1972, 1973, 1974 and 1975 could in fact continue to be encountered from 1981 onwards. The Australian Democrats are pledged to make sure that that does not happen while the nation and its Parliament are in a position to discuss altering the Constitution. I look forward very much to Senator Evans's private member's Bill on the notion of having fixed-term parliaments. I believe that that is a possible solution which could gain support from both sides and would, through its technical operation, remove the whole problem of Supply being blocked in the Upper House. </PARA>
<PARA> The moves made by Mr Whitlam and Mr Hamer are so obviously based on the 1972 reminiscences that they have very little chance of success. Therefore, I look forward to Senator Evans's private member's Bill so that we can have discussion on that subject. I wish to quote again what Mr Whitlam said at a convention in 1976, the substance of which was raised in the ministerial statement by the Attorney-General. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It means that no Government-</PARA>
<PARA>He is referring to the threat from the Upper House-</PARA>
<PARA>without control in the Senate can afford to take unpopular measures which may be necessary for good government for fear of being forced to an election at a time when its popularity is low. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats certainly, as part of their policy, support the notion of a fixed-term of office and believe that a government should complete the term in respect of which it pledged itself at an election. For instance, this Government was re-elected by the people eight months ago and should carry through its program. We will not obstruct Supply or money Bills. We will allow the Government to govern and in due course, in three years time, present itself to the people. We believe that at that time the Government will be defeated on the types of decisions it has made in regard to this Budget. We have no doubt that it will be defeated on that ground. But until such time as the people again have the chance to express their views, this Government will remain the Government of this country. There will not be a premature election while we hold the position that we do in this Senate. The Government itself would have to choose to have a double dissolution on other Bills that we will be scrutinising. Indeed, some of the Bills that the Government has already suggested it will bring forward will not receive our support. If these Bills do not receive the support of the Australian Labor Party they will be defeated. If the Government had the courage of its convictions, it would be bringing forward legislation for us to debate. I wish to quote again from Mr Whitlam, who said:</PARA>
<PARA> It means that we must now ignore-</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the matter raised by the Attorney-General in his statement about Supply-</PARA>
<PARA>the experience of 75 years, and literally hundreds of precedents in our own system alone, that a hostile Senate does not deny Supply . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We believe that our stance, is one that ultimately will receive the acceptance of the Australian people. We would hope that it would be in a form that would not only deal with the Supply issue but also be developmental and innovative for the future. While we hold the position that we do, we will ensure that the issue of Supply ceases to be an item on the political agenda of this country. We hope that it can be put aside, discussed in quieter places than this chamber and a resolution on it can be adopted by the people of this country. Until such time as that occurs we will not allow the Senate to use the powers which it probably has to bring down a government by blocking its Supply. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The paper before us is entitled 'Constitutional Review'. As has been pointed out, in its last paragraph the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) seeks the support of all senators and members of parliament to help carry out the responsibility for constitutional review. I can only say that the Attorney-General is going about obtaining that support in a funny way, having in mind the way in which this paper comes before the Senate today. The first I knew that this statement was to be made in the Senate was when the Attorney-General sought leave to make a statement and started to read it this afternoon. I think that, as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, I might have been expected to have an interest in the matter. I know that those honourable senators in the Op- position who have responsibility for these matters have had an hour or so in which to study the paper and to prepare their comments on it. I was asked by Senator Evans when I planned to speak on the statement. I told him that at that stage I did not know what the statement was about but, from its heading, it would appear that I would be interested in it and I would decide when I heard it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think I should make some comments on this paper which has come before us today but I ask why it was not listed on the daily business sheet. Presumably it was prepared over a period. Why was it not listed on today's business sheet? Why is it that once again something on which it is intended that a debate will ensue is sprung upon the Senate? Even in the statement it is claimed that the Government wants to encourage debate and discussion on the matters covered in it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Peter Rae is not here; I do not know whether he knows anything about the presentation of this statement. Both he and I represented the Senate in part of the 1978 Constitutional Convention. I would have thought that I had shown sufficient interest in those subjects to have been given warning that this matter was coming on for debate today. Therefore when the matter was first raised I had no knowledge of it. Despite the fact that the Whips are a little jaundiced by the fact that a further speaker has come into this debate, I think it is important to say a few things about the statement before us. </PARA>
<PARA> I will refer briefly to four points in the statement because they are significant. I regret that the statement does not come to more positive conclusions on constitutional reform, does not tell us that constitutional referenda proposals are to be put forward in the near future, but of course the statement does indicate some good work which has been carried out by the Australian Constitutional Convention. The first of those matters is the Attorney-General's statement that he thinks it is nonsense to assert, as some people do, that there is general agreement that the Constitution is an inadequate instrument for the type of democratic government desired by Australians. I think that that was a very mild expression. I believe that there is clear agreement among the people in this country who are taking an interest in the matter that it is an inadequate instrument. It is true that it has managed, with the assistance of the courts, to develop a number of powers so that the disjunctive nature of our Constitution has not been felt as much as it might have been. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite right to say, as the Attorney-General said, that the proper course is to work towards amending our existing Constitution. I certainly agree that it is beyond the realm of possibility to expect a new Constitution, but to expect a Constitution which is substantially amended is not beyond the realm of possibility. I applaud the efforts being made by the committee to which Senator Evans referred and of which he is a member. As a member of the consultative committee attached to that committee, I certainly want to work hard to develop further interest in constitutional reform, to look at the hard questions and to try to find solutions to the problems posed by those questions. I agree with Senator Evans's comment today that we must try to find a way through the constitutional dilemmas. That is one of the major tasks for us in Australia. There is inadequate interest in constitutional reform. That is evi- denced to some extent by the relatively poor attendance in this chamber today during a debate on a subject such as this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague from South Australia has pointed out that perhaps honourable senators do not know it is on. Of course, it should have occurred to me that that is an obvious reason, but perhaps he is a little more idealistic now than he will be after further experience of this place. He may find that on many occasions honourable senators will know that events are taking place in the chamber but they still, regrettably, will not turn up. However, I believe that it is necessary for us to develop an interest in constitutional reform and to ensure that a more adequate instrument is produced by us through reforms and amendments to the Constitution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point raised in this statement to which I refer-this point has been developed at some length by two other speakers in this debate-is the suggestion of a popular conven- tion, which the Attorney-General regards as not likely to be a goer. He claims it will not replace the Parliamentarians Convention. I am of the opinion that the Parliamentarians Convention, which is mostly a collection of State members, has done a considerable amount of good work. It has developed quite a climate of opinion in favour of some constitutional amendments that have succeeded. I think that others which have been the result of their deliberations may well succeed also. At the same time, I think it is time for us to move on to a popular convention. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that a popular convention should, as Senator Macklin would have it, somehow exclude politicians-that by a self-denying ordinance politicians would not be part of the convention. That would be foolish because the practitioners, the people who work with the Constitution and very often see the most rusty of its joints are the ones who ought also to be attending the convention. However, I likewise agree with Senator Macklin that parliamentarians should not have a monopoly. They have no monopoly of knowledge or common sense. Such a convention would, I believe, be one in which politicians would constitute but a relatively small minority of those who are elected by popular vote. I believe it would need to be a convention which met not once every three or four years, as the present convention is doing, and be a weekend away for a number of politicians; it would need to be one which met over a considerable period in a year and which got down to the problems before us. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not find any conviction in the argument that we cannot have such a popular convention because proposals for constitutional reform can be put to a referendum only by an enactment of the national Parliament. We know that, but the fact is that if such a convention got behind it a very substantial body of opinion, as was the case at the original convention which formed the Constitution, of course those proposals could be swept through the Parliament. There has to be public demand and, following that, one can expect that the Parliament may well operate in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I was disappointed to read in the statement that we are only now speaking of the next convention. If we are going to go ahead with the Parliamentarians Convention, and at this stage that course of action obviously seems to be necessary, one wonders why we have waited three years before holding the next one. One wonders why, as was said earlier, the Government is only now considering the next plenary session and is to have discussions with the State governments. The Attorney-General stated: 'An appropriate opportunity to do so will be taken at an early date'. One wonders why discussions have not taken place with the State governments well before this time so that in the current period of the Parliament and before we move into the next election we can contemplate further meetings of the Constitutional Convention and further constitutional changes being introduced in the Parliament. It is disappointing that this matter is taking such a slow course. </PARA>
<PARA> The last matter I refer to with regard to this statement is the Attorney-General's strong support for a proposal of the Constitutional Convention, adopted largely on party lines, to institute an automatic double dissolution procedure, popularly known as the 'Court procedure'. I hold the same view on that as does Senator Evans. I believe that it is a matter on which hardened views are held generally on party lines. In addition, there is so much opposition to such a one-sided solution to the problem of the conflict between the two Houses that I have no doubt that such a proposal would not be carried by a constitutional convention. I find the solution to the problem quite implausible and I believe it would not be acceptable to the broad range of Australian people. Therefore I think we must look still at finding solutions to the problems to stop a recurrence of what occurred in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the statement in the sense that it shows a continuing interest in matters of constitutional reform. I regret that it does not indicate urgent activity in that area and that it rejects so many of what I believe are the more hopeful signs for the continuation of parliamentary reform by popular convention. Finally, I hope there will be further debate on this subject-I realise that time is short at present-but I hope that urgent action will be taken to get ahead with constitutional reform. Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A few weeks ago the Aboriginal people of Cherbourg Aboriginal Reserve in south-east Queensland, in Mr Bjelke-Petersen's own electorate, prepared a petition to the Premier calling for freehold title to their reserve. As is reported in the National Times of 4 September, 300 people signed that petition which was handed to Senator Bjelke-Petersen's husband at the opening of a new wing of the Murgon primary school by Charlie Renouf, a field officer of the Aboriginal Legal Service. A couple of days later, on the following Monday, a school groundsman found that petition in a rubbish bin. This is the attitude of the Premier. That is the attitude of the Queensland Government to land rights in that State. This is why it is necessary for the Commonwealth to act now in discharge of the constitutional responsibilities in this area vested in it by the referendum of 1967. This is why it is necessary for the Senate and the Opposition within the Senate to act now by way of the hitherto unusual course of a private members Bill because this Government has made it abundantly clear that it will not act, that it will, unless it is forced to do otherwise, continue to kowtow, to genuflect and to pay obeisance to the kind of redneck racism which continues to parade as State rights north of the Tweed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Fraser Government simply will not react in a protective way against the announced intention of the Queensland Government to abolish Aboriginal reserves in Queensland. This Government has shown that it will not react to counter the kind of attitude evidenced again by the failure of the Queensland Government to transfer title to land being purchased on behalf of Aboriginals in the Archer River area, the matter which is now, of course, the subject of challenge in the High Court by Queensland, putting at risk the whole constitutionality or the whole existence of the Racial Discrimination Act as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before us today embodies principles which are themselves embodied in existing legislation which has been passed by the Fraser Government-the 1976 Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act and the 1978 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities Self-management) Act. It ought to be, as a result, capable of accommodation by this Government if its word means anything. If it ever wants to be believed again when it claims through the mouth of Senator Baume or anyone else commitment to Aboriginal land rights, it ought to give support to this measure which has come back into the Parliament today. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic elements of this Bill were outlined by Senator Ryan during her second reading speech. I think perhaps they need to be recapitulated to have the foundations or the bearings before us for the remarks that I later want to make. Part I of the Bill deals with the question of self-management of reserves. It creates an optional system of self-management which will not be able to be circumvented by the Queensland Government. Part II of the Bill, which is rather more complicated, deals with the question of the grants of land to Aboriginal land trusts in respect of particular Aboriginal reserves. This Part of the Bill makes provision for first the ability to make a land rights claim in respect of reserves; secondly, power for the Federal Minister to acquire the claimed land compulsorily from the Queensland Government; thirdly, the setting up of an Aboriginal land trust in respect of each reserve so acquired; fourthly, minerals to remain the property of the State but mining to be allowed in the event that either the land trust agrees on the one hand or both Houses of the National Parliament pass a resolution on the other hand that mining must go ahead in the national interest. Finally, this Part of the Bill makes provision where mining does proceed for Aboriginal owners of the land to be entitled to compensation. </PARA>
<PARA> My task, as I see it in this debate, is essentially to reply to the speech on this Bill that was made by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Baume, and in particular to endeavour to deal with the series of what I fear are quite technical points that were made by the Minister by way really of endeavouring to support the proposition that this Bill was ill-drafted, ill-prepared and inappropriate as a result to be further dealt with at this stage by the Senate. I want to contest--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Peter Baume" NAMEID="ME4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They were only examples too; there were more.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Minister throws up any more examples I will be only too delighted to deal with them on the run because so far it has not proved to be an insuperable task to deal with any of the matters that have been produced by the Minister and his team of bush lawyers who have been grinding away so assiduously in preparation for this debate. The basic comment I make about Senator Baume's contribution to this debate is that it is, to be fair, something of a curate's egg: It does have some good points, some suggestions that we should adopt in this Bill and can, of course, at the Committee stage. It does contain some reasonable points on which reasonable men and women may well differ. It certainly, however, contains some bad points which we cannot accept, and I will give some instances of those. It contains some misunderstandings and it contains some propositions which are simply inaccurate or based on a complete misreading of what we are endeavouring to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The opening salvo fired by Senator Baume proved to be a very damp squib in that he gave as his initial demonstration that the Bill was badly drafted the fact that it was even so incompetent as to confuse in at least one section-he instanced clause 37 (3)-a land trust with a land council. The reference to 'trusts' should have been a reference to 'council'. I am afraid in that respect that Senator Baume got it wrong because he was reading, in preparing his remarks, from an earlier and subsequently proof corrected draft of the Bill. In fact, all he served to do by making that point was to demonstrate the fact that he had not read the Bill very carefully at all because in fact he missed a similar proof reading error in clause 24 (3) of the Bill which was not in fact corrected in the final printed version. So maybe the rest of his speech is based on what we can only regard as not a terribly close reading of the Bill at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me move straight to the series of substantial points made by Senator Baume. I do not know whether these points were made by way of example but certainly he seemed anxious to put before the Parliament a pretty systematic set of examples. In any event let me deal with all the ones that appeared in the speech he made in this second reading debate. The first point I want to refer to appears on page 769 of Hansard where the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> If the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act applied in Queensland many of the communities there would not be able to claim . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Territory land rights model-</PARA>
<PARA>That is clearly embodied, as I have said and as Senator Ryan has said, in this Bill-</PARA>
<PARA>is inappropriate for Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a general point that is being made but it is one that falls to the ground as soon as one looks at the terms of clause 18 of the Bill and the definition therein of traditional Aboriginal owners, because what is added to that definition is a third description which in fact is quite different from the description of traditional Aboriginal owners that appears in the Northern Territory Bill. I acknowledge that there has been a drafting error: The word 'and' which links (b) and (c) should have read 'or'. That correction will be made at the Committee stage. But there is an alternative description of traditional Aboriginal owners which will be able to be relied upon by the Queensland Aboriginals, and that is local groups of Aboriginals or Islanders who 'are entitled to land ownership by virtue of prior residence on a reserve'. I should point out that we propose to add further to that in the Committee stage 'or by virtue of having been born on a reserve' to make further accommodation for the particular circumstances of the Aboriginal people. So here, as elsewhere, I will indicate in passing that there may well have been some legitimate misunderstanding of errors in the draft of the Bill as can only be expected when something is done in this fashion. But the basic point that was made as a second reading point and not as a Committee stage point by the Minister was in fact ill-founded. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point that the Minister raised-this was the first of a whole series of them which now appear in the next part of his speech-is on page 770 of Hansard. The Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill empowers councils to make any law for conduct, discipline and well-being of members without outside involvement or parliamentary scrutiny and in any manner the councils decide. This could allow extreme penalties for trivial conduct without the right of appeal. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a fair point and that is readily acknowledged by the Opposition. It is a point that really should have been accommodated in the draft of the Bill. It was initially put forward, I think, with a slightly too cavalier disregard for the utility of having a mechanism of disallowance. It is proposed to meet the Minister's point by incorporating at the Committee stage a modification of clause 10 of the present self-management Bill which will provide for disallowance by the Parli- ament of by-laws so promulgated by the mechanism elsewhere in the Bill. It also provides for a maximum penalty of $50 to apply in respect of any such by-laws. Also a defence of ignorance of the by-law in question is to be available. To clarify that for the record, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the proposed new sub-clauses which we will be endeavouring to incorporate at the Committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Page 6, clause 10, after sub-clause (3), insert the following new sub-clauses:</PARA>
<PARA> (4) insert ''Where a Council makes by-laws under sub-section (1) the Council shall cause a copy of the by-laws to be received by the Minister.''</PARA>
<PARA> (5) insert ''Where the Minister receives a copy of any by-laws, he shall cause a copy of the by-laws to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the day on which he received a copy of those by-laws.''</PARA>
<PARA> (6) insert ''Where a copy of any by-laws has been laid before a House of the Parliament in accordance with sub-section (5) of this section, sub-sections 48 (5), (5A) and (6) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 apply to and in relation to those by-laws as if references in those sub-sections to regulations were references to such by-laws.''</PARA>
<PARA> (7) insert ''The Council for a Reserve to which this Act applies, or for a Community to which this Act applies, shall use its best endeavours to ensure that the by-laws of the Council are made known to Aboriginals or Islanders who reside on the Reserve or are members of the Community.''</PARA>
<PARA> (8) insert ''The by-laws may provide that any contravention of a by-law is an offence punishable, upon conviction, by a fine not exceeding $50.''</PARA>
<PARA> (9) insert ''In proceedings for an offence referred to in sub-section (10), it is a defence if the person charged proves that he was not aware of the by-laws to which the offence relates.''</PARA>

<PARA> The Bill exempts councils, under clauses 10 and 14, from application of Queensland laws and inserts no Commonwealth laws to fill the void. </PARA>
<PARA>It is true that no Commonwealth laws are inserted to fill the void but it is simply not true that the Queensland laws are completely excluded from the provisions of the legislation.

It appears, for example, if Senator Missen would like to check just some fairly randomly chosen examples, in section 41 of the Atomic Energy Act, section 19 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act, section 19, I think, of the Financial Corporations Act and section 25 of the notorious Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act, which I know is dear to Senator Missen's heart.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that is right but that is the kind of point that clearly we can argue out further in more nit-picking and tedious detail in the Committee stage. I am simply endeavouring to meet in a second reading contribution the kind of points that were made by the Minister, to acknowledge fault where fault exists but also to indicate where there is not really fault in drafting. Perhaps there was a reaction based on a misunderstanding or a too hasty reading of what we were endeavouring to do. The basic object of the exercise, of course, is to demonstrate to the Senate that we have before us a Bill which, whatever the need for further refinement of it in the Committee stage may be nonetheless is basically sound in its structure and has basically anticipated all the key things that have to be in a piece of legislation of this kind and that will in fact be perfectly workable subject to the Committee stage attention to detail. It is also of course appropriate to be supported now in the second reading debate. The next point that is made by the Minister again appears on page 770 of Hansard and is in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under clause 18 the Bill imports a new and peculiar definition of 'traditional Aboriginal owner' which is certainly inappropriate to many of the Queensland reserves. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a point that I have already endeavoured to cover in indicating to the Senate how and why the definition in clause 18 of 'traditional Aboriginal owners' is drafted as it is. I have also indicated to the Senate that it is proposed to modify in the Committee stage the existing draft of clause 18 by converting the word 'and' to the word 'or' and making paragraph (c) of clause 18 in its entirety read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> are entitled to land ownership by virtue of prior residence on a Reserve, or by virtue of having been born on a reserve. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that particular formulation will be seen, new and peculiar as it may be in the sense that it is not in the Northern Territory Act or in any other legislation, to be still perfectly appropriate to meet the needs of the Queensland situation, which of course is the nub of the criticism that was earlier advanced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting I was discussing a series of objections to the Bill that had been raised by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume)-I was endeavouring to deal with them as briskly as the technicalities allowed-in order to indicate that the Bill is in fact acceptable, at least for a vote on the second reading, in its present terms. It contains no fundamental flaws; certainly none of the kind that cannot be easily corrected in the Committee stage. Indeed, we have anticipated most of the objections that have been made and which have any substance. Let me proceed to the next item mentioned by the Minister. On page 770 of Hansard he is reported as having said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clause 28 reserves minerals to the Crown in right of Queensland but limits Queensland's access to them. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me simply say that we do not read the Bill as having the complete effect that is claimed, especially if the clause in question is read in the context of clause 33 relating to grants of mining interest, and clause 40 (2), associated with that, which allows the grantee of such an interest an automatic right of entry into the land in question. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point relates to clause 28 (5) in respect of which the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 28 (5) of the Bill purports to impose an obligation on a State officer to register a title granted by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>What the honourable senator may not know but should have known is that the High Court of Australia has previously held such provisions to be invalid. I presume the reference there is to the case of the Commonwealth and New South Wales, decided in 1923 and reported in volume 33 of the Commonwealth Law Reports at page 1, wherein there was a four to one majority holding that section 20, as it then was, of the Lands Acquisition Act 1920, drafted in similar terms to this, as beyond Commonwealth power. It was not the acquisition itself that was rubbed out by that particular decision but simply the mandatory requirement that it be registerd by the State property officer. That case has not been much cited subsequently and it may well be that the High Court would now take a different view as to how the law in question in that case should be resolved, especially in the light of the quite powerfully argued dissenting judgment from Mr Justice Higgins, which made clear, among other things, that the point was not really very fully argued. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point to make about that is that the case was decided in the immediate aftermath of the famous engineers case, and the question as to the possible reach of Commonwealth power into State areas was perhaps less settled then than it is today. In any event, even if this particular clause was struck down by the application of the case that the Minister has referred to, we do not see that that is in fact fatal to the basic scheme of the Act to the extent that the acquisitions and purchase of land for and on behalf of the trusts in question could certainly survive. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point related to clause 40 of the Bill, in respect of which the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 40 would preclude a State officer-for example, a policeman-who was acting in the performance of his duty from entering upon land vested in a land trust without the consent of the trust. </PARA>
<PARA>We simply do not accept that interpretation of that particular clause as having that effect. Might I draw the Minister's attention in particular to sub-clause 1 of that clause which uses the expression 'or otherwise in accordance with this Act', which I think, when he reads carefully what we have in mind and have already referred to so far as clauses 14 and 43 are concerned, he would acknowledge is a legal environment in which such entries could in fact be made. But we do acknowledge that the clause and the right in question could perhaps be a little clearer. We have accordingly in fact proposed an amendment to clause 40 in the Committee stage. For the record I simply indicate that that amendment would read, by way of an insertion after the word 'Act' in clause 40 (1), 'or by a law which by virtue of section 43 applies to Aboriginal land'. That should clarify the matter beyond doubt, but we see that particular amendment as being an abundance of caution. </PARA>
<PARA> The next matter referred to-it appears in Hansard at the bottom of page 770 and goes over to page 771-is the claim by the Minister in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill makes no alternative provision for the preservation of law and order on land held by a trust. </PARA>
<PARA>As to that, we say yet again that this overlooks the effect of clause 43 which will allow the Queensland laws of general application to continue, for better or worse, to actually operate. If the Minister is really making a different point than that, if he is claiming that there is no legal framework for the continued self-management by law-making power, and so on, to operate in the hands of councils, this is a point that I will address again in another context in a moment. The Minister then quoted a provision from a report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. He said that we on the Committee did 'not consider that a single general statute . . . provides the best means' of achieving Aboriginal self-management of reserves. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to that point, having stated and understood the problem, is simply that our Bill does allow for a flexibility of response as to the kind of self-management in the first place, and, secondly, the kind of proprietary interest in the context of land rights that is appropriate to the needs and demands and interests of each particular community. The other point to make, I suppose, is that the Senate Committee report was brought down in the context not as a general attack on Aboriginal reserve status being then contemplated but rather a question of maximising the opportunities of Aboriginal communities to get self-management status on a case by case basis in particular reserve situations. That was the context of that report. All that was being done there was to identify the kind of options and possibilities that were available in respect of each group of Aboriginals around Queensland, in respect of each community in which they happened then to reside, with a differing situation so far as mineral right demands and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Here we are confronting a situation-this is the nub of the point that I want to make-of a generalised across-the-board attack on the status, simultaneously, of all the reserves in Queensland. For that reason it is necessary to produce at the moment a statutory solution which will in fact anticipate that attack and make provision for its force and effect being overcome, again on a case by case basis. It ought not to be misunderstood that what is being provided for here is again simply a framework piece of legislation which will, at the threshold, enable different kinds of self-management solutions to be created for each community. Then, when each such community wants to proceed beyond the self-management situation into a land rights proprietary possession situation through a land trust, this Bill allows for the creation of such a trust, again on a case by case basis. This is something we obviously need to argue about in more detail in the Committee stage. This is not the occasion to pursue it. But it seems to me that the general thrust of the Minister's objection is a little misconceived. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point argued out is in respect of clause 42. It is said that there is in effect an inconsistency between the self-management provisions of the Bill on the one hand and the lands acquisition provisions on the other which makes the operation of this Bill in practice unworkable because, it is argued, clause 42 operates in such a way as to mean that Part I, the self-management Part of our Bill, ceases to apply when the land in question ceases to be a reserve. Again, I try to keep the answer short. We do not agree that there are inconsistencies between the two Parts of the Bill in the way that has been suggested. There is a rational interrelationship between the different parts of the Bill and there does not seem to be any necessary reason why the continuation of the council or councils and the self-management powers associated with their operation could not be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we acknowledge that it is probably desirable to make explicit provision for this transition from self-management status of a Commonwealth acquired reserve on the one hand to the self-management of land held in trust by a land trust on the other. It seems to us desirable to make that explicit and to make precise provision in enabling form for a continuation of the self-management framework. That is the point of the proposed new clause 28A which we will be seeking to move at the Committee stage and which I have made available to the Minister. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the bottom of page 770 and running on to the top of page 771 the Minister referred to the just terms provision of the Constitution which, of course, govern any acquisition and proprietary interests and simply asked: 'Where is the money coming from to pay for land so acquired?' Of course it is true that compensation is payable ultimately by someone. It is in the nature of any land rights exercise of this kind. I took it the Minister was not so much making a technical objection to the operation of the Bill but rather a more political one. Might I remind him again that that after all was intended to be the utility and value of the Senate Committee report to which I referred, insofar as it pointed out that acquisition situations are not all or nothing situations; that there are different gradations of proprietary interest that can be purchased, ranging from a licence or lease situation at one end of the scale through to a complete freehold interest, with the full range of mineral rights, I suppose, at the other end of the scale. The amount that will be payable on acquisition-this is a potentially much lengthier discussion but I will keep it to just another sentence-will depend upon the nature of the proprietary interest that is in fact acquired.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There will be a cost ultimately to the nation somewhere along the line of this exercise. It is even conceivable that there could be a cost right at the threshold with the Part I self-management Part of the Bill, to the extent that a court might be moved to construe the Part I clauses as in themselves amounting, as they do, merely to a granting of self-management status but nonetheless amounting to a acquisition of some of proprietary interest and diverting that proprietary interest away from the Queensland Government, where it presently resides. I acknowledge that it is possible, although I think unlikely, that it could be construed as meaning that a licence type of proprietary interest had been acquired, in which case it would demand that some kind of compensation be paid to Queensland as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> I think to dress that up as a significant objection to the Bill really rather misses the basic point of what this Bill is all about and what I have taken the Minister, in his more enlightened moments, to acknowledge the Bill to be about. It is not a question of worrying here about the bill that is ultimately to be payable by someone, but really it is a matter of ensuring essentially that justice is done to those who so manifestly deserve it. Of course the compensation amounts that are ultimately to be payable cannot simply be dismissed as mere bagatelle or something that is not relevant at all to the basic consideration of this Bill, but they must be kept in their proper perspective and it cannot possibly count as a knock-out blow at the second reading stage against this Bill, that there is an uncertainty about what precise degree of compensation is to be paid at the various stages of operation of this kind of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that that deals as systematically and as completely as is possible in any reasonable time with the points raised by the Minister. But there is one other point that has been raised, certainly outside the chamber, with me by Senator Missen which I do not think has been covered by any of the points I have mentioned. That is the question of the resolution of conflicts in the operation of the land trusts, especially with the councils continuing, as they may well do-in fact are likely to do-to exercise self-management functions. It is possible that the councils and the trusts will be constituted by different people with technically different powers, but nonetheless operating in an area where there is a possibility of conflict arising. We accept that the existing clause 32, as it is drafted, which is intended to deal with the conciliation of disputes, may not have a sufficiently wide reaching operation to deal with the kinds of disputes which I have understood Senator Missen to have in mind. So may I again simply foreshadow at this stage the intention of Senator Ryan to move in the Committee stage a new clause 32, the terms of which I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> ''32 (1) The Minister may appoint persons to act as Commissioners in accordance with this section. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Disputes Commissioners shall be persons familiar with Aboriginal or Islander tradition. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Before the appointment of any person to act as a Disputes Commissioner, the Minister shall consult as widely as possible with those bodies or groups who may be affected by decisions of the Disputes Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) The terms of appointment of a Disputes Commissioner shall specify the Land Trust or Land Trusts in respect of which the Disputes Commissioner has jurisdiction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have aimed to demonstrate-inevitably, I fear, in a very technical way, but that is the nature of the exercise-that the Bill is a credible exercise technically. It is not full of the kind of holes that, as I have said, the Minister and his hastily assembled team of deparmental lawyers have sought to find through it. I am not suggesting that the drafting and enactment of this kind of legislation is a simple exercise. Nor, of course, am I suggesting-and I have taken pains to make this clear in everything I have said-that the Bill is incapable of further improvement at the Committee stage. Indeed, I have foreshadowed a number of improvements which we will be seeking to make. There are at least another 20-odd smaller amendments which are presently in an advanced stage of drafting but which do not really go to significant questions of principle but certainly improve the drafting in a number of ways. The real point I have been endeavouring to get across on behalf of the Opposition is that the Bill is in a condition in which it can and it should be guaranteed a second reading by this chamber. To give this Bill any less than a second reading tonight, in the circumstances of crisis-it is no less than that-that we are facing in Queensland, would be to abdicate all the responsiblity which we, as Australians, share for the 200 years of humiliation, annihilation, neglect and contempt with which our Aboriginal brothers and sisters, the first and the rightful inhabitants of this land, have so unfairly borne.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are discussing a very important Bill and a very important proposed initiative for the Senate and for the Parliament of this country. This Bill, the Queensland Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders (Self-Management and Land Rights) Bill 1981, is an initiative for which I pay tribute to Senator Ryan and Senator Evans for the careful way in which they have explained their views. The speech which Senator Ryan has made, I think, sets out a great deal of the grievous treatment which the Aboriginal people of this country have received over a long period and the claims which they have on this Parliament for better treatment and for some recognition of the justice of their claims, in particular claims for land rights. I believe that we in this Parliament have made some attempts in the past, by legislation, which have not been very successful. We must ensure that any attempts we make now are more successful and that we are not met by the ingenuity which has been seen in past occasions to have frustrated the will of the Australian people expressed through the Australian Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I desire in the speech I make tonight, and through an amendment which I will move in the course of this speech, to maintain three particular points. I refer, first, to the need for stronger Commonwealth action and make an analysis of what demands are made on the community for action, and the way in which we ought to proceed. Secondly, we must consider the strategy of the Bill proposed, it being a private member's Bill. We must consider very carefully the way in which it is handled, taking into account the way in which people who are hostile to the purposes of that Bill may well be able to use it to advantage if we travel in an overzealous but careless direction. Thirdly, I will talk about the weaknesses or defective aspects of the Bill, some of which have been referred to by Senator Evans and some of which have not. If the Bill is to proceed these aspects must be considered very carefully and repaired before we embark on what is a very vigorous and difficult fight with a State government. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, this is a Bill which sets out-the second reading speech does also-much about the obligations we have to the Australian Aboriginal people. What is claimed by the people who are residents on the reserves in Queensland, bearing in mind that those reserves are threatened with termination, is something like 2 per cent or slightly less of the land surface of Queensland. One must recognise that, in economic terms, that land is among the poorer and more distant land; it is not the most valuable in an economic sense but very often is land where Aboriginal people did not originally live. But different clans and tribes have been moved onto reserves and they have developed a particularly strong attachment, which Aboriginal people have always had for land, to this land which they fear might be taken from their control. It is very important that we bear in mind that it is only a small percentage of the land of Queensland that is under question. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe four salient actions or facts ought to be mentioned at the beginning, as we consider the need for our taking action. They are actions which involve the Senate, and which have involved it over the last few years, and we ought to remind ourselves of them. In the first place I want to remind the country that we now have unquestioned constitutional power in the Commonwealth Parliament to take action. After all, section 51 (xxvi) of the Constitution says that we may make laws for the good order of the people of Australia in respect of the people of 'any race, for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws'. What was once an exclusion-the words 'other than the Aboriginal race in any State'-was removed overwhelmingly by vote of the people of this country in 1967. I think it is clear-this is the view of the Senate committee which considered this matter-that unquestionably the Commonwealth has very strong powers to make those special laws that it may deem necessary. That, of course, includes powers in respect of the Aboriginal race and the Torres Strait islanders who are the subject of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The second salient fact I want to refer to is the resolution which the Senate adopted in 1975 on the motion of Senator Bonner. I was a member of this chamber on that occasion and one of the people who voted for and accepted that resolution. The resolution was adopted without dissent in the Senate on 20 February 1975, and reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate accepts the fact that the indigenous people of Australia, now known as Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, were in possession of this entire nation prior to the 1788 First Fleet landing at Botany Bay, urges the Australian Government to admit prior ownership by the said indigenous people, and introduce legislation to compensate the people now known as Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders for dispossession of their land. </PARA>
<PARA>The terms of that resolution, of course, go further than this question of land rights. It was a resolution carried by the Senate, I believe sincerely, and those of us who voted for it meant it to be not merely a matter of words addressed kindly to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people but to mean something significant and in due course to be introduced into legislation. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was carried only in this chamber. But it was carried by the Senate, and the Senate ought to take initiatives in regard to it. One of the things we ought to do in acknowledging land rights in Queensland surely is to accept this principle as the first essential, thus showing that we are prepared to take some action, to take some stand, to incur some wrath in certain parts of Australia and to fight to ensure that their rights in those areas are protected. That, I think, is an important thing so far as the obligations of this Senate are concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third matter arose from the fact that in 1978, the Queensland Government proceeded to abolish the reserves at Aurukun and Mornington Island, we endeavoured by legislation, which one might describe as the self-management Act of that year, to protect those rights. We know that because of the action of the Queensland Government in abolishing the reserves after the legislation went through that legislation was vitiated at that time. Consequently, the decisions of the Parliament then were ineffective. This matter was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, of which I was Chairman. The report of that Committee has been quite heavily relied on in the preparation of this Bill and in the matters which Senator Ryan has raised in her second reading speech. I intend to read two extracts from the Committee's report. In addition, the Committee's report does indicate the very strong power the Commonwealth has not only to acquire land but also to acquire lesser interests in land and to take very many other steps that are necessary for the Australian Aboriginal people. In its responses to that report the Government has never challenged in any way the views which the Committee then expressed about the strong power of the Commonwealth in this area. I quote firstly from paragraph 46 of the report. The Committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee notes the claim made in the submission of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (Annexure E, at p. 3) that 'since the passage of the legislation led the Queensland Government to legislate for local community self-management under Queensland local government legislation and to grant leasehold title to the Aurukun and Mornington Island communities, it can be argued that the Commonwealth legislation has been most effective'. The Committee cannot agree with this proposition. It seems clear to the Committee that the Commonwealth Act, being incapable of application to Aboriginals at Aurukun and Mornington Island, must be regarded as totally ineffective in dealing with their plight. That the Queensland Parliament may have chosen to confer on the face of it somewhat wider powers of self-management upon Aboriginals at Aurukun and Mornington Island than they enjoyed under the previously applicable Queensland Acts is no more than a fortuitous beneficial side result of the Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>So we have to recognise that the Commonwealth legislation dealing with those two particular areas and communities was not successful. I read further from the conclusions of the Committee report. The Committee was referring primarily to Aurukun and Mornington Island, but not entirely; the Committee report ranged much wider. Paragraph 74 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee accordingly bases its recommendations regarding Aboriginals and the Torres Strait Islanders in Queensland on the assumption that co-operation between the Commonwealth and Queensland is not necessary to provide a full and sufficient discharge of Commonwealth obligations to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in Queensland and that some unilateral action by the Commonwealth will therefore be likely to be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the facts of the last three years, despite the long and I think genuine negotiations by the Commonwealth Government in endeavouring to obtain better treatment for the Aborigines of Queensland, have proved that there will be a necessity for Commonwealth action. In the fourth of these aspects, I refer to the fact that on 5 April 1979, when that report of the Senate committee was debated and when a resolution was adopted which noted the various actions that the Commonwealth had taken in its negotiations, it was stated in clause (b) of the resolution, as recorded on page 1415 of Hansard of 5 April:</PARA>
<PARA>In the event of such agreement, legislative action and negotiations failing to provide satisfactory means for self-management the Senate requests the Commonwealth Government to give urgent consideration to (and advise the Parliament of its intentions in regard to) the amendment of the existing Commonwealth legislation or the introduction of new legislation to ensure effective self-management for the Aurukun and Mornington Island Aboriginal communities, and other Aboriginal communities-</PARA>
<PARA>I stress the words 'and other Aboriginal communities'-</PARA>
<PARA>pursuant to the substantial powers of the Commonwealth as examined in the Senate Committee's Report. </PARA>
<PARA>So indeed it was very much in the mind of the Senate at that time that it may well have to take action to look after the interests of other Aboriginal communities which are now under some challenge. Those are salient actions involving the Senate and they lead us on to consider what we should do now. </PARA>
<PARA> I will say something about the slow negotiations and the threatened security which are facing Aboriginal communities in Queensland. In the course of the last three years the Commonwealth has been negotiating-I think not without great difficulty-with the Queensland Government. As expressed by Senator Baume in his speech last week, the Commonwealth has been working sincerely in accordance with the four principles that he mentioned. They are:</PARA>
<PARA> That the integrity of the present reserve boundaries should be maintained; that there should be secure tenure for the occupants and preservation of their usufructionary rights, their rights to use the land; that local communities should play a significant role in the management of the reserves; and there should be full consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people before any decisions are made. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe those principles are sound ones. Unfortunately they are under some challenge at present. We know that the Queensland Government has threatened, both in the election campaign last year and since, to abolish the reserves and has left the future of the people who live on those reserves at least in a state of great uncertainty. The Commonwealth in its negotiations of course has been conscious of the fact that if it applies the rights which it has to acquire the land then of course there will be further difficulties. We know the situation could arise in which a Queensland government not prepared to recognise facts could well take the view: 'Right, these are your islands. These are your Bantustans. You will have to provide all the services for these areas. We will no longer provide all those services that are normally applicable to all ordinary citizens of Queensland'. We know that a fight may occur. We know the Commonwealth has endeavoured to reach an agreement which does not lead to a situation where it would have to maintain all the services for these people if the Queensland Government were to react in such a way. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Government has at times proposed 50-year leases. Frankly, I do not think they are a satisfactory answer for a people who have a deep and abiding feeling for the land and on whom the land has such an influence. To tell them they have rights to land for 50 years, 75 years or even 100 years is insulting in view of the demands which they make and the influence of the land on them. We would have to expect more than that. We have not seen that yet from the State of Queensland. We have heard the examples already-I will not repeat them; Senator Evans spoke of this matter-of areas where Queensland has denied Aboriginals the right to ownership and has denied them leases. The Archer River area is an example of that. The Aboriginal people have been denied the lease of land. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently the World Council of Churches presented a report after investigation here. One can be critical of some aspects of that report. Of course there have been criticisms of the people who were involved in its preparation and the extent to which they were able to see what was happening, but I believe it is a substantial report. I would have been happier with it if it had recognised that there is also racial discrimination between black and black in the world, and people of other colours, rather than distinguishing only between black and white. I think there are many salient facts set forward in the report. It states, amongst other things, that there are indeed areas in Queensland where Aborigines have been denied the right to obtain land. The cause of uncertainty which arises as far as the Queensland people are concerned is to be found in the statements made by people such as Mr Bjelke-Petersen, the Premier of Queensland. In a statement on 4 September this year he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The radical Left's drive for so-called 'land rights', a misnomer if ever there was one, is just another variation of the old cargo-cult. All Queenslanders now have the right to buy, sell and own land and as such they already have 'land rights'. The process of obtaining land is the same for all, as it should be in a democratic society. </PARA>
<PARA>That is gobbledegook and untruth. We know that. The facts are there to show that for Aboriginal people there have been unjust denials of land and rights and that in fact this is not a demand just by people on the radical left. I suppose there are relative conservatives like Senator Bonner and me, religious people and those of other groups who believe that justice must be done to the Australian Aboriginal people and the situation not pushed away in that manner. Uncertainty is being caused by the forked tongue and differing statements of Queensland leaders. In the Age of 18 March this year is a report of what the Premier of Queensland said about his intention to repeal the two Acts covering Aboriginals and Islanders by the end of this year. He did not expect the State government to set up other systems. The report reads:</PARA>
<PARA> 'We don't want them set aside in some country that becomes black man's country-we want them to live exactly like you do', Mr Bjelke-Petersen told the Press conference. 'We'll make them Queenslanders just like you and I-We won't pass any new law.'</PARA>
<PARA>The same day the Queensland Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Tomkins, said that he believed there would be new legislation to replace the old. A report of his remarks reads:</PARA>
<PARA> 'I don't think it will be repealed and nothing put in its place,' Mr Tomkins said last night. </PARA>
<PARA>Whatever one might say about these things and whatever one believes as to who will win out in such a battle, there is every ground for thinking there is uncertainty on the part of the Queensland Aboriginals, an uncertainty which this Parliament must do its best to resolve. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the last of the four points that I previously mentioned. What about the public demand for justice? Is this a matter in which only Queenslanders are interested or are other people interested? I have referred to the report of the World Council of Churches. It pointed out the demands made and what it believes should be done in this case. But to me and to many members of this Parliament, have come demands for immediate action from all different sections of life. I refer in particular to two organisations. One is the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace. In a letter to me on 21 August 1981 it set out a four-point policy in relation to the Queensland situation as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Queensland Government should consult fully with the Aboriginal and Islander people of Queensland before repealing the Acts. The public service must have ample opportunity to discuss proposed changes. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Queensland Government should vest Aboriginal and Islander reserve lands and lands in the Shires of Aurukun and Mornington Island in a form of direct Aboriginal ownership considered suitable by Aboriginal and Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. The Queensland Government should enact legislation to give Aboriginal and Islander people the right to veto mining and other developments on their land: any overriding of that veto should be contingent upon judicial inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. In the event of the Queensland Government failing to grant land rights to Aboriginal and Islander communities the Commonwealth should exercise its constitutional powers and provide these rights by Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will note that the action is proposed in the event of the Queensland Government failing itself to act. So far the Queensland Government has failed. The amendment that I propose to move tonight, with the support of Senator Bonner, is designed to ensure that there is no doubt that the Queensland Government has made up its mind; that we know where it stands; that no longer can it be said that that Government has been taken by surprise, that it did not have the opportunity to complete its investigations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Uniting Church, at its 2nd Assembly held quite recently, resolved-I shall quote the major recommendation only-as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. recognise the injustice done to Aboriginal people through the dispossession of their lands, the importance of ties with their land for the maintenance by Aboriginals of their culture, and the economic importance of land; and affirm its support for Aboriginal groups seeking to obtain freehold title to traditional lands or land to be used for housing and economic support, and compensation for land which has been expropriated. </PARA>
<PARA>After dealing with other matters, including stating what the resolution was about, they went on to say what the church would do in respect of its own land-that is, pass some of it back to the Aboriginal people. That was expressed as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> In pursuance of this policy the Uniting Church is bound to support any political initiative which really seeks to honour the right and need of Aboriginal people for secure land tenure. Furthermore the Uniting Church would want to support positive political action to aid the Aboriginal people of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> It is our hope that the Federal Government would be more decisive and courageous in facing the issues raised. We do not believe its present actions have been effective. </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, there is a demand by the Aboriginal people themselves. It is important to recognise that the surveys taken in Queensland have indicated overwhelmingly that the Aboriginal people want land rights. The World Council of Churches referred in its report to the survey that was taken in 1978 of Aboriginal opinion in Queensland. This showed that the overwhelming majority of Aboriginals on reserves, 73.1 per cent, wanted the Commonwealth Government to replace the State government as the body responsible for making laws; that 85 per cent of Aboriginals on reserves wanted the ownership of the reserve land to be in their hands; that the survey revealed a widespread desire for self-determination. I believe that is even stronger today. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Campaign for Land Rights and Self-Management in Queensland on 10 July 1981 pointed out that the investigations in 1979 of the Foundation for Aboriginal and Islander Research Action had noted that 85.6 per cent of reserve residents wanted land ownership of reserves to be in the hands of Aboriginal and Islander residents of the reserves; that 78.1 per cent wanted the community councils to control all decision-making relating to housing on reserves; that 86.2 per cent wanted the councils to control access to reserves; and that 80.3 per cent wanted the councils to control mining, waterways and forest reserves. Perhaps even more significantly, the survey found that 69.1 per cent, almost 70 per cent, of Aboriginals and Islanders presently living in Queensland towns, stated that they would return to live on a reserve if it were controlled by the Aboriginal people. So there is also expressed a wish to change their place of living, if that can be done. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told that the Queensland Government is undertaking an investigation of what the Aboriginals on the reserve want and that it has not yet got all the results. I have not much doubt as to what that result will be. The results are in so far as the Torres Strait Islander Advisory Council is concerned. According to the figures shown in its report, those who wanted inalienable freehold numbered more than 1,000,-1,047; those who wanted freehold numbered 44; those who wanted perpetual leasehold numbered 10; and that one person wanted leasehold. In regard to control of Islander affairs, 721 wanted control by Islanders and four wanted control by government. One does not need much more than that to indicate their overwhelming desire. Despite all of the propaganda, the Aboriginal people clearly have made up their minds in this way. Thus, there is no doubt about the need and the demand. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to more difficult questions. Where do we go from here? What strategy should be employed? Should the Bill be passed by the Senate at this time? I believe that to pass it at this time would be a great mistake on the part of honourable senators; that we should give the Queensland Government a last chance. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator's logic is infallible; he is quite right. In my opinion the Queensland Government has had far, far more opportunities than one could expect to be given. The answers should be there. But honourable senators know the way in which the Queensland Government has argued in the past; the way in which it will act as a sovereign state if it feels that it can put a case-one that it feels has not been given a hearing. The Queensland Government says that it has legislation coming along; that that legislation will be before Cabinet by about the middle of October. It states also that it is obtaining the views of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. That survey apparently has not yet been completed. No stone must be left unturned to ensure that this is right. Also we must be sure that we pass a water-tight Bill, one which, if in fact the Queensland Government indicates that it will not act to meet the needs of the Aboriginal people, will be adequate. We must pass a Bill that does not let down the Aboriginal people again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not believe there is any value in having some Bill passed on the eve of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. That argument has been raised by some people. In fact, Senator Ryan has written to me about the amendment that I am about to move, stating that it will delay the Bill until 29 October and that that is quite unacceptable as it undermines the potential effectiveness of the initiative. I say earnestly to her that I do not believe that is right. In fact, it will make water-tight the initiative which is being undertaken. Certainly, if we do as Senator Bonner and I propose in this amendment, and delay the final decision on the second reading until 29 October, so far as I am concerned, if the Queensland Government has not by then come forward with genuine and sensible proposals which cover the needs and desires of the Aboriginal people, I will have no hesitation in voting for a Bill-which one would want to be sure was effective. I know that Senator Bonner is of the same view. I therefore move:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out all words after 'That', insert</PARA>
<PARA> (1) the Bill be deferred to enable the Queensland Government to advise the Senate and the Australian people of the specific proposals of that Government on-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) its announced intention to repeal the Aboriginal and Torres Islander Acts and to amend the Queensland Lands Act in order to abolish Aboriginal reserves in Queensland;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) what consultative processes it has undertaken and completed to ascertain the desires of the Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, who presently reside on reserve lands, for land rights and self-management of their own communities;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the alternative legislative and/or administrative steps it now proposes to take, in accordance with the expressed wishes of the local communities, to provide Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders with land rights or other effective security of tenure of lands now constituting the reserves and of other traditional lands to which they have proper claims;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) what legislative and/or administrative steps it proposes to take to provide effective self-management for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in Queensland; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the date or dates on which such legislative and/or administrative action will be completed, and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) if no such advice has been received by the Senate by 29 October 1981, the Bill be restored to the Notice Paper, and the second reading be an Order of the Day for the first sitting day after 29 October 1981, and that such Order of the Day take precedence of all other business on the Notice Paper for that day.''. </PARA>

We would ascertain also the legislative and administrative alternatives or steps that the Queensland Government will take to carry out its proposals in regard to both land rights and self-management, and when this is to be done. If we are not satisfied in that regard we propose that the Bill should be brought back and, before the rising of the Senate at the end of the session, be dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One question was raised in the drafting stage with the Clerks to which we could not get a satisfactory solution. I refer to the two situations that may arise if in fact the Senate were to rise before the time specified. We would have some days notice of that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the Government would facilitate it. The alternative is that the Queensland Government might take precipitate action. It might abolish the reserves and create national parks. I do not intend to put suggestions into the minds of members of the Queensland Government. If any of those steps were to be taken Senator Bonner and I would be prepared to give the undertaking which I now read into the record. Senator Bonner and I have chosen in our amendment the date of 29 October 1981 for receiving advice from the Queensland Government of its legislative and administrative intentions in relation to Aboriginal reserves, land and self-management. From information we have received we believe that that gives more than ample time for the Queensland Government to make its intentions clear. Suggestions have been made but not confirmed that this Parliament may complete its session before that date. We agree with Opposition senators that the vote on this Bill in the Senate should be completed this session. However, we are advised by the Clerks that it is not appropriate to insert an alternate date in an amendment but that our end can be achieved by a vote of the Senate and by undertakings of procedural support. Consequently, Senator Bonner and I assure the Senate that, in the event of a proposed closure of the session before 29 October, or in the event of earlier action being taken by the Queensland Government that might prejudice Aboriginal rights under this Bill, we will support any procedural steps that might be necessary to bring on the Bill for a vote before the closure of the session.</PARA></TALK.START>

We will not see this Parliament hoodwinked by any action of the Queensland Government. Therefore, in my opinion it would be a fatal mistake if we were to pass this Bill now. As I will point out in a moment, this Bill has defects which need to be cured. If it is to go ahead it must go ahead with those defects cured. I and, I believe, Senator Bonner also, would not vote in favour of this Bill and pass it tonight. That would be a fatal mistake by the Senate. The Bill must neither pre-empt what the Queensland Government may do, nor must it fail in its intention. I urgently appeal to members of the Senate, including members of the Australian Democrats who are present, who I believe are sincerely concerned about this problem, to ensure that we do not falter or make a mistake in relation to timing. Another reason why this Bill should not and could not pass at this stage is that amendments to it have been tabled tonight. We have not seen those amendments. I do not criticise Senator Evans in any way for that. But we do want to see those amendments and to see the defects.</PARA></TALK.START>

I agree; it is not an insuperable task, but there are tasks to be performed. This Bill has been put together in a patchwork quilt way.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Roughly half the Bill is that 1976 Act. It is a Bill prepared by a committee. The other half of the Bill is the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities Self-Management) Act 1978, with some improvements. But unfortunately they do not sit together terribly well. Senator Evans has mentioned only some of the problems in the Bill. For example, let us look briefly at clause 8 (1) of the Bill, that very interesting provision which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Council for an Aboriginal Reserve to which this Act applies, or for an Islander Reserve to which this Act applies, shall be responsible to, and only to, the Aboriginal community or the Islander community, as the case may be, residing on the Reserve for the conduct, discipline and well-being of the members of the Aboriginal community or the Islander community, as the case may be. </PARA>
<PARA>That is very much a take from the 1978 Act. But I think it probably is unwise to use it in this Bill. I think it is probably too wide. After all even in Queensland there are laws that relate to civil liberties. Such considerations are excluded from this Bill. In this Bill the council is given overwhelming power. Maybe that is intended. Maybe that is what we should have. But I think we should look carefully at that before we decide to exclude aspects of the ordinary common law and statute law of Queensland. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Everything I say can be clarified in the Committee stage, but work must be done on that aspect before we come to the Committee stage. One of the extraordinary things that Senator Evans said tonight was: 'It is all right because look at sub-clause (2) of clause 14 where it states ''this Parliament does not affect the application to a Reserve of a law of Queensland to the extent that that law is capable of operating concurrently with this Part''.' But that is not what it states. It turns it around. It does not say that sub-section (1) is subject to sub-section (2); it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Subject to sub-section (1) and (3), this Part does not affect the application to a Reserve of a law of Queensland to the extent that that law is capable of operating concurrently with this Part. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 14 (1) takes out the law of Queensland. The second aspect of this is that clause 14 (1) states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Council for a Reserve to which this Act applies, or for a Community to which this Act applies, is not subject to control under a law of Queensland and, in particular, is not required to comply with any directions given to it under or by virtue of a law of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>It removes entirely the effect of the law of Queensland. When we come to laws operating concurrently, referred to in sub-clause (2), we see that they are subject to sub-section (1) and not the other way around. Maybe it is a mistake; maybe it is intended that it be the other way around. Unfortunately, as it stands, it contains a very clear exclusion of the common law. So there are two aspects: The councils are given overwhelming power and common law and statute law are excluded, which is not an effective way in which to operate. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another aspect to this. As I said, Part I gives the councils a very strong power to dictate and control communities. In Part II we find that land is placed in the control of trusts. Those trusts are given very strong administrative powers. Senator Evans has acknowledged that indeed there is a danger that the people running the council might be different from the people running the trust. In communities there are people of different tribes and different clans, and one group of people might be in control of the trust and another might be in control of the council. They might disagree on what is to be done. Each of them seems to be given power to control the land under this legislation. Nothing in the Bill really satisfactorily provides for conciliation between them or explains whose will will prevail. There is no provision for appeal. There may be desirably in those situations a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal with on it distinguished Aboriginal citizens who are not members of a particular reserve. That is a possibility. In the interests of the Aboriginal people of Queensland we must find solutions to this problem and not allow those sorts of difficulties to crop up without there being any power of appeal or any resolution of the problems involving the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other questionable things in terms of the Bill. There are of course the functions relating to management and control. There are differences between those provisions and clause 44 which enables regulations to be made which might vary those functions. Senator Evans referred to clause 10-I merely very quickly refer to those matters-the by-laws power, the exclusion of disallowance which has gone out of the old Act, and I understand he has an amendment which is designed to cover this sort of thing and to overcome some of the constitutional doubt in this area. He has not mentioned clause 29 which deals with missions and land on which missions are located. That clause has some rather curious provisions in it because it provides that whereas a mission may have rights to continue in occupation, if it enters into a lease the land on which it is situated ceases to be land to which the clause applies. There is no right of appeal; there is no right of any further lease. I think that has to be looked at. I do not put it any higher than that. I think there is obscurity in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 36 of the Bill-the arbitration section of the Bill-includes amendments which were defeated in the Senate and the House of Representatives considered the 1976 Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill. These amendments did not go into that Bill but they have been put into this one. I merely said that we ought to look at them to ascertain whether the Senate was right in rejecting them in 1976 and whether they should be altered and inserted in this Bill. I do not think I need to go any further into those things. I do not want to be nit-picking about this but I do not believe anything that I have referred to is not, with proper advice, capable of being repaired so that the Bill will be successful. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe we have to get this Bill right if we have to have this Bill. If we have to have the Bill we will be taking on an enormous fight with the Queensland Government. There is no doubt that that Government will endeavour to thwart the will of the Parliament. The people who we must ensure do not suffer again from any mistakes that we may make are the Queensland Aboriginals and the Torres Strait Islanders. It is for those reasons that Senator Bonner and I have proposed this amendment, and we sincerely hope the Senate will support it. We think the Bill ought to be put aside. The Queensland Government is well aware of the threat of what the Senate is likely to do if it does not in fact come up with proper provisions in the month provided. The Queensland Government will have more than enough time to provide reasons for its decisions and to tell us what it intends to do in accordance with the wishes of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people. I therefore urge support for the amendment and I hope that we do not have to go to the next situation of having to vote on the second reading motion at this stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to speak for quite as long as Senator Missen did. His speech rather amazed me, as a matter of fact. I cannot quite understand how he has got this deep and abiding faith in the Queensland Government because it does not keep promises in any area. I want to say that Australia, and the Aboriginal people of Australia, are on the side of Senator Ryan and the Labor Party in producing this private member's Bill. It is true, as Senator Missen has said, that there might be certain technical weaknesses in the Bill but they can be improved in the Committee stage by appropriate amendments. If there are still weaknesses in it after that there is no reason why this Parliament cannot improve them with further amendments at a later date. The Bill itself has been drafted in circumstances quite different from those in which the original 1975 Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill was drafted and the 1976 Bill which was enacted to deal with land rights in that part of Australia. Queenslanders are in a unique situation because of the type of government that we have and the type of people who run that government who in fact are not favourable to Aboriginals anyway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make my contribution to this debate as short as possible because I agree with Senator Missen when he said that it is a very important Bill. I hope we can deal with the major part of it tonight. I want to quote from a Press statement issued by Senator Susan Ryan on 18 September 1981. I will quote only one paragraph which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Federal Opposition spokesperson on Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Susan Ryan has warmly welcomed today's unanimous decision by the High Court recognising a special interest of the Victorian Aboriginal tribe which sought to prevent the clearing of land at Portland by the Alcoa company. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that 80 per cent of the population of this country supported the 1967 referendum which gave to the Australian Government the right to take responsibility for Aboriginal affairs in this country. This has now been backed up-I will quote later from other authorities in this regard-by the High Court of Australia in its decision in relation to the Victorian tribe that wanted to preserve this area even though some of it has already been desecrated. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard this document which I have already shown to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume). </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>BACKGROUND TO REVIEW OF ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS (NORTHERN TERRITORY) ACT 1976</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Mr Justice Woodward was commissioned to inquire into Aboriginal land rights in the N.T. on 8 February 1973. He presented an interim report on 19 July 1973 and a second and final report on 3 May 1974. He emphasized that the 'Aboriginal people themselves must be fully consulted about all steps proposed to be taken' (par. 48). He foresaw the need for review of the arrangements between the Land Councils and the government after three years and thereafter at seven year intervals to ensure that anomolies are brought to light and that the system does not become rigid and unresponsive to changing needs. He emphasized the need for both flexibility and for the broad basis of arrangements to remain undisturbed. (par. 757-764). </PARA>
<PARA> 2. In his speech on the second reading of the Aboriginal Land Rights Bill on 4 June 1976 Mr Viner Minister for Aboriginal Affairs said:</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will give traditional Aborigines inalienable freehold title to land or reserves in the Northern Territory and provide machinery for them to obtain title to traditional land outside reserves. The coalition Parties' policy on Aboriginal affairs clearly acknowledges that affinity with the land is fundamental to Aborigines' sense of identity and recognises the right of Aborigines to obtain title to lands located within the reserves in the Northern Territory. The Bill gives effect to that policy and, further, will provide Aborigines in the Northern Territory with the opportunity to claim and receive title to traditional Aboriginal land outside reserves. The Government believes that this Bill will allow and encourage Aborigines in the Northern Territory to give full expression to the affinity with land that characterised their traditional society and gave a unique quality to their life. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister's statement makes clear two fundamental policy intentions of the Government:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the title would be inalienable freehold title, and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) there would be an ongoing process enabling Aboriginals to obtain title to traditional land outside reserves. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Viner emphasized this again later in his speech when he spoke of land claims to be heard by the Commissioner to Wave Hill, Willowra and Kildurk 'and the several other properties recently bought for Aboriginal communities by the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission or now being purchased by the Commission.'</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Mr Viner emphasised these aspects of the Act again in articles published in the Northern Territory News in the latter half of 1978 and published by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs as a booklet. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Alienated land bought by the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission for Aboriginals, then being alienated to Aboriginals, can be subject to claim by Aboriginals on traditional grounds. If the claim is upheld, it takes on the status of traditional land and inalienable freehold title passes to the traditional owners.'</PARA>
<PARA>There can be no doubt that the intention of the Government was to allow traditional land claims to be made to pastoral lease properties owned by or on behalf of Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. The Land Rights Act came into operation in January/February 1977. Deeds of grant for reserve lands were prepared, research for traditional land claims began, land claims began to be lodged, negotiations began with mining companies. The Aboriginal Land Rights (NT) Act has been extremely successful. Some justice has at last been done to Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. Former reserves have become Aboriginal land. Traditional land claims have been heard. Some have been won, some lost. The hearing of claims is proceeding in the careful and orderly process envisaged by Mr Viner in his second reading speech. Agreements are being made with mining companies. Companies are expressing their satisfaction with the good relationships they are establishing with Land Council and are acknowledging Aboriginal interests and aspirations. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. By the Northern Territory (Self Government) Act 1978, the Northern Territory became a self governing Territory and the interests of the Commonwealth in land vested in the Northern Territory from 1 July 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> Thereafter the Northern Territory Government began to complain about alleged problems with the operation of the Land Rights Act. It said that it was making these complaints on behalf of pastoral and mining interests. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. On 24 August 1978 in a letter the NT Chief Minister Mr Everingham assured the Land Councils that it was 'not the intention of the Northern Territory Government to attempt to avoid the intentions of the provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act.' He gave an undertaking on behalf of the Northern Territory Cabinet that 'for unalienated Crown land which is the subject of a claim before the Aboriginal Land Commissioner no action will be taken to process applications for development of that land for a period of two years, except for that land for which action in respect of the land claim has been completed by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and which still remains unalienated Crown land. At the end of two years, processing of applications for utilisation of that land for developmental purposes will be considered by the Northern Territory Government in a way which should not be prejudicial to the future use of the land should the Aboriginal land claim be successful.'</PARA>
<PARA> This undertaking was restated by the Solicitor General in a letter to Mr Justice Toohey of 15 February 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. In September 1979 the Aboriginal Land Commissioner began hearing the land claim to Utopia Station owned by the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission. This was without doubt a land claim of the kind mentioned by Mr Viner and intended by the Land Rights Act. Despite this the NTG challenged the jurisdiction of the Commissioner to hear the claim. The Commissioner rejected the NTG argument. After a period of time in which Mr Everingham mounted a public campaign referring to Aboriginal run cattle stations as 'running sores' and 'harbours of disease', the NTG took the matter to the High Court. Again they were unsuccessful. (54ALTR145)</PARA>
<PARA> 8. In response to the complaints the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs Senator Chaney in November 1979 appointed Mr B. Rowlands Q.C. to examine the representations he had received regarding 'the practical implementation of the Land Rights Act'. Mr Rowlands terms of reference stated that 'this examination will be without detriment to the basic principles of the Act.'</PARA>
<PARA> 9. Mr Rowlands made visits to the NT at the end of 1979 and held discussions with various bodies. He also received written submissions. The CLC forwarded a written submission on 5 May 1980. Sometime in 1980 the Land Councils received unofficially a submission to Mr Rowlands on behalf of the NTG. However it is understood that this document was not given to Mr Rowlands as Mr Everingham on 21 April 1980 advised 'that the NTG has decided it will not be making a submission to Mr Rowlands.' So, after complaining of problems with the Land Rights Act, and after preparing a written submission, the NTG chose not to subject its views to the scrutiny of the independant person appointed to examine any difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. The report of Mr Rowlands Q.C. to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs was made 11 August 1980. It examined a number of areas of alleged difficulty, assessed the nature of the problems, and suggested various possible solutions.</PARA>
<PARA> 11. Mr Rowlands Report was not released by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs until 18 November 1980. In February 1981 the NTG produced its views on the Land Rights Act in a written document in a submission to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. It raised a number of the same matters as the previous NTG document not submitted to Rowlands. The Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council each prepared submissions in response to the matters raised by the NTG. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. Senator Baume convened a meeting of representatives of the Land Councils and of the NTG in Darwin on 17 March 1981. The meeting began at 9 a.m. and had finished by midday. There was general discussion of the positions of the NTG and that of the Land Councils. The Land Councils saw that the NTG was attempting to whittle away the Land Rights Act, to reduce its effectiveness and value. The meeting concluded with agreement for a working party to examine some of the issues, for written proposals to be exchanged, and for the meeting as a whole to reconvene in six weeks time. </PARA>
<PARA> 13. The working party chaired by the N.T. Secretary of Mines met once on 7 April 1981. The Central Land Council met at Alice Springs 28 April 1981 and considered the NTG concerns. The CLC's issued a statement saying inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) that land claims over Aboriginal owned pastoral leases should continue;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that conservation parks should become Aboriginal land subject to management for park purposes;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) that Aboriginal communities on cattle stations should be able to obtain land;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) that mining on land under claim should not proceed without the consent of the traditional owners. </PARA>
<PARA>The meeting as a whole chaired by Senator Baume reconvened again on 11 May 1981. Again it was a half day meeting. Mr Everingham began the meeting by declaring that in view of the CLC statement there was no point in talking further. He remained and after some discussion of issues demanded a written statement of what the Land Councils would accept. The meeting adjourned and the Land Council representatives met and produced written proposals which were made available to NTGs representatives in the early evening. The meeting reconvened in the late morning for a short time on 12 May when Mr Everingham presented a written response to the proposals. The Land Council representatives made it clear at all times that they had no authority to act without the consent of the full Land Council. They agreed to take the proposals back to their respective Land Councils. </PARA>
<PARA> 14. At the same time as the Land Councils were talking to Mr Everingham trying to reach agreement the Minister for Lands Mr Robertson was acting to alienate a substantial portion of the Lake Amedeus land claim by way of lease to two men who wanted it for camels for a tourist enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> The claim had been lodged on 12 June 1980 and was within the period covered by Mr Everingham's undertaking. The CLC members were deeply angered by this breach of faith by the NTG including a promise by the Minister for Mines to alienate land in relation to which the Aboriginal Land Commissioner was hearing a claim. The CLC met 2-3 June 1981 and issued a further statement saying inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) that the Land Rights Act should be strengthened to prevent the alienation of land under claim,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that the NTG had acted in bad faith,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) that a system for dealing with needs of Aboriginal groups on cattle stations should be established,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) that the right to claim Aboriginal owned cattle stations and stock routes should be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> 15. On 10 June 1981 Mr Everingham wrote to the CLC Chairman calling off the meeting that had been arranged for 23 June. He threatened:</PARA>
<PARA> 'If there is to be no shift in the stance taken by the Central Land Council you leave the Northern Territory Government with no alternative other than to pursue its own remedies in its own way.'</PARA>
<PARA>The Chairman of the CLC wrote to the Prime Minister on 17 June about NTG attempts to weaken the Land Rights Act. That letter was inserted as an advertisement in the National Times. On 25 June Mr Everingham wrote to Senator Baume asking for the meetings to be reconvened as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> 16. Following discussions with Mr Gray of DAA, where it was again made clear that the CLC had no interest in confrontation with the NTG and wished to find solutions to any real problems raised by the NTG, it was arranged for Mr Everingham to attend a full meeting of the Central Land Council on 12 August 1981. He attended with the Minister for Lands Mr Robertson. </PARA>
<PARA> The CLC Chairman raised at the outset the acts of bad faith by the NTG. In response:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Everingham told the meeting he was 'sick to death of the Central Land Council'. Mr Everingham told the meeting that after seeing the National Times advertisement the NT Cabinet had decided to go its own way and make its own laws to achieve what it wanted. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Robertson said that not only was a lease granted over part of the Lake Amadeus claim, but the balance had been advertised as being available for claim. He undertook to get the parties together to seek a compromise solution.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Robertson said that Mr Everingham's promise not to deal with land under claim so as to prejudice the claim did not mean what it said. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Everingham remained silent. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Baume attended the meeting in the afternoon. He explained the matters concerning the NTG. Pressed by one Council member in particular as to which Government had the final power in relation to Aboriginal people Senator Baume said the Commonwealth Government but that it would not exercise its powers to disallow legislation of the NTG that weakened the operation of the Land Rights Act. At this meeting Land Council members gave much consideration to claims to Aboriginal owned cattle stations and clearly reaffirmed their commitment to converting leasehold interests to freehold title. </PARA>
<PARA> 17. Representatives of the Land Councils met with Senator Baume and Mr Everingham on 13 August. Senator Baume began by stating that while the Governor-General had power to disallow NT laws he would not be advised to exercise it unless NT legislation was extremely offensive. CLC representatives stated that the CLC was committed to freehold title as that provided security of title and control over mining. Mr Everingham responded with a proposal for perpetual leases that could not be forfeited. He said this was the NTG's 'last word'. He again emphasised that the NT Cabinet had resolved 'to go its own way' and had prepared a legislative package 'tied up with a ribbon' which it would introduce the following week if the proposal was not accepted by the Land Councils. </PARA>
<PARA> 18. On 24 August 1981 at a meeting attended by Senator Baume and staff the NLC resolved to accept the principles in the NTG proposal. On 25 August the CLC neither rejected nor accepted the proposals. Senator Baume also attended this meeting. A number of Aboriginal members of the Council spoke to him of how they had been forced off cattle stations and wished to pursue claims to small stock route and stock reserve areas on their traditional country. The CLC said that careful consideration should be given to the wording of the legislation proposed by the NTG and that it would be irresponsible to agree to the proposals without being completely clear what they mean. The CLC committed itself to make a concentrated effort to work on the principles and details of the proposals with senior personnel of the NTG to seek to reach an agreement. Mr Everingham said that the Land Councils approach was acceptable and agreed to the establishment of a working party. </PARA>
<PARA> 19. The working party met 7, 8, 9 September 1981. The detail of the proposal to provide for community areas was discussed. The CLC submitted proposals that it considered met the NTG express concerns about conversion of Aboriginal owned cattle stations and claims on stock routes. Difficulty arose in relation to the perpetual lease proposal as the N.T. Solicitor-General explained the proposal to mean-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) An Aboriginal station owner would have the right to apply for a perpetual lease. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) He would have to fulfil certain criteria e.g. be qualified by experience, have sufficient finance, have taken steps to eradicate TB and brucellosis. </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Both the Land Board and the Minister would have a discretion as to whether the perpetual lease be granted. </PARA>
<PARA> (iv) While forfeiture as a sanction would be removed, substantial fines would be introduced, payment of which could be enforced by sale of the land. </PARA>
<PARA>It was agreed that the parties would take the issues raised back to their principals and meet again at the end of September. The Chairman of the NLC Jerry Blitner stated towards the close of the working party sessions that the NLC had only agreed to the NTG proposals because they had been threatened. </PARA>
<PARA> 20. On 10 September 1981 Mr Everingham publicly attacked the CLC for claims on stock routes and stock reserves. The CLC pointed out that these claims were for small areas of Crown land which had not been used for many years, and which were the only areas of land available to be claimed by dispossessed Aboriginals. These areas have never been declared or proclaimed as stock routes. It also agreed to the land being subject to the rights to move stock. In a television interview on 11 September Mr Everingham stated that he wanted the negotiations to continue, but that he would alienate the stock routes to prevent the land claims going ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> 21. In summary the review of the Land Rights Act has proceeded in an atmosphere of threat by the NTG and expressed reluctance by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to act to preserve the rights of Aboriginals under the Land Rights Act. The CLC is seeking:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) guaranteed preservation of the rights of Aboriginals under the Land Rights Act by non-alienation of land under claim;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) a system to enable Aboriginals on cattle stations and Aboriginals entitled to be on cattle stations to obtain- title to areas of land for their community needs;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) preservation of the right under the Land Rights Act to make a traditional land claim to land held by or on behalf of Aboriginals, subject to a system of lease back to the Aboriginal community for pastoral purposes;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) preservation of the right to claim areas of Crown land once used as stock routes or stock reserves, subject to the rights of others to move travelling stock across the land;</PARA>
<PARA> (v) preservation of the right to claim Crown land which has been declared to be a national park under N.T. law, until agreed N.T. legislatiof whereby the land will become both Aboriginal land and national park subject to a management committee. </PARA>

I had the honour of sitting with him on a committee which dealt with the Aurukun and Mornington Island decisions and I know his sentiments. But I cannot quite understand why he wants to defer this legislation. I want to quote from a letter dated 21 September which I received from the chairman of the Central Land Council in the Northern Territory. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Dear Senator Keeffe, Thank you for your letter of interest and support concerning the proposed changes to the Aboriginal Land Rights (N.T.) Act 1976.</PARA>
<PARA> The Central Land Council has committed itself to negotiations with the Northern Territory Government to identify any problems with the Act and to find solutions to those problems acceptable to all parties. The Central Land Council has put proposals to the Northern Territory Government as to how its concerns can be met. </PARA>
<PARA> I am deeply concerned that these negotiations are taking place with the Northern Territory Government threatening 'to go its own way' and pass laws to destroy rights that have accrued to Aboriginals under the Land Rights Act, and the Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal Affairs expressing his reluctance to act to ensure that the existing rights of Aboriginals are preserved. </PARA>

<PARA>Your faithfully,</PARA>
<PARA>Stanley Scrutton</PARA>
<PARA>Chairman</PARA>
<PARA>Central Land Council</PARA>
<PARA>My proposition is that the amendment that has been moved tonight by Senator Missen is part of the ongoing process of the Australian Government abdicating the promises that it made in 1975 and 1976. I have a summary of the discussions that have taken place, which summary was mentioned by the chairman of the Central Land Council. If any member on either side of the House wants a photostat copy of it I am prepared to supply it because this document represents a back-off from our obligations to the Northern Territory people. Let me cite one more attitude which I believe substantiates what I have just said. I shall quote again from a Press statement issued on 23 September 1981 by our spokesperson, Senator Ryan. It concerns the Noonkanbah film, which was not for overseas distribution. Paragraph 2 stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has stated that the film will not be distributed to overseas posts, nor will it be for sale to overseas television stations. </PARA>
<PARA>What are we frightened of? This is a first-class film. We ought to be proud of it. Perhaps we ought to be ashamed to show it anywhere in the world. Perhaps that is what is wrong-the Government is frightened. We have a Prime Minister who struts world platforms saying, 'I am opposed to apartheid', yet in this country he encourages it.

<PARA> I now wish to refer to a number of points raised by Senator Missen. I do not know what his reason was for moving the amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not going to get personal about this. If Senator Bonner wants to get personal, I think he is being idiotic. This is an important Bill. Senator Missen referred to the resolution carried by the Senate, and he was right. The Labor Government of the day made certain alterations, at the suggestion of the then Opposition, including Senator Bonner, so that the motion would be acceptable to both sides of the House. That motion was carried unanimously. We will be repudiating that if we continue to postpone a decision on land rights. It is true that the churches now are coming in and backing the Aboriginal people of Australia. The only problem is that they have come in about 150 years too late. Nevertheless, I am delighted to see that they all doing it, and I congratulate them on their attitude. Two reports were received two or three years ago. One was the report of a commission set up by the Queensland Government and it was a whitewash of the current separate laws. The other was 'Beyond the Act', which was produced by two groups of people, including the Aboriginal Legal Service. It is a very good historical work and is a very clear claim for land rights in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must again be slightly critical of Senator Missen. He said: 'Let us give them just one last chance'. One last chance in that State has been coming for 20 years. If we give them one more last chance they will keep this situation going for another 20 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Missen can beat them on one last chance, hear, hear, good luck. Let me trace a little of the history, and then I propose to refer to the amendment clause by clause. That will be my contribution to this debate. Dealing with the abolition of the Acts, I go back to 1884, when there were separate laws in Queensland for blacks and whites. The law introduced at that time, when I think Sir Samuel Griffiths was Premier, was tightened up a little in 1897 by some amendments. There were a number of other amendments, but two Acts covering Torres Strait Islanders and Aborigines were introduced in the late 1930s. Probably the worse Act ever introduced was the one put foward in 1965. Its by-laws and regulations virtually placed Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in the position of animals, not human beings. Senator Bonner would know that after the demonstrations and the strike that took place at Yarrabah and Palm Island in 1957 people were banned from both settlements for 20 years. Some of them never got back. In fact, the Yarrabah people were not allowed back until 1972, when a Labor Government was elected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at what the Premier of Queensland has done in relation to land rights. First of all, and I have a copy of this, a Cabinet minute initiated by him and distributed to his Cabinet said that no Commonwealth officer of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs was to speak to any senior person in any of the departments in Queensland unless the permanent head of the Department of Aboriginal and Islander Advancement and/or his nominee was present. That requirement was introduced by the Premier. When we tried to buy Archer River, and the person who owned the pastoral lease was happy to sell it to the Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the sale was blocked by the Premier. No sale was allowed. When a group of Aborigines wanted to buy a very small parcel of land in the Ayr district to set up a caravan park that would have kept at least two or three families in a good living, that too was blocked because the Queensland lands commission happened to be the owner of the land. It is all very well for the Premier to say: 'They can go into the market to buy land.' What Aboriginal family can afford to pay $50,000, $60,000, $70,000, $80,000, $90,000 or $100,000 for a small farming property? With the exception of the Seven Emus property in the Gulf of Carpentaria, what Aboriginal family can afford to pay $250,000 or $500,000 for a pastoral property on a freehold basis? They cannot do it, and the Premier knows they cannot do it. This is his way of locking out the blacks in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> In the days of the Labor Government there was an ex-Anglican mission station called the Gorge outside Mossman housing a small colony of Aborigines. Some of them were brought there from the old Daintree River area. The old people who were brought there in the 1930s were infested with hookworm and they all died out. However, the policy on the station is one of assimilation. The Queensland policy is to get rid of that reserve-a beautiful 60 acres of mountains and rivers-sell it to a tourist organisation. The dwellings are decrepit, and they are nothing more than huts. I do not know whether Senator Bonner has ever seen them, but they are a disgrace to humanity and a disgrace to any government, national or State. In the days when Senator Cavanagh was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs he wanted to rebuild those houses, but permission was refused by the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Islander Advancement and the Queensland Government. He then made an approach on behalf of the Australian Government to buy seven acres of an adjoining property and to build houses there. This was agreed to by the farmer concerned, but when my close personal friend, Holy Joh, found out about it he applied pressure to this farmer, who was a member of the National Party. The farmer withdrew his offer to sell the land to the Australian Government. Today, in 1981, it is a disgrace to this country, a disgrace to the State Government, and a disgrace to this Government that those people are still living in huts. When they wanted their homes painted they were forced to buy their own Dulux to tidy them up. It was not until six or seven years ago that they were allowed to have electricity. At that time they were getting it from the one white-owned house in the community. It was distributed through one of those multi-point systems to some of the lights. It is a wonder that somebody was not killed by that unofficial type of electric wiring. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not going to tolerate that sort of thing; or are we? If this amendment is carried, yes, we are going to tolerate it. The people in the communities in Queensland want land rights now. They do not want them in the never-never. They do not want them next year or the year after or in 10 years time, and they are no longer sitting back and copping it. I am sorry that when Senator Bonner went to Palm Island he would not talk to a mass meeting because he said it was an unofficial meeting. That is a very great tragedy. </PARA>

That area is a hotbed of people looking for land rights, and so are Yarrabah and Kowanyama and a number of other settlements, including those in the Torres Strait Islands. They are in ferment, waiting for a lead from this Government to get their land rights. I refer briefly to the clauses of the amendment proposed by Senator Bonner and Senator Missen. I hope that it is not carried. I hope that when the time to determine the motion for the second reading arrives this Senate has enough intestinal political fortitude to support the original Bill introduced by Senator Ryan, legal warts and all. Let us tidy those up with amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have to realise that we are not dealing with just one part of Australia. My personal friend, Johannes Bjelke-Petersen, has taken Queensland out of Australia. There is no such thing as the Queen of Australia in Queensland; she is the Queen of Queensland. That is the attitude with which we have to live. There is no such thing as democratic law. Laws are produced in Queensland which enable people to go into any home without a search warrant. When the new legislation is passed there will be no freedom of speech, there will be no freedom of movement and no freedom of congregation. That is the way it will be in the last decade of the twentieth century. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause (a) of the proposed amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA>its announced intention to repeal the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Acts . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I know that Senator Missen has treated this matter very kindly, but there is a very real fear that the Commonwealth Games will be boycotted by African nations because of Queensland's attitude to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. The games have already been negated because the Queensland Premier sent a telegram to Mr Muldoon congratulating him for letting the Springboks into New Zealand, where approximately 2,000 people were arrested because they opposed that decision. The Springboks are now in America. They played their first match there behind closed fences and only about 250 people turned up to watch. They happened to be trusted people. The black community was insulted. In addition to that, the Queensland Premier sent a telegram to Indonesia when it invaded Timor which meant, in effect: Get into them; clean them up. That is what happened. There were thousands of Indonesians in Timor with guns and bombs and the Timorese were cleaned up. That incident is a great blot on Australia's history. But the biggest blot on our history is the activities of the Queensland Premier. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause (b) of the proposed amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA> What consultative processes it has undertaken and completed to ascertain the desires of the Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait islanders . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Those consultative processes have all been held. The Premier and his permanent head and a couple of friendly Aborigines sat down with sandwiches in the back room of the Taj Mahal. That was their consultation. There will not be another one. The Premier will not allow it because 90 per cent of the blacks in Queensland want land rights. They do not want to fiddle around like this. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause (c) of the proposed amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA>the alternative legislative and/or administrative steps it now proposes to take, in accordance with the expressed wishes of the local communities . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The local communities are not going to be allowed to express their wishes. They have never been allowed to express their wishes. If they do express their wishes, the local council is sacked. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause (d) of the proposed amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA> What legislative and/or administrative steps it proposes to take to provide effective self-management . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Queensland Government does not propose to take any such step. The Premier has already said that if any militant decides he is not satisfied with the decision of the Queensland Government the Aboriginals will not get self-management. They will not get any sort of land. They will not even get a 50-year lease. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that my colleagues in the Senate will not accept this amendment, that in fact they will have second thoughts and allow the Bill to go through, political warts and all, as it now stands. </PARA>

<PARA> I am on record as saying publicly, and I repeat it this evening in this chamber, that I totally support the concept of this Bill. The Bill is long overdue. The granting of land rights to Aboriginal people in some States of this Commonwealth is long overdue. The Commonwealth Government, in its wisdom, has been able to achieve land rights for the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. I am proud to say that I played a small part in bringing that about. South Australia, to its credit, under a Liberal government, has given land rights to Aboriginal people in that State. We have all heard about the tribal Aboriginal people who now have a substantial amount of land in South Australia. But in our State of Queensland this has not been achieved up until now. </PARA>
<PARA> While I say that I support the Bill in principle, there are a number of parts of the Bill with which I am not completely happy. I suggest that this Bill be stood over for a period, as suggested in the amendment moved by my colleague, Senator Missen. I seconded that amendment. This will give us time, as my colleague has already said, to examine the Bill in much more detail and to have more expert advice and counselling in relation to it. This possibly will enable us to do something about those parts of the Bill that I and my colleague have some concern about, as does the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Chaney). </PARA>
<PARA> What we are talking about is not land rights such as those that have been achieved in the Northern Territory. What we are talking about is an area in the State of Queensland that has been set aside as Aboriginal reserves since 1890 or thereabouts. I have taken the trouble, through the Parliamentary Library, to have produced a reproduction of a map of Queensland which outlines the areas and the communities that this Bill is talking about, or at least should be talking about. Look at the total Queensland area of 1,727,000 square kilometres. The reserves we are talking about occupy a mere 75,000 square kilometres or approximately 2 per cent of the total area of Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed it is. That is the area that we are talking about, and that is land which has been set aside for a great number of years as reserves for Aboriginal people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think we need to have a small lesson in history. It might enlighten some of my colleagues on the other side of the chamber and it might also enlighten some honourable senators on this side of the chamber. Let us ask why that 7.5 million hectares, or 75,000 square kilometres of land was set aside for Aboriginals. It was not set aside of the goodness of the heart or the generosity of previous governments. It was set aside for Aborigines for a quite different purpose altogether. It was set aside so that the authorities could herd the Aborigines into communities, not because of their grave and great concern for them but for administrative convenience. What happened was that many Aboriginal tribes which normally occupied those lands and lived in separate communities, because they were separate tribes, were herded together. This caused tremendous problems for the Aboriginal people over that 100-odd years. It was done for administrative convenience so that the government of the day and the authorities knew where the Aboriginal people were. It was not done as the Act at that time stated, to protect the Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Keeffe, who is so knowledgeable about these Acts, did not even know the name of the Act. It was the Aborigines Protection Act, so called. Protection from what? In my opinion it was not in the true sense for the protection of the Aboriginals; it was to protect the whites from marauding blacks, as it were. That was one of the reasons for the setting up of these communities and for the setting aside of these lands. But the government of the day did not set the Darling Downs aside. It did not set any of the seaboard aside-land that was valuable for agriculture or for building towns. No, at that time it set aside what was considered to be worthless land. The land was no good for agriculture-growing citrus, grain or anything else. It was set aside for Aborigines, as I say for the third time, for administrative convenience-to keep the Aborigines where they could be kept under control. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the herding of Aboriginal tribes into these communities, there was another way of handling Aboriginal people or, to use the unfortunate terms that the Premier in Queensland has used on occasions, to get rid of the radicals. In those days they had different meanings from that used today. In those days we did not call them pinkos or commos or radicals, but immediately an Aborigine raised his voice in protest against some authority, he was picked up by the protector of the town or village, who happened to be the police officer wherever he lived, put into the local gaol and transported under escort to one of these communities, where he would remain until the authorities felt that he was behaving himself enough to go back and live in the broader community. Sometimes they were never returned to their communities. Descendants of Aboriginals who were forced on to the communities are still living there. They are the descendants of a number of generations. I can name some of them for the edification of some of my colleagues here today. Four people on Palm Island are descendants of people who were sent there- and they happen to be my sons Patrick, Kenny, Peter and Tony. They are the descendants of the late Mr Jim Banfield, who was forcibly put on to Palm Island by the authorities under these Acts that are now, thank God, not with us any more. All down through those years these kinds of things happened. I have seen them happen. I also know the people who were involved in getting rid of Aboriginal people who for some reason wanted to speak up against authority. Those reserves are still there. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last 10 to 15 years, as in the past, many Aboriginal people raised their voices and asked for the repeal of the repressive Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders Acts. The term that was used at that time by some of them was 'smash the Act'. This campaign has raged for many years but, more specifically, over the last 10 years. All down through those years I have cautioned against this so-called smashing of the Act. I have done that at great cost to myself. I am not talking about finance or economics; I am talking about the great cost to myself. I was called an Uncle Tom and a traitor and many nasty names by both Aborigines and non-Aborigines because I dared to caution against the smashing or the repealing of this repressive Act. I could see, more particularly since I had become a senator, the dangers for the Aboriginal people in the State of Queensland if that Act was repealed or if it was smashed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government in Queensland has finally listened to the voices of the people who were calling for the smashing of the Act. Senator Keeffe, who sits opposite, was one of the leaders. Senator Georges, who is asleep, was another one of the leaders screaming for the smashing of the Act. Now that the Act is being repealed and we can clearly see the dangers, a different tune is being played. The repeal of that Act and the repeal of the Act that governs the lands go side by side. No one has told us yet what is going to replace the Act when it is repealed. We have heard speculation and some statements by the Premier of Queensland that when he repeals the Act he will give 50-year leases to the communities. But he has also gone on record as saying that the communities will not be allowed to become havens for radicals. </PARA>
<PARA> We get back to the days I spoke about. The authorities had a different method of handling radicals in those days. They pushed them and shoved them into a community where they were confined at the pleasure of the authorities of the day. We have a different method now. Now we threaten Aboriginal people by saying: 'We will give you a 50-year lease but the communities will not be allowed to become havens for radicals'. Does that mean that if a 50-year lease were given to the Aboriginal community on Palm Island and I, who have been called by Ministers of State in Queensland and by the Premier, a radical, a pinko, a little Afghan camel driver and such like, were to go there the lease could be revoked?</PARA>
<PARA> What security of tenure is that to any people? What security of tenure would that be to any local government authority? I wonder what the local government of my city of Ipswich would say if the Queensland Government were to say: 'Look, Alderman Freeman'-who happens to be the mayor of that town-'we will give you a 50-year lease on this place'? What would he say? How could he do any forward planning? What could he do with that community? But that is supposed to be good enough for Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> I never have and I never will settle for leases. I will speak out and do whatever I can to reject them and to prevent that from happening to Aboriginal people-the race I am proudly a member of. I will speak up at any cost to myself to prevent that from happening. </PARA>

I think it important that we understand what we are talking about. I have outlined the reasons why the areas of land were set up and I have spoken about the repealing of the Act and all the things that I think are important to what we are talking about in this chamber this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am concerned that the Queensland Government has not yet made any kind of firm statement. Negotiations that have been going on between the Commonwealth and that State lead me to understand that the Queensland Government will be doing something in a reasonably short time. We do not know what it will do but I want to wait and see. In spite of some of the situations that have arisen in my State, I want to be fair to the Government of Queensland and give it a chance to tell this chamber, to tell the Commonwealth Government, to tell the people of Australia, to tell the people of Queensland but most importantly to tell the Aboriginal people of Queensland exactly what it intends to do. I want to see what kind of legislation will be brought down; I want to see what kind of regulations accompany that legislation; and I want to see exactly what the Queensland Government is offering the Aboriginal people in regard to these reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think the passing of this Bill tonight will be helpful in any way. I think it will be counter-productive. I do not want to see the State Government or the Premier of Queensland pushed into a corner where they will throw up their hands. They would get a lot of support in Queensland because people would say: 'This centralist Government again did not wait to see what we would do. We could have done something better'. They might do something worse, too, but once we know exactly what is to be done we can make the moves that I believe will ensure justice for the Aboriginal people of my State of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment moved by my colleague Senator Missen and seconded by me I believe represents the right approach to this whole mess in which we find ourselves. I think we can truthfully and honestly say we are approaching this problem in a bipartisan way. We can say, and I can say to the people of Queensland, that we are giving Queensland the right to make whatever moves it intends to make and to inform us as to what it is going to do. I think the amendment spells out exactly what needs to be done. The amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) the Bill be deferred to enable the Queensland Government to advise the Senate and the Australian people of the specific proposals of that Government on-</PARA>
<PARA>It then lists paragraphs (a) to (e). Paragraph (a) states:</PARA>
<PARA>Its announced intention to repeal the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Acts and to amend the Queensland Lands Act in order to abolish Aboriginal reserves in Queensland;</PARA>
<PARA>I think that spells out what we understand the Queensland Government intends to do. Paragraph (b) states:</PARA>
<PARA>what consultative processes it has undertaken and completed to ascertain the desires of the Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, who presently reside on reserve lands, for land rights and self-management of their own communities;</PARA>
<PARA>We are talking about self-management, not self-ruin. I am afraid that some clauses of the Bill make me suspicious in that regard. The amendment goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the alternative legislative and/or administrative steps it now proposes to take, in accordance with the expressed wishes of the local communities, to provide Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders with land rights or other effective security of tenure of lands now constituting the reserves and of other traditional lands to which they have proper claims;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) what legislative and/or administrative steps it proposes to take to provide effective self-management for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in Queensland; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the date or dates on which such legislative and/or administrative action will be completed, and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) if no such advice has been received by the Senate by 29 October 1981, the Bill be restored to the Notice Paper, and the second reading be an Order of the Day for the first sitting day after 29 October 1981, and that such Order of the Day take precedence of all other business on the Notice Paper for that day. </PARA>
<PARA>I can see nothing wrong with the Senate carrying that amendment. As I understand it, the Government is not unhappy with it, but I cannot see why the Opposition and the Australian Democrats would be unhappy with it. Senator Missen has made a statement, and I intend to make the same statement myself. The statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Missen and I have chosen, in our amendment, the date of 29 October, 1981 for receiving advice from the Queensland Government of its legislative and administrative intentions in relation to Aboriginal reserves, lands and self-management. From information we have received, we believe this is more than ample time for that Government to make its intentions clear. There have been suggestions, not confirmed, that this Parliament may complete its session before that date and we agree with Opposition senators that the vote on this Bill in the Senate should be completed in this session. However, we are advised by the Clerks that it is not appropriate to insert any alternative date in the amendment, but it can be achieved by vote of the Senate and by undertakings of procedural support. Consequently Senator Missen and I assure the Senate that, in the event of any proposed closure of the session before 29 October, or in the event of any earlier action being taken by the Queensland Government that might prejudice Aboriginal rights under this Bill, then we will support any procedural steps that may be necessary to bring on the Bill for vote before the closure of the session. </PARA>
<PARA> I was under the impression earlier in the piece when we first told people that we were proposing to move this amendment that the Australian Democrats had no real problems with it and that we could rely on their support. As I understand it-I may be wrong; I hope I am-that support has now been withdrawn. If that is the case and this amendment is defeated I want to say quite categorically, firstly, that I will not be supporting the second reading of this Bill and, secondly-I have the full support of Senator Missen-that in the event that the terms of this amendment are not achieved by the Queensland Government I give the Senate, the people of Australia and my fellow Aborigines in Queensland the assurance that my colleague and I will re-introduce this Bill, if Senator Ryan does not want to do it, or we will introduce a private member's Bill of our own that will achieve what we believe is in the best interests of the Aboriginal people of Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the amendment moved by Senator Missen and Senator Bonner and to indicate that the Opposition will be opposing this amendment. Before I proceed to explain why I would like to thank Senators Missen and Bonner for the contributions they have made this evening. I believe that for the most part what they have had to say endorses my initiative and underlines and reinforces the arguments that I, and the Australian Democrats, have put to the Senate about the need to have Commonwealth legislation of the kind outlined in the Queensland Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders (Self-Management and Land Rights) Bill 1981. It is only a matter of regret to me that having made such important and informative contributions regarding the situation in Queensland, both from the legislative expertise of Senator Missen and the personal life experience of Senator Bonner, that they have still concluded that they want to delay consideration of this urgent matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I gather from the contributions of Senators Bonner and Missen this evening, and indeed from the contribution of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) in the second reading debate, that their objections are not really to the substance of the Bill but to the timing. I make clear for the sake of the record that as far as the substance is concerned I have been open to, and still am open to, any constructive suggestions that will improve the Bill either in its efficiency of operation or in its clarity of intention. The Minister knows this. Senator Bonner and Senator Missen know this. Indeed, Senator Missen has come to my colleague, Senator Evans, with some suggested areas for amendment. By and large, these will be accommodated by our amendments at the Committee stages of the debate. The more significant amendments were foreshadowed tonight by Senator Evans. I have given a complete list of these amendments this evening to the Minister so that he can assure himself that the legal difficulties that have been raised have been addressed by way of prepared amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot accept the Missen-Bonner amendment this evening because it would postpone the Bill and delay action in an unjustifiable way. We have been asked, and asked again tonight, why the rush? I answer again: A combination of facts makes this initiative an urgent one. There is the frequently stated opposition of the Premier of Queensland to land rights. This opposition has been adverted to tonight on both sides of the chamber. What are we waiting for? We know the Premier of Queensland is totally opposed to freehold title. That is the first issue. Secondly, the past record of the Queensland Government establishes that it is prepared to legislate overnight to obstruct the wishes of Aboriginal people. There can be no argument about that. The degazettal of the reserves at Aurukun and Mornington Island in 1978 shows that the Queensland Government can and will, at any time convenient to itself, introduce unilateral State legislation totally contrary to the express desire of the Federal Government. I cannot take comfort from the suggestions tonight of Senators Missen and Bonner that they will make sure that if the Queensland Government does the wrong thing they will revive this initiative. We have seen the Fraser Government, with what we believe were the best of intentions, out- smarted by the Premier of Queensland over the degazettal of those reserves. We believe that is how he will act again. We must forestall him. The Minister said: 'We will insist on four criteria being met'. We have heard these criteria read out again by Senator Missen. They are acceptable criteria except they do not insist on a commitment to freehold title. </PARA>
<PARA> Why should we wait until the Premier announces the details of a leasing system when our commitment and the commitment of the Australian Democrats is to freehold title? If we are forced to wait, what is the advantage? I hope the Minister will address himself to this point; if we are forced to wait then Mr Bjelke-Petersen's leasehold system, whatever its details, will be simply one more system that the Commonwealth will have to dismantle to pursue freehold title. Such a dismantling would accelerate that very State-Commonwealth confrontation that Senator Baume insists he wants to avoid. Such a confrontation will only be avoided if the Federal Parliament is prepared to insist at this stage, prior to any State legislation, that freehold title is its objective. If we voted on the second reading tonight in support of the legislation-with Government support-that step would provide a clear sign to the Premier of Queensland that the Federal Government was seriously committed to freehold title in Queensland and that anything less than that would be unacceptable. </PARA>

And here we have an amendment which capitulates to him. It gives him time and breathing space to express his contempt for Aboriginal aspirations in legislative terms. I believe we must now act to demonstrate the willingness of the Federal Government to secure land rights. We must demonstrate this willingness before Queensland acts and not after. Why is the Federal Government unwilling to demonstrate its intention? It is suggested by some honourable senators opposite that they have such an intention, but they will not demonstrate the intention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting has been raised. Senator Baume in his speech at the second reading accused me of having all kinds of political motives in respect of timing in relation to CHOGM. I think it is time to question the cliche that I am acting out of political motives. What are political events for? How are they justified unless as a forum in which to advance a just cause? CHOGM is a political event initiated by a politician, the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and attended by other politicians, the leaders of Commonwealth countries. It is a political forum, and a costly one. How is it to be justified unless as a forum for the advancement of just causes? Similarly with the Senate, we are all politicians here, though Senator Baume likes to pretend otherwise. This is a political forum. It is not an operating theatre or surgery, Senator Baume. Senator Baume is not here in his capacity as a doctor; he is paid to be here as a politician and so am I and so is every other senator in this place. I am advancing, as a politician, in a political forum, a cause I judge to be a just cause for the Aboriginal people. Any other description of what is happening is completely dishonest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Hansard record will show that the Minister attempted a defence of the situation of the Queensland reserves. I am pleased that the Minister is resiling from this tonight. I point out that if there is any doubt in the mind of any honourable senator about the unsatisfactory nature of life on Queensland reserves we need only refer to the judgment in the Supreme Court of Queensland last week regarding the conviction of a person who grew up in the reserves, Alwyn Peter. I believe this was a very humane and progressive decision because for the first time the actual destructive environment of life on the Queensland reserve was taken into account and mitigated the sentence afforded. Let us have no pretence that there is anything other than a totally unsatisfactory situation prevailing on Queensland reserves today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister talks about the need for co-operation and consultation. In principle, who would object to that? But he is wrong to suggest that, in dealing with the Queensland Government, co-operation and consultation are going to achieve our aims. Let me remind the Minister and the Senate of what has happened in the past. Both the Whitlam and the Fraser Governments attempted to assist Aborigines in Queensland through consultation and co-operation with the Queensland Government. That Government remained intransigent. It refused to co-operate. This is evidenced by the actions of both Federal Governments in passing Federal laws aimed at assisting Aborigines in Queensland, despite the Queensland Government and that Govern- ment's outright opposition to Aboriginal self- determination. </PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975, the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 and the Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities Self-Management) Act 1978 all attempted to protect Aborigines from the Queensland Government. They were all passed against the wishes of that Government. The major reason why these Acts were not more successful is that they did not provide for what has come to be regarded as a prerequisite for Aboriginal self-determination-land rights, secure tenure to their land. In our view that means freehold title. Therefore, successive Federal governments have tried consultation and co-operation with the Queensland State Government. It has not worked. We have tried legislating without making provision in respect of land. That has not worked either. Thus Senate committees, churches, numerous international experts on racism, lawyers, jurists, and so on have all examined the situation and the consensus is that to enjoy self-determination Queensland Aboriginals need secure title to their land, but the Queensland Government is not prepared to grant it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs spoke of the fact that Queensland Aboriginal and Islander People are being consulted now, but there is no doubt whatever as to what those people want. Evidence for that exists in the survey published in the book by Malezar, Foley and Richards Beyond the Act. I will not describe that survey again because, conveniently, Senator Missen has already described it for us tonight, but it shows that the overwhelming desire of Queensland Aboriginals is to obtain freehold title. Yet the Minister wants them to wait. His Government is supposed to support land rights, but not now. His Government's policy is supposed to be self-management, but he is not prepared to listen to the Queensland Aborigines, at least not now. </PARA>
<PARA> Government senators have insisted tonight that we must wait to see what the Queensland Government will do. They read the papers, listen to the radio and watch television. Perhaps they even get Mr Bjelke-Petersen's Press releases. If so, they will know that the Premier of Queensland has given his final word on the granting of land ownership to Aboriginals and Islanders for their reserves. His final word is no. The Premier has ruled that option out completely. He has also apparently ruled out perpetual leases. In July of this year he gave a very clear outline of the system which will operate in Queensland after the abolition of the Queensland Act and the reserves. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Tenure will be initially for 50 years, 20 or 30 years longer than for normal grazing titles. Residents will be required to satisfy improvement conditions, such as fencing and land clearing 'the same as those applying to grazing properties'. Black communities will not be able to claim mineral rights 'as mineral resources belong to the Crown the same as on any other lease.' 'Militants' will be discouraged from the new leasehold. </PARA>
<PARA>Where would Senator Bonner stand then? He stated further:</PARA>
<PARA> An annual rental will be charged but 'the reserve residents will not be asked for a cash settlement to take over their leases'. </PARA>
<PARA> Elected councils representing the reserve population would hold the leases but would be helped by State advisers. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bjelke-Petersen explained-he was referring to the Aboriginals-that 'they are not losing control because they never had control over their land'. Of course, there he is quite wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs said in his speech of 16 September: 'It is simply not true to suggest that this is some kind of last chance to win recognition of land rights in Queensland,' and said that Queensland had been moving progressively, even if very slowly, in changing its legislation and administration of Aboriginal Affairs, I was quite astounded. I do not deny that the Queensland Government has effected some small changes which have had a little practical effect on the lives of Queensland Aborigines. On the major issues, the principles involved which are important, the attitude of the Queensland Government has hardened. </PARA>
<PARA> How can the Minister claim that there has been progress in Queensland when the Government of that State is currently mounting a legal challenge to the Racial Discrimination Act which will probably end up in the High Court? This challenge was prompted by the very same problem that we are discussing tonight, the Queensland Government's refusal to allow a group of Queensland Aboriginals to own land. That group was attempting to buy the land. That negates Mr Bjelke-Petersen's argument that Aborigines should, just like any other Queenslanders, buy land if they want it. They are not even allowed to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> The plain fact of the situation is that Mr Bjelke-Petersen will not allow groups of Aboriginal people to hold land because he fears they may obstruct the development of mining or tourism on the 2 per cent of land for which they seek immediate land rights. Therefore, Mr Bjelke-Petersen will not give Queensland Aboriginals secure title to their reserves. He will abolish the reserves, abolish what protection exists in the Queensland Act and grant leases on conditions that will allow their revocation by the Queensland Government. If Queensland Aborigines do not concur with the wishes of the Premier as to what is to happen on the reserve lands, he will not hesitate to revoke their leases. One does not need a crystal ball to work that out. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was quoting the conditions which the Premier announced in his July statement and then I added my own comments. These are the reasons why the Bill must go ahead now. All other avenues have been tried and have failed. Also, the Bjelke-Petersen Government is moving towards creating a situation in which further encroachment upon Aboriginal reserves is facilitated by a lease system which can be revoked. The Minister knows that Mr Bjelke-Petersen can act very quickly when he wants to, as he did in 1978. Unless the Commonwealth acts now to protect Queensland's Aboriginal reserves it may be too late. I ask the Minister to say what steps he could take if we are unsuccessful tonight and the Government's amendment is successful. What would he do if overnight the Premier of Queensland brought in a system of leaseholds? What steps would he be prepared to take then? It is absolutely untenable to accept the argument that it is better to wait until the damage is done and then try to fix it up rather than to take preventive action now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make something clear with regard to the timing of this measure in relation to that of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference. We do not wish to see the Australian Government humiliated and downgraded at that conference. In fact, our view is the opposite of that. The Australian Labor Party truly wishes to see Australia applauded by other Commonwealth leaders for taking action on this vital issue. What better way is there to demonstrate to Commonwealth leaders that Australia will not tolerate the oppression of its indigenous people any longer than by making a decision to support this legislation. It is a golden opportunity for the Prime Minister to demonstrate his good faith to the indigenous people of this country in a most appropriate forum. That is what we wish to see happen. If the Goveernment wishes to avoid Australia being condemned at CHOGM and violent confrontations occurring, of the type which the Minister's senior adviser, Mr Perkins, has predicted will mar the Commonwealth Games, I urge it to support this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has argued that the legislation could be challenged by the Queensland Government in the High Court, that the Federal Government could lose and therefore we should not proceed with it. This is a specious argument. If the Commonwealth's legislation were successfully challenged in the High Court, the Federal Government would have demonstrated that it was prepared to use every avenue to obtain self-determination for Queensland's Aborigines. It would then be time to proceed, as we did in 1967, to approach the people of Australia to grant the specific power that we needed. In my view, of course, the exercise would not fail but if it did all would not be lost. We could proceed to another referendum. So to say that because we might fail we should not try really amounts to an expression of political cowardice. The Queensland Aboriginals want land rights and want them now. To vote for anything else in the Senate tonight would be to break faith with the Aboriginal and Islander people of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason, I believe that we should defeat the amendment moved and proceed to vote on the motion for the second reading of the Bill. I remind the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs that, that having been done, it would be open to the Senate in the Committee stage of the Bill, whenever the Government wants to bring on that stage, to set about improving the Bill along the lines Senator Missen has suggested improvement is needed. We will be totally co-operative at that stage, as indeed we have endeavoured to be co-operative at this stage. We are trying seriously to provide the Government with an opportunity to make the decision which, sooner or later, it will have to make. We cannot go on forever pretending that these matters will be resolved by hostile State governments. So why not take this opportunity? The legislation is available to us, the Committee stage of that legislation could be available to us, to advance the cause which nearly all honourable senators have said they wish to advance. Mr President, I foreshadow that we will oppose the amendment moved by Senator Missen and seconded by Senator Bonner. We urge honourable senators to proceed tonight to give a positive vote on the motion for the second reading of this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> In speaking to this Queensland Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders (Self-Management and Land Rights) Bill 1981 tonight, I must say that if Senator Ryan cannot accept the amendment moved by Senator Missen I certainly cannot accept her Bill on a matter of principle. This Bill is an attempt by the Australian Labor Party and its Australian Democrats allies to set themselves up not only as the de facto government of Australia but also as the de facto government of Queensland. The people of Queensland have not given the ALP or the Australian Democrats a mandate for introducing this legislation. What really concerns and frightens me is that this move is unconstitutional. The ALP claims that the 1967 referendum gave the Commonwealth power to make laws for Aboriginals. That is not disputed. But that referendum did not give the Commonwealth power to take land, nor did it give it power to make other moves that are contemplated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter before us concerns the Aboriginal people of this country. I remind the Senate that the Democrats and the ALP plan to introduce also private member's Bills to give this Parliament power to prevent sand mining on Moreton Island. What we are really considering here is a very serious constitutional question. Minority groups are trying to use this Senate to force their will on democratically elected State governments. What in fact they are saying is: 'Queensland won't do what we want, so you make them do it'. In case any honourable senator feels that this is a good opportunity to do in this Senate what he or she cannot do at the ballot box-that is, to defeat the Premier of Queensland-let him or her reflect on the fact that, whilst it may be Joh today, it surely will be their State governments tomorrow. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I beg the senator's pardon; the Queensland Government was properly and democratically elected. It holds a majority of votes in that State. The National Party holds a majority of the vote in the seats within the Queensland coalition. The Queensland Government has been re-elected with more than 50 per cent of the total vote at every State election since 1957. It has a clear mandate from the people of Queensland for its policies. The ALP cannot claim it has that mandate. It has constantly been defeated at polls, both State and Federal, in Queensland. Yet this Bill seeks to override a democratically elected government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I invite honourable senators to look at the Bill. It is a blatant, transparent political ploy designed purely to embarrass Mr Fraser and the Federal and Queensland governments on the eve of the forthcoming Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. Senator Ryan has admitted that publicly on television. The ALP is only interested in point scoring and looking after its own interests. In my opinion and in the opinion of many Australians, to the ALP the situation of Australian Aboriginals is quite secondary to this Bill and the debate it has generated. I fail to see how anyone can take the honourable senator's Bill or the ALP seriously. Her introducing this Bill really is an unnecessary misuse of her position as a senator and of the trust people have placed in her by voting her into the Senate. </PARA>

My husband in his early days when he was working in the area during the war had Aboriginals in our Cherbourg electorate working for him. They were fed and clothed. They came to work and they lived in the house. I wonder whether Senator Georges has ever looked after the members of an Aboriginal family, had them in his home, fed them and had them working for him. It is all very well to talk about theory but I am talking about facts. The funny part about it, Mr President, is that they kept coming back year after year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walsh had better write a letter about that and find out. All I say as far as looking after Aboriginals in Queensland is concerned is that at the end of the war when Aboriginals from the far north of our State were at Woorabinda Joh spent a lot of his time and a lot of his money going up to search out another area for them in which to live. At that time the Lutheran Church took them from Woorabinda, where they were located, up to Hopevale because they wanted to go there. This to me is a demonstration of practical care for the Aboriginals. I would like to know whether Senator Ryan and Senator Georges who keep on interjecting have done anything similar for Aboriginals, other than talk about them. That is all they have done. They are very great on talking about these things. It is funny that they should complain about Queensland's treatment of its Aboriginals, yet the Aboriginals want to stay at these settlements, such as the one at Cherbourg; they do not want to leave. The same applies to all the other settlements throughout Queensland. As the Minister himself has said, the treatment of Aboriginals in Queensland is the best treatment of Aboriginals throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> They are some of the points that I especially wanted to bring to the notice of the Senate this evening. I feel that it is very important indeed that the Senate give some consideration to these facts. As far as Queensland is concerned, all the hot air we have heard so far on this issue from alleged Aboriginal spokesmen has come from non-elected, self-appointed spokesmen and I certainly question their credibility. That is why I have brought these matters to the attention of the Senate this evening. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel that the Bill is a very devious and very sharp two-edged sword. Because of the constitutional dangers that I have spoken about I think Senator Ryan must think about what she is doing in this matter. If the Bill is passed, I feel it will bring in its train demands for curbs on the powers of the Senate and this Parliament to interfere in the Federal system. Our Federal system rests on the willingness of the partners to recognise each other's rights and responsibilities. The serious constitutional issue involved in this Bill far outweighs the subject. I urge the Senate to reject the Bill. </PARA>

There has been agreement in the second reading debate that there is no dispute on the principles involved. In this sense I think it has been an excellent debate and a very useful debate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will explain the situation. Arrangements were made ten minutes before the adjournment to ensure that certain papers would be tabled. The arrangements were specifically in terms of the list. Reference was then made to the papers referred to in paragraph 10 about committee reports. I want to make it quite clear that there was no intention to do anything without the agreement of the various parties in the Senate. That agreement was expressly sought and obtained. The present position is that Senator Reid has presented the report of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory which was presented in the other place in the normal course by another member of the Committee, Mr Fry. In accordance with normal practice, the same statement was put down this afternoon in the House of Representatives. The honourable senator, having reached the point of presenting the report, would be entitled in the adjournment debate to read the statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That seems to be a fairly pointless exercise from the point of view of the honourable senator and the Senate. It would simply mean that, in accordance with the normal situation, the report of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory was tabled and the same statement was put down in both chambers on the same day. It was, of course, open to the Opposition or any member of the Senate to refuse leave for the procedure that was followed. If the procedure is one which does not please honourable senators, no doubt it will not be followed again. I want to emphasise to you, Mr President, and to the Senate that what was being done was being done by leave, after reference to all parties in the Senate, and therefore, as I say, any objections are objections which really ought to lie to the future rather than to the present. I suggest to the Senate that Senator Reid has a perfect right to read the statement now if the Opposition or anybody else wishes to deny leave to incorporate it. But it would save us all a little time if she were to be allowed to incorporate it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to offer an explanation in connection with the arrangements. I think it is fair to say, without putting it too strongly, that there has been some disorganisation within the Government ranks today, and that there has been an attempt between the Whips and the various Ministers at the table to allow the business of the Senate to proceed. My understanding of the arrangements that were to be made was as follows: Firstly, there was to be one select committee brought in and that was to be the committee on the Bendigo ordnance factory, because we have four members for it. We now find that two committees were brought in, the Bendigo committee and, I understand, the South West Tasmania committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we put four committee members on that means that that committee can now meet, and so for three weeks there will be no Australian Labor Party representatives on that committee. There was an agreement that this would not go ahead. Obviously there can be some lack of communication. But when this sort of thing happens it tends to throw the credibility of those sorts of discussions into some doubt. Let me say quite clearly that I believe that the discussions I have had with the Government Whip represent what I am saying, and I would exonerate him from any involvement in any changes that were made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We were then told that we were going to have the President put down a statement and then we would have 22 papers put down. It may be that I am a little thick and did not understand all of this. But quite clearly we would not be too happy about people coming into this chamber and putting down a statement to go with a paper, whether it is incorporated or not-incorporation would give it certain publicity-without our being given the opportunity to respond to it. Let us face it. We are pretty gullible on this side. We go along with a lot of the things that the Government does. But it seems to me that we cannot operate unless we have reasonable arrangements. I think that the Government once again, as it has done so often in the past, has tried to put one over on us. I do not think that is good enough. We cannot operate as two Whips unless what we decide in consultation goes ahead; otherwise we lose our credibility with our colleagues. I lose credibility with honourable senators on this side, and my colleague loses credibility with honourable senators on the other side. </PARA>
<PARA> We have taken the papers Nos. 1 to 22. These were put down so that the Minister at the table could have one of his papers presented and there could be debate about it. There was agreement that these would be brought on on the Tuesday we returned to the place. I did not hear mention of this. Those matters were adjourned to the next day of sitting, and I can understand my colleague's reaction. I would rather the Minister had agreed, when he stood up, that these papers would be brought on on the next day of sitting in the full sense of the word-in other words, the Tuesday when we resume. I would hope that the Minister can now say that we will have no more business tonight and that there will be no more attempts to bring things in on the adjournment. We are going to be very wary of coming in on this practice at a later stage. After the Minister has made his statement, as was the general suggestion, the thrust of the arrangements, the Senate will then adjourn. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately there has been some misunderstanding in the Senate over the last few minutes. Perhaps I should support some of the words of the Opposition Whip, Senator Robertson. I indicate to the Senate just what happened. In the first place it was decided, with the agreement of all, that the debate on the Queensland Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders (Self-Management and Land Rights) Bill should continue until the adjournment at 10.30. Honourable senators will realise, too, that during the day the Select Committee on the Government Clothing and Ordnance Factories has been set up. All the nominations from the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and the Government have been received. As there had been some restriction on the reporting time of this Committee, it was felt that another two weeks delay in its formation would cut into its time of investigation. So, it was agreed by all that before 10.30 p.m. the Select Committee should be set up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that the formation of the Select Committee on South West Tasmania is incomplete. The reason for this is that the various parties associated with it have not put in their nominations. I think the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) and everyone else would agree with me that nominations have been received but that they mean absolutely nothing. The formation of the Select Committee on South West Tasmania cannot be completed until all the nominations have been received. I assure honourable senators that while one particular party has indicated its nominations this will mean nothing at all until the Committee is formed in two weeks time. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the reports that have been tabled. I have given an assurance to the Opposition Whip and to honourable senators who discussed this matter in the last few minutes that the reports will be noted and debate on them adjourned. I assure the Senate that these reports will be available for debate on the return of the Senate in two weeks' time. There is no suggestion that these reports are being put aside so they cannot be brought forward for debate. I have given honourable senators an understanding of what has happened. Nothing is hidden; there is no suggestion of trickery. It is a straight out arrangement. There is no time lost in respect of the formation of the Committee. The Committee cannot act until--</PARA>

I just do not understand how this sort of thing can happen. I certainly need considerable assurances from the Government side of the House on the Select Committee on South West Tasmania. It is beyond me why the nominations for that Committee were introduced at all. We also saw the extraordinary situation of the nomination of Senator Haines on the Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes without any nominations of Government or Labor Party senators. It is of concern to honourable senators on this side of the House that the four members on the Select Committee on South West Tasmania can form a quorum and can run away for a couple of weeks and do all sorts of things.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (4) The Auditor-General's report refers to specific areas of activity where departments and authorities advised there were staffing difficulties. I am advised by the Public Service Board that these difficulties were in the context of work and staffing priorities. In most of the cases referred to in the Auditor-General's Report remedial measures have been taken to overcome the problems mentioned. These measures were, in the main, the introduction of alternative management methods, technological processes. the re-distribution and more efficient handling of workloads, and the overcoming of recruitment difficulties. In the remaining few cases existing staffing priorities appeared to be justified, having regard to factors such as normal backlogs, costs and convenience to the public.</PARA>
<PARA>(5) In taking decisions on staff ceilings the Government expects that departments and authorities should give proper regard to revenue protection in Government operations. This will remain the case following recent staff ceiling decisions, including the average 2 per cent reduction in areas subject to staff ceilings. Should Ministers be of the view that the ceilings set cannot be achieved or are inconsistent with Government policies the Government has established appropriate machinery for reviewing such cases.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The claim of major unemployment caused by the Commonwealth's decision to require all national road construction work to be put to tender is pure speculation. It should be realised that State Government and local government councils are free to tender for national road construction projects and that staff can be redeployed from national road construction to maintenance work and projects on arterial and local roads. In addition national road construction works commenced by day labour prior to 1 September 1981 will not be affected by the new tender provisions. Consequently the Government will not speculate as to any impact on the labour market in this instance.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Carrick</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In a Press release of 1 September 1981, Sir Roderick gave details of the half year shareholders' report for Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd. In this Press release, attention was drawn to 'the constant public references to the so-called ''resources boom'' ' as emotive words conjuring up expectations of immediate profits, at least for some sectors of the economy. It is this picture of development which Sir Roderick has termed 'a mirage'. He was concerned that Australians would attempt to distribute the benefits before the gains existed.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The basic strength of the Australian economy and the opportunities opening up to it through the 1980s are evidenced by the upsurge in actual and forecast levels of investment and an associated rise in investment-related imports. The fundamental competitive advantage that Australia enjoys by reason of her natural resource endowments, particularly in the field of energy, remains unimpaired. This situation will continue, so long as private enterprise responds flexibly and positively to changing economic conditions and Government policies continue to provide the appropriate economic environment.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 August 1981 (Hansard, page 320-321), Senator Hearn asked a question, without notice, about placement of post boxes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided me with the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia Post's policy for the provision of posting boxes at present is that a new box should not be provided within 800 metres road distance of an existing posting facility and that at least 30 articles a day could be expected to be posted in a new box.</PARA>
<PARA> The preferred locations for street posting boxes are shopping centres, busy commercial and industrial areas, transport terminals and large institutions such as hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA> In reviewing the continued need for an existing street posting box the same general principles apply. In practice, however, only posting boxes receiving less than 10 articles daily are being considered for withdrawal.</PARA>
<PARA> When considering the withdrawal of a street posting box, the special needs of aged residents are recognised and taken into account. A street posting box would not, under normal circumstances, be withdrawn if it were located near an elderly people's home or a hospital or other institution which caters to the needs of the aged.</PARA>
<PARA> At least four weeks in advance of the intended date for withdrawal of a street posting box, a notice is attached to the box, advising users of Australia Post's intention to withdraw the facility. This gives residents the opportunity to comment on or appeal against the decision. No formal social impact study is undertaken but the following elements are considered:</PARA>
<PARA> the needs of the elderly;</PARA>
<PARA> the level of inconvenience to the public, as assessed by the distance to alternative posting facilities;</PARA>
<PARA> the extent to which the posting box in question is used.</PARA>
<PARA> If a posting box has low usage then the level of inconvenience to residents of the area, resulting from removal of the box, would be minimal.</PARA>
<PARA> The availability of transport is not a relevant factor when considering the withdrawal of a posting box because, generally, the distance between posting facilities is not great. Furthermore, anyone who resides more than 400 metres from a posting point may give fully stamped, unregistered articles to the postman for lodgement.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia Post must certainly consider the cost of maintaining and clearing boxes but its aim is to arrive at a reasonable balance between service and costs. Consideration of provision and withdrawal of street posting boxes is not confined to purely economic terms.</PARA>
