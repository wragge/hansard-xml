<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EK7">Senator DOUGLAS McCLELLAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister representing the Prime Minister aware that both the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister committed the Federal Government to supporting the national soil conservation program at the last election only to have the razor gang announce that the Federal Government was pulling out of all soil conservation programs? Has the Minister had personal representations on this matter from the New South Wales Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries? Will the Minister confirm that New South Wales spends over half the amount of money spent annually in Australia on soil conservation and provides for this $20m plus expenditure out of its own revenue? Will the Minister explain how the Federal Government expects State governments to commit themselves to long term soil conservation programs when New South Wales is told that $1m made available for the national program is buried within an overall general allocation which has been reduced by over $300m in real terms?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What has happened over the whole course of Federation has been the broad acceptance that both sovereignty and responsibility for soil conservation lie with the States. All the States have responded to that responsibility by developing very substantial soil conservation programs. The New South Wales Department of Agriculture developed particular skills, and I acknowledge that. The Commonwealth had indicated that it would make some national contribution to soil conservation programs. It had decided on an amount of $3m. It decided that its best way of contributing would be not to abandon that undertaking but to take that amount of money and incorporate it in the revenue distribution to the States so that there would be a continuous dissemination of that money to the States as an addition to their programs. So, in fact, the Commonwealth is adding, as it did, I think some $69m by way of absorption to the States. As I have said, the States have the primary responsibility and must always continue to do so. As to the question of the availability of moneys for the States, I remind the honourable senator that of all public finance spent in Australia 52 per cent-that is, the significant majority of it-is spent by States and local government and 48 per cent is spent by the Commonwealth, the minority spender of public finance. Therefore, the more abundant field of public finance available for this and other matters lies with the States.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Finance aware that artists, including those artists who are part time lecturers in tertiary institutions in photography, print-making and drawing, pay sales tax on raw materials or equipment at the rate of 30 per cent?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a provision in the sales tax law that exempts works of art produced in Australia and works of art produced overseas by Australian artists. Materials and equipment used by an artist who produces works of art for sale are exempt from sales tax at the time of the purchase of raw materials and aids to manufacture. However, materials and equipment used by an artist who does not produce works of art for sale are taxable at the time of purchase. This is the matter to which Senator Watson has addressed himself. The Treasurer advises that in these circumstances materials and equipment used by artists are generally taxable at 17 1/2 per cent, although certain types of pens are taxable at 30 per cent. Artists' canvas is exempt from tax. The question has also indicated that photographic equipment and materials may be in issue. These goods are generally taxable at 30 per cent, although chemicals are taxable at 17 1/2 per cent. The matters that have been canvassed by Senator Watson in his question will be referred to the Treasurer for consideration as to whether he sees any change as being appropriate. As soon as I have a response from him I will see that Senator Watson is advised.</PARA></TALK.START>

I ask the Minister: Will the report and the findings of this committee be made available to the Parliament and the public? Will the report and the findings of the committee be made available to members of organisations concerned with the disabled so that they may comment on it, or is the report to remain a secret document until it falls off the back of a truck?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The status of the document referred to by Senator Grimes in his question is the same as the status of any document of advice given to me on matters of policy and prepared by my Department. Those documents are not normally published. I do not think they are normally regarded as secret in any sinister sense. They are simply documents of advice. I have said to the Australian Council of Rehabilitation of Disabled, which is the principal body representing the disabled, that I do not propose to make any changes to the programs about which it is concerned without having prior discussion with it. In other words, any action which might be taken with respect to any recommendations put forward by that group would first be subject to discussion with ACROD as the peak representative body of organisations for the disabled and, of course, in any event would have to be subject to government consideration in the normal way. As far as Senator Grimes's reference to documents falling off the back of a truck is concerned, I am quite aware that there is a tendency in some areas for documents to be leaked. I have no intention of changing my practices to take into account the behaviour of people which I think is out of line and has nothing to do with good, orderly and proper administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that, even under freedom of information legislation which might be proposed by either side of the Parliament, there is not an assumption that all documents of advice would be open to public purview. It is not a matter of secrecy; it is a matter of getting advice and considering it. I think what is of concern to the public is that information which is relevant to decisions should be available to the public and to the people who are affected. I would always be prepared to make available any information which was requested and which was relevant to decisions.</PARA>

<PARA>In view of that, I ask: Will the Minister ensure that a condition of State Bank entry into the Australian Capital Territory reciprocates the arrangements in New South Wales whereby the Commonwealth Savings Bank under a 1933 agreement pays half the profits it makes in New South Wales to the State Bank, so that the profits remain in the Australian Capital Territory for the benefit of this community?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I am aware of the report referred to by the honourable senator. The comparison drawn with the 1933 agreement between the Commonwealth Savings Bank and the New South Wales Government is not one which could apply in this case. In 1933 the Commonwealth Savings Bank took over, by agreement, the business of an existing savings bank owned by the New South Wales Government. It was considered that it would be in the national interest to merge the interests of the States in savings bank business into one national institution. The profit-sharing arrangement with New South Wales reflected the fact that the Commonwealth Bank acquired the State's savings bank business and its assets as a going concern. Of course, those circumstances do not apply in this case. I have noted the interest of Senator Reid in the matter. I will refer it to the Treasurer and seek a response from him in due course after consideration is given to the proposal that was the subject of the public comment mentioned.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> If there are further significant increases (in oil prices), then the first priority of the Government will be to return that to the Australian family through the taxation mechanism or through family allowances.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister whether she is further aware of the Prime Minister's undertaking as late as last Saturday:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . with the deficit virtually eliminated in this year's Budget, we will obviously have an enhanced potential for tax cuts.</PARA>

I further ask whether she supports the Prime Minister's view on this question or the views of the other two Ministers. Finally, if she does not want to put a personal view to the Senate, can she say, as a member of Cabinet, whether the Cabinet has discussed the matter and what is its view?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first thing I want to do is to correct the selective quotation made by Senator Chipp both today and yesterday. It is highly important that this be done. I quote from the Hansard which contains the quotation of the alleged promise made by the Prime Minister. On Tuesday Senator Chipp quoted as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If there are further significant increases (in oil prices) then the first priority of the Government will be to return that to the Australian family through the taxation mechanism or through family allowances.</PARA>
<PARA>He repeated that today. In fact, I quote from the transcript of 15 October. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . if there are significant increases in the price of oil and therefore in the revenue from the levy . . .</PARA>
<PARA>There is a slight difference in the meaning! There is a total difference in the meaning. In other words, if as a result of oil prices there is a net increase in the levy, then these things will flow. So the first situation is that the premises that Senator Chipp raised were, of course, wrong. The claim made by the Australian Labor Party that there would be huge increases in oil prices was utterly wrong. Do not honourable senators remember Mr Keating talking about the price of oil rising to 40c with huge oil prices? He has been wrong on everything he has said. I now go on to read--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I go on to quote what the Prime Minister said on 15 October:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I need to add a rider to that, because it is a hypothetical question at the moment. The prices that have been made in the OPEC countries are ones that at this point lead to an increase in the price of petrol of less than 1c a litre, so the additional revenue coming from that is pretty minimal.</PARA>
<PARA>That is of absolute importance, but also in the Budget Speech of this year the Treasurer, in the section headed 'Family Allowances', said:</PARA>
<PARA>Prior to the last election the Government stated that any significant increase in oil revenue in 1980-81 over the Budget estimate would be returned to Australian families. In the event, receipts from this source last year were actually below the Budget estimate, as I have already indicated.</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, we have reviewed the levels of family allowances and decided to increase the rates of assistance for third and subsequent children by 50 per cent, with effect from 1 January 1982.</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that in fact the full year cost of that assistance is about $120m. I understand that there was also partial tax indexation. So although there was no increase in revenue at all-and that was inherent in the promise-the Government has proceeded with family allowances and tax matters well within the lines of its promise.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Social Security. In the light of the increasing evidence of wealthy people artificially manipulating their incomes in order to qualify for age pensions and fringe benefits and thereby making it more difficult for the Government to provide effectively for those who are entirely dependent on their pensions, has the Government given consideration to reverting to the system of including assets as well as income in the determination of entitlement to an age pension?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2082" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has not given consideration to the point raised by the honourable senator. I have already indicated that the Government proposes to strengthen the existing provisions of the social security legislation which relate to deprivation of income. The purpose of section 47 of the Social Services Act is, of course, to ensure that people do not get pension entitlements to which they would not be entitled if they got income which was available to them. As far as any changes beyond those announced are concerned, the social security system is, of course, under continous review and most of these areas are reviewed annually in the Budget context. But as the Prime Minister has recently indicated, there is no proposal before the Government for the reintroduction of an assets test. I am of the view that it is certainly desirable that there should be an effective income test if we are to be able to ensure that we can look after the aged people of Australia in an appropriate way. At the moment a part pension is payable to single pensioners who have incomes of something over $150 a week. For a married couple a part pension ceases to be payable only when non-pension income reaches $266 a week. That is a fair spread of income over which the Government does provide some supplementary assistance and I think it is an indication of the breadth of the pension system in Australia. When we have a situation in which people with very large incomes can, in quite artificial ways, dispose of that income and yet retain the benefit of it, the matter needs very careful examination. If the demands of the people of Australia, including members on this side of the Parliament and the other side of the Parliament, for us to do a better job with respect to more needy Australians are to be met, I believe we have to place some limitation on the amounts of money which go to Australians who are readily able to provide for themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is this $200m more than the avoidance figure reported a year earlier and $550m higher than the avoidance figure of two years ago?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I do not have the precise figures with me but I am aware of the figure of around $1,000m as being quoted by the Commissioner of Taxation this year. The problem of tax avoidance schemes has been discussed on a number of occasions. There are a number of difficulties in collecting as much tax as we would regard people as being legally required to pay. It was discussed in one of the Senate Estimates committees, or in one of the discussions held around the time of the Budget preparation, that staff figures were important in being able to use the resources of the Department as widely as possible in minimising tax avoidance. I will seek from the Treasurer information as to whether he believes the whole of the problem is related to staff shortages or whether, as I think would be the case, he would share a general view that a number of reasons exist for the inability to collect the appropriate tax from all the people who ought to be paying tax in this country. I will seek from the Treasurer the up to date position on his staff ceiling problems, whether he has been able to divert resources into that section to meet what he believes are the requirements of the Commissioner and whether he has been able to settle any additional staff which I know the Commissioner is seeking for the Australian Taxation Office at this time.

As a first step TAA intends to introduce new schedules to operate from 1 December. Those schedules no longer include services to a number of very low traffic ports, including Birdsville.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer, follows the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Button. In view of the Treasurer's statement that the Federal Government is taking effective measures to crack down on tax avoidance, will the Minister tell the Senate how this can be achieved with the Government's job cutting policy for the Public Service? Was the Commissioner of Taxation correct when he said that these job cutting policies are seriously affecting the ability of the Taxation Office to detect and to control tax evasion? Is the Minister aware of the dissatisfaction in the community where wage and salary earners are being taxed directly at source while other people seem to be able to evade or avoid paying taxes? With the continual cutting of jobs in the Public Service, how is the Government achieving its proposed aim of making taxation equitable in the community, or is the Treasurer's statement just a gimmick to keep wage and salary earners happy in the belief that something is being done?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I have nothing to add to what I said earlier with regard to the staffing position in the Taxation Office and the fact that I would seek an up to date response from the Treasurer. As to the other part of the question with regard to wage and salary earners feeling that they are bearing an undue burden of the personal income tax that is collected, I am aware that there is great resentment in the community that people are evading tax that properly should be paid by them. But perhaps we ought to extend just one step further what was said by Senator Elstob and say that equally there is resentment in the community at the use of the cash economy to avoid or evade tax. I think it is fair to say that a number of people who may be paying pay-as-you-earn tax as wage and salary earners are using the cash economy to evade tax on other income which they receive. There is equal resentment that that total income is not subjected to the level of personal income tax that is appropriate for the total income received.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, as I said, I will seek from the Treasurer the up to date position of the staffing of the Taxation Office.

If all members of the community give support to the efforts that are being made I feel sure that more equity will result from the strenuous efforts that have been made by this Government over recent years. It certainly is a case of inequity if some people are avoiding their responsibilities. Every effort ought to be made to see that this is minimised.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; There has been an interest in this matter for a number of years. Some years ago, when I was Minister for Social Security, the report of the Hancock National Superannuation Committee of Inquiry was tabled and discussed. Subsequently it was said that the Government did not intend to proceed with the plan outlined in that report. The Treasurer subsequently investigated occupational superannuation matters, and I think he has made statements that there is no imminent introduction by the Government of a national superannuation plan. I am aware that in recent weeks the life assurance houses have put forward some proposals. Again I think it ought to be understood that a national superannuation scheme with benefits additional to those which are paid under present age pension schemes would require additional contributions, either by way of additional personal tax, if it is to be a non-contributory scheme, or by way of an identified contribution, which would have the same effect as additional personal income tax. As I understand it, the scheme that was proposed recently by the life houses acknowledged that over $1,000m extra revenue would be required to introduce that sort of scheme. So whilst we wish to see as generous retirement benefits as possible, that cannot be achieved without the contribution of the Australian people to ensure that more is done than we are presently able to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If there were continuing interest in the introduction of a national superannuation scheme, it would require a great deal of investigation and a great deal of discussion before such a plan could be introduced. It is rather facile to suggest that the introduction of a scheme will of itself result in greater benefits. It is the expenditure and the commitment of the Australian people to their retirement schemes that will ultimately result in their having a higher or more universal level of age pension or retirement benefits. If the honourable senator who raised the matter has a particular proposal he wishes to refer either to my colleague Senator Chaney or to the Treasurer, I will see that that matter is transferred.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator asked a number of detailed questions about the timing of the calculations of adjustments to the cost of living index in Australia, which calculations, of course, affect the adjustments which are made to pensions and benefits. I am not able to give him confirmation of the precise dates of the month which are the relevant cut-off points. I have seen those dates and I assume he is quoting them correctly, but I have no independent recollection of them; so I will need to check that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The heart of the honourable senator's question involves the fact that one can get an adjustment shortly after a cut-off date which will not be picked up until the next cut-off date when changes to the cost of living are being taken into account, and that therefore there can be lags in the pension adjustments which are required to cover those increased costs. I can only say that of course it is possible for the timing of increases in costs to be either benign or otherwise with respect to these calculations. I will examine the example which the honourable senator has raised and see whether the point which he has made is correct.</PARA>
<PARA> I point out that the adjustments which are made to pensions to take into account increases in the cost of living are, of necessity, imperfect and some of the imperfections will not favour pensioners but others will in fact favour them. Currently, for example, the cost of living index is being affected by the changes to the health scheme. Those changes add something like 0.75 of a per cent to the cost of living index. It is a fact, of course, that for the great bulk of pensioners and beneficiaries those changes in costs are irrelevant. In other words, there is a provision within the social security system, through the pensioner health benefits card, which ensures that pensioners are insulated from that part of the rise in the cost of living. That is a fortuitous gain for pensioners. It means that they get some part of the next increase to cover an increase in the cost of living to which they are not subject, in the main. So there are those sorts of compensating and offsetting adjustments. Indeed, in respect of the adjustments made in 1981 and 1982, automatically under the legislation introduced by this Government, in November and May there will be rises which cover costs not required to be met by the bulk of pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA> I will examine the point raised by the honourable senator. It has certainly been drawn to my attention in the past by my Department. I accept that any system which we have to adjust pensions will have some imperfections, because it is impossible to dictate the date on which all changes in costs of living will occur. But I think that the basic protection which is given to pensioners in this country by the twice-yearly indexation of pensions is as sound a system as has been found to date to ensure that those members of the community who most need to be protected do get protection from the ravages of inflation.</PARA>

Is it true that the consumer price index will be increased by three-quarters of a per cent for both these items, and that therefore the age pension increase, in respect of these items alone, will automatically be $1.05 a week? Is it also true that, despite this $1.05 a week rise, it is objectively calculated that for pensioners there will be an increase of less than 50c a week in costs?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The facts in the broad indicated by the honourable senator are, of course, correct. Those pensioners and beneficiaries who are in receipt of indexed benefits will see changes to their pensions and benefits in accordance with changes to the cost of living which are caused by the changes to the health care arrangements and by the indirect taxes. In that sense, therefore, there is protection, for that part of the community which is reliant upon indexed pensions and benefits, from the changes which have been mentioned by the honourable senator.

I ask: Is it not a fact that when announcing world parity pricing for Bass Strait oil the Minister claimed that the decision was made solely for conservation purposes due to an oil shortage? In view of the Minister's recent answers, is he now at last admitting that the application of world parity pricing to Bass Strait oil was for no other purpose than revenue raising and not for conservation purposes, as he has so often claimed?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is really the most convoluted question I have heard in this Senate. The fact of the matter is that the International Energy Agency, unanimously speaking on behalf of the 21 major oil consuming nations of the world, has said that for conservation purposes the price of oil in each country should be at world scarcity price. It is not only this Government's view but also the unanimous view of the free world that the way to get oil conservation and the way to get an energy balance in this world is by import parity pricing. What I have said before and what the Government has said before stands. The fact of the matter is that import parity pricing has caused both a conservation of oil and a stimulus to exploration and development. The stimulus to exploration and development has been such that I was able to say that the incentives could scarcely be improved upon. The basis of the Government's policies remains impeccable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I have said on revenue is correct; that is, that the Budget estimated a certain amount of money coming from Bass Strait, Barrow Island and Moonie on the basis of the free movement of oil. There have been delays for a variety of industrial reasons. The result of those delays is that there will be a shortfall in the order of $220m in revenue. If one takes into account the proposed increase in the Saudi light crude market, to function from 1 January, the net loss to revenue would be in the order of $120m. That basically is the fact of the matter.</PARA>

In view of the answer given by the Minister that my question was a convoluted one, I now ask him: Why is he endeavouring to blame the trade union movement for a loss of revenue because of the non-availability of oil products to the community which, in effect, is a saving of oil products? In his view this would be conservation. He is now trying to blame the trade union movement. I ask him why he does that?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Indian rubber man would declare himself an amateur and cease practice on the basis of that convolution. That is a most remarkable situation. The facts are that due to industrial troubles in the oil industry, there has been a shortfall in the production of oil in Australia resulting in a revenue fall. It is fair to say that that does not create conservation. It means that that we have to buy oil at a higher price from overseas. So, rather than conserve, it in fact wastes and causes more costs to the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Following the detection in the United States of America of substitution in meat exported from Australia the Department of Primary Industry introduced a species testing program for beef products exported to the USA. Assistance was obtained from a number of laboratories both Commonwealth, State and private, throughout Australia, with ability to undertake the required tests. Two tests were used; an agar gel diffusion test (AGDT), most commonly, and an iso-electric focusing test (IEFT), on a limited number of samples. Procedures to be followed in the AGDT were advised to participating laboratories in early September and the assistance of the CSIRO Division of Meat Research obtained to evaluate these and other candidate tests in terms of reliability, sensitivity, specificity, simplicity and cost so that standardised procedures may be drawn up. The test methods for the AGDT which are in routine use have been approved by the US Department of Agriculture as have the sampling procedures being employed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I rise because of my disturbance at the contents of this report of the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr O'Reilly. We are confronted with a situation where the Commissioner is unable to collect almost $1 billion worth of revenue due to the Federal Government. This is largely because of the inadequacy of the staffing arrangements made by the Government to support the legislation which this chamber and Parliament have worked at so assiduously over the three years that I have been a member of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to the key paragraph of the report under the heading 'Tax Evasion and Fraud'. At page 15 the Commissioner noted that tax evasion and fraud may have denied to the Federal revenue some $167m and that overall tax avoidance amounted to some $973m. But in speaking about evasion and fraud he said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate to comment that as at the time of making this report, resources employed in enforcement activities have had to be considerably reduced owing to the recent decrease in staff ceilings. The combined effect of this reduction and the need to deploy substantial resources to the investigation of tax avoidance activities has seriously affected capacity to detect and control tax evasion and, as I have stated in previous Reports, is a matter of considerable and increasing concern to me. </PARA>
<PARA>We have a situation where this Parliament has attempted on behalf of the Australian people to deal in legislative terms with the subversives in our society-those socially subversive tax bludgers who refuse to contribute their fair share to the revenues of this nation. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are strong words for a situation which I believe has brought the Australian people to the limits of their tolerance. We have a situation where an inequity and injustice are caused within the system not only because of the failure to contribute revenue, and that has an immediate impact on the ability of democratically elected governments to carry out their programs, but also because within the system there is generated an inequity: Continually, pay-as-you-earn taxpayers are forced to bear the burden of the avoidance, the evasion and the fraud of those who are not within the PAYE system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the 10 years from 1971-72 we have seen this inexorable shift in the burden of personal income tax, and indeed of all total tax payments, on to the PAYE taxpayer. In 1971-72, personal income tax as a proportion of total tax was 48 per cent. In 1981-82 it is expected to be 55 per cent. In 1971-72 PAYE collections as a proportion of all personal tax were running at the rate of some 77 per cent. Now they are running at a rate of 83 per cent. Those figures, shortly stated, symbolise the way in which the burden of tax paying has been shifted on to PAYE taxpayers. How can this Parliament go any further in attempting to deal with tax avoidance, the activities of these people who pervert the best legal and accounting brains of this country to their own selfish ends? The Australian Labor Party has supported in this chamber amendments to section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. It has supported in this chamber legislation which directs the courts when interpreting all legislation, but particularly tax legislation, that they should take into account and use as a major criterion for interpretation the social purpose designed to be achieved by legislation directed as tax avoidance, evasion or fraud. </PARA>
<PARA> We in the Labor Party say that a further step should be taken and that the Government ought to be more robust in the retrospective application of laws to tax avoidance schemes. But the question then is: What sort of partnership do we as a Parliament have with the Government in dealing with these tax avoiders? I am afraid that the report from the Commissioner of Taxation reveals that the Government in its doctrinaire insistence on cutting back employment within the public sector is hamstringing the Commissioner in dealing with tax avoiders in the way in which this Parliament desires and all honourable senators support. </PARA>
<PARA> We find that the same conclusion has been reached by a Senate Estimates committee. It appears that only a month or so ago the Australian Taxation Office revealed to an Estimates committeee of this Parliament that staff cuts will result in an estimated revenue loss of some $46.8m simply because there are not enough officers to chase tax avoiders. That information is contained in an official letter from the Commissioner of Taxation to a Senate committee. The salaries saved by reducing staff would amount to $1.5m, leaving a net revenue loss to the Australian people-a loss which has to be borne by other taxpayers if the programs of government are to be maintained-of $45.3m. In other words, over a quarter of a million dollars in revenue is forgone for every officer which this Government refuses to allow the Commissioner of Taxation to employ in order to carry out the task which this Parliament has assigned to him. I quoted at length from one section of the report on tax evasion and fraud. The same sorts of comments are scattered throughout the early pages of the report. For example, with regard to tax avoidance, on page 12 the Commissioner says:</PARA>
<PARA> The number of experienced staff required to be allocated to the additional work of detecting, monitoring, investigating and contesting tax avoidance schemes continues to make serious inroads into resources available for other administrative functions. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, on the very first page of the report the Commissioner is forced to make the plea that, from a management viewpoint, the Government should come to his aid because as a result of his moving, as the Parliament has required him to move, experienced officers into the tax avoidance area other sections of his administration are suffering deleterious effects. </PARA>
<PARA> In these few short comments I am afraid that one comes to the very sad conclusion-an indictment against this national Government-that it is prepared to forgo revenue, it is prepared to see injustice amongst taxpayers flourish, while it pursues its doctrinaire attack on employment within the public sector. It is doing this not only to its political shame but also in a way which I believe does not have the support of this chamber-I am speaking of all sides of the chamber-and, more importantly, is of very grave detriment to the revenues of this Government, or of any elected government, and therefore in a way which makes the Government an aider and abettor of the most subversive elements within this society, the tax bludgers who are undermining our very social structure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make just some brief comments about the same report. Senator Tate has made a number of thoughtful observations about the report of the Commissioner of Taxation and I want to add very briefly to them. We are talking about one of the greatest inequalities in our society today-the way in which people at the highest level of the income scales are paying less tax. We would argue that because of somewhat feeble attempts to close off avoidance schemes these people are pocketing hundreds of thousands, even millions, of dollars. Of course, it is millions of dollars in terms of the report of the Commissioner of Taxation. At the other end of the income scale, low and middle income earners have to make up the loss which is incurred through tax avoidance by the wealthier section of the community. I think there is very little argument about this. I do not in any way derogate from the fact that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has repeatedly expressed concern about this matter. Whether that concern has been followed up by appropriate action is the question which must concern us as a Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commissioner's report shows the extent of this activity. The number of tax avoiders in Australia last year rose by 30 per cent, and it has doubled over the last two years. Tax avoidance is now operating at a rate 26 times greater than it was in 1975 and 1976. The report for 1980-81 identifies 22,366 people involved in tax avoidance schemes, involving a revenue loss of $973m. Twice as many tax avoiders were identified by the Commissioner as were identified two years earlier, when $424m in revenue was lost. The previous report in 1979-80 referred to 17,233 identified tax avoiders responsible for $711m in lost revenue. The amount being lost is skyrocketing both in gross terms and in the amounts that individual tax avoiders are getting away with. In 1978-79 tax avoiders were pocketing, on average, $37,500 a year each. The following year the figure had risen to $41,300, nearly four times the amount of the average annual salary. In the year of the Commissioner's report, 1980-81, the figure had risen again to $43,500. I remind the Senate that in 1975 there were only 861 identified tax avoiders. The number of tax avoiders has risen by over 2,600 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In attempting to grapple with this problem the Government has pursued a policy of legislating against tax avoidance schemes from the time they are discovered. This, of course, allows many schemes to operate for up to two years before they are closed off. What happens, in classic terms, is that the Government attempts to close a series of stable doors after various horses have bolted. Even then, the amending legislation designed to close those stable doors results in new loopholes being opened up. One of the reasons for the failure of the belated legislation relating to this problem is that the Government refuses to use fully retrospective legislation. I know it is argued in this Parliament that retrospective legislation is inherently bad, but if retrospective legislation is used to try to close off a scheme such as the Curran scheme then in a sense one has conceded the view that the social evil of tax avoidance is so considerable that it is justifiable to use retrospective legislation. Retrospective legislation of a general kind is the most damaging weapon against tax avoidance schemes. I am not suggesting that even that weapon can totally wipe out tax avoidance schemes, but it is the most effective weapon for dealing with the issue of tax avoidance known to parliaments and governments. We have made our view on the matter quite clear. Whilst we generally do not support retrospective legislation, the social evil of tax avoidance is so great that general retrospective legislation is, in these circumstances, socially desirable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lewis's party won, but I would argue, of course, that it won not so much because it was looking after the interests of 22,000 tax avoiders, although they undoubtedly helped the party coffers, but because of a number of promises which were made and which have since been dishonoured in legislation introduced into the Senate. I was referring to the question of retrospective legislation and Senator Lewis drew me out, as they say, on what our attitude to this was generally. What we are concerned about is that the Government's use of the tax system to provide tax concessions to favoured groups also provides wide scope for abuse. It is a matter which should be examined much more closely by the Parliament. In this report, the Commissioner of Taxation makes this comment:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Incentive measures of this kind . . . are usually settled on by professional tax avoiders to generate benefits never intended to be conferred. </PARA>
<PARA>Not only is the tax avoidance industry growing and not only are the avoiders getting away with much more on average, but also the prospect is that it is an industry that will continue to flourish under this Government. If one looks at the Government's record the only growth industry which can be pointed to is that of tax avoidance, unless Senator Chaney can point to another. One of the principal reasons for this is that the Taxation Office, as I have said, is already fighting a losing battle and has been denied staff to meet the challenges of people involved in tax avoidance. That is not a matter of Government admission but it is a matter about which questions have been directed to Government Ministers and no satisfactory responses have been received. Staff ceilings are preventing the Commissioner from detecting and pursuing tax avoiders. </PARA>
<PARA> A 3 per cent staff cut this year is being rigidly pursued and it will mean a reduction of 179 officers in the enforcement section responsible for uncovering tax avoidance schemes. As the industry grows, the staff is reduced, this year by 179 officers responsible for dealing with tax avoidance schemes. The Taxation Office estimates that this will mean a loss of $45.3m which represents a quarter of a million dollars forgone for every officer lost from the enforcement section of the Taxation Commissioner. That is a matter which one would have thought must be of grave concern to this Parliament and to the Government. It is a matter which might be quickly rectified without damaging the Government's ideological commitments in relation to Public Service ceilings. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday, I mentioned the idiocy of the razor gang decisions in relation to many of these staff ceiling matters. There is further evidence in this report of the extent to which the ordinary Australian citizen is carrying the wealthier sections of the community where tax avoiders and the bevy of lawyers and accountants advising them operate. This is shown by the amount by which pay-as-you-earn taxation has risen since 1975. Up to this financial year, PAYE tax payments have gone up by 146 per cent. Over the same period, wages and salaries have gone up by 98 per cent. In the last year of the Labor Government-</PARA>

As I pointed out, PAYE taxation has gone up by 146 per cent. Salaries and wages have gone up by 98 per cent in the same time. In the last year of the Labor Government, PAYE receipts as a proportion of wages and salaries were 16.9 per cent of the total amount paid in wages and salaries. In the current year that figure has gone up to 21 per cent. By any measurement taxation of middle and lower income earners in Australia has risen to unprecedented levels. I challenge the Government- as we did at the last election-to prove otherwise. I also challenge the Government to stop favouring a few at the top of the financial heap by avoiding questions of political and social responsibility relating to retrospectivity of legislation outlawing tax avoidance. I challenge the Government to bring to an end the games wealthy tax cheats play. Until there is evidence that tax avoiders are to be pursued seriously, no Australian can do other than conclude that this is a government that encourages, if not thrives on, inequality in Australian society.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very well, Mr Acting Deputy President, I withdraw. Tax evasion is theft. Tax avoidance is theft. Every dollar stolen in that way by tax evaders and tax avoiders is paid by other taxpayers. Principally, of course, it is paid by wage and salary earners, particularly those on lower incomes who can least afford to pay to make good, to make restitution for the theft of others. It is not just a question of loopholes in the Act due to careless drafting or unforeseen circumstances or the sequence of bizarre judgments from the High Court under the tutelage of the former Chief Justice. There is also the problem of governments actually devising laws the effect of which and the intent of which is to facilitate tax avoidance. We have the notorious film industry case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have another scheme current, designed by this Government, under which very high income earners, who also have some interest in farming or some income from farming, may lend, with gilt edged security, to the Government for one year $25,000 and to receive almost $2,400 in interest. They can borrow from the Government, by way of deferring taxation, $15,000 for three years on which they pay no interest at all. Moreover, the taxpayer who does that permanently evades more than $2,200 in tax. That scandalous rort, engineered and enacted by this Government, is misrepresentative of a scheme to help low income farmers. Of the 200,000 odd taxpayers eligible to participate in such a scheme, only 12,000 have in fact done so. Hardly any of them are low income farmers. In fact the scheme, as the former director of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics has stated on several occasions, actually harms not only smaller and lower income farmers but also anyone in general who wants to remain in agriculture-to be a farmer rather than to get some nominal interest in agriculture to take advantage of the tax haven provisions which were not inherited but designed and built by this Government. The scheme to which I referred is not a scheme to help small farmers; it is one which will harm them. In fact, it is a scheme designed to help the very wealthy who have some interest in and derive some income from agriculture rob their fellow taxpayers by tax avoidance and tax evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> The final scandal-not irony-is that almost half the members of the Fraser Cabinet, who designed and enacted this incredible scheme for tax evasion and avoidance, are well placed to participate in it themselves. We have no evidence that almost 50 per cent of the members of the Cabinet which designed and enacted this scheme are, in fact, exploiting it, but on several occasions Senator McLaren and I have sought guarantees from the Prime Minister via Senator Carrick that the Ministers in question are not exploiting this scheme for tax evasion and tax avoidance designed and enacted by those Ministers. No guarantee has been provided. Senator Carrick has refused to give such a guarantee and the Prime Minister has refused to give such a guarantee. So, in the absence of any such assurance, it is only reasonable to conclude that those Ministers have something to hide, that they are in fact exploiting the tax haven which they designed and built. </PARA>

<PARA> In quantitative terms this scandal to which I have referred is, of course, quite small. The amount of tax evaded up to now has not exceeded $30m a year compared with almost $1 billion a year lost through other forms of tax avoidance to which the Commissioner for Taxation has referred.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's policy objective is contained in the statement by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The new system will strongly favour skilled applicants and those with close family in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition approaches this matter cautiously because it almost verges on a contradiction. We do not quarrel with the system favouring skilled applicants provided up to date statistics show that the apprenticeship intake for this year forms a fairly sizable part of the work force. One of the problems shared by people considering immigration policies is that they forget, in the first instance, that somebody who is brought to Australia at the age of 25 will be looking for employment for the following 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the concept of having guest workers in this country has been resisted, and rightly so. There are fat cat countries in Europe which, on the one hand, are pretty lousy in providing aid to distressed parts of the world but which, on the other hand, are quite happy to use people as guest workers and then pack them off. Australia does and should maintain a conservative attitude in that regard. I say that because it is completely repugnant to everybody in this chamber to talk about industrial cannon fodder. Job security is vital, regardless of whether the person coming into the work force is native born or from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of this policy is that relating to family reunion. The matter of close family ties is, of course, a bit delicate. Whenever families in Australia say that they will create for a relative a job which is not in a scarce employment area, it might be argued that an unemployed unit from Granville or Footscray will be pushed away from obtaining that job because it had been created for a family member. This is a very delicate area. Yesterday, in discussions with Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, I questioned whether the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs was teed up administratively to meet all the immigration problems. At the moment it is not. I prove it this way: I had a case involving a girl from Britain who was working as a technical investigation claims officer with Multicon Engineering Pty Ltd on a working visa. My immediate reaction was that she was here on a visa and I did not favour conversion of that visa. She said that she was prepared to go back to Britain and enter the queue to migrate to Australia in the normal way. When she got back, of course, the Minister announced the new system. She fronted up in Manchester. In the meantime, Multicon-I probed this very closely-said that it had searched for four months to find a suitable replacement for her. I checked with the Federated Clerks Union of Australia as to whether it disputed this and it did not. One would assume that after four months the bureaucracy in Manchester would have cleared this girl to come here. It has not. It has argued that it is unaware of the credentials and the submissions that Multicon had made. It could be argued that that submission was still in the regional director's office in Sydney. Of course, this gets back to the point of how quickly the Department can process these matters. As late as yesterday I spoke to members of the Minister's staff. It was conceded that probably there is a case. I am deliberately being objective in trying to relate job opportunities in Australia with those sorts of situations. </PARA>
<PARA> Another example is where the firm Climax Equipment, a firm that specialises in fork lifts and tractors, ran into industrial difficulty and wanted to bring one of its trouble shooters from overseas. That firm got sick of waiting for documentation. That person is here now. The problem now is if he wants to go back to visit his family briefly for Christmas and then come back to Australia how is that situation to be unravelled? I have just mentioned those cases where I believe the Department was not not really staffed to meet the situation. Further on in his ministerial statement the Minister referred to the fact that Australia's refugee intake has remained unchanged. I do not necessarily quarrel with the figures. But I believe that if we want more harmony we have to treat every continent on an equal basis. Senator Chipp and Senator Evans in particular have been vigorous critics of our pussy-footing attitudes towards political suppression in Latin America. Peru is surrounded by four fascist or semi-fascist countries. It is a very slow process to bring people here on family reunion, much less people who have been persecuted for their political activities. An exodus from Poland could symbolise European political refugees, we have Latin America via Peru, which is the only country that has a reasonable democracy where people come across the border and there is also the South East Asian syndrome. </PARA>
<PARA> The last part of the Minister's statement dealt with the difficulties that these people face in obtaining employment. We have a situation where we skip the physical attributes of political refugees. That is very nice, but when people come on the assembly line and argue that some of the work is too hard and state that someone else should do it, the union is faced with a very difficult problem. I am not being a devil's advocate. I am trying to be fair in order to portray the problems in this area of industrial relations. That brings me to my punch-line which I have advocated before. I know that the present Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has been very reasonable to deal with. The shadow Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mick Young, would agree with me. It has been generally accepted that if I pulled off my request for a Senate committee to monitor immigration over a 12-month period, a joint committee might be set up by the other place. As I said before, I think this is due to the guerilla activities of my Western Australian colleague, Peter Walsh, when dealing with some of the members of committees and some National Country Party members who were shell-shocked when this proposal went before Cabinet. I believe that, disliking the role of some committee activities in the rural sector, Liberal Ministers agreed that there could be a very excellent job for a joint committee, but that National Country Party Ministers revolted. </PARA>
<PARA> At a later stage I will be seeking to resurrect the concept of a committee to study this situation. I have said respectfully to the World Council of Churches and to those Catholic people involved with refugees: 'You have a fixation on the numbers of refugees that you bring to Australia. Then other people have to help those refugees adjust to the job opportunities'. It is quite wrong. I believe that a standing committee of some sort could obtain a better balance if rival groups were to testify and then the different submissions were evaluated. No doubt other honourable senators have received aid memorandums from the Vietnamese community arguing that Mr Macphee was a bit hard in his concept of refugees. I have written to these people and have said: 'Have you ever looked at other continents and realised the persecutions and ordeals people are suffering in Latin America?' I have told people of both Protestant and Catholic persuasions that they had better look at their brethren in Latin America and other continents. I expect another response from the Vietnamese groups. I say quite candidly that I accept what Mr Macphee said. If people are on a losing side, irrespective of the ideological battle, they are entitled to feel that they ought to be saved from further reprisals when the armistice has been sounded. If Vietnam is to rehabilitate-which it will have to do-people living there have to face taxation to rebuild their country and there should not be a continuing exodus. Poland and Latin America face a different situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's statement contains a contradiction concerning family reunion. We need to know how many people we will take in an unskilled category when there is an outflow from another area. Many post-war migrant children encounter a maths barrier and will find employment difficult. They will not get a tradesmen's status in the work force. I appreciate the dedication of the Minister and senior officers of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, but I do not believe we have a linking with the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) or the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown). My Tasmanian colleague, Senator Tate, on an earlier occasion on an Estimates committee, referred to Scandinavia having a vast computer system which can pin-point job shortages and help people to know what to aim at. We have not got that facility yet. A very fine Minister, Clyde Cameron, sought sanction for it. In subsequent years we felt that economy-wise such a scheme should not happen. I believe that we should get a close link between the two ministries. We do not yet completely have such a link. I do not quarrel with the objectives of this statement but I believe that justice has to be done. I will finish on that note of wisdom. </PARA>

<PARA>Further on, the document states:</PARA>
<PARA> From 19 April 1982 applicants for immigration to Australia will be considered in one of five eligibility categories. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He got out just in time because of other things, but I am not here to talk about that today. I am concerned that the Australian Government, through its agent in Los Angeles, the Consul-General, Mr McLeay, is conducting a massive and no doubt very expensive campaign to attract migrants to this country. The article, under the by-line of New York of 9 November, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australian immigration officials in California are being swamped with inquiries by skilled workers wanting to migrate to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> A spokesman for the Australian Consulate-General in Los Angeles said that 1500 inquiries were received in five days, recently. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> This followed a promotional visit to them by the Consul-General, Mr John McLeay. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> We are looking for those with good academic qualifications and with three to five years' good business experience or application in banking or industry, Mr Slater said. </PARA>
<PARA>He is a spokesman for Mr McLeay. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr McLeay's visit included radio and television interviews over three days in Arizona. </PARA>
<PARA> By the time he returned, the consulate was deluged with inquiries-most of them from the type of workers Australia was seeking. </PARA>
<PARA> The embassy also has found increased interest since it launched an advertising campaign in US newspapers recently. </PARA>
<PARA>The end of the article states:</PARA>
<PARA> In the past financial year Australia took 3236 migrants from Canada and the United States-a 29 per cent increase on the previous period. </PARA>
<PARA>This country has massive unemployment, and any amount of people capable of carrying out the jobs for which the Government is trying to recruit people in the United States of America. With the amalgamation of banks many very experienced banking officials in this country are now on the scrap heap because no jobs are available. Yet here we have this Government trying to recruit people in the United States of America with banking experience when we have people with such experience here. What sort of a government do we have in this country? Why does it want to bring these Americans into this country when we have thousands of our own people who could easily fill these jobs? Let us look at some of the other categories of people that the Government is looking for. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA> Some of the people we are most particularly interested in are those in the computer industry-programmers, systems analysts and computer salesmen. </PARA>
<PARA>We have all those people with those skills in this country who would be only too willing to carry out the work if it was made available to them. But they are being bypassed by this conservative Government trying to bring people into this country to fill jobs which we ought to be filling with our own residents.</PARA>
<PARA> There is another matter I am concerned about. When I look at those figures I see that in the past financial year 3,236 migrants from Canada and the United States have come to this country. I was in Canada recently and I learned that Canadians who are issued with visitor's visas to come to Australia are also given work permits. But there is no reciprocal arrangement for Australians going to Canada on a visitor's visa. They are not allowed to work in Canada, and I agree with that. Canada has unemployment too. Australian citizens going there should not be allowed to take the jobs of Canadians. But here in Australia we do not say that Canadians who come here on visitor's visas cannot take a job at the expense of our own work force; they are allowed to do it. We have this document put down by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) giving us all the categories of the new system under which the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is going to work, yet there are all those anomalies in it. I have no doubt that if I had the time to go through the document and time was available to me to speak about it today I could find many more anomalies. </PARA>
<PARA> I have raised two matters which are of great concern and which people who are out of work have brought to my attention. The fact is that this Government is advertising overseas for skilled people to come here when we have any number of suitable people to fill those jobs here in Australia. It is only recently, I think over the last six months, that I have had to draw to the attention of Senator Chaney-it has been a long, protracted discussion with questions in the Parliament and letters to and fro-the fact that a journal in the United States of America which is circulated in Australia is telling people in America that thousands of jobs are available in Australia. Senator Chaney wrote to me recently that the Minister was looking at the matter and would endeavour to take some action, if possible, to point out to the people in America that this was false advertising. I took Senator Chaney's word that the Government would endeavour to do something about it but I was amazed when I picked up the Melbourne Age today to see that the Government itself is advertising, at the behest of Mr McLeay, the Australian Consul-General in Los Angeles, for people to come to Australia. So if the answers I got from Senator Chaney are correct-and I have no reason to doubt that they are not-the Government is engaging in misleading advertising, trying to attract United States citizens here for work which our own people are quite well equipped to do. I hope that the Governmment will put a stop to this practice as soon as it possibly can in the interests of our own Australian citizens. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The presentation of this report affords us a very limited opportunity to examine and to debate some of the basic questions which are contained in it. At least it does give us a chance to examine the activities of the Industries Assistance Commission since it was established in 1974 following an acknowledgement by the major political parties in this country that the work of the Tariff Board had limited scope and that there was a need, therefore, for another organisation not only to carry out the work which was formerly the responsibility of the Tariff Board but also to act in an objective fachion, an advisory fashion, to government, to industry and to the community generally. I think it has to be said that the legislation establishing the Commission sought to establish guidelines by which objectivity could be achieved. However I have to say, having looked at the activities of the IAC in the intervening years, that a great many of the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission lack objectivity and, in fact, do not put into effect the guidelines upon which the organisation was to operate. That is due to deficiencies in the legislation and to the fact that we have within that organisation an influence, which can be generally described as economic rationalism, which does not take into account the views of the Parliament when the organisation was first established. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Commission has done in its examination of various industries in the intervening years has been to create a lot of objective analysis of the industries and to provide the Parliament with statistics and information about the way in which Australian industry, particularly manufacturing industry, operates. In coming to its conclusions and in providing the Parliament with information the IAC has created a climate of uncertainty and confusion in many sectors of Australian industry. Australian manufacturing industry in particular has reacted very strongly to a number of the assumptions that the Industries Assistance Commission has made. Of course, in recent times the IAC, particularly with its latest report on the automobile industry, has created a climate that one can only say has contributed to dismay by management and labour in the industry. Probably, the time has arrived when the organisation ought to have new guidelines established. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the IAC, with its emphasis on efficiency, on rationalisation and on trying to put Australia into a situation in the changing world economy-the world economy is now undergoing tremendous changes as a result of the internationalising of capital and the consequent effect of that on labour-is dovetailing its work with that concept rather than establishing in Australia a climate of self-sufficiency and certainty which would enable investment decisions to be made, with all that that means in respect of the viability of our industrial and manufacturing base. Therefore, I find myself attracted to the view that the IAC should be replaced by an authority which would plan for a diverse, balanced and self-sufficient industry base in this country. IAC inquiries contribute to a great deal of unease not only within the industry but also within the Public Service and within the Government itself. I refer to a report in the Melbourne Age of 6 November, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Industry and Commerce is believed to have advised the Federal Government to ignore the Industries Assistance Commission recommendations and maintain high protection for Australia's car industry. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Cuts in protection, as recommended by the IAC would cost thousands of jobs in the industry in Victoria and South Australia, where Liberal State Governments are due to go to the polls before the end of next year. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The IAC, the Government's independent advisory body on protection and tariffs, submitted its final report in August on proposed assistance to the car industry after 1984. </PARA>
<PARA>We know, of course, that the companies and the unions involved in the motor car industry have considerable unease and concern. This has a destabilising effect upon those areas and regions of our country where the automobile industry is a vital component of decentralisation. Certain factors have to be taken into consideration. Parts of our nation are vulnerable to changing world trends and to changes in the relationship between our own industries. It seems to me that the IAC does not take that fact sufficiently into consideration. For example, on page 17 of the report, in speaking of the automobile industry, it talks about the extent to which some industries bear the burden of protection, yet it does not address the advantages that accrue from maintaining the provision of some assistance to those industries. I refer, of course, to the component industries in particular. That point has well and truly been made not only by the manufacturing unions in the automobile industry but also in the course of an important statement issued by the Repco company. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 8 of the report the IAC expounds its own basic view. However, it seems to me that the IAC does not properly apply itself to advising the Government, the Parliament, and the Australian community for that matter, on the need for specialisation in our manufacturing industries. We do have certain skills in this area. We should be encouraging a wide and diverse manufacturing sector, but all too often the IAC's view of specialisation is limited and fails to take into consideration alternatives that would enable Australia to become both self-sufficient and efficient in many areas. That can be achieved by specialising in certain aspects of manufacturing industry. A view expressed widely by industry, and one with which I tend to agree, is that all too often the IAC's concept of rationalisation is the limited one of mere rationing; that it is prepared to see written down very important and valuable industries of this country, as happened with regard to clothing, textiles and footwear. I recall what I regard as the disastrous decision taken in 1974-75 to cut by 25 per cent the tariffs which applied to clothing, textiles and footwear. </PARA>
<PARA> The Parliament should be demanding that the Government make clear the need for the IAC to have new objectives, new guidelines, new concepts and perspectives concerning the international pressures which obviously are bearing down upon important sections of our economy. After all, whatever may be said about the problems which face our economy, it has provided us with a significant standard of living and the time has arrived for the Parliament to be given an opportunity to debate in the future this very important question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment on the Industries Assistance Commission and its recommmendations regarding the motor vehicle industry. The IAC argues that the elimination of quotas and the reduction of tariffs would result in lower prices for imported motor vehicles and that this in turn would restrain the prices of domestically produced vehicles. According to the IAC, these price reductions would stimulate demand to the tune of 11,000 vehicles per annum which would, of course, represent only 2 per cent of the average new motor vehicle registration figure per annum. The IAC also argues that lower priced vehicles would contribute to an increase in the real aggregate income of consumers and would lower the cost to other industries. This, it says, would increase the overall level of economic activity and create sufficient job opportunities to offset those lost in the car industry. However, to arrive at this conclusion, the IAC assumed that a reduction in the price of motor vehicles would cause a decrease in the consumer price index, which in turn would cause a drop in money wages and further reductions in the consumer price index. Not only did it assume that money wages would drop but also it assumed that the loss of jobs from the motor vehicle industry would not affect the overall demand for goods. However, history has shown that, as unemployment increases, the demand for goods is restrained and real incomes fall.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite clearly, the IAC has overestimated the effect of the consumer price index and, as a result, has overestimated the likely gains from any increases in demand. The IAC admitted that some plants would close and the overall size of the motor vehicle industry and the component manufacturing industry would decrease, but it deliberately ignored the impact of any increases in unemployment on economic activity. According to some economists, the impact of cheaper vehicles would be swamped by the general downturn in economic activity which would result from a contraction of the motor vehicle industry. The Melbourne-based Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research produced a paper which showed what would happen if tariffs were reduced by 7.5 per cent and import quotas were raised by 20 per cent to 40 per cent of the market. The study predicted that, after three years, 21,400 jobs in the motor vehicle industry would be lost; a total of 51,300 jobs throughout the economy would be lost; and motor vehicle production would decrease by 35 per cent. This would happen after only three years with a tariff reduction of only 7.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government must not accept the IAC recommendations. The cost in human terms would be just too great. Unemployment in South Australia and in the Geelong area of Victoria would soar if the IAC recommendations were accepted. Already South Australia has the highest unemployment rate of any State in Australia and if quotas on car imports were abolished unemployment in South Australia would rise to something like 11 per cent. Of course, the importers group of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries and the National Farmers Federation could not care less about what happens to the car industry workers. They are the only ones who stand to gain from the adoption of the IAC report. They talk a lot about lower car prices but where were they when the Government increased the sales tax on motor vehicles and when the Government imposed the crippling petrol tax?</PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that in 1980-81 this Government earned $4,000m from the combined effect of the sales tax on motor vehicles and the petrol tax. In the same year it earned only one-quarter of this amount from tariffs on cars. Obviously the Australian motor vehicle is not operating as efficiently as it could be but to argue that abolishing quotas and reducing tariffs would fix this is far too simplistic. Surely, if quotas were abolished Australian made cars would not stand a chance against the flood of Japanese imports. Even the United States has to protect its car industry from the Japanese to ensure its survival. The importance of the motor vehicle industry to the Australian economy cannot be underestimated. The IAC has outlived its usefulness and should be axed before it kills off the Australian industries. The time has come for the establishment of a motor vehicle authority, comprising government, employer and union repesentation, to thrash out these complex issues and work towards the development of a more efficient car industry. The introduction of the Export Complementation Scheme in 1982 is already threatening jobs in the component industry. Technological change is also posing a threat to the jobs of car industry workers. The issues are far more complex than the IAC has suggested and can only be resolved by responsible long term economic planning. It is this sort of long term planning which is seriously lacking in Australia. It is about time the Government recognised this fact. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not always see eye to eye with my colleague Senator Arthur Gietzelt but his comments in relation to the Industries Assistance Commission made a lot of sense to me. In the brief time available I would like to speak about the uncertainty which is created in the minds of industry by the manner in which the IAC presents its reports and the delays and attitudes of governments in responding to those reports. I refer particularly to the problems that are inherent in the system itself. The IAC's types of recommendations, in focussing unduly on tariffs, quotas and subsidies, inherently attack the whole basis of long term certainty in business planning. There is also a need for a social evaluation of a lot of the recommendations. All too often the IAC compares one industry's concessions within Australia with another rather than looking at the global situation; that is, examining what other major producing countries are doing in relation to industry assistance. If Australia is going to compete and trade on a world basis it must compare industry by industry on a global basis rather than on an Australian basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that all too often, by cutting the heart out of industry, we do not provide long term security for employment or for long term survival of industry, with detrimental consequences such as unemployment. The IAC pays far too little attention to the problems of decentralised areas. I believe it should be paying far more attention to securing mechanisms. For example, we all recognise we have far too many manufacturers in the motor car industry. But the IAC says that it wants to cut the heart out of the industry, which virtually puts everybody at risk, rather than create a situation whereby we can have some mechanism for amalgamation. We have five car manufacturers in Australia whereas there are three in the United States. Surely to goodness the IAC should have enough sense to bring forward recommendations for the merging of these industries. We will only reduce prices to the consumers by getting economies of scale. Only through manufacturing are we able to introduce high level technology. Because of the time available I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

Before outlining the major provisions of the Bill, I would like to make some preliminary remarks about the well-documented inadequacies of the existing law. </PARA>
<PARA> The power which lies in the hands of either House to punish for contempt is an extraordinary one. It is capable of being exercised without any regard being had to modern precepts of safeguards, checks and balances in the administration of justice. For example, there is no requirement for the alleged offender to be given notice of any hearing; there is no requirement that he be charged; there is no requirement that he know the evidence against him; he cannot cross-examine his accusers; there are no guidelines within which the House is constrained to operate in coming to a finding; the accused has no right to legal counsel; the chamber trying him can act inquisitorially or aggressively. </PARA>

I would suggest that not only ought any chamber be extremely sparing in its use of such a power while it exists but also it ought to do what it can to bring about a situation where the parliament is protected from vexations and damaging abuse in a way which is more consonant with modern legal safeguards. Clearly the way to do that would be to place the contempt power in the hands of the courts. It was with these sorts of considerations in mind that a joint select committee of this Parliament in 1908 recommended just such action. In 1908 when Australia was one of the more progressive social democracies in the world, parliamentary conservatives and progressives alike came to the following conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA> The ancient procedure for punishment of contempts of Parliament is generally admitted to be cumbersome, ineffective, and not consonant with modern ideas-</PARA>
<PARA>This is in 1908-</PARA>
<PARA>and requirements in the administration of justice, it is hardly consistent with the dignity and functions of a legislative body which has been assailed by newspapers or individuals to engage within the chamber in conflict with the alleged offenders, and to perform the duties of prosecutor, judge and gaoler. </PARA>
<PARA> All the . . . witnesses who gave evidence . . . were agreed that it would be competent for the Commonwealth Parliament . . . to assign to the ordinary courts of law jurisdiction to deal with . . . persons charged with and found guilty of contempt of Parliament . . . such legislation would not create new offences, or offences previously unknown to the law of Parliament; it would merely provide a new tribunal for adjudication and determination and possibly a new measure of punishment. </PARA>
<PARA> The new tribunal so exercising power could fairly be equipped with a greater discretion in the infliction of punishment than that possessed by either House. It could be authorised to punish libellers and slanderers of, and other offenders against, Parliament by imposing fines of a moderate or severe character, according to the heinousness of the offence or, in the alternative, imprisonment. It could also be authorised to impose upon the offenders the costs of the prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA>Those words were written in 1908 and in those words the Parliament was talking about a contemporary view of the law. A Bill was drafted to put part of that report into effect in 1910. It was never introduced. In 1934 the Attorney-General in a conservative government, Mr J. G. Latham, as he then was, prepared the 1910 Bill for re-introduction. It was never introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The nature of the contempt power, as I have outlined it, should make us suspicious that the power is prone to abuse. A brief look at a few examples from the past indicates that exercise of the power has often involved abuses, and has rarely, if ever, acted to promote the dignity of parliament as viewed by the public. Perhaps the most celebrated and most frightening example was the Browne and Fitzpatrick case in 1955. There, the Bankstown Observer contained a series of allegations suggesting that the then Federal member for Reid had been mixed up in an immigration racket. Following a committee hearing, the transcript of which was never made public, the House called Browne and Fitzpatrick before it. Neither was permitted legal representation. Fitzpatrick apologised to the House. Browne pointed out to the House that he was to be convicted of an offence without any charges having been laid; that the case against him had nowhere been properly proved; that he had not been able to cross-examine his accusers; that he could not appeal. The House's response to that was summarily to convict both Browne and Fitzpatrick of contempt of parliament, and have them incarcerated at Goulburn Gaol for some months. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not an incident of which this Parliament can be particularly proud. Again, it was an incident in which the Parliament was seen by the public to behave in an undignified way; an ironic result when one remembers that the Parliament was seeking to preserve its dignity. As evidence of that, I seek leave to have copies of three newspaper articles of the time incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA>THE 'SYDNEY MORNING HERALD'</PARA>
<PARA>Friday, June 10, 1955Trial by Parliament</PARA>
<PARA> 'Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!' When Mr C. A. Morgan, M.P., feeling aggrieved by charges made against him in the Bankstown 'Observer', decided to take his complaint to the House and its committee of privileges, instead of instituting legal proceedings for damages, he set in motion a remarkable train of events. These led yesterday to the protraction of a session of the Federal Parliament which was due to end last night, and to a decision to call the owner and editor of the paper before the Bar of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> Parliament is properly jealous of its rights, dignity and privileges. It is essential to the working of our democratic system that members in the performance of their duties, should be protected against improper influence or intimidation from outside. But Parliament, in exercising its rights, must be careful not to infringe those of ordinary citizens by procedures inconsistent with the normal processes of the law. In asserting its dignity, it should be sure that the occasion really demands the invocation of its traditionally imposing powers; otherwise a loss rather than a gain in prestige is liable to result. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people will not feel satisfied that these conditions are being met in the present case. Persons conducting an obscure suburban newspaper were summoned before the privileges committee, sitting in private. They were not allowed representation by counsel, though it happened that the chairman of the examining committee was himself a QC. Then a report was tabled, and duly published, containing selected portions of the evidence of Fitzpatrick and Browne. The extracts, very evidently, were those best calculated to support the committee's finding that a serious breach of privilege had been committed. But they were also, necessarily, the portions containing the most damaging admissions by the two men-answers which, however disgraceful, might have been given a somewhat different complexion if counsel had been present to assist or protect them. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fitzpatrick and Mr Browne were, in effect, on trial. It is unfortunate that the hearing, in its secrecy and the exclusion of counsel, partook of the nature of a star chamber. Parliament is the supreme law-making body. When it or one of its instruments proceeds to arraign citizens for alleged offences, not against any law, but against the privileges of the House, ordinary legal safeguards and practices should be scrupulously observed. If they are disregarded, if Parliament sets itself up as a tribunal exempt from the customary methods of enforcing British justice, there is bound to be generated a public sympathy for the defendants which they may not deserve. </PARA>
<PARA> On the face of the committee's report, a report based on the procedures above indicated, a gross breach of privilege undoubtedly has been committed. What is the House, assuming it endorses the finding-and the brutal candour of Fitzpatrick in particular, has clearly caused a strong wave of Parliamentary feeling-going to do about it? There is talk of imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever penal powers Parliament possesses, or believes it possesses, so drastic an application of them would be most undesirable. In this country and in these times public opinion would strongly oppose the gaoling of any person except by due process of the Courts appointed to administer the law. Archaic precedents notwithstanding, it is not for Parliament to usurp the functions of Judge and Jury. An apology to the House is plainly due. The offenders would be well advised to offer it. And Parliament, in the words of the privileges committee in relation to other articles in the ''Observer'' would 'best consult its dignity' by then letting the whole matter drop. </PARA>

<PARA>Parliament Unfit to be Judge</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> If the dignity, status and the very institution of Parliament depends on a repetition of the proceedings of the last few weeks, God help the Commonwealth of Australia. There has seldom been anywhere in any British country a poorer showing of conduct and a demonstration of unfitness than that which has been revealed by proceedings. Nevertheless, the function of legislation should be the supreme exercise of reason and power known to mankind, and it is of supreme importance that Parliament, as the very cornerstone of our liberties, should be fit to discharge its high function. If there are doubts in the minds of the Australian people, they have been put there by the eyes and ears of those who have watched sadly the poor standards so often displayed and ill disguised by all the outward show of dignity cheek by jowl with misbehaviour and medocrity. </PARA>
<PARA> The deep sense of misgiving which has spread through Australia during the last 24 hours did not begin or end in the proceedings by which two persons guilty of serious breach of privilege were committed to prison. It may be that other ends of justice will be served by the decision of the House, but the fitness of the judges is a matter of greater concern than sentences which may fortuitously have a salutary effect in other directions. </PARA>
<PARA> Parliament is a court for determining breaches of privilege and the matter in which breaches shall be punished. Parliament as a court makes its own rules of procedure, and being the highest source of rule making, makes its own rules. It is a pertinent commentary on the mental indolence that so often has characterised the discharge by Parliament of its duty to the people that it has done nothing to make modern rules with respect to that which it affects most dearly to prize, namely parliamentary privilege. Thus, it has happened that Parliament acts as judge in matters on which it has exerted neither wisdom nor power to define in accordance with modern democratic concepts. Indeed, the proceedings in the House of Representatives yesterday suggested that some of the judges were rather unwilling to accept the obligations that their own neglect had left at their doors. There is a certain abjectivness about some aspects of the Browne and Fitzpatrick cases. The original complainant was obviously disturbed at the consequences of his appeal to Parliament to defend him, and he scuttled out when it came for him to vote. There can be little doubt that no member of Parliament is undisturbed by the consequences of the use of power that was unleashed when the Committee of Privileges brought in its report. What then followed was admission in many words of the unpreparedness and unfitness of Parliament to apply precedents which have been left by its own careless custodianship of power. Surely, it was never thought when the Constitution was framed that for 55 years there would be no action by Parliament to declare by original act its own powers, privileges and immunities. What happened in Parliament yesterday was no precedent, but slavery to outmoded precedents which are the relics of other days and long faded circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The first proceedings of Parliament when it again meets should be concerned with positive action to review the entire procedure in relation to privilege. It would be fitting if Parliament were to impose heavier penalties on those which, by persistent misbehaviour, lower dignity and breach privilege. It is imperative that the proceedings of Parliament with relation to persons who commit breach of privilege outside Parliament shall be shaped in accordance with modern ideas of human rights. We believe that the power of Parliament must be upheld, and that the institution shall be protected so that the liberty of the subject shall be guaranteed and protected. We deplore that the Parliament of the Commonwealth is not better conditioned to achieve these ends, and that in consequence its power to defend liberty may breed fear in the minds of those who best cherish and defend freedom. </PARA>

<PARA>The Gaoling of Browne and Fitzpatrick</PARA>
<PARA> In Canberra yesterday two men were ordered to be imprisoned for three months. They were convicted and sentenced without a trial in the ordinary sense of the word, without being allowed representation by counsel, and finally, so far as the House of Representatives was concerned, without right of appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an event without precedent in the history of Federation. Never before has the Commonwealth Parliament thus arbitrarily exercised its powers to punish for breach of privilege or contempt. It had not, in 55 years, even troubled to declare or define those powers, but had merely accepted them as a vague heritage from the House of Commons, transmitted through the Constitution. This lack of definition had two extraordinary results in the case of Fitzpatrick and Browne. First, the House was uncertain whether, while possessing the right to inflict the major penalty of imprisonment, it was legally entitled to impose the lesser penalty of a fine. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, and more importantly, it meant that the two men were arraigned for an offence, hazy in itself, for which no penalty had previously been prescribed. In ordinary criminal cases the offender knows in advance, or should know, the punishment to which he will become liable. Even for contempt of Court the nature of the penalty-usually a fine, though imprisonment may be ordered-is well understood. But here, not only were the perpetrators of contempt of Parliament unaware-because no precedent or precise rules existed-of the penalties they might be incurring: Parliament itself was in doubt and divided upon the degree of punishment it could or should impose. </PARA>
<PARA> This dubiety, and the novelty of the circumstances ought to have counselled the House to act with more restraint than it showed yesterday. To say this is not to condone in the slightest degree the conduct of Fitzpatrick and Browne. Their offence was gross, and in Browne's case it was aggravated by a defiant refusal to apologise. Nor is any reflection intended on the House's approach to its task. On the contrary, with one regrettable exception, the historic debate was in the best Parliamentary tradition of dignity and fairness. </PARA>
<PARA> But the sentence passed was severe in the extreme. Not only so. The verdict was reached and the penalty fixed (by majority vote) in an end-of-session atmosphere of haste utterly unsuited to the importance of the matter, and following procedures in the committee of privileges-secret hearings and denial of counsel-contrary to ordinary conceptions of justice. The House should at least have had access to the whole of the evidence, and not merely to selected portions of it, before it made up its mind. </PARA>
<PARA> More time for reflection, in place of yesterday's flurry of behind-the-scenes consultations and arguments, might have convinced more members that Parliament would do itself a disservice in the public esteem by invoking the ancient and outmoded sanctions of privilege and applying them so harshly. By so doing it has risked making martyrs of two inconspicuous and rather contemptible persons. And it has raised up a strong public feeling that no citizens of this free country, whatever their misdemeanours, should be gaoled except by due process of the law and the Courts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The power exists in State Houses of Parliament also. That means that 13 groups of politicians in Australia have the power to hold inquisitions in secret, to intimidate and to punish summarily without trial, without permitting the accused a right of appeal. State Houses too have abused the privilege power. I cite a case from as recently as 1968 in South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In South Australia in 1968, a select committee of the South Australian Legislative Council heard evidence to do with the introduction of the Scientology (Prohibition) Bill from one K. E. Klaebe. Mr Klaebe later wrote to the Secretary of the Committee which was inquiring into these matters in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> Re the honourable Mr Hill (the Chairman of the Committee) although I accepted at the time the reassurance of the Committee re its impartiality, on further reflection I feel I must make the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it from the comments of the honourable members during evidence on the 30th inst., if I believe that the abovenamed is unduly biased against scientology, I must formally charge him with that short-coming. I now take up that suggestion. In doing so I restate the allegations I made in my evidence which I may point out the honourable gentleman was not prepared to deny. </PARA>
<PARA>In my view, Mr Klaebe was exercising his democratic rights in writing that letter. He was doing so, I suggest, with some dignity and with some moderation. Mr Klaebe was called before the Bar of the Legislative Council and was given only the opportunity to apologise. He was not allowed counsel. He was not given any opportunity even to speak in his own defence. He was then addressed in these terms by the President of the Legisla- tive Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Klaebe, I have to inform you that in the opinion of the House the writing and sending of the letter was highly improper conduct and the House, without proceeding to the question whether that conduct constitutes a contempt of the House, issues a warning to you to refrain from a repetition of such conduct in the future, which could be attended with most serious consequences. To deliberately attribute to the chairman of a select committee a lack of impartiality is a contempt of the Legislative Council which, on being duly established, can be severely punished. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members, when individually engaged on official duties both inside and outside the chamber, are obliged to make up their minds and speak out as they think fit, but when sitting as members of a select committee they are, whatever they may have said before, under a strict duty to be impartial, and they invariably discharge their duties. That concludes the proceedings, Mr Klaebe, and you may withdraw. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that that is a ludicrous statement and that the dignity of a chamber of Parliament will not be sustained by this sort of sanctimony. After reviewing these cases and others, one of Australia's leading authorities on parliamentary privilege, Dennis Pearce, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> There would seem to be many advantages in empowering the courts to deal with questions of contempt of Parliament-it would avoid the use of the contempt procedure for political purposes, it would deter hasty allegations of the commission of contempt, it would ensure a person the chance to put his own case properly-to mention some of the more obvious. Perhaps more importantly, the dignity of Parliament would be enhanced as it would avoid the aspersion case against it of being both prosecutor and judge. </PARA>
<PARA>The authors of the book Freedom in Australia, Enid Campbell and Harry Whitmore, are of the same opinion. This Bill now seeks to remove most of the parliamentary contempt power to a court. The Bill creates a series of offences against Parliament. The word 'contempt' is not used, but the offences created are modelled on offences which have been traditionally held to be in contempt of Parliament. These matters are dealt with in clauses 7 to 22. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 11 dealing with defamation of Parliament is perhaps the most topical. The clause creates the offence of publishing 'defamatory or scandalous matter tending to adversely affect the reputation of either House or its members or to impair the respect due to the authority of either House.' The Latham Bill of 1934 created a similar offence. However I have added to the earlier Bill to accommodate more modern ideas, and to create the defences of truth, reasonable mistake, and fair comment. This is in line with the Australian Law Reform Commission report on defamation. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the House of Commons Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege of 1967 also recommended that similar defences be recognised. I note further that Messrs Birney, Holding and Jacobi, members of the House of Representatives, in their dissenting report call for privilege law on defamation of Parliament which takes into account the relationship between the Press and Parliament. That is what was done by the Law Reform Commission and the House of Commons Select Committee. I have drafted clause 22 accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 (2) provides that if an Act is an offence as set out in the Bill, the House of Parliament may not proceed against such Act except according to the procedures laid down by the Bill. That means that the House cannot punish, but may refer the matter to a court for trial. If the accused is found guilty, he may be punished accordingly by the court. In deference to the views of the Select Committee of the House of Commons on Parliamentary Privilege no attempt has been made to codify exhaustively offences against Parliament, although the offences created in the Bill range fairly widely over the whole ambit of contempt of Parliament. Accordingly there may be a residuum of offences against Parliament which are not covered by the Bill. The Parliament remains free to decide what those further offences are. It may punish in such cases but cannot, without referring the matter to a court, imprison a person. That is dealt with in clause 4 (3). This would enable the Houses to retain exclusive jurisdiction over their own precincts by way of orders to their officers. Also, either House may order a person to desist from behaviour. If such order is within the authority of the House, disobedience of it discloses an offence under clause 14 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 (4) enables a court inquiring into an offence, or other non-compliance with the Bill, to examine records of the proceedings of Parliament, but only so far as is necessary for making its determinations. Any proceeding against an alleged offence against the Act takes place in two stages. Firstly, either House of Parliament may investigate the matter through its privileges committee. The committee can then recommend that the House require the Attorney-General to prosecute. If the House then passes a resolution to that effect, the Attorney-General institutes proceedings in the courts. The court then hears the matter de novo-that is, it shall hear all the evidence and come to its own conclusion on that evidence as to whether an offence has been committed, and what penalty is appropriate within maximum penalties prescribed by the Act. That maximum penalty is one year's imprisonment or a $10,000 fine, or any lesser maximum penalty that the House provides for a particular case. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, parliamentary investigations of possible offences are to be made only according to certain safeguards. These are as follows: Committee hearings are to be heard in public if a witness requires; the alleged offender is to be given the right to legal advice at all times; the alleged offender has a right against self-incrimination; where a person's conduct is raised that person has a right to be heard in his own defence; the Committee is required to give the alleged offender notice of the time, place and nature of any hearing investigating the possible commission of an offence, to which that person is called to give evidence; and unless large numbers of members are involved, the Committee will as far as is possible not include members with a personal interest in the matter. Clause 29 empowers the High Court to make orders or declarations to ensure those safeguards are complied with. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate at this stage for me to explain why I have seen it necessary to draft and introduce this Bill at this stage. I should explain that my intention was not to prejudice the report by the House of Representatives Privileges Committee on the Oakes case. At no stage did I have any special knowledge about the deliberations of that Committee. When announcing my Bill, I assiduously avoided any direct comment on the Laurie Oakes case. My purposes were to ensure that the possibility of referring contempt cases to a court was widely discussed in the community, and to put before the Parliament and the people a concrete proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then, I have been gratified by the report of the House of Representatives Privileges Committee which calls for review of privilege. I have been gratified by the concern expressed by some parliamentarians about this issue. In particular, I refer to Mr Hodgman's views as expressed in the House on 29 October. Mr Hodgman said that the right of a person against whom allegations have been made to be heard in his own defence was: 'absolutely fundamental to the administration of justice'. I agree with him, and applaud him for that statement. However, his conduct on the Privileges Committee may have belied it. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The most humble and menial defendant charged before the most inferior court of competent jurisdiction in the land on the most trifling charge imaginable has, as the law demands, the total, absolute and fundamental right to be heard on his own behalf. </PARA>
<PARA>The most humble and menial defendant charged before the most inferior court of competent jurisdiction in the land on the most trifling charge has more rights than the right to be heard on his own behalf. He has the right to legal counsel; the right to notice of the charge against him; the right in most cases to cross-examine his accusers; the right to be heard by a body with no personal interest in his case; the right to reasons for a decision; and the right to appeal against any decision. I would be happy if this Parliament took it upon itself to provide those basic rights to someone accused of a breach of parliamentary privilege because there is no way of doing that other than to provide that such cases be heard by an independent judicial tribunal. I hope honourable senators will consider that very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> It is natural for honourable senators and members of the House to seek to retain a maximum of discretion in this area. As they will be exercising that discretion, perhaps they believe it will not be abused. Common sense should indicate that that trust is naive. History shows it is unfounded. It is said that a move to remove the privilege power to courts would be in derogation of parliamentary sovereignty and the principle of separation of powers. I should like to offer my Bill as an opportunity for this Parliament to exercise its sovereignty by expressing its will in an Act of Parliament. Such an Act would in no way derogate from parliamentary sovereignty. In the words of Professor Colin Howard which appeared in the Melbourne Age of Friday, 6 November:</PARA>
<PARA> Parliamentary sovereignty asserts the supremacy of Acts of Parliament over decisions of the courts and the executive. It is not in the least dependent on arbitrary power to imprison ordinary citizens on grounds which need not be communicated to them and which they have no legal right to dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>Nor is the Bill in conflict with the principle of separation of powers. In fact, the power to punish for contempt should be characterised as a judicial power, that is, a power to assess the legal quality of Acts according to pre-existing legal rules. Returning that power to the courts would accordingly be more in harmony with the doctrine of separation of powers as enshrined in our Constitution than leaving it in the hands of parliament. Indeed, in 1955 the Sydney Morning Herald commented:</PARA>
<PARA> Archaic precedents notwithstanding, it is not for the Parliament to ursurp the functions of judge and jury. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest to the Senate sincerely and very seriously that this Bill is one which will enhance the dignity and the public confidence in the Parliament. If I as an individual were threatened, molested, defamed or maliciously misrepresented, I would not welcome the public odium of referring that matter to my colleagues for summary determination in secret meetings. I would feel better protected if I could take that matter to a court. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to honourable senators and members of the House that in any serious case in which the privileges of this place have to be defended, they will be grateful to be able to refer that matter to a court and to escape the political odium of being judge, jury and prosecutor in their own cause. The Browne and Fitzpatrick case may well have been such a case. Would it not have been advantageous for the parliamentary institution for the House to have had a verdict and sentence passed by a court? In that case, Browne and Fitzpatrick could have been punished-if indeed they deserved punishment-and the Parliament could have been defended without the public spotlight falling on 'the deep sense of misgiving' and 'the mental indolence' of Parliamentarians to which various daily papers referred in their editorial leaders on the occasion of Browne and Fitzpatrick's incarceration. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority report of the House of Representatives Committee of Privileges notes the lack of progress on the issue of parliamentary privilege. I am introducing this Bill because I believe that unless the Parliament adopts it progress will again be thwarted in this area. I have good grounds for that belief. Those grounds are provided by the sorry history of privilege reform in this country and in others. In Australia, that begins over 70 years ago with the Quick report of 1908, the draft Bills of 1910, 1932, 1933 and 1934. Then no action was taken despite specific proposals by the Committee, and draft Bills available for passage. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then we have seen the Parliament's privilege power used, and sometimes abused, on several occasions. On each occasion there has been much publicity, much public call for reform before the issue was quickly forgotten-until the next time it was raised. In 1967, a House of Commons select committee on privilege reported with fairly comprehensive recommendations. Again, nothing has been done as a result of that. In Australia, in 1978 the House of Representatives Committee of Privileges strongly recommended that the whole question of privilege should be referred to it for investigation and report. The House then agreed in principle to such an inquiry, but no such inquiry eventuated. Now, less than four years later, the same suggestion for a general review is being made. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my suggestion that either no such investigation will be set up, as in 1978, or alternatively any comprehensive proposal will not be implemented, as happened in 1908, 1910, 1932, 1933 and 1934. Accordingly, so that we may at last have some action on this matter, so that the Australian community will not condemn us for being unprepared to back up words of concern with action, I appeal to all honourable senators in a spirit of compromise to vote for this Bill if they believe, as I do, that it will improve our procedures on privilege-if they believe it will improve the standing of the Parliament in the community both now and on the future occasions when we have to act in defence of our privileges. I point out to those who may be able to see possible difficulties with this proposed law that it is an area which is difficult and complex enough to ensure that no solutions will be free of problems. It is also an area in which the present law is such that, as a number of commentators have pointed out, almost any reforms would represent an improvement. </PARA>
<PARA> Should this Bill pass into legislation, it shall remain within our competence to amend it so as to change our procedures. I have given considerable thought to this Bill to seek to ensure that it might be capable of acceptance from as wide a number of members of parliament as possible. I propose it to them with confidence and enthusiasm. However, from the beginning I have sought to produce a reasonable solution to this so far intractable problem, and a solution which would involve constructive and thoughtful contributions from all members of parliament. In that spirit, I wrote to all senators and members inviting their comments. I remain of that frame of mind. But I urge senators to bear in mind the necessity for comprehensive reform of privilege. I urge them to consider that in most modern Western constitutions, particularly those of Western Europe, legislative bodies retain their sovereignty and retain their privileges in a more dignified and modern way than has so far been available to our Parliament. Those countries include Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. I shall conclude by quoting one of the minority reports on the Oakes case which says:</PARA>
<PARA> The law of privilege has been static for nearly three centuries while the world of politics has changed dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA>Implicit in those words is a challenge to all of us who sit here. It is only by meeting that challenge that we can discharge our duty to those we represent. </PARA>

I am not playing party politics because I also took up the matter of the force's responsibility with the New South Wales Minister for Police. It is not good enough, when we are dealing with the Estimates, that we cannot get specific information just because the Minister is away. I want to know whether five members of the Australian Federal Police are on that citizenship applications job. I have an idea that members of the State police forces have access to the fingerprint records of people who have convictions. Let us break it down and set out what is the responsibility of the State police and what is the responsibility of the Australian Federal Police. At the moment the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs says that that is one of the major factors in this backlog. That may be true, but let the Minister for Administrative Services or whoever acted for him when he was away, come clean and tell us in specific terms just what is the state of play. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the estimates for the Department of Administrative Services I want to raise a matter which concerns the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Newman. Honourable senators would be aware that, as a Minister, Mr Newman is entitled to a chauffeured car from the pool to drive him at his instruction. That would include driving him within his electorate of Bass in Tasmania. What has happened in recent times is that the Minister has decided not to take advantage of the privilege of being provided with a driver but instead to drive himself in a car drawn from the Department of Administrative Services car pool-a Datsun 200B. I guess that is fair enough as it is his decision although of course it involves a loss of work for his driver and a loss of overtime which does not help his driver's income. If the Minister is entitled to do that as a general privilege, that is fair enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to know from the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) how many Ministers have been supplied with cars in which to drive themselves when they travel around their own electorates. Presumably the situation is that the Minister for Administrative Services is embarrassed to travel in his electorate in a chauffeured car. Perhaps the voters may think that he is not one of them if he is driven around in that way. I seek from the Government justification for the availability in the pool of drive-yourself cars for Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> What is a far worse aspect of this matter is that the Z plates, the Commonwealth Government plates, on the car that was supplied to the Minister have been replaced with ordinary Tasmanian registration plates so that to all appearances the car is a private vehicle and not a Government vehicle. The Minister is driving that car and presumably the costs of his travel by that vehicle are being charged to the Government. </PARA>

But it strikes me that this is a blatant cover-up by the Minister for Administrative Services in respect of the provision for himself of a service that is within his responsibility. Presumably the Government's justification or the Minister's justification for that action is the saving in costs; that is, if he drives himself the cost of an official driver is saved. If that is the sole justification, why is it necessary to replace the Z plates with ordinary Tasmanian number plates? This strikes me as a means by which the Minister seeks not to be seen as having the privileges of office. At the same time he is being supplied with them at Government expense. He is seeking to cover the matter up in this way. I ask for a response to this matter from the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise one issue in relation to the estimates for the Department of Administrative Services. As a senator who took his place in this chamber this year and who chose not to have an office in the central Commonwealth Government building in Brisbane but rather in a shopping centre, I wish to make a couple of observations on the practice that is employed in this country compared with that which is employed in other countries in relation to the entitlements of members of parliament. It seems to me that, despite the good will, dedication and constant attention of members of the Department of Administrative Services in Brisbane, a good deal of money is still being wasted in providing facilities for members of parliament. I believe that this results for a number of reasons. Probably the most obvious is that, when government departments buy, they buy according to a series of regulations which may or may not have anything to do with what a member of parliament is looking for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have made the point before that if one is terribly interested in rubbers, pencils and books, then certainly, tonnes of those are available. Computer facilities in which one might be interested are absolutely nil. I have since provided myself with those facilities at my own expense. It seems to me that a far simpler way of providing facilities for members of parliament would be to follow the American model and provide a lump sum of money to the member of parliament. Let him set up his own office according to his own priorities. I would much prefer to sit on packing cases and have a good computer terminal and operating mechanism with which to serve my electorate than to have a very nice chair. I will not inform the Parliament how much my chair cost but it was a one-off deal. I was quite staggered when I heard how much it cost. Indeed, if I had been allowed to buy my own furniture I would have bought it from my own personal contacts at a price far lower than what was paid for it. Indeed, I could have furnished the entire office for the amount it cost to provide my office with one desk. I believe that the amounts of money expended are not large in terms of the total Budget of the country but it is encumbent upon members of parliament to look very closely at that expenditure. I believe new offices could be set up much more efficiently and effectively if the money could be provided to the member concerned so as to allow him or her to make the choice from those things that are available according to what he or she may consider to be in the best interests of the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I feel that the officers of the Department of Administrative Services from time to time have to put up with a great deal from members of parliament. The officers who assisted me in setting up my electorate office in Brisbane were most helpful and, indeed, most solicitous. Nevertheless, I gained the feeling from them that they could see far more efficient and effective ways of operating. I gained the impression that many of the regulations which bound them were not, in fact, the most effective regulations. I wonder whether, not only in relation to this Department but also in relation to other departments, it might not be possible for officers at the work face to have more imput into how those departments operate so that they may bring more effective and efficient methods to bear. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macklin is very lucky to have an office in the suburbs. I want to relate what happened to me. I decided, having won the Senate position, to have my office in the suburbs. I made that decision late last year. Early in March officers of the Department of Administrative Services accompanied me to the geographical location in which I wanted the office. We spent three hours searching for appropriate premises and found them. The negotiations with the landlord for those premises took about five months. The Department finally agreed to a price for the premises after a lot of haggling. That occurred in mid-September. The lease was signed on 1 October and the Government has been paying for the lease since that date. I am still nowhere near occupying those premises. The Department of Housing and Construction is dragging its feet and is refusing to put up the partitions. First of all the money was not available. Now the money is available the Department says it is too busy. Maybe at the end of the month it will spend the two days necessary to put up the partitions in that office to make it usable. That is a total waste of money. It could have put the partitions up early in October. I have been receiving this one response all the time: 'You will be in in two weeks'. I rang at the end of the two weeks and was told that I would be in in another two weeks. It has gone on and on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think that is good enough. It is causing problems. The furniture of the senator I replaced has been in storage for well over 12 months. Material from the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting needing to be stored in Melbourne cannot be moved into storage because my furniture is still in that storehouse. Senator Macklin can consider himself lucky to have a regional office. It is a very difficult task. I think it is a lot harder than getting endorsement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to follow through the examination of the estimates for the Department of Administrative Services, and relate it to a number of the questions that we asked when we had the task of reviewing the Government's decisions following the Review of Commonwealth Functions earlier this year. I wish to relate it also to some of the evidence that is now available and to seek some justification for the decisions that the Government has taken in the matter of staff ceilings. I just wonder when we will have some sort of cost benefit analysis of these decisions. It must surely be agreed that as a result of the Review of Commonwealth Functions earlier this year and the implementation of those decisions, there has been a great deal of disclocation of staff formerly working under the jurisdiction of the Department of Administrative Services which has caused a great deal of anxiety and concern, some of which perhaps has been temporarily allayed as a result of a Press statement issued yesterday by the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Newman. Senator McLaren and other members of the Estimates Committee asked questions on this matter. We were told what was being done in respect of staff ceilings, private contractors and so on. Mr MacDonald, in reply to a question asked by Senator McLaren, put it in these terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, it is consistent with the general philosophy of the Government as expounded in the RCF statement by the Prime Minister . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I make no criticism of that response to Senator McLaren's question. It seems that a great deal of information has been given about the problems associated with staff ceilings in various government departments and particularly in this Department. But we do not have any evidence or information available to show whether there has been any saving of public funds which ostensibly was the motivation for the Government's changes in the whole gamut of functions of the Department. Therefore, on the basis of some philosophical view that the Government has we are supposed to endorse these changes that have been made without any evidence that there will be saving in public sector spending or that the cost to the taxpayer will be significantly reduced. I note that it was reported in the National Times that the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Newman, told Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> One clerk earned just under $15,000 in salary last financial year but $22,000 in overtime. A stenographer received $13,743 in salary and $19,986 in overtime. Another received $14,242 in salary and $18,696 in overtime. </PARA>
<PARA>Now that is one aspect of concern, although there are other aspects of concern about the transfer of work that was previously done by the Department and which is now being handed over to private surveyors. After receiving approval of the Minister in attendance, Senator Guilfoyle, Mr MacDonald made this admission:</PARA>
<PARA> If you use more private surveyors, an increase in the cost will result. I do not have a precise costing. I cannot say what would be the cost for a particular job to be done by a government surveyor or a private surveyor, so I cannot tell you whether in any individual circumstance one would be cheaper or more expensive than the other. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a very strange set of circumstances with which we are faced. There has been a great dislocation of staff and many former government employees have suffered. As a result, I have had to interview three separate deputations and address three meetings on the front lawns of Parliament House concerning changes that have been effected as a result of the Government's decisions to transfer projects to the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of days after the Senate Estimates Committee reviewed the estimates of the Department of Administrative Services Alex Moss, the Executive Director of the Professional Officers Association, made a statement. Whilst conservative politicians will argue that they have a vested interest in this matter, I do not think that necessarily their views should be put aside. Just because a person has an interest does not mean that he is not entitled or able to be objective in his observations. Mr Moss raised a number of questions. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> But it becomes a matter of great concern if the reviews are simply and blindly aimed at reducing expenditure regardless of the overall effect such reductions may have on the well-being of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact some evidence is available which reveals that the cutbacks in government expenditure, under the guise of increasing Public Service efficiency, are costing more than it was suggested would be saved. The Committee is entitled to have precise information to assure us that transfers will increase the efficiency of the Department, that the staff will not be disadvantaged and that, in fact, there will be substantial savings to the taxpayers. Yet we have no information about what the private contractors system will mean in terms of savings arising out of the razor gang's recommendations. Despite the assurances given by the Minister we have abundant evidence to suggest that public employees are being displaced without any guarantee of definite employment by private contractors. I do not want to misquote Mr MacDonald, but he said that whilst the Department was able to carry out its role satisfactorily it was in a very tight situation and would have to reduce staff levels even further. He hoped that this could be done without retrenchments. </PARA>
<PARA> I think in recent times we have had some evidence of the tremendous effect reduced staff levels have had upon collecting tax revenue in another department where staff ceilings have been applied per se without any understanding of the various responsibilities of the department. It does not necessarily follow that the public interest is protected. We have raised these matters consistently in the Senate and in the Estimates committees but we have not yet been given a satisfactory answer. I am sure there are misgivings about the absolute way in which the Government's philosophical position is being applied. The answers that have been given to us and the evidence that has subsequently become available show that transferring functions from the public sector to private consultants in a whole variety of ways does not necessarily result in a cost saving from the point of view of the department or the public generally. I do not know whether the Minister or her departmental officers are now in a better position to give us more precise information. It is now some six weeks since we first raised the matter, but so far we have been able to get only partial answers. I am not in any way criticising the officers concerned because they were not able to provide the sort of information required. But we ought to be provided with such information because we are dealing with the careers of a large number of people; we are dealing with a change in administrative functions and we are dealing with public funds in a rather cavalier fashion. I think we are entitled to more information than has been given to us to date. </PARA>

Before dealing with them, may I put information on the record which related to our previous discussion on this Department. On 27 October, in the course of the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1981-82, Senator Evans raised the question of the number of cleaning and watching staff employed in the Department of Administrative Services who were affected by the Government's decision that cleaning and watching of Commonwealth properties be undertaken by the private sector. I now have a table of the staff engaged in that function, their location and whether they are employed on a part time or full time basis.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Senator Mulvihill raised the matter of citizenship and the number of police engaged in that function from the Australian Federal Police. The information I have is that there are four Australian Federal Police officers engaged full time in processing citizenship applications. The present time lag in dealing with this matter is about two months and the Australian Federal Police is endeavouring to reduce this time lag. The officers who are working full time in this area hope that the time lag may be reduced. It certainly is a matter of considerable interest and urgency and I note Senator Mulvihill's continued interest in it. I will advise the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) again of the honourable senator's concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Walsh raised a number of questions on the last occasion that we were dealing with this matter. Specific questions were raised by him and I have answers to those questions. The first question was: Who made the arrangements for appointing an additional staff member at Ministerial Officer, Grade 1 level to Senator Harradine's staff? The response to that question is that a position of Assistant Private Secretary was granted to Senator Harradine in 1976. The decision was conveyed to him by the then Minister for Administrative Services on 2 July 1976. The position was reclassified to Ministerial Officer, Grade 1 following a request from Senator Harradine. This decision was made by the Government and conveyed to Senator Harradine by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on 25 February 1981. Another question concerned the level of the position approved for Senator Townley and what travel rights were attached to that position. On 15 August 1974 Prime Minister Whitlam wrote to Senator Townley and said:</PARA>
<PARA> I confirm that you may have secretarial assistance during the coming Sessional period. The position will be located in Canberra and will be at a salary level of $8058 to $8537 per annum with provision for overtime payments where appropriate, with the actual salary rate payable to the person you wish to appoint being dependent upon that person's experience and qualifications. There would be no entitlement for travel. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot agree to the same assistance being provided for you as for Senator Steele Hall, since the Senate has recognised him as the leader of a party. I acknowledge, however, that as a senator who does not belong to a party you are entitled to assistance in dealing with the additional amount of legislation which is being brought before the Senate since you were first elected to it. </PARA>
<PARA>The salary quoted in Prime Minister Whitlam's letter was for the position of Assistant Private Secretary. A further question was asked by Senator Walsh which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Did Senator Carrick authorise or take any part in the decision authorising this additional staff member for Senator Harradine?</PARA>
<PARA>That was for the Ministerial Officer Grade 1. The response to that question is:</PARA>
<PARA> Decision to provide Senator Harradine with a Ministerial Officer Grade 1 position was taken by the Government and communicated to Senator Harradine by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>Another question was:</PARA>
<PARA> Was Senator the Hon. Dame Margaret Guilfoyle correct when she advised Senate Estimates Committee C on 21 September 1981 that Prime Minister Whitlam had approved in August 1974 the provision of an assistant private secretary position for Senator Townley, then an independent Senator?</PARA>
<PARA>The response to that question is:</PARA>
<PARA> Yes. The classification of the position was not specifically mentioned in the Prime Minister's letter but the salary quoted namely, $8,058-$8,537 was at the Assistant Private Secretary level. </PARA>
<PARA>Those were the questions raised at that time and those are the responses that I have. Senator Coates has today raised a matter with regard to the use of cars by the Minister for Administrative Services. I have some information on that matter. The Minister for Administrative Services does hire a Commonwealth self-drive vehicle which is based in Launceston. This arrangement commenced in August 1981. This vehicle is hired on a permanent basis from the self-drive fleet of the Department of Administrative Services and is a compact and modest four-cylinder sedan. The hiring charge is $40 a week including fuel and oil. Larger cars at more expensive hire rates would have been available from the Department's self-drive fleet. </PARA>
<PARA> A Minister is entitled among other things to the unrestricted permanent allocation of a car and driver for himself and his wife in his State of residence. Most Ministers have ready access to a Commonwealth car with driver or a hire car of similar standard in their home States. However, there are no Commonwealth chauffeur-driven cars currently stationed in Launceston and departmental investigations have shown that it would be expensive to arrange for a Commonwealth car and its driver to be moved there either permanently or for temporary periods from Hobart. In certain circumstances the Minister is obliged to use taxis in Launceston with the occasional use of a Commonwealth car with driver from Hobart. The cost of this mode of operation in Tasmania during 1980-81 was some $10,200. This compares with car hire charges incurred by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) in their States of residence of some $41,000 and $21,000 respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the circumstances in Launceston it was felt that the use of a Commonwealth self-drive vehicle on a permanent hire basis would provide a more cost effective answer to the Minister's needs as a Minister. The permanent hire cost for the compact sedan of $40 a week compares favourably with the hire charges of $16 a day or $80 a week which would apply if the car were hired on a temporary basis only. This permament hire charge compares with a hire rate for a Commonwealth car with driver of $19.10 per hour plus travelling allowance for the driver where overnight stays away from Hobart are involved. The hire rate also compares favourably with hire or rental charges made by private firms. It is correct that the Minister's hired self-drive vehicle carries Tasmanian, not Commonwealth, registration plates. This was arranged for security reasons. The Minister has received a number of threatening phone calls and has been subject to other incidents in Launceston.</PARA>
<PARA> A comment was made by Senator Macklin with regard to his feeling that he would prefer to exercise choice and priorities in the conditions and facilities that are offered to him as a senator. I will draw the Minister's attention to those comments and to the comments also of Senator Robert Ray who is experiencing difficulties in having his office accommodation settled. With regard to the matter raised by Senator Gietzelt, I have no specific information. After all, we have no specific incident which we are trying to compare. If we had a particular contract in which we might be looking at a particular service that is to be provided perhaps there could be some comparison made. But the whole of the function of the Review of Commonwealth Functions Committee was to look at those areas where it may be appropriate for the Commonwealth Government to move away from the monopoly service or the service that may be given and perhaps to share that with the private sector. In some instances this will be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> As was stated yesterday in the Senate it is expected that the Review Committee's decisions will result in some 16,000 fewer Commonwealth staff being employed and that over a period, as is reflected in the Budget, savings in excess of the expected $560m saving will be effected. The concern of Senator Gietzelt with regard to the effects of change on the Commonwealth employees involved is recognised. Where a total function is to be sold or disposed of to private concerns one of the matters for negotiation is the staffing involved in the transfer, but these are matters of precise detail relating to particular instances and I am not able to state in a generalised way the effect of any of the particular decisions unless it is possible to make a comparison at a particular time concerning a particular function. Having provided those additional items of information I now commend the votes to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a few remarks to make concerning the estimates for the Department of Administrative Services because the answers to questions which I asked during the Estimates hearings have now been provided and are not quite to my liking. First, I would like to comment on the remarks made by Senator Macklin and Senator Robert Ray in regard to office accommodation. Although I have never had any personal problems with officers in the Department of Administrative Services I wish to draw attention to a problem which does exist. It is not the fault of the officers but of the penny-pinching practices of this Government. In Murray Bridge, South Australia, a new Commonwealth office complex is being constructed to house branches of the Commonwealth Electoral Office, the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service. Although the sign on the board outside describes the latter as a job centre, I do not know how that term can be used because the service cannot find jobs for most people; there are simply none to be had. The complex is also to contain an office for myself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have had complaints from a couple of the people who will be staffing the other offices that no provision has been made for a rainwater tank for the complex. Hundreds of thousands of dollars are being spent, yet the Government cannot find the money to install a rainwater tank. I ask the officers present, through the Minister, whether provision could be made for such installation. The complex is still under construction. Why cannot some $2,000 or $3,000 be found for a rainwater tank and the necessary connections to the kitchen which services those four offices?</PARA>
<PARA> During the Estimates hearings I asked the representatives of the Department of Administrative Services whether the Government had paid compensation to property owners for the installation of a telephone in a holiday house in Gippsland for Mr Nixon. My question was as to whether any land had been acquired to enable the telephone service to be run in. The answer given was:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Administrative Services has no record of any such acquisition of an easement for a telephone line on behalf of either the Department of Primary Industry or Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA>Is it the sole responsibility of the Department of Administrative Services to purchase land or property for all Government requirements, or may land be purchased, or an agreement entered into, for an easement by some other department?</PARA>
<PARA> The other matter that I wish to raise concerns the vote for the Commonwealth Electoral Office. At an earlier stage I asked a question about the amount of money that must be deposited by candidates seeking office in the Federal Parliament. I was very surprised at the answer I have received and believe that remedial measures should be taken in regard to the matter. The response I received was that in 1965 the deposits required of House of Representatives candidates were increased from $50 to $100, and the deposit for candidates to the Senate were increased from $50 to $200. I was told that the current House of Representatives deposit of $100 represented in 1965, when first introduced, approximately 176 per cent of average weekly earnings but now represents approximately 35 per cent of average weekly earnings. The current deposit for Senate candidates, which is $200, represented approximately 352 per cent of average weekly earnings when introduced but now represents only approximately 70 per cent of average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> One can quite easily understand that whenever a Federal election is conducted many bodgie candidates register their names because of the small amount of money they have to lodge as a deposit. It is high time that the Government gave earnest consideration to raising that deposit. I suggest that the deposit for contesting a House of Representatives seat-nobody should be standing for election unless he thinks he has some chance of winning it-ought to be $500 and that the deposit required from anyone who stands for the Senate ought to be at least $1,000. We know that we run into problems created by honourable senators opposite who encourage a multitude of candidates to nominate for the Senate in particular. In a Federal election some years ago we had about 75 Senate candidates in New South Wales. The informal vote was enormous. The polling booths are not big enough and they are ill lit. I have spoken about this before and there has been some improvement. I am not blaming the electoral officers; it is the Government that is to blame. It does not provide enough money to light these halls properly. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem as I see it-many other people have complained about this matter-is that people are unable to cast a formal vote because the ballot paper will not even fit across the platform or desk that is provided in the cubicle. People have to fold it over. People are asked to vote by numbering candidates from one to 75. I suggest that many honourable senators opposite would not be able to number candidates from one to 75 without making a mistake. I could name a few of them. That matter ought to be rectified. The deposit payable by Senate candidates ought to be at least $1,000. We know that many people take advantage of the present system. We know that a candidate is allowed certain election expenditures as taxation deductions even if that person does not spend a penny as a candidate. That person can legitimately claim under the law a certain taxation deduction. </PARA>

I hope that the Government will take that matter on board and do something about it. I do not expect to receive an answer to that matter at present; I will pursue it at some time in the future before I leave this place. But I would like to receive an answer to the first question I posed-that is, whether the Department of Administrative Services has the sole responsibility for purchasing or acquiring land for use by all Government departments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer again to the matter I raised a few minutes ago. I find the response of the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) to my allegations about the car driven by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) to be quite unsatisfactory. As I said in my earlier remarks, of course the Government would justify the arrangement for Mr Newman to have a car from the Commonwealth pool which he drove himself, on the basis of the difference in cost. But the Minister slid very quickly over my argument when I asked why, even if that were so, the car had to have plain Tasmanian State number plates instead of the identifying 'Z' number plates. I assert that that is an excuse and not a reason.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suggest that having plain plates in no way adds to the protection of the Minister. If he uses plain plates following security advice, which apparently is supposed to be the case, how does the Government justify the rest of its Ministry driving in cars with 'Z' plates, if that is the means by which people are identified? All members of parliament receive threats of all sorts and, of course, people are identifiable by their personal appearance as well as by the appearance of their car. The fact that their car may have 'Z' plates is a minor factor in my view. I ask the Minister for Finance to table, if she can, the security advice about this matter to enable us to ascertain whether the matter was given the proper considerations which she suggested was the case. I also asked earlier whether Mr Newman was the only Minister with such a car or whether other Ministers were provided with cars in this way. I now ask: If there are others, how many have had the 'Z' plates changed in order to camouflage their use of Commonwealth facilities?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal first with Senator McLaren's questions. The first related to a water tank at offices in Murray Bridge. The Department of Administrative Services will refer the comments to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman). The suggestions have been noted and will certainly be examined. With regard to the second matter, the acquisition of land or an easement for the installation of a telephone, the Department of Administrative Services is the department that handles all acquisition proposals for the Commonwealth Government. I have noted the other matter that was raised by Senator McLaren, with regard to the size of the deposit that is required for candidates for election. Some people share the view of Senator McLaren that the application fee has not risen commensurate with changes in values. Perhaps that is something that should be investigated. I will draw it to the attention of the Minister. It is a suggestion that could be considered, perhaps with more emphasis, in the reviews of electoral legislation which are always continuing. It is perhaps something on which there would be differing views. There would be those who would feel that a higher deposit would penalise independent candidates who may have, under our democratic system, every right to present themselves as candidates for election. However, there would be differing views and it is something that should be considered. I have noted the views expressed by Senator McLaren.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Coates again raised the question of the car that has been provided in Tasmania for the Minister for Administrative Services. I have no further information on this matter. As I said to Senator Coates, the change of registration plates was arranged for security reasons. That is the answer that has been given by the Minister. I accept that as his reason. I have no security report to table on his behalf on this matter. I think that what has been shown in the response that I have given is that what has been undertaken involves a much lower cost than otherwise would have been necessary, given that there is no service in Launceston that is of a resident nature that could supply unlimited use of a car, as is usual, for all Commonwealth Ministers, leaders of the Opposition and some other people who are office holders in the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a couple of points I would like to raise that arise from the discussion here recently of the methods of conducting elections. A point Senator McLaren touched on that has been brought to me by many constituents is the appalling degree to which polling places are not lighted. In other words, people have to take themselves into a dark little screened area and attempt to decipher what is on a ballot paper. I would have thought that in this modern age it would have been a comparatively simple matter to provide some form of portable lighting so that people who are voting can see what they are doing when they undertake that most important duty. I put that forward as a suggestion to the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle). We should not expect our voters to vote in almost complete darkness. In fact, I have seen polling places where that was the case on a dull day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point I raise with the Minister has been mentioned to me by a large number of constituents also. Why does the Commonwealth Electoral Office persist in a system of finding somewhere the most ancient, the hardest, pencils-pencils which write illegibly-to provide in polling booths when these days modern ball point pens are just as cheap as pencils and could be provided with equal facility? If ball point pens were provided the voters would not have to exert extreme force to try to make a mark on the ballot papers that the people counting the votes and the scrutineers can see later. </PARA>

<PARA> The third point concerns Senator McLaren's view on deposits. Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, I suggest to Senator McLaren, the Minister and honourable senators, that to the people who want to subvert the electoral system by increasing the number of Senate votes it will not make much difference whether the deposit is $200 or $1,000. Those sorts of people can get hold of the money they want and they will go on doing so. There is another possible solution to the problem and I commend it for consideration; that is, that persons standing for the Senate should be required to have a greater number of nominees listed on their application form. In other words, there should be at least, say, six names from every electorate in the State so that a candidate can be shown to have a substantial degree of support. I would have thought that that would be a better method, if it could be adopted, than increasing the amount of the deposit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief in my remarks. I raise the problems of accommodation for senators and members of the House of Representatives within the metropolitan area of Brisbane. At the Commonwealth Parliament Offices in Brisbane the secretary is housed with the senator or member concerned and the research officer is housed separately. Some offices are larger than others, and it seems to me that too little space is available on the twelfth floor for the group of parliamentarians within the Brisbane metropolitan area. Although the officers of the Department of Administrative Services do a very good job in allocating space and certainly do the best they can with the services they provide to members and senators, it is virtually impossible to have adequate space available in offices to house the member or senator, the secretary and the research assistant within the one area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Partitions are not available and the offices are separate. We have some members of parliament in one corner of the building and their research assistants in another corner, which in some ways makes it very inconvenient for the members or senators and the staff members concerned. During the short time I have spent in the metropolitan offices it has been suggested that the Department of Administrative Services plans to increase the size and number of the offices made available to members and senators by reducing the number of offices on the twelfth floor and transferring offices to the thirteenth floor. From time to time I hear that that is right and then I hear that it is wrong. I ask the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) whether the Department intends to make those sorts of extensions and, if so, how long does the Minister envisage it will take to carry out extensions to create the sort of space that should be available to the members and senators in the area?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I wish to deal with the matters raised by Senator Mason. The matters will be referred to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) for consideration by the Australian Electoral Office. The sheer logistics of an election in Australia are enormous. On many occasions, community halls and other places have been used for a number of years. In some cases, there may be alternatives; in other cases, there are not. I note the comments of the honourable senator with regard to adequate lighting and other facilities. We will certainly refer his comments and impressions to the Electoral Office. Equally, the other matter concerning deposits will be referred. With regard to Senator Jones and his difficulties in Queensland, I am told that it is expected that the extensions will be proceeded with within this financial year. That is all the hope that I am able to give him. I hope that work occurs as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to the matter regarding the Australian Democrats. Senator Walsh asked who made the decision to provide additional staff and, in particular, he inquired whether the Leader of the House of Representatives (Mr Sinclair) was involved. Senator Primmer asked a question on this matter also. I am informed that, on 11 July 1978, Senator Withers, as Minister for Administrative Services, wrote to Senators Chipp and Mason informing them that the Government had approved a position of assistant private secretary to be shared between them. In 1979, the Government agreed to a request that they each have a full time assistant private secretary position. This decision was conveyed to them by the then Minister for Administrative Services, Mr John McLeay, in his letter of 25 September 1979. On 4 December 1980, Senator Chipp wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) asking for additional staff with higher classifications for himself and the Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Mason). In his letter, Senator Chipp said that he had had discussions with the Leader of the House, Mr Sinclair, about the facilities needed by the Australian Democrats. He said also that he was forwarding a copy of the letter to Mr Sinclair. The Government agreed that, as from 1 July 1981, the non-electorate staff available to the Australian Democrats would be increased from two to four positions. The two additional positions were a ministerial officer, grade one, and an assistant private secretary, grade two. The decision was conveyed to Senator Chipp by the Prime Minister in a letter dated 24 February 1981. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise the matter which was the cause of the postponement of the consideration of the estimates of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

<PARA> Senator McLaren asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 10 June 1981:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Did the Review of Commonwealth Functions consider during its deliberations what cost savings could be achieved if Ministers were prevented from using VIP aircraft for business trips; in particular, would not great savings be made by banning such trips as were made by the Prime Minister to Armidale for the purpose of visiting relatives and to buy a bull for his property at Nareen as was reported in the Northern Daily Leader at Tamworth on Friday, 22 May 1981, and in the ABC program PM on 21 May 1981. </PARA>

<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Carrick" NAMEID="2U4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Carrick</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Ministers use Special Purpose Aircraft, in accordance with the long-established guidelines, to enable them to carry out the duties of their office and carry out other commitments. All members of Parliament appreciate that the pressures on a Prime Minister means that he has little enough time to spend with his family. It is therefore perfectly appropriate for a Prime Minister to take the infrequent opportunities that arise during the course of official duties to pursue family obligations, and anyone with an understanding of the pressures would expect him to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> At Armidale I did spend some time with my son. The visit was not for the purpose of buying stock and no stock was bought. </PARA>
<PARA> The visit to Armidale referred to in the honourable senator's question was in fact a call at Armidale en route to Townsville on official business. It is not possible to provide meaningful information about the additional cost of a particular segment of a flight. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Functions (Statutes Review) Bill 1981 passed the Senate on the same day that the honourable senator asked his question. </PARA>
<PARA>I am at a loss to understand why the Department of Defence, which is responsible for VIP aircraft, cannot ascertain what it cost to keep that aircraft on the ground at Armidale for the period that the Prime Minister spent visiting his son. I would like that information to be provided. If I do not get the information within a reasonable time I will keep pursuing the matter until it is provided. We were told in a previous answer that it cost a certain amount of money per hour to fly and staff these aircraft. It would not be hard for the Department of Defence to look at the log to see how long that aircraft was located at the Armidale airport and to ascertain the cost to the Australian taxpayer of the Prime Minister visiting his son. I have no reason to doubt the Prime Minister's statement that he did not buy a bull. It may be that he did not bid high enough at the sales to get the bull. I will make some inquiries from stock agents in the area about this matter. The Prime Minister did not say that he did not attend a stock sale; he said he did not buy any stock. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned with the other part of the Prime Minister's very historic answer. Many of us in this Parliament have long memories. We recall the very stringent criticism, in most cases unwarrented criticism, against the previous Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, for his use of VIP aircraft. Now we have on record the present Prime Minister saying: 'All members of Parliament appreciate that the pressures on a Prime Minister means that he has little enough time to spend with his family'. However, he would not concede that that practice operated when Mr Whitlam was Prime Minister. He was very critical. Mr Whitlam, of course, did not use VIP aircraft to travel the long distances between Canberra and Nareen that the present Prime Minister does. As we know the cost of travel is now astronomically high. The cost of transporting the present Prime Minister between Canberra and his home is very much higher than was the cost of transporting the previous Prime Minister. I am sure that this very historic document will be used as a precedent by many members of parliament. This Prime Minister has now set a precedent in that he has said: 'It is therefore perfectly appropriate for a Prime Minister to take the infrequent opportunities that arise during the course of official duties to pursue family obligations'. </PARA>
<PARA> If that applies to the Prime Minister, in my view it should also apply to many back benchers who are restricted by the Remuneration Tribunal in bringing their wives and families to Canberra. We are just as much entitled as the Prime Minister to have the company of our families in Canberra. The Prime Minister has the wherewithal to transport his wife and family with him on every occasion he is away from home. He is not prevented from doing so. However, back bench members of Parliament are. I do not know whether Ministers have free travel rights for their wives and families at all times but certainly back bench members do not. Many back bench members, particularly those from Western Australia, who live a long way from Canberra, are restricted in the number of times they can bring their families here. In addition, if a member or senator from Western Australia has to travel from Perth to Kununurra or to some such place and his or her spouse uses a spouse's travel warrant, that is one less trip that that person can make to Canberra. It is all very well for the Prime Minister to plead that it is appropriate for a Prime Minister to make infrequent visits to his family. That should also apply to back bench members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Tribunal, when it looks at this document, will see that the Prime Minister has set a precedent and that it will not be long before all back bench members of parliament are treated on the same basis as the Prime Minister, bearing in mind, of course, that back bench members of parliament get a very much smaller remuneration for the work they do than the Prime Minister gets and have hardly any staff compared with what the Prime Minister has. I put that on the record. I hope that the Tribunal will take cognisance of the fact that the precedent has been set. What is good for the goose is good for the many ganders who sit on the back benches of this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I will detain the Committee for only a minute more on the same matter. I think the carping of Senator McLaren on this matter related to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is mean-spirited and is against the best interests of family contact and solidarity. I believe all members of parliament and all Ministers, when passing through a region where there is a member of their family, ought conveniently to be able to spend some hours with that family member. I believe there is not one member of the Senate who, in travelling from one State to another and when coming to an airport in transit, does not take the opportunity on occasion to meet with a sister, a brother, an uncle or a friend-to make personal contacts which would not have been possible but for the fact that they were travelling through the area on business. Even within the city I know of friends who, in the course of their business, take the opportunity once in two months if they are near their family home or near a brother or a sister to call in for a cup of tea or for lunch. Is such a mean-spirited and carping approach by a senator in this place to bring derision or criticism upon that kind of personal contact within families? I believe it is entirely appropriate for that kind of family contact to be encouraged by the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only other comment I want to make is that members of statutory bodies have the ability to travel at public expense to fulfil their duties. I refer, for example, to chairmen of statutory authorities. I believe they are denied the ability to travel with their spouses when they travel away from home, quite as often as members of parliament do, to carry out some of their quite onerous duties. I believe consideration ought to be given to allowing chairmen and some members of statutory commissions and authorities the privilege of being accompanied by their spouses during their long term absences from home. I come back to my original point. I put it to Senator McLaren that we should act fairly in the Senate and not seek to make political advantage out of the Prime Minister or any other hard-working member of the Australian community who wishes to take a short time in a very busy schedule to see a member of the family. </PARA>

He would make it a lot better for everybody concerned if he would keep quiet during a speech that is not an attack on a person but an analysis of what is happening to the finances of this country. The cost of running the BAC111s is approaching $1,700 an hour. The cost of running the Mysteres, which are smaller aircraft, is about $940 an hour. Yet those smaller aircraft, of which we have two, average only 420 hours per year. It is expected that in the coming year the BAC111s will fly 550 hours. I want to know why BAC111s are used so much rather than the less expensive Mysteres. If a Minister wants an aircraft does he decide for himself which aircraft will be used or does he use the least expensive? The speeds of them are about the same. The HS748s travel more slowly. They will average about 500 flying hours in the coming year. It has been shown over the years that the use of these expensive BAC111s has been increasing quite considerably.</PARA></TALK.START>

He did not have to suffer the almost daily unwarranted attacks by the then Opposition members on Prime Minister Whitlam for what they claimed was his unwarranted and unlawful use of VIP aircraft.

Senator Teague said that probably every member of this Parliament makes contact with a relative at some time while waiting for an aircraft at an airport. But of course that does not cost the taxpayer anything. In those cases Members of Parliament are in transit, unless Senator Teague makes special trips to visit relatives interstate. He did not tell us that. He might. He might have opened up a Pandora's box. </PARA>
<PARA> The question I posed was: How much did it cost to keep that BAC111 aircraft on the tarmac at Armidale? If I could only find out the number of hours-as I said in my earlier remarks, they would all be logged and I will be seeking this information-I would be able to ascertain the cost, using Senator Townley's figure of $1,700 an hour. I am sure that the aircraft would have been on the tarmac for at least four hours, so we will find it cost about $7,000 for the Prime Minister to visit his son in Armidale. Senator Townley posed a further question. He asked why the BAC111s are used so much. I would like to know that too. He also asked: Who decides the type of aircraft to be used? I am sure that when the Prime Minister wants a VIP aircraft he would not order one of the smaller aircraft which Senator Townley says would cost less to run and would be a lesser debt on the taxpayer. </PARA>

Of course, Senator Townley did not realise when he gave those figures that he was really putting his colleague Senator Teague in a hot spot. Now the public at large knows what it costs to run those BAC111s. As soon as we get details of the number of hours the aircraft was on the tarmac at Armidale we will know what it cost on that day. We might search for the cost on other days. Back benchers cannot do what Mr Fraser did. If we are going through Tullamarine we can telephone a relative or a friend and say: 'I will be in Tullamarine for an hour waiting for a change of aircraft. Can you hop in a car and come and see me?'. That is only peanuts. It costs nothing because we are waiting for the change of an aircraft. In this instance there was a special purpose for the Prime Minister's trip to Armidale. It was, as he said, to visit his son.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think members of the public at large who are listening today will be interested to know that it was, in fact, Mr Fraser who first started this witch hunt against the use of VIP aircraft by Prime Minister Whitlam. It has rebounded very much on him. The figures that have now been revealed to us-my colleague Senator Sibraa will be seeking some further figures later when we are considering another group of votes and those figures will be very revealing if they are made available-show that we have the most expensive Prime Minister, because of the cost of his own desires, this country has ever had.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been provoked by Senator Teague to make a couple of brief comments on the same subject. I am very touched by Senator Teague's concern for family contact, as evidenced by his agreement with the use by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)-completely at the taxpayers' expense, of course-of a VIP aircraft to VIP-off to Armidale overnight to see his son. I would be more touched if we had not heard so much cant and humbug in 1975 from the same Prime Minister about alleged extravagance by the former Prime Minister in a personal way through the use of VIP aircraft and so on. I would be much more touched by Senator Teague's concern for the contact within the Fraser family if the head of the Fraser family had not poured out so much cant and humbug when he was trying to denigrate someone else who was doing less of that sort of thing than he has done since.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also be more touched if the Prime Minister showed more concern for the welfare of other families-for example, if he showed a bit more concern for what subsistence on unemployment benefit for long periods does to family stability. I see little evidence of the Prime Minister or Senator Teague, for that matter, showing any concern for that. On the other hand, I see a great deal of evidence of the party they both represent trying to denigrate and vilify as dole bludgers those people who are placed in that unfortunate situation. No Prime Minister, as Senator McLaren has said, has indulged himself more in a personal way at the taxpayers' expense than Mr Fraser. It does not stop with him directly. We had his wife and her relatives bludging on the taxpayers with 4 1/2 per cent loans obtained under sordid circumstances from the Victorian Government-but it was ultimately Commonwealth money-a couple of years ago. I say that far from Senator Teague having any valid reason for complaint, both the historical record and the present practice show that it is high time the taxpayers of Australia got the Fraser clan off their backs. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EJ4">Senator SIBRAA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased that Senator Townley raised the issue of the VIP planes and their costs. He asked: Where is the estimate for the running of the larger planes in the VIP fleet? These are included in the Department of Defence estimate. During the examination of the Estimates committees when we were dealing with Appropriation Bill (No. 1) in September 1980 I raised the question of the cost of running the VIP 707 aircraft. Thanks to previous work done by Estimates committees and honourable senators, such as Senator McLaren, the costs are now summarised under one item in the Department of Defence estimate although we were originally told, over a number of years, that it was not possible for this to be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In last year's appropriations the Department of Defence said that the cost each hour of operating the 707s for VIP use was $2,757. On my estimate, after examining the operating costs, I calculated that these aircraft were costing $4,189 an hour. An article concerning the then United States President, Jimmy Carter, pointed out that the President would not be flying the Boeing 707 during the presidential campaign because it was costing in excess of $4,600 an hour. I contacted a commercial firm called Clarkair International (Australasia) Pty Ltd. It said that the cost of hiring a 707 aircraft would be approximately $6,000 an hour. That was 12 months ago. This year the Estimates Committee was told that the agreed rate of charge for hiring the 707 for VIP purposes was $3,633 an hour. That was an increase of $900 an hour on last year. What I and the Committee members want to know is how this sum is calculated. If the calculations that I put forward in 1980 are correct-nobody said they were not correct-then this year's operating cost should at least be $5,000 an hour. As I said, if it was costing $4,600 an hour to run the United States presidential jet over 18 months ago perhaps the figure of $5,000 an hour is closer to the mark and not the figure that the Department of Defence gave of $3,633. </PARA>
<PARA> In this item an amount of $216,000 was given for the cost of overseas training. An amount of $66,000 was for simulator training and $150,000 for travel expenses. When we made an examination of these figures we found that crews for the 707s have to go to Hong Kong to train. The reason they go to Hong Kong is that there are no 707 simulators in Australia. When we asked why, it became fairly obvious that as Qantas Airways Ltd does not fly 707s any longer it does not need a simulator in Australia. I think that Air Nuigini is the only commercial firm that flies a 707 into Australia even though some charter operators come in. Therefore, if our crews have to do their regular training they go to Hong Kong at a cost of $216,000 per annum. When the pilots are fully trained to fly the VIPs we have a catch-22 situation because then they are entitled to fly a commercial 707 aircraft. Therefore we can lose the crews to commercial airlines around the world which still fly 707s. There are quite a number of such airlines in Africa, South America, the Middle East and on the Indian subcontinent. It is interesting to note that in fact one of the full crews of a 707 has gone already. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we should question the need for having these planes in the VIP fleet. Last year the cost of running the 707s alone amounted to $9,408,000. I am not querying the need to have a VIP fleet, but surely, if the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, can go from Australia and tour the countries of the Middle East in a BAC111-a smaller plane-the larger 707s are not needed. </PARA>
<PARA> Another situation which ought to be looked at relates to the number of emerging smaller nations of the South Pacific which are of crucial interest to Australia at the moment. The South Pacific is one of the areas where the use of a VIP aircraft is, in my opinion, justified due to the very poor commercial air links throughout the area. We are faced with the situation where a 707 is too large to land at the majority of the airports in these countries and a smaller aeroplane would be much more suitable. Australia is pouring a lot of aid into Vanuatu but the largest aeroplane Vanuatu can take at the moment is the DC9. Vanuatu wants 727s to fly there. Air Vanuatu flights from Australia are booked out completely at the moment. The larger planes cannot land there as the runway is not long enough. Some of the smaller executive-type jets would be much more practical and economical. After all, as I pointed out, if it is too expensive for the President of the United States to use a Boeing 707 it surely should be too expensive for the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) of Australia to keep two of them operating at a cost of over $9m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> It will probably be said that some of the leaders attending the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne arrived in their own private 707s or DC8s: Nigeria and Canada are two of the countries that come to mind. However, the vast number of leaders of countries who came to CHOGM, including more populous, wealthier and important countries than Australia, arrived in chartered aircraft from their own national airlines. The Estimates over the last three or four years show that we are still spending in excess of $1m per annum in chartering aircraft from Qantas Airways Ltd. If there are occasions when the smaller aircraft, such as the BAC111 that Senator Townley referred to, are not suitable then I believe a case can be made out for charter arrangements to be made from either Trans Australia Airlines, Ansett Airlines of Australia or Qantas. After all, it was Prime Minister Fraser who in 1976 said:</PARA>
<PARA> On my own visits overseas, commercial aircraft will be used as far as possible; the argument that Qantas cannot provide adequate security is a specious argument and false. </PARA>
<PARA>These aircraft are out of date, old fashioned and gas guzzlers. They are being pensioned off by all of the commercial airlines of the world but are costing the Australian taxpayer $9.408m per annum just for the prestige purposes of this Prime Minister. Of course the Australian Labor Party, when it comes to power after the next election, will sell them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank you, Madam Temporary Chairman. I, as Chairman of Estimates Committee D, which has reviewed the estimates for the departments of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Foreign Affairs and Defence-which also includes the Australian Development Assistance Bureau-would briefly wish to touch upon the report of the Committee. I take the opportunity, too, of thanking the officers of the Senate who assisted the Committee. They worked most diligently and over very long hours. The work they did was very good. At the same time I would like to see that the work of committees is kept going with some continuity so that there is no lapse between the various phases of the hearings. This applies particularly to Estimates Committee D.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to the presentation of information in the report. I would like it to be noted that often the costs associated with a particular program are spread over a number of items within one department or over a number of departments. Where this occurs, it would assist Estimates committees if the explanatory notes of the department involved, or of the major department if several departments are involved, were to include a compilation or consolidation of all the costs related to that program. As it is now, it is very costly in terms of the time it takes to gather the facts from all the departments so as to bring about a true picture of the situation. I think this has been touched on before today. I suggest this could be done with some liaison between the departments or at least the committee secretaries. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to civil defence which also is dealt with in the Committee's report on the estimates for the Department of Defence. The Committee considers that it might be timely for a Senate committee to examine Australia's civil defence preparedness in the event of a nuclear attack. Evidence presented to the Committee indicated that the planning for such an eventuality at the national level was inadequate. The Committee has not made a specific recommendation but it notes that a proposal to establish a select committee to inquire into all aspects of the civil defence program against nuclear attack is currently on the Notice Paper as General Business, Order of the Day No. 143. I do not believe it would be feasible at the moment to have a select committee look into this aspect of the work of the Natural Disasters Organisation because at the moment the Senate is very much overloaded with committee inquiries. In view of the present number of select committees I do not think it is feasible for the Senate to be able to staff any more of them. At the same time I believe that honourable senators are already almost overburdened in their duties in respect of the various committees presently operating. Nevertheless, I believe that as soon as possible consideration could be given to a reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to be an alarmist on this aspect that the Committee has referred to but it is noted that on the evidence regarding the Natural Disasters Organisation it appears that not one person out of the 61 people employed in the Organisation was employed specifically to plan for defence against nuclear attack. I do not think we need to be alarmed but we should be realists. These days sufficient planning should be taking place to ensure that at some time in the future there will be a preparedness for nuclear attack. It may be that the Natural Disasters Organisation has taken some action. All I can say is that from the evidence that was presented to the Committee such action is not apparent. It would appear that in the interests of the country there should be an inquiry into this aspect to see just what is the situation in regard to the Natural Disasters Organisation. The name of the Natural Disasters Organisation implies that it is more concerned with natural disasters such as cyclone Tracy, an aeroplane crash or a train derailment which may involve a considerable loss of life. It seems rather odd that we speak of civil defence and preparedness for a nuclear attack being the responsiblity of the Natural Disasters Organisation. Nevertheless, I do not think very many other authorities would be responsible to oversee operations following the various disasters that could occur in Australia. I would not like to see any procrastination on this subject. So I suggest that in time further evidence should be taken from the Natural Disasters Organisation to ascertain whether it is up to date and is sufficiently prepared to cope with a nuclear attack or a disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point I wish to raise relates to late answers provided to Senate Estimates Committee D. The Committee has expressed concern at a trend towards increasing reliance by departments on written answers being supplied subsequent to Estimate committee hearings, thus in practice avoiding follow up questions because of the short time left before the committees are required to report. The situation is made worse if such answers arrive late. The Committee urges that where a department undertakes to provide written answers it should do so promptly. Perhaps for some reason or other which escapes the Committee there has been time restriction on the departments after the hearings. I think it should be noted that late answers appear to be getting more common. I suggest that the departments improve their performance and liaison in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to take up too much time of the Committee but one other point to which I want to refer is that relating to the use and costs of the Boeing 707s. This matter has come up over the years, particularly at the hearings of the various Estimates committees. As Chairman of Estimates Committee D, I asked a question of the Department of Defence in regard to the use of the VIP Boeing 707s. The reply has been received by the Committee and has been incorporated in Hansard. I refer people who are interested in the number of hours that those 707s are used to that evidence. In 1978-79 the hours flown by the Boeing 707 aircraft were: VIP use, nil; national commitment, 33 hours; defence tasks, nine hours; training, 367 hours and squadron support, five hours. The hours flown in 1978-79 totalled 414 hours. Hours flown in 1979-80 were: VIP use, 429 hours; national commitment, 55 hours; defence tasks, 555 hours; training, 245 hours; squadron support, 12 hours-and total hours flown, 1,296. Hours flown in 1980-81 were: VIP purposes, 142 hours; national commitment, 34 hours; defence tasks, 844 hours; training, 544 hours; squadron support, 24 hours-total hours flown, 1,588. </PARA>
<PARA> Total hours flown for the specific purposes previously mentioned for the period 1978-79 to 1980-81 were: VIP purposes, 571 hours, which amounted to 17.3 per cent of the time; national commitment, 122 hours or 3.7 per cent; defence tasks, 1,408 hours or 42.7 per cent; training, 1,156 hours or 35.1 per cent; and squadron support, 41 hours or 1.2 per cent-totalling 100 per cent. It is interesting to note too that in the figures for the national commitment tasks that in the period June to December 1979 there were five refugee flights totalling 88 hours. These flights were, of course, the flights that brought refugees from South East Asia to Australia. There was one flight, Singapore to Melbourne, one flight Singapore to Sydney, one flight Singapore to Brisbane and Sydney, one flight Jakarta to Sydney and one flight Hong Kong to Melbourne and Sydney. In January 1981 there was one task of a flight of 34 hours for the purpose of taking Australian teachers to Zimbabwe. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is evidence that was given to Estimates Committee D as to the flying hours. This information has been incorporated. As there has been so much talk about the Boeing 707s I merely indicate that the hours used for VIP flights are a very small percentage when compared with the overall use of the aircraft.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to evidence that has been given in regard to surveillance services in Australia. This is an indication of how questions can be spread over the broad face of Estimates committees. The responsibility for coastal surveillance is shared by the Department of Primary Industry, the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, the Department of Defence, the Department of Health, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Administrative Services, the Department of Finance, the Australian Federal Police, et cetera. I believe that the matter of surveillance is now under review, and it is very difficult to get a comprehensive picture of what surveillance is all about in the northern part of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the review that is taking place in regard to surveillance will bring about a situation where one department is in charge of surveillance in Australia. There is not sufficient responsibility accepted within any one department as so many departments share the responsibility. One can well imagine, knowing the amount of surveillance that has to be undertaken on the northern coast, that perhaps the Department of Defence should have that responsibility. At the moment-perhaps for very good reasons-it is the responsibility of the Department of Transport. However, I make the point that as the surveillance area comes under Estimates Committee D, I look forward to the result of the review of northern surveillance being made public and tabled in the Senate for discussion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to pursue the matter that was raised by my colleague Senator Sibraa and to quote from the VIP manifest from the Department of Defence which is tabled periodically in this Parliament. Earlier today one of the Government senators, Senator Townley, acquainted us with the fact that it costs $1,700 an hour to operate a BAC111, and he asked why BAC111s are used so much. Of course, I concur with his view that smaller aircraft could be used. If honourable senators look at page 91 of the manifest, the Schedule of Special Flights by the Royal Australian Air Force for the period 1 January 1981 to 30 June 1981, I shall deal with the flight I mentioned when we were debating the estimates for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. If we look at the flight that landed at Armidale we see that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) used a BAC111 from 20 May to 22 May to fly from Canberra to Armidale, Amberley, Townsville and Essendon, and then back to Canberra. I notice that there were only five passengers on that BAC111 flight from Canberra to Armidale. What Senator Townley had to say has a lot of substance. Why did the Prime Minister need a BAC111 aircraft for five people-himself, Constable Taplin, Miss Murray, Inspector Howard and Dr Rosalky-to go to Armidale? That fact is borne out in this document.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a long history to the tabling of this VIP manifest. Long before I became a member of this Parliament there was quite a row in the Senate in connection with this matter. A person by the name of Senator Gorton first tabled this manifest, after a lot of persuasion from the then Opposition, because people wanted to know who was using VIP aircraft. Of course, this document is a little lacking in the information which ought to be provided. Now that we know that it costs $1,700 an hour to fly a BAC111, I suggest to the Department of Defence that in future, when this document is tabled and we get a list of the VIP flights, we be told for how many hours aircraft were engaged in particular flights. Alongside the passenger manifest, we ought to be told what it cost per hour to run those flights and for what purpose the aircraft were used, whether they be BAC111s or Mysteres. I know that some VIP aircraft are used to transport Senate standing committees around the country, and perhaps Senate select committees although I am not aware of that. That should be shown in these manifests. </PARA>
<PARA> The other suggestion I wish to make, and I have raised this matter before on many occasions, is that it is very difficult when senators are discussing matters in Estimates committees or during the debate on the Appropriation Bills, to single out the actual cost to the taxpayer for any particular department. In the appropriations for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, which we dealt with a short while ago, certain costs are shown. But, buried in the appropriations for the Department of Defence is another set of costs for the same purpose, that is, flying Ministers and the Prime Minister. I have suggested before-and I suggest again-that all these costs ought to be accumulated and put before the Parliament in one paper so that we can ascertain what it costs a year for the Prime Minister, his Ministers and members of standing committees of the Senate and joint parliamentary committees to fly around this country or overseas so we are not running from one Estimates committee to another trying to define the actual cost to the taxpayer for running VIP aircraft and related costs which are charged against various departments. All these costs are split up. This is a fancy way of doing it if one wants to hide these facts from the taxpayer. It is time that something was done about the practice. If I am here when there is a change of government one of the matters that I will advocate very strongly is that those figures be put before taxpayers. The figures should not be hidden. Taxpayers ought to know what the costs are. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently some figures were given in answer to a question on notice asked by the shadow Minister for Transport about what it cost to ferry members of parliament around Canberra. In answer to a further question by me, the dissection of that cost revealed that it was not members of parliament who were running up the enormous amount of money; it was public servants. Yet newspaper articles said: 'This is what it is costing you to transport members of parliament around the ACT'. That was a blanket answer. We had to go to the trouble as some departments had to go to the trouble to dissect the figures so that we knew the actual cost to the various departments and the categories of people who are using those facilities. I put that point to this Committee and the Minister. I hope that it is taken on board so that when the next VIP manifest is tabled in this Parliament, included will be another column showing the number of hours that an aircraft was engaged on a particular duty which is listed here and what the actual cost was to the taxpayer. I think we then might be able to get through these Appropriation Bills in this Parliament much quicker. We have to go through this exercise at least twice a year. I have seen Senator Carrick just about at his wit's end because he would not or could not provide answers. However, there is a different atmosphere in this Parliament now; the numbers are different. Fortunately we are getting some answers because the Government knows that it must deliver them. If the Government provided us with this information, it would get through its business much quicker. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to Senator Kilgariff for the figures that he read into the record this afternoon. They really proved the point of the extravagance of the Boeing 707s. He pointed out the tremendous amount of time that was spent, at over $3,000 an hour, in training crews and flying these planes. I make one point very clear. If we did not have them, there would not be that cost. If aircraft are needed occasionally to fly refugees to Australia, we should hire from Qantas Airways Ltd the most efficient plane for the job. I refer to the Boeing 747s which have been used in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take up one other point. I support Senator Kilgariff, the Chairman of Senate Estimates D, who spoke on coastal surveillance and said that this matter should be under the control of the Department of Defence. Unfortunately, when I asked questions on this matter no officers from the Department of Defence were able to give me the answers that I wanted. They said that I should see the Department of Transport. As Senator Kilgariff pointed out, a number of departments share responsibility for coastal surveillance. It is rather ludicrous when one looks at the number of them-the Department of Primary Industry, the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, the Department of Defence, the Department of Health, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Administrative Services and the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the issues that concerned me in this whole matter of coastal surveillance was whether civilians who seek work with these civilian firms, the private air charter firms which operate coastal surveillance, were subject to government security checks or government screening in any way. I think the answer to that question is no. The other thing which worried me was whether it would be possible for a person with connections with drug traffickers to be employed by these private firms. I believe that the answer to that question is yes. I think it would be much better if the Department of Defence were to carry out our coastal surveillance, then all of the personnel would have to undergo some government screening or check on their past. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence was in Darwin about last Easter an Indonesian fishing boat was located inside the legal limit. We had a rather ludicrous situation in that the Navy, for a number of reasons, was not able to reach the boat. The Northern Territory Police were the first people who were able to reach the fishing boat. No helicopter was available because the helicopter that is used on this work belongs to a private company and was undergoing repairs at the time. When one looks at incidents like that, it only proves that the Department of Defence or some sort of coastguard should be doing this work and not private operators. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other item in the Department of Defence appropriations that I should mention and which I did raise with the Department of Defence officers. It concerns Australian servicemen who are serving in joint United States of America facilities in Australia. I was concerned, when the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence visited these joint bases, to see that the American servicemen at Woomera and, to some extent, at North West Cape received better housing than the Australian servicemen. Specifically, most, if not all, houses occupied by the United States servicemen are air-conditioned, wheras homes occupied by Australians have only evaporators. At Woomera there are approximately 100 homes which were owned by the United States and which were handed over by the United States Air Force when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's firings were completed by the mid-1970s. Those houses are still under the control of the United States Air Force. They are better equipped than those occupied by the Australians. I think it is wrong that Australians serving in Australia with United States servicemen at joint facilities have conditions which are much worse than those of United States servicemen. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make one observation at this moment with regard to cost benefit analyses. I find that every government department has bought some computer, but not one government department can give a cost benefit analysis relating to the purchase of that computer. I asked questions last year of each of the departments which came before the Estimates committee. I did the same this year and I find that none of those departments has looked into a cost benefit analysis of the purchase of computers. It seems to me that it would be normal for a government department to do a cost benefit analysis before it purchased such expensive equipment. I ask the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) whether the Government has ever made any attempt to see that the departments undertake a cost benefit analysis before they purchase expensive computers.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want briefly to thank honourable senators for the comments and suggestions that they have made with regard to the Department of Defence and for the comment made by Senator Watson with regard to the officer from the Australian Development Assistance Bureau. The comments have been noted and the information that was given as supplementary information to the Senate Estimates committees, including that given by Senator Kilgariff relating to the matter raised by Senator Sibraa, a breakdown of flying hours, will now go on the record as additional information. Briefly, we can say that the flying hour rate is based on an assessment of aircraft flying costs such as fuel, oil, tyres, spares and contractor servicing. On the basis that the aircraft have a defence role, the rate excludes amortisation, interest on capital facilities, pay and allowances for crews and other squadron personnel and base squadron and other Royal Australian Air Force formation support. Perhaps the more general comment that could be made on the matter of the costing of the agreed rate for the special purpose flights of the Boeings is that it follows the established formula for the 34th squadron which stems from the statement to the Parliament in 1967 by the then Prime Minister, Mr Holt, indicating that special purpose flights would be costed on an extra cost basis. That rate excludes the charges of a capital nature-the sorts of things that I mentioned-and RAAF manpower salaries. I think the interest in this matter has been noted. The suggestions of Senator McLaren have been noted and will be drawn to the attention of the Minister concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One matter that was raised at the beginning with regard to late answers, I think, is something which we would want to note. I make the comment that I think an improved resource has been given to the Senate Estimates committee by every department. This has stimulated a lively interest in the Appropriation Bills which are twice a year before the Parliament for discussion. As a general rule departments ensure that a wide cross-section of advisers is available at the Estimates committee hearings with a view to answering as many questions as possible. I think it is fair to say that the departments prefer to minimise the follow-up work that they have to do. They try to provide a very frank exchange of information at the time of the hearings of the Senate Estimates committees. The need of the committees for information to be provided promptly is appreciated. The Department of Finance will make special reference to this matter when making contact with departments prior to the next round of the Senate Estimates committee hearings. Emphasis will be placed on the need to provide supplementary information before the conclusion of a committee's hearings, if that is possible. The interest of the Senate has been a very salutary lesson to many departments in the preparation of their estimates, and, indeed, in the preparation of a great deal of their work and things of that kind. There is support for what has been suggested with regard to the provision of that information. I believe it has been a very helpful process. </PARA>
<PARA> One other matter that was mentioned by Senator Kilgariff and referred to also by Senator Sibraa related, I think, to civil defence. That matter is noted also. The comments are useful ones. I think that proper attention and consideration can be given to them. Senator McIntosh raised again the matter of a cost benefit analysis for computers. Without going through the whole procedure of the purchase of a computer I can say only that there is a very involved procedure throughout Public Service Departments before the purchase of a computer is undertaken. Consideration could be given at the time of the hearings of Estimates committees to whether any further cost benefit analysis could be given. In many instances, of course, computers have become the essence of public administration. I can say only that their purchase, the contractual arrangements for them and the tendering procedures applied to them are under very close surveillance throughout the Public Service. If we can provide any further information of interest I will see that that is given. With those comments I commend the estimates for this group of departments. I understand that Senator Mulvihill wishes to raise a matter on immigration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want any misconceptions to arise. I deliberately refrained from speaking because this is a topic I did not want to gate-crash. I will be dealing with defence. First of all, I want to supplement Senator Kilgariff's remarks as to the functions of Estimates committees and the effect of the backup staff that we had during the committees hearings. I give advance warning also that a motion has been circulated in my name. I will be seeking leave to move it at the end of our consideration of this group of departments. Of course it means only that we will give warning to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs that when we deal with the Supplementary Estimates we will certainly want to scrutinise much closer than usual the effect of new changes in our migrant selection scheme. We will want also to look at our refugee policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to defence. When Estimates Committee D met I used as a parallel recent disclosures by the British Admiralty on whether one or two of the decisions of World War II were right or wrong. Let me say at the outset that I am not one of those who on Sunday afternoon after a football club's performance assume the role of an expert in the light of hindsight. However, anyone who read the book by Michael Montgomery will agree that it raised a number of questions about the fate of HMAS Sydney which do not appear to have been satisfactorily answered. Following my two questions, the rather limited answers that I received, and certain statements made by the author in some Sydney newspapers, I sent him a copy of the relevant Hansard record. He replied on 3 November from his home in Middlesex, in the United Kingdom, and I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard his three-page letter, of which the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) has a copy. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SUNRIDGESOUTH HILL AVENUEHARROW-ON-THE-HILLMIDDLESEX</PARA>
<PARA>01-422 62953 November 1981 Dear Senator Mulvihill,</PARA>
<PARA> Many thanks for your kind letter of October 20th and enclosure. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence's reply to you covered only questions relating to the Sydney's actual conduct of the action itself, whereas the more serious and pertinent questions arising from my examination of the evidence all concern the Navy's handling of the episode as a whole. These may be summarised as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) It would have been impossible for the Kormoran to have surprised the Sydney as she did unless she had opened fire (with an under-water torpedo) while still flying a neutral flag. This would have been in direct contravention of International Law; were War Crimes charges on this count ever considered against Captain Detmers, and if so, why were they not pursued?</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The condition of the life-jackets and Carley floats recovered from the Sydney point very strongly to survivors from her having been shot in the water; why were no charges brought on this count, granted also the evidence that the Kormoran had twice previously fired on lifeboats in actions with the merchant ships British Union and Eurylochus?</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Carley float recovered off Christmas Island was clearly stamped MADE IN AUSTRALIA and contained a body dressed in a RAN-issue boiler suit and shoes. No other RAN ship had lost a life in action in that area up to that time; why therefore did the Director of Naval Intelligence in 1948 issue a report denying that it had come from the Sydney?</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Sydney had given her Expected Time of Arrival at Fremantle as 'PM November 20th'; why was no signal made to her to report until she was three days overdue, and that in spite of a Q ('Suspicious Ship') signal having been received at 5 p.m. on the 19th? (Vice-Admiral Sir Alan MacNicoll raised the same question in the Bulletin of August 25th). </PARA>
<PARA> (5) Why did the Naval Board not inform the Aquitania, which was following the same course three days behind, of the Sydney's absence? (The First Naval Member at the time, Vice-Admiral Sir Guy Royle, wrote that he considered that 'the Naval Board were grossly at fault' in this). </PARA>
<PARA> (6) At 10 a.m. on November 20th a party of civilians on Dirk Hartog Island reported seeing thick smoke burning out to sea; no ship was in that particular area at the time, and I conclude that it must have been caused by oil and wreckage from the Sydney and Kormoran still burning on the surface. Naval Intelligence, however, attributed it to the tug Uco, although her Deck Logbook shows that she was then 180 miles to the south; why? N.I. also gave a position for the Uco when she picked the signal on the 19th which was at least 80 miles west of any position shown in her Logbook; why?</PARA>
<PARA> (7) It is very surprising that no signals were apparently received from the Sydney either before or during the action. On examining the Master's Logbook of the lighthouse service ship Cape Otway, I found that the Official Log had been very obviously rewritten to end on November 18th-the day before the action-the next one not resuming until March 30th, 1942; did the original contain a record of signals recieived from the Sydney which were then suppressed? (There is also evidence that the Uco's Master Logbook was similarly doctored.)</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Why were the different boatloads of Kormoran survivors not kept segregated in view of a report from the Intelligence Officer concerned that the first of them to be interrogated were refusing to answer due to the influence of officers and others from another boat? (This was another question also raised by Vice-Admiral MacNicol.)</PARA>
<PARA> (9) Why did Naval Intelligence choose to adopt the account of the action eventually put together by the officers and to ignore the different evidence volunteered while the boats were still separated-in particular, the shorthand cryptograms drawn by Dr. List, the Kormoran's official war correspondent, which when deciphered made unambiguous reference to the involvement of the Japanese in the Sydney's sinking? (I produce evidence in the book that certain Naval Intelligence officers privately admitted the truth of the latter.)</PARA>
<PARA> As a non-Australian myself, I don't feel that I'm in a position to say whether these constitute sufficient grounds for opening an official enquiry. I would like to think, however, that they will lead to consideration being given to amending the account of the action in the official RAN History by which, as it stands at present, the lives of 645 of Australia's finest sons are made to seem to have been needlessly and ingloriously squandered. I would also like to suggest that the Navy exhume the body buried on Christmas Island and return it to an honoured place of burial in Australia; this would, I feel, be a particularly appropriate gesture in the fortieth anniversary year of the Sydney's loss. </PARA>
<PARA> I am deeply grateful for your interest in the matter, as I'm sure are all those others who lost relatives and friends in her. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely, Michael Montgomery</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GM7">Senator MULVIHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Committee. I am motivated to seek further information from the Navy because the letter makes a number of assertions. One is that if Sydney was tricked, if I may put it in that way, by the German vessel concerned flying a neutral flag and firing a torpedo at the same time it would have rendered the master of that vessel liable to prosecution later for a war crime. The author refers also to the condition of certain life jackets, to a float bearing a body dressed in a Royal Australian Navy boiler suit and to evidence which raises the question whether personnel were machine gunned in the water. There is also the question of whether a log was tampered with, and other such matters. Hansard will contain the full text of the letter. I believe that, in view of the British precedent, the Navy could come up with more detailed answers to these questions. I hope that it will.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish also to refer to other matters which relate to the Department of Foreign Affairs and to the issuance of passports. As members of the Committee will know, I probed for answers from the officers of the Department concerning why we could not achieve better co-operation with the State Registrar General's officers so that one could block the loophole that now exists. Anyone who has read Day of the Jackal by Frederick Forsyth will recall the account of how one may check up on records of death and masquerade as one who is deceased, thus obtaining a passport under false pretences. In view of the manifestations that have become apparent about the extent of white collar crime I believe that we could do more to block that loophole. I raise the matter again because, although the response I received was rather negative, and doubts were expressed as to whether corrective action would be possible, individuals as far apart as David McNicoll, writing in the Bulletin and the authors of one or two of Canberra's newsletters, have hinted that something is happening in this field. Common politeness demands that if the Department is contemplating a reform which I have advocated I should be advised of it. My recollection of these matters went back to the occasion when a member of my own union, the Australian Railways Union, was blandly told, when he wanted to go abroad and sought a passport: 'Look, David Flynn, someone has already got a passport in your name'. It is not as though I have suddenly jumped on the bandwagon. I raised the matter several years ago. True, the real Mr Flynn got an apology from the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Peacock, but the matter has been crying out for reform. If reform is around the corner I would like to believe that a member of Estimates Committee D should have the same knowledge of it as perhaps columnist David McNicoll and some of the authors of Canberra newsletters. I will leave the matter there. </PARA>
<PARA> My other comment concerns immigration policy. I wonder whether decisions have yet been made in certain matters which have been raised. One is of a very delicate nature and involves a deportation order which was issued against a certain person who had gone to New Zealand from Britain, had grown up there as a teenager, had been convicted in Australia of an offence and had received a fairly lengthy sentence. A deportation order having been issued, the question was whether New Zealand would take him back. We continue to reciprocate action by New Zealand on these matters. Although we have imposed passport control across the Tasman, the size of the migrant component that crosses the Tasman from New Zealand does not cause us to tailor our total annual migrant intake from other countries. New Zealanders are still a privileged group. I am not suggesting that we should not maintain excellent trans-Tasman relations but I am curious as to whether New Zealand has decided to take back the person to whom I refer. Occasionally we read in the New Zealand newspapers of Australians having transgressed and magistrates having lectured them, saying: 'You will have to go back across the Tasman or you will be in trouble'. The situation should be even-handed. I hope that I will be able to get answers relating to those matters. Madam Temporary Chairman, I am in the hands of you and the Minister as to when I should seek to move the motion I have foreshadowed. Should I do so now or at a later stage?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As always I am indebted to my colleague Senator Mulvihill for his forbearance. I wish briefly to raise a matter to do with security in the issuing and dispatch of passports by mail, which is something of an old chestnut which, I think quite properly, rears its head on occasions such as this. Some further and better answers need to be provided. As I understand it, the Department of Foreign Affairs ceased sending passports by registered or certified mail during 1978 as part of what was described as an economy measure. The results of that economy measure do not seem always to have been entirely happy as is instanced by an example of the way in which passports now appear to be travelling through the mail which was drawn to my attention by Dr T. G. Corbett, a Melbourne patent attorney. He told me of the circumstances in which his wife had received a passport. Indeed, to prove the point he was making, he sent a photocopy-an extraordinarily evocative photocopy-of the condition of the envelope in which that passport arrived.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The passport was in an envelope which was not the subject of a certified or a registered mail procedure. It was a particularly flimsy looking envelope which arrived in a particularly crumpled condition. It was not gummed down at the back but had only a couple of rather wan pieces of sticky tape stuck to it which had long ago lost whatever adhesive capacity they might once have had. The envelope was open when it arrived in the mail and the fact that the passport arrived at all was clearly much greater testimony to the skills of Australia Post than to the sense of the Department of Foreign Affairs in sending the extraordinarily valuable document that a passport represents through the mail in that way. There is no doubt that with drug trafficking, immigration problems and other circumstances of which we are aware, that passports have a significant blackmarket value. One would have thought that the Department would introduce more intensive security measures to ensure that they do not go astray in this way and cannot simply be plucked from the post by any hand that happens to pass them by. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Corbett wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) about this matter and was kind enough to send a copy of his letter to me. The Minister in his reply simply confesses the error and promises to do better by way of improving the quality of sticky tape in the future but makes no concessions at all on the question of certification or registration. He simply states that there have been very few instances of delay or loss due to the use of normal postal services. One would have thought that any instances would be too many instances in this area. I for one remain unsatisfied, I am afraid, by the Minister's answer. I am not suggesting that this is a breathtaking issue-very few of the issues with which we deal in these Estimates debates are of breathtaking or earth-shattering national significance-but it is a small matter which seems to be capable of remedy by, one would have thought, a not especially spectacular financial outlay. I would welcome from the Minister-not necessarily right now but at some later stage-some indication of just what dollar and cents cost savings to the Department are involved in no longer posting passports by certified or registered mail. Also, will the Minister be prepared to reconsider what seems to be a rather silly piece of cheapness on the part of the Department?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some remarks about the Department of Foreign Affairs. I was interested to find out that in the Department of Foreign Affairs estimates there was a grant to the Australia-Britain Society for $150,000. I have never heard of this organisation and this grant was to support its secretariat. I was told that the Society sees itself, as the report states 'as a rallying point for people wishing to preserve our family relationship with the people of Britain and the essential features of our British heritage'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While the aims of the Society are quite commendable, I personally feel that such a society may be somewhat redundant and irrelevant these days especially when one looks at the priorities of the grants from the Department of Foreign Affairs. For example, the United Nations Association of Australia and the Australian Institute of International Affairs had their grants considerably reduced from last year. I think that would be wrong, but grants to the Australia-China Council, the Australia-Japan Foundation, and the Australia-New Zealand Foundation were the same or were slightly greater than those of the year before. I would not oppose that. When one sees $150,000 going to an Australia-Britain Society, I wonder whether we should have an Australia-Italian society or an Australia-Greece society. As I have said, I have never heard of the organisation, but in the Mercury from Tasmania yesterday there was an article entitled: 'Australia-Britain links live on'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australia-Britain Society is alive and well, according to the national director-general, Air Vice-Marshal W. E. Townsend. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Townsend, based in Sydney, was in Hobart yesterday in an attempt to reactivate the Tasmanian branch of the society. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Townsend, who spent 40 years with the Royal Australian Air Force, has been director-general of the society since June, 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> He said the society was set up in 1971, with the help of Sir Robert Menzies, to 'maintain the ties Australia has had with Britain for the past 200 years.'</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Townsend said the society had about 1,500 members in Australia, and a sister-society had been formed in England. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a grant of approximately $100 per head for every member in the Society. I reiterate the fact that I think perhaps it is something that we ought to look at in our priorities in the future. During the Estimates I asked one of the officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs whether his Department's travel section looks after the overseas bookings for the Australian Development Assistance Bureau staff. I was told that the Department of Foreign Affairs travel section would only handle the bookings if the travel was financed by the Department. Instead, travel arrangements are made by the management and foreign service division travel section of the Department of Foreign Affairs. I have long believed that it is ridiculous that each government department should have its own travel section rather than one central booking office operated by specially trained staff, yet I think it is even more ludicrous in this situation that we have within a department two sections handling travel arrangements. There was a very good article in the Traveltrade back in July which dealt with this matter. It spoke about Canberra being a fast growing tourist attraction. It mentioned the Australian War Memorial being second only to the Sydney Opera House as a drawcard for tourists and went on to talk about the Australian Capital Territory Tourist Bureau. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> If the Government were to divert its massive travel budget-domestic and international-through the Bureau it would probably make a profit on the operation with the commissions it would get. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead it prefers to allow every department to have its own travel section in which travel expertise is not necessarily the hallmark. </PARA>
<PARA>Later on it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile in Canberra, not only are individual departments doing their own thing but it is also costing the taxpayer dearly. </PARA>
<PARA> Concessionary fares often available are just not being utilised for Public Service travel. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead the Public Service Board and the Public Service unions engage in continuing wrangles including a 3-year epic on when first-class, business-class or economy should be made available. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that the idea of a central booking section for a number of departments ought to be looked at. Another matter that concerned me in the Department of Foreign Affairs estimates was I believe that the staff ceilings have detrimentally affected the security standards at our overseas posts. It is quite obvious that security is playing a much more important part in our missions abroad than it was 10 years ago. I was informed that the Department of Foreign Affairs is adequately coping with the security that is required overseas. However, it was admitted that staff ceilings were causing inconvenience. I hope the Government continues to bear that in mind. I do not think we can afford to cut costs when it means cutting back on the security of our staff or the people who work overseas on security. </PARA>
<PARA> A further issue that concerned me was the outcome of the razor gang's decision to remove the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation advisers to the London High Commission and the Washington Embassy. It seems to me to be a ridiculous situation that the Australian Government cannot afford to support those advisers when, apparently, it can afford to spend at least $3,633 an hour for the use of VIP aircraft by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). The Committee noted in its report that the Government should take into account the potential benefits to Australian science and industrial research and development by posting those officers abroad rather than bearing the costs involved in flying in advisers. I urge the Government to reconsider its decision on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Another issue that came up in considering the estimates of the Department of Foreign Affairs-it has been raised by Senator Robertson and me in the past-was that of our having a consulate in Bali. I believe that the Government has at last decided to go ahead with the appointment of a permanent consul in Bali. In my opinion the decision has come years too late, but I am glad that at last it has been made. The situation in Bali is that officials of Qantas Airways Ltd have borne the brunt of the problems posed by any Australians who have had travel problems in Bali. Regardless of whether we like it-I know a number of Government senators do not like to see Qantas Airways being subsidised in any way-in the instance to which I refer our airline and our airline officers are seen, in fact, to be arms of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Government. I believe a very good case can be made for a subsidy to be paid to Qantas Airways in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the other department whose estimates were considered by Estimates Committee D-the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. Again, it was quite worrying to see the result of the razor gang cuts which placed severe pressure on staff in passport offices around Australia. Pressures were also placed on the processing of citizenship applications in our overseas missions, particularly in London and Washington. At the Estimates Committee hearings officers readily admitted that the processing of passport applications was way behind schedule. Many of the calls for assistance that I receive at my office directly relate to the inadequate staffing levels determined by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Constituents are contacting me because their citizenship applications are taking months and months to come through. Because of the long delay they sincerely believe that their applications must have been lost. The total process is now taking between six and nine months. I have heard that in New South Wales now 17,000 applications are waiting to be processed and that 5,000 applications in Sydney alone are waiting for a security clearance. If those figures are wrong I hope the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), through her advisers, will correct them for me. Consequently, prospective citizens are being given no encouragement to become Australian citizens. They are justifiably beginning to believe that perhaps the Government does not care whether they become citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also received a number of calls from constituents whose relatives have applied to migrate to Australia and who have been waiting for many months to learn the outcome of their applications. This applies, in particular, to London. In a number of cases, even when there is no doubt that the relative will be permitted to migrate to Australia, the processing takes many months, mainly because of the staff shortages. As I said, this is particularly the case in England. It is quite wrong, I believe, that prospective migrants to Australia have to wait up to three or four months just to be granted their first interview with immigration officials in London. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise briefly a matter concerning immigration; in particular, the Telephone Interpreter Service. The service in Hobart is now switched to Melbourne, so that anybody who rings the Hobart number ends up speaking to somebody in Melbourne. That is a very unsatisfactory way of providing a telephone interpreter service because for a start, local knowledge is often very important. As I understand it, since that changeover occurred the number of people making contact with the Telephone Interpreter Service has been reduced, not just by 10 per cent, a quarter or anything like that, but by something like 85 per cent. There has been a reduction of 85 per cent in the number of people making contact with the Telephone Interpreter Service from Hobart. I would like to ascertain whether those figures are correct or are anywhere near correct. I ask in particular whether the calls which are received in Melbourne from Hobart can be identified as such and whether they are recorded as being Tasmanian calls and not calls from Victoria. I condemn the Government for the change which has occurred in that service. It was very useful to the ethnic communities in Hobart. The service was obviously valued. A reduction of that amount-even if it is not 85 per cent or anything like that-is an indication of the lack of service which is now being provided by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of matters have been raised. Some of them will need to be referred to the departments for information. Senator Sibraa made a suggestion with regard to a central booking section for travel. I will refer that to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street). A comment was made with regard to staffing. I have some information about the Department of Foreign Affairs. The Public Service Board has advised the following developments in relation to the matter raised by the Senate Estimates Committee in regard to staffing in the Department of Foreign Affairs. I advise that the Government has approved variations to the provisional ceilings in the light of Budget and other Government decisions. These variations included an increase of 25 in the staff ceiling of the Department of Foreign Affairs as at 30 June 1982 to handle the work load arising from the Government's decision to introduce passport control on trans-Tasman travel. The Department was advised on 28 September of that increase. A temporary allocation of an additional six staff has also been approved recently to assist the Department to establish a temporary passport processing unit in its central office. Over the next three months this unit will process applications which are redirected from the passport offices in the States. I have noted the comments and concern with regard to delays and security through the post of passports. I will draw those matters to the attention of the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A further question was raised-I think by Senator Sibraa-regarding scientific advisers. The Review of Commonwealth Functions recommendation on this matter provided that there be reduced staff levels at those posts but the reductions were not strictly related to scientific adviser positions in London and Washington. Several Ministers appealed against the Government's decision to reduce staff insofar as it affected their responsibilities. A case for the retention of the scientific adviser positions was made but, after ministerial consultation, it was decided not to change the original decision on this matter. Arrangements are being made within existing resources and through established channels to maintain a flow of science and technology information. This will build on the already extensive interchange between Australian and overseas scientists that is a feature of scientific relationships. Much of this interchange is Budget supported. I believe Senator Mulvihill raised a question with regard to deportation-if that is the correct word-to New Zealand. I advise that negotiations are being conducted with New Zealand concerning the person mentioned by Senator Mulvihill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to deal with the shortage of staff in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs both in Australia and overseas. To illustrate the point I want to make, I will take the case of an Australian national, a girl, who married an Irishman in New Zealand in February 1980. She then came to Australia. Later that year and certainly more than 12 months ago she made an application to the Department in Sydney for a change of status so that her spouse could become an Australian citizen. I have raised in this place before the fact that I believe this is totally unnecessary. I believe that if an Australian national marries overseas his or her spouse should become an Australian citizen automatically. If we did this we would overcome the problems we are having at present where an Australian national has to seek a change of status for the spouse. I will not press that point again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will not go into the full details of this case because the Department has them both in Sydney and in Darwin. Let me give a little of the background. I indicated that the couple made an application in Sydney over 12 months ago for a change of status. They then moved to Melbourne and some months ago moved to Darwin. As soon as they arrived in Darwin they contacted the local departmental office to seek some details about the change of status. Despite constant calls to that office, they got no action. So, six to eight weeks ago they came to me and I started to make contact with the Department in Darwin. The same story came back: 'It will be about two weeks'. I was in contact with the couple this afternoon. We are still waiting, 12 months after the application was made, for the job to be done. This is because either the Department is inefficient or it is short of staff. I think it is the latter, because I have had good contact with the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the officers seem to me to be very efficient people. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me reinforce why I say that I think the reason for this delay is a shortage of staff. I rang the office in Darwin four or five weeks ago to see what was happening and an officer said to me: 'I have been in touch with Israel and with Ireland'-they are both involved in the application-'and I wrote to them some months ago'. I said: 'Will you contact them again because we need some information before this job can be done?' He said: 'I would not bother them again because they are so busy'. Then he went into some detail about how he personally had experience of working 14 hours a day and more and how the officers in the missions overseas did this sort of thing-worked 14 hours a day-quite often. He said that he would not want to bother them. I have visited a number of missions, particularly in the Asian area, and the same comment comes back to me-that the enthusiastic officer who is trying to keep up with the job, trying to get the job done, has to work far longer than his normal office hours in the day. I will not go into detail about why I think the offices in Darwin and the rest of Australia are understaffed. I have made that point before. It is as a result of the razor gang and other cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> In the evidence given to the Estimates Committee there was an indication that there is no shortage of staff and that everything is flowing along. I ask the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) why there would possibly be this sort of delay. When I told an officer that it was over 12 months since the application had been made, he said: 'That is all right. It is usually six to eight months before this sort of application can be processed'. What a load of nonsense! The comment was made that they needed information from Israel and that this would take a lot of time. The person concerned wrote to Israel as a private citizen-not as an officer of the mission or the embassy, but with no contacts there-and in less than three months received back from the Israeli police force a clearance of character, which was apparently the information that was needed. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously there are holdups and I can attribute these holdups only to a shortage of staff. If this process takes six to eight months, that is a short time. It is taking 12 months to process a fairly straightforward case of an Irishman who spent some time in Israel, married in New Zealand, and spent the last 15 to 18 months in Australia. Surely that is not a difficult case to sort out. I ask the Minister whether she would comment on this shortage of staff both in Australia and overseas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry that I did not refer to Senator Mulvihill's query. I have no information on it. I do not think that many people would have more information than Senator Mulvihill, with his contacts with the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. With regard to the motion which was moved by Senator Mulvihill and carried, the Department is happy to give him any information that he may require at any time, despite the fact that the Estimates Committee may wish to monitor the new system. Senator Robertson referred to delays in the Department and asked whether six, eight or even 12 months for the processing of an application is normal? I am told that in many instances there are long delays. Many complex applications come before the Department. Senator Robertson cited one case. The Department asks that information be given to it to see whether it can assist or determine what the circumstances are relating to the delay that has been outlined by him. If information that might assist can be provided the Department will be happy to have it. Generally, I suppose six to eight months sounds a long time but to deal with personal applications, movements of people, changes in relationships and status and matters of that sort takes time at every point at which inquiries have to be made. The Department is always endeavouring to facilitate such applications and minimise the delays that occur. If information could be given on the particular instance that has been mentioned the matter could be investigated.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) for the response. I accept that I have been asked to give details of this case but it ought to be unnecessary to do so. I make the point once again that we ought to be adopting in our work what I have often called the little old lady syndrome which means that anybody can get from the Department what he or she requires. It should not require a parliamentarian to go to a department and say: 'Will you hurry up?' Although I thank the Minister for her response it is not really good enough to say: 'Well, yes, if you bring this case to us, we will clear it up for you. We will give you assistance'. I want to make sure that there are sufficient staff members in every one of the Department's offices, firstly, so that people do not have to work 14, 15 and 16 hours a day as they claim and, secondly, so that when people go into an office they will automatically get the treatment to which they are entitled and not have to go to get someone to intercede for them. A good deal of our time-certainly my time in Darwin-is spent going to a Department and asking for special treatment, or asking it to hurry up its normal work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I use this case only to highlight what I believe is a deficiency in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and in other departments-I will not mention them as we are not dealing with them at the moment-that is, a shortage of staff. I put it to the Minister that perhaps no response is needed here except to keep the matter in mind in regard to future staffing. Both the missions overseas and the local offices are understaffed. If they are understaffed, people will not get the service. The only people who will be served are those who are brash enough to go in and thump the desk or those who come to us to thump the desk for them. Let us take as a part of policy what I have suggested is the little old lady syndrome so that anyone who goes into an office gets service because there are enough staff members to do the job they are being paid to do and for which the Department was established. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will know that I have frequently put forward my quest to reach a more equitable employment society. There is a need to have a much tighter liaison between the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, to which we have just referred, the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs and the Department of Industrial Relations. With the rationalisation, restructuring, or whatever one likes to call it, of industry I sometimes wonder whether there is enough co-ordination. I preface my remarks with the tocsin I have sounded on many occasions; that until we have computerisation of our work force, as has been brought about by the Scandinavian governments, we will find a lot of looseness and that people simply miss out on adequate employment because there is not enough awareness of specific demands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will illustrate that by referring to an extract from Workers News. It deals with the fact that in Five Dock in the electorate of Lowe, for which I am the resident senator, near Christmas the Nestle Australia Ltd chocolate factory is to be taken over by Life Saver (Australasia) Ltd. To be quite fair about it I say that I have a copy of a letter sent by Nestles to the Labor Council of New South Wales in which was put forward a reasonable, or even favourable, severance pay system. In a lot of industries in Australia today the unions are able to negotiate an effective severance pay system which is all right for the man over 50 years of age. It may mean that he just manages to make the final payment on a home which he has been struggling to pay for a long while and matters like that. It is quite attractive for him. But nobody seems to know what happens to the people under 50 years of age, say, between 25 years and 50 years, who receive less severance pay and who still have a role to play in the Australian work force. I seek leave to have this article from Workers News dated 7 November 1981 incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA> The article read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>TAKEOVER MOVE TO SHUT FACTORY</PARA>
<PARA> Three hundred families in the Five Dock area of Sydney's inner-western suburbs have been dealt a blow by the planned closure of the Nestles chocolate factory at Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA> The plant is being shut down following a takeover of Nestles' Australian operations by the Lifesaver company. </PARA>
<PARA> Three hundred and sixty jobs will be destroyed in the process adding to the growing list of sackings in the confectionery industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Over 200 jobs were axed at Rowntree-Hoadley when the Sydney operations were transferred to Melbourne and 60 jobs went when the same thing happened at Scanlen's. </PARA>
<PARA> At the Small's factory the workforce has been reduced from 80 to 26 following a takeover of the company, but output has been trebled with the introduction of new machinery. </PARA>
<PARA> Nestle's factory workers have accepted a redundancy agreement which gives them a lump sum of four weeks pay plus an additional three weeks pay for each year of service and loadings of up to 25 per cent on the gross amount depending on age. </PARA>
<PARA> Bob Biddle, the New South Wales secretary of the Confectioners Union, said it was one of the best agreements he had seen yet. </PARA>
<PARA> But he added: 'No matter how much money you get you still haven't got a job.'</PARA>
<PARA> Many of the workers are close to retiring age and some have worked at the factory for as long as 40 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the article epitomises the matter I am raising. I am asking the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) to inquire into a situation in the central western suburbs of Sydney. When people become aware that one firm in an industry is to be taken over by another, what effective liaison and what function is performed by the Commonwealth Employment Service in the fitting in of the redundant workers? In the case in point the article states that 300 people are faced with dismissal. I spoke to Mr Biddle, the secretary of the confectioners union. It is true that some of the people will be retained by the new company and others will probably be slotted in to what I call the confectionery sector of the manufacturing industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We had a similar situation in the rubber industry. When Firestone Australia Pty Ltd vacated the area of tyre manufacture, I, along with Barney French, the secretary of the Federated Rubber and Allied Workers Union of Australia, paid tribute to the then Minister for Productivity, the Honourable Ian Macphee, for the role he played in helping many of those workers get alternative employment. In the case of the rubber workers it was all very nice to say to them: 'There is alternative work in Dunlop Australia Ltd across the border'. Even if a man of 42 years of age with a family of two, say from eight to about 14 years of age, living at Bankstown is offered free travel and the cost of the removal of his furniture to another State, he has to pull up roots from a suburb where he has been happy and contented and where his children have been happy in their school. This is the point I am making. In the era of Ian Macphee there was consultation with other ministries to see that these workers received adequate or, as far as possible, alternative employment. I say to the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) simply that I would be curious to know what role Neil Brown, the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, is playing in these sorts of operations since Ian Macphee left the Department of Productivity. I am not taking a Luddite attitude. I know that there will be mergers and restructuring in industry. If that comes about and some sections receive good severance pay I want to know what happens to the people who have another 25 years to work. I am trying to find out just what effective liaison there is. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> This confirms our recent discussions regarding severance payments to employees affected by this Company's announcements on 21 August 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> 1. Severance Payments</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The Company agrees to make a severance payment based on the following calculation:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) An employee who has been made redundant and remains with the Company until the scheduled closure date, or leaves at the specific direction of the Company, will receive a payment of four weeks pay. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) An employee who has been made redundant and who has voluntarily left the Company's employment, or who leaves before the scheduled closure date, will receive a payment of two weeks pay. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) All such redundant employees will receive an additional payment at the rate of three weeks pay for each completed year of service, plus 3 weeks payment for part year of service. </PARA>
<PARA>2. Age Allowance-In addition to all payments, an 'age allowance' will be provided also, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) 45 years of age, to 49 years of age-an additional 10 per cent of gross payments under this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) 50 years of age, to 54 years of age-an additional 15 per cent of gross payments under this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) 55 years of age, to 59 years of age-an additional 20 per cent of gross payments under this scheme. </PARA>

<PARA> 6. Time Off for Interviews-The Company will provide the necessary time off, with pay, to allow employees to attend interviews for alternative employment. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. Seniority-The Company agrees to the general principle of seniority and consultation, however, as explained during our discussions, we do not want to be tied down to the literal application of this principle in all cases. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. Itemised Statement of All Wages Due-Redundant employees shall be given an itemised statement of all termination payments as early as possible prior to the actual date of termination. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. Certificate of Service-The Company will supply a Certificate of Service to all retrenched employees. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. Superannuation-Separate payments of Superannuation Scheme/Pension Fund entitlements will be provided under the rules. </PARA>

<PARA> 12. Alternate Employment within Company-Where the Company offers a retrenched employee alternate employment in other units and this employment is accepted, the employee shall be entitled to all redundancy payments if that employee leaves within three months from the date of transfer. Employees have the option of accepting the alternate employment or the redundancy payments. </PARA>
<PARA> 13. Transfer to Other Company Units-Where a redundant employee is offered, and accepts, alternate employment within the Company, the employee will receive compensation for expenses as provided by Company policy. </PARA>
<PARA> 14. Long Service Leave-The Company will make Long Service Leave payments in accordance with the Long Service Leave Act, except that the Company will make pro rata payments to retrenched employees with three or more years of completed service. </PARA>
<PARA> 15. Payments-All payments referred to will be based on the weekly 'shop rate' applying at the date of retrenchment. </PARA>
<PARA> 16. Death of Employees-Should an employee die before the final date of termination, all benefits relating to this scheme shall be paid directly to his or her estate. </PARA>
<PARA> 17. Gross Payments-The gross severance scheme payments must not amount to more than the sum the employee could have earned up to his/her normal retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> 18. Operative Date-Severance payments detailed in this letter will be operative from 21 August 1981. </PARA>

There will be other jobs for them to do, so we will want these committee hearings to continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I mention one area that we referred to in paragraph (b) on page 2 of the report. That paragraph refers to the heading 'Incidental and Other Expenditure'. The background in this area of the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) is greater than mine. Perhaps she can elaborate on this matter. It certainly seems to me to be undesirable to have large amounts of money in this vote. In some departments it is a sort of grab bag for the items that they cannot slot in elsewhere. I take as one example freight and cartage. Some departments have a separate heading for freight and cartage; others have this collected in a grab bag of incidental and other expenditure. While I am not suggesting that we want to see uniformity in every set of explanatory notes that come before us I think that most of us sitting on the Committee would want the point made that it is inappropriate to have a large amount of money under one heading and for the department to say: 'Well, we have $150,000 or $200,000 which is just incidental or other expenditure'. One hesitates to use the expression 'slush fund' but certainly it is a grab bag sort of vote. I wonder whether the Minister might care to comment on whether it might be more appropriate for some of the large 'Incidental or Other Expenditure' votes to be broken down and included in other areas or to have set up separate votes, such as 'Freight and Cartage', which involve fairly large expenditures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As was observed by the Committee and pointed out by Senator Robertson, a separate item of appropriation is already provided for freight and cartage under the estimates for some departments. In most cases the amounts provided are significantly in excess of the amount that was highlighted by the Committee. Following the Government's decision on a Review of Commonwealth Functions recommendation, the Government currently is reviewing the appropriations with a view to reducing the number of items where this would result in no significant loss of control. Pending completion of that review it would not perhaps be appropriate to embrace a procedure that would result in an increased number of items.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The underlying rationale for this review is to provide departmental managers with a greater degree of flexibility to allocate funds to services having the highest priority. It is not envisaged that explanatory notes for Estimates committees, for instance, will be presented in any less detail. In fact, I think what has occurred with the Estimates committees is that a great deal of information is given and a lot of segregation of items occurs even within particular votes. However, in the meantime, recognising the needs of committees for adequate information on which to examine departmental appropriations, departments will be instructed to provide full details in explanatory notes of any continuing and substantial amounts, provision for which is included in the appropriation 'Incidental and Other Expenditure'. In other words, where that item appears there will be a breakdown of it and the Estimates Committee will have that information in the detail that I think it would require. As I said, my department is looking at perhaps providing fewer headings, not less control, so there is greater flexibility within departments. Perhaps the outcome of the review we are undertaking will be of interest at some future time to an Estimates committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I deal with page 3 of the report of Estimates Committee E. In dealing with paragraph (e) the report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Report of the Auditor-General was not available till 24 September 1981, more than one week after Estimates Committees had commenced. As in previous years when this had occurred (see Estimate Committee C's Report to the Senate, October 1976 and 1977). Committees have commented on the need to have the report available for a reasonable time prior to the examination of Departmental Estimates. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not read further. I wonder whether the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) would care to comment on this and perhaps give us some sort of assurance that we might have the report of the Auditor-General in front of us. I shudder to think what comments Senator Wright might have made if he had not had his Auditor-General's report well and truly in front of him in time to prepare his questions for committees. So can we have an assurance from the Minister that the Auditor-General's report will be made available in ample time for us to be able to make use of this most valuable document?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do recognise the requirement of a committee to have available the Auditor-General's report. It is always of assistance for the committee members to compare items or to be informed of progress in matters that may have been reported on previously. The timing of the tabling of the Auditor-General's report is very much dependent upon the availability of the financial statements prepared by the Minister for Finance pursuant to section 50 of the Audit Act. The preparation of these statements is a lengthy and exacting task which receives the highest priority in the Department of Finance. That preparation is undertaken in close collaboration with the Auditor-General's staff and is subject to detailed checking throughout the preparation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think anything I am saying is underestimating the understanding that we have that the Auditor-General's report ought to be available. We appreciate the wish of the Estimates committees to have the Auditor-General's report available because it relates to expenditures during the previous financial year and is presented pursuant to the requirements of sections 50 to 53 of the Audit Act. It will be appreciated that the overriding responsibility is therefore to report to the Parliament as provided and that this cannot be subordinated, for instance, to the requirements of the Estimates committees, which are primarily directed to the subsequent year's Estimates. The main opportunity for review of matters included in the Auditor-General's report is through inquiries of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and other parliamentary committees and the debate on the report in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, subject to the major responsibility to report in an effective manner to the Parliament, every effort will be made to table the report as early as is possible. Where possible-it often depends on the dates on which the Senate Estimates committees sit-we will endeavour to see that that report is available for the committees' use, having noted their interest in looking at the matters on which the Auditor-General comments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) for her answer and for the assurance that she will try to get the report to us. I take issue with one point that she made, perhaps because of a philosophical difference. I am particularly keen on the Estimates committees and the other committees of the Senate and see them as extremely valuable. I would not like there to be the sort of distinction on dichotomy, if one likes, that the Minister seems to suggest by saying that the report should be prepared for the Parliament and not for the Estimates committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take the point that Parliament is vitally important, but, of course, the Estimates committees are a part of the Senate and meet as part of the Senate. They are not something separate. I think it extremely important for us to have that document in front of us. Let us face it; to deal with the report when it comes before the chamber, perhaps after the Estimates committees have met, is to deal with it in a reasonably abstract way. If we deal with it as it comes to us when we are sitting with the officers of the various departments in front of us, then we certainly have the opportunity to use the material in the Auditor-General's report and, of course, to give the officers an opportunity to comment on it. I would not like anything the Minister has said-perhaps she did not intend it-to be taken as a suggestion that the Estimates committees are in any way, shall we say, subordinate to the work of the chamber. They are an integral part of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly agree with what Senator Robertson has said. I did not mean to imply otherwise. I think what I was probably trying to say was that the Auditor-General's report really looks at the expenditure of the previous year. We are dealing with the forthcoming Budget expenditure. It is a matter of meshing the Auditor-General's report on the previous year's expenditure-which report he must present to Parliament under his statutory responsibilities-with the time frame in which we work in looking at the expenditure for the forthcoming year or period. I certainly agree that the Estimates committees of the Senate, or any committees of the Senate, are very much part of the parliamentary process and I did not in any way wish to suggest otherwise.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise a couple of matters relating to the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs. Firstly, I give a very small illustration of the result of the Government's policy on the employment situation. The Government's sales tax measures have, of course, been widely criticised on all sorts of grounds. I just want to quote from a letter that a Tasmanian constituent received to show a further effect of that policy and how it can affect employment. I have deleted the name of the constituent concerned. The letter is signed by the Personnel Services Manager of a pet food manufacturing company. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We would like to apologise for the time it has taken us to get back to you regarding your application for the position of Engineer. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately recent developments in our industry following the imposition of a 17 1/2% Sales Tax on our products, have resulted in us having to slow down on our planned expansion activity. It is therefore with regret we have to advise you that we have decided not to recruit an additional engineer at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for your interest . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I would just like to emphasise that that sort of effect of the Government's policies, particularly its policy on sales tax, must be being duplicated all over the country many times. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I want to raise briefly under the estimates for the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs relates to the State committees of the National Committee on Discrimination in Employment and Occupation which, of course, were set up under the umbrella of the former Department of Labour and Industrial Relations by the Whitlam Government and which have performed a very useful task in beginning the job of highlighting discrimination in employment and trying to overcome the problems. Of course, I think we would all admit that there is still a long way to go. One point I would like to make is that it is an amazing fact that the committee in Tasmania, for instance, has no women on it. It is purporting to be a committee on discrimination in employment but the committee there has not one woman on it. It is a totally male committee. I urge the Government to review this situation-I am sure the situation in other States is similar-to ensure that these very committees on discrimination are not in themselves discriminatory and are much more representative of the work force and of the community than they are at present. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to raise now a matter in connection with the estimates for the Department of Housing and Construction. I want to register a complaint in relation to a question I asked of Senator Messner on 29 October in his capacity as the Minister representing the Minister for Housing and Construction. I referred the Minister to the desperate situation of the building industry in Tasmania and the urgent need for whatever Commonwealth construction work there is there to get under way, particularly the new Federal law courts building in Hobart. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Is it a fact that the letting of tenders for the project is held up because the Government's conditions will not allow any site allowance which may be granted by the Arbitration and Conciliation Commission to be part of the rise and fall conditions of the contracts? Is it also a fact that none of the tenders is in accordance with that condition?</PARA>
<PARA>I urged the Government to change its mind about that condition and not to try to usurp any decisions of the Arbitration Commission which may grant site allowances in accordance with the law. I pointed out to the Minister that it is crazy economics to hold up for that sort of reason projects that were so urgently needed to be commenced, especially when costs are rising every day. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) has been praising the Government long and loud for having gone ahead with this project, although it was initiated by the Labor Government. This Government is being very loud about this project in praise of itself, but because of its own policies it is holding it up. I was promised a reply by the night of the day I asked the question, 29 October. I got a note from Senator Messner's Private Secretary late that night which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Messner has asked me to let you know that, although we were not able to get a reply to your question without notice tonight, we are expecting an answer from the Department of Housing and Construction early tomorrow and we will phone your office in Tasmania as soon as it is available. </PARA>
<PARA>I waited all the next day and did not hear from the Minister or his office. Five days later, still having had no answer, we contacted Senator Messner's office in Adelaide and were assured that there was a letter in the mail. We still have not been informed as to the reason why this project has been held up. As I said, Tasmania's building industry is in a desperate situation. The Government should be making every effort to give it a boost by making a start on this project rather than holding it up. I would like an answer to the problem. I would like a start made on the letting of the contract and an explanation given as to why the promised answer was not provided. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to know. We have been told by the officer that the rents have been going up and I want to know whether the rate of interest has gone up. The interest on the houses that were sold some years ago was as low as 4.5 per cent and some Ministers did have such houses. I am interested to know whether that interest has escalated in the same way as rent has escalated for people on low incomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Rope-The rate of interest has escalated on the great bulk of our mortgages. There are a small number of mortgages on which interest rates have not escalated as a result of some fault with the mortgage documents. This was a mistake which will not be made again. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps you will provide the Committee with that information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>We have been provided with that information. On the second page of the document in which the answers were provided under the heading 'Housing Loans' it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Hansard Reference-Page 265</PARA>
<PARA>Housing Loans</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Question: The Chairman requested information to be provided of the number of Members of Parliament occupying houses which are being purchased through Government loans. </PARA>
<PARA> Answer: There are two current Members of Parliament purchasing Government allocated houses in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA>On the third page of the document there is a further question and answer. They state:</PARA>
<PARA> Question: Senator McLaren asked whether the interest rate has increased on houses that were sold by the Government--</PARA>
<PARA>The Department omitted in that part of the question to mention the two members of parliament. The question continued:</PARA>
<PARA>in the past and whether that interest has escalated in the same way as rent has escalated for people on low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Answer: There are still some current mortgages at 4.5 per cent, 4.75 per cent and at 6.25 per cent. These rates have not escalated because the mortgage documents in respect of these loans do not provide for the interest rate to be varied. </PARA>
<PARA>The list that I have in my filing system states that there are four persons paying these rates of interest of which three are still Ministers in this Government. In view of the fact that you, Mr Temporary Chairman, received the answer to your question that two current members of parliament are still purchasing government allocated houses, then almost certainly two of the three must be Ministers. One of the other persons who had a loan at 6 1/4 per cent is no longer in the Parliament. He got one of those jobs for the boys. I have the names of these people, but at this stage I will not reveal them. I ask the Minister: Do those two members of parliament have houses at this very low interest rate? My information is-I do not doubt it-that in the first case the purchase price of the house was $31,950 and there was a government loan for the mortgage of $30,352 at 6 1/4 per cent; in the second case the purchase price was $18,910 and there was a government loan for the mortgage of $17,964 at 4 3/4 per cent; and, in the final case, the purchase price was $17,500 and there was a government loan for the mortgage of $16,625 at 4 3/4 per cent. Each of those loans was over 45 years. Before I go any further, I want to know from the Minister whether, in any of those three cases, the two Ministers are referred to in the answer as the persons who have government loans at that low rate of interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning I referred to the adversative attitude of the Industries Assistance Commission whereby it is attempting to cut the heart out of manufacturing industry in Australia without having regard to the social or dislocative effects of its recommendations. It does this with blinkered vision towards lowering tariffs and eliminating quotas. This is all done without regard to what other countries use as measures to protect their industries. On the other hand, the Commission conveniently ignores a whole host of monopolistic positions which apply in the tertiary sector or even the public sector. According to the criteria which are used against manufacturing, some of these industries would be categorised as inefficient.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The recent interim report into the motor vehicle industry, I believe, is a typical example of what I refer to as cutting the very heart out of the manufacturing sector. If the Australian Government wishes us to have in Australia high technology capable of utilising a wide range of skilled people, a stable manufacturing sector is essential. I believe this objective will not come to fruition through assembling or importing completed units produced overseas. Too many Australians currently have the mistaken notion that we will have cheaper vehicles in Australia if we rely almost exclusively on imports. What a fallacy and how naive and disruptive that is for the Australian workforce! What these transnational companies, which operate from overseas, will do is send a sufficient number of vehicles at a price that the market will bear. The only possibility is that we will get cheaper cars in the very short term until the market is fully secured and the market share is fully secured. </PARA>
<PARA> How many honourable senators are aware of the effective upward revaluation of the Australian dollar in the last 12 months compared with currencies in many Western European countries? Anyone exporting, for example, sheepskins or apples to those countries would know of the losses and consequences of that effective revaluation. For example, there has been an effective 26 per cent revaluation against the United Kingdom currency, a 33 per cent revaluation in the case of France and a 36 per cent revaluation in respect of Germany. Have honourable senators noticed the prices of vehicles such as Peugeots and Mercedes-Benz which are imported from those countries come down by anywhere near those percentages? Of course not, and what a fallacy that argument is! Australia needs a capability to produce a complete motor vehicle-not necessarily a whole range of vehicles from a Mini right up to a Statesman Caprice. We must have this capacity for strategic and defence reasons if nothing else, apart from the important employment implications. </PARA>
<PARA> I will look at some of the strategic problems. Our sea lanes could be vulnerable in time of war and our maritime industry is punctured with disruption and dispute. I believe that the component manufacturers are very much at risk. It is important that there is no increase in export facilitation. I am aware of certain abuses that are currently employed and which extend far beyond the techniques of transfer pricing. I believe that lower prices will come about only by some constructive rationalisation which will result in the motor vehicle industry in Australia having the capability of producing reasonable batch sizes so that industries can produce with reasonable economies of scale. I believe that the Australian car manufacturing industry must be capably supported by an up-to-date component industry which is employing modern technology. I am concerned about the unremitting attitude from the Industries Assistance Commission. I ask that we have a bipartisan debate with a view to getting the charter of the IAC changed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the comments that were made earlier in the day by Senator Gietzelt when he recommended that the terms of reference of the Industries Assistance Commission should be changed. I support that concept absolutely. I believe the time has come to change from a confrontationist approach, which the terms of reference of the IAC necessarily engender, to an approach of co-operation between government and industry. This can happen only if the terms of reference of the IAC are changed. At present industry has to face IAC references on the basis of justifying its existence. It is asked to present evidence to the IAC as to why it should be allowed to exist with the rates of protection which it enjoys. I contrast this with the approach in Japan, where there is co-operation between government and industry-not confrontation, but co-operation. Industry is a part of the economy of the Japanese Government and that Government looks to ways of co-operating with industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This could be done in Australia with a different approach. It starts, of course, with understanding clearly what our long term objectives are and understanding clearly what the markets are for various industries around the world. I suggest this could be done through the Department of Trade and Resources. It could very easily be asked to quantify the potential markets in various countries and then, in co-operation and discussion with industry and with other sectors of the community, work out a long term plan for the development of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> To illustrate my point I draw the Senate's attention to the situation that occurred some years ago with an IAC report in relation to the steel industry in this country. Whatever the merits or demerits of various industries in this country, from brick making to steel making and textiles, one can hardly argue that we should not have a steel industry and we should not encourage a steel industry. We have some of the largest deposits of iron ore in this country. We have the best deposits of coal in this country. We should, in all circumstances, develop our steel industry. This concept appealed to the IAC. There was an inquiry into the steel industry. The IAC received evidence from the steel manufacturers and from other areas of the community and it then came out with a report. It said, in essence, that Australia should develop its export markets and that a very large percentage of the future investment of the steel industry in this country should be related to export industries. That is a concept which would appeal, I am sure, to many honourable senators on both sides of the chamber. But what happened? As soon as that report was brought down it was challenged by the management of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, the major producer in this country. In isolation, a government body advising the Government of this country had come up with a projection of the future possibilities for the export of Australian steel, which was in complete contradiction to the projections of the executives of BHP. </PARA>
<PARA> I contrast this to what happens in Japan, where the Government and industry get together to look at the long term projections. They discuss them; they work them out. Finally, they agree as to what the future of that particular industry could be. That is co-operation between industry and government. It is co-operation with the best expert advice available. They come up with a long term plan and, having agreed on it in a bipartisan way, they then say: 'All right, we will now co-operate. Government and industry will work together in the interests of this long term plan, which is in the interests of this country'. That approach has to win every time. It is winning in Japan. Let us look at the situation in Japan. It is a country with no resources. It imports its raw materials. It imports a large percentage of its food. Right now Japan is the major competitor with the United States of America in the automotive industry. It is the major competitor with the United States in the steel industry. Why? The Japanese Government, in co-operation with the steel and automotive industries, said: 'These are the areas we will encourage. These are the areas that are in the interests of our industry and in the interests of our Government'. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I agree absolutely with the proposition that was put forward earlier today by Senator Gietzelt: The terms of reference of the Industries Assistance Commission have to be changed in line with the principle of co-operation between government and industry rather than the principle of confrontation, which is the essential approach today in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. What has been said so far is a demand for the continuation of the high levels of protection in this country. What is wrong with protection? A huge industry develops behind a high tariff wall. When such an industry does its costings the first calculation it makes concerns what the traffic will bear, and that is what it charges. It does not care what it produces. It does not care whether its goods are of poor quality. It has no real competition. It does not have to worry about price and quality because it believes the Government will protect it by stopping good quality, cheap goods coming into Australia. Essentially, that is an answer to what has been said by Senator Watson, Senator Siddons and others. I make the point that I am glad that the Industries Assistance Commission report has given a very clear indication that this sort of thing should not go on and that the Government should take very great cognisance of what is said in the report about the levels of protection being far too high.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because I know that other arrangements have been made tonight, I do not seek to take advantage of the numerical power available to us as senators to move the suspension of that sessional order to permit further debate on these papers. I merely take the occasion to comment on what I think is the absurd situation with which we are confronted-of some 19 significant reports having been introduced today and an hour and a half having been allowed in which to debate them, with the procedures operating in such a way that it has not been possible for some very important items even to be reached. The order in which the reports are listed appears somewhat random. Presumably it represents the chronological order in which they appeared in the tabling office. It has nothing to do with their intrinsic significance or the desire of honourable senators to speak to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will wind up my remarks by making just a couple of additional comments on this matter. It seems to me that the only way in which it would have been possible for this new sessional order to have made any sense was for there to be an assumption that there would be an average of only one speaker on each paper and that that speaker would address himself directly to it, saying what it was possible to say given the short notice that we have of these papers-stating what it was in effect urgently necessary to point out in relation to it-rather than using the occasion as a springboard for general chatter about matters raised incidentally or consequentially by the subject with which a particular report dealt. Perhaps the problem we have experienced today, more than the overall time limit, is the fact that honourable senators, for reasons that I can well understand, have taken the opportunity of the presentation of papers to speak-a number of them successively-on particular matters rather than observe the spirit of the new arrangement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That may well be so and it is in that spirit that I am contributing to the debate tonight what I hope is in most of our minds, in such a way that it can be taken account of in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Also, it seems fairly bizarre for this kind of sessional order to apply at this stage of the year when, as we all know, a very large number of reports do tend to be tabled by statutory authorities, departments and other bodies, simply because of the time of the year. A period of an hour and a half, which might be perfectly reasonable during most of the year to deal with the reports brought down in a given week, becomes manifestly unreasonable in the context of this stage of the calendar year. </PARA>
<PARA> I make those points not in order to seek to bring on a major procedural debate now-certainly not to move to change the order of business-but so that the matters which I have raised may be brought to the attention of the Standing Orders Committee. I do not know whether it is necessary to move to that effect. I certainly ask the Standing Orders Committee to take it on board. I also ask the managers of business in the various parts of this chamber to take account of the fact that at least three or four of the items which remain are of significance, and to see what might be done about adjusting the procedures of the Senate in order to provide some brief opportunity for a contribution to be made on them before the Parliament adjourns until next year. </PARA>

Several statements that I was to have put down I cannot now put on the record at the time when the relevant reports are being tabled. It is a matter of concern for the Government as well as for private members and Opposition spokesmen. I think that it is a difficult matter part of the solution to which, as Senator Baume interjected in the debate, involves self-control by honourable senators and some selection as to the items which are seen to have priority.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When this Bill was last before the Senate on 16 September I spoke at some length about the Australian Democrats' attitude to it. I said that it had our wholehearted support. Since that time developments have taken place in relation to Queensland Aboriginal lands which I believe are heartening and have the support of honourable senators on both sides of this chamber. I believe that those moves are in part a response to previous debate in this chamber and to the work of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) in this regard. I believe that the atmosphere in which the debate has taken place so far and the attempts by honourable senattors from all parties to see it successfully concluded must give heart to everybody in this country. We have shown that we may on these very contentious yet extremely important issues come to a resolution and a consensus without brawling in public. I believe that this is one area in which that situation is rapidly approaching. I hope that we will reach it in the very near future so that this matter can be resolved to the satisfaction not only of this Parliament and of the Queensland Parliament but also, and in particular, of the Aboriginal people in Queensland so that at last they may again be owners of their own land in their own country. I believe that this is what is desired and hoped for by all right-thinking Australians. We certainly commend this Bill to the Senate and give it our wholehearted support.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I have had two opportunities to contribute to the debate on the private members Bill that I introduced to give self-management and land rights to Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. I do not propose to traverse the same ground again this evening. I have been able on a previous occasion to remind the Senate of the history of the violent usurpation of land from Queensland Aboriginals by the colonial invaders and of the sorry history since that time of Aboriginal Queenslanders, both those living on reserves and those living outside of reserves. I have set out in my Bill machinery which will allow Aboriginals and Islanders living on reserves to become properly self-managing and a way in which the Commonwealth can secure freehold title to reserve lands for the Aboriginal and Islander residents of those reserves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the course of the debate some Government senators raised some objections to some minor aspects of the legislation. In response to those objections I have pointed out that in consultation with the Australian Democrats who, as Senator Macklin has said, have been supporting us wholeheartedly on this issue, we have drafted a number of amendments which I believe meet any of the serious criticisms that have been made of some of the machinery aspects of the Bill. I understand that Senator Missen and Senator Bonner would also like to contribute amendments at the Committee stage. I look forward to studying their amendments in the spirit of co-operation which I am very happy to say has pervaded the Senate during the debate on this Bill. I think it is a matter of gratification that nobody in this Senate has actually opposed the concept of land rights for Queensland Aborigines. There has been opposition to some of the methods I have proposed, but, speaking certainly for my own party, for the Australian Democrats and I believe for Senator Bonner and Senator Missen, there has been no objection to the objective of land rights for Queensland Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA> I will comment briefly on some developments which have been given coverage in the media in recent days. There have been references to new proposals which are about to be put forward by the Queensland Government to deal with the situation of Aboriginal reserves. Both the National Party in Queensland and the Queensland Liberal Party have announced new policies with regard to Aboriginal land in Queensland. I believe it is appropriate that I comment briefly on the proposals insofar as we have any details of them. As far as the National Party's new policy is concerned, there is really little to be said at this stage. All we have been told is that a new policy will be announced this weekend. However, we do note that the National Party is using the term 'perpetual title to land'. This is something which it is prepared to consider, which it has not yet defined and which, as far as we understand, will not meet our case for freehold title to Aboriginal land by Aboriginal owners. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the Liberal Party of Queensland is concerned, a more detailed release has been made public in which the concept of a limited freehold is discussed. I am gratified to see the Liberal Party in Queensland using the concept of freehold at all. However, we do not know what form of limitation the Liberal Party intends by 'limited freehold'. Again we can greet this new announcement only very cautiously. There are some interesting aspects to the statement by the Liberal Party in Queensland, not least of which is the announcement that when arrangements for self-management and limited freehold are made the Department of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement in Queensland, the Department which has become quite notorious amongst Aboriginals and Islanders in Queensland, will no longer need to exist. </PARA>
<PARA> I endorse the view of the Queensland Liberal Party in that respect, although not generally at this stage because, as I said, we do not know what arrangements in detail are contemplated by the Queensland Liberal Party. Suffice it to say at this stage then that we are pleased to see that there is a more active discussion of Queensland land rights among members of the National Party and the Queensland Liberal Party. As everybody in this chamber knows, there is a great difference between what political parties may announce as their policies and what governments are prepared to do. What we in the Labor Party are interested in at this stage is what governments are prepared to do. We have no reason to believe at this stage that the Government of Queensland is prepared to grant freehold title to Queensland Islander and Aboriginal inhabitants of reserves. Therefore, in our view, we must proceed with this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to state the principle of freehold title and of self-management and to lay down machinery whereby those principles may be implemented. So nothing that has been said on previous days makes it any less urgent that we proceed with this Bill this evening. No suggestions of proposals that have come forth negate the need for a statement from the Senate of Australia that freehold title must be granted to Queensland Aboriginals. Therefore, we will proceed with this Bill as it has been my intention to proceed since I first introduced it. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I remind the Senate that some 43 amendments to be moved at the Committee stage have been prepared by the Australian Labor Party and are available. More amendments may be brought forward and we will examine them in a spirit of co-operation. The important thing at this stage is to press on with this Bill, to press on with enacting the legislative principle, which we are entitled to do, which it is our Federal responsibility to do. Should it happen that the Queensland Government wants to provide for freehold title in the next few days we will re-examine our position and see whether it is necessary to proceed to the Committee stage. However, as I said at this stage it is clear that our commitment to freehold title is unqualified and unaffected by anything that has happened. I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful that the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) has agreed to table the document. Unfortunately, her doing so at this time may not give me an opportunity to look at it before we take a vote on this group. Earlier this evening I posed a question because of an answer that I received from the Department of the Capital Territory that two current members of parliament are purchasing government allocated houses in the Australian Capital Territory. The Minister asked me to put the question on notice. I was only interested in current members of parliament. I notice that the document is the same as the one I was provided with quite a number of years ago. I notice that the names of at least three of the people I mentioned tonight are shown on this document. As the answer I received in writing stated that there are only two current members of parliament involved, I sought to ascertain which members are still in receipt of these very low interest loans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am in a little difficulty in trying to peruse this document quickly, but I notice that the three members I named-Mr Anthony, Mr Nixon and Mr Sinclair-are shown on the document. The figures shown are exactly the same as the ones I quoted. The interest rates are the same. The document shows the dates that the loans were granted. That intrigues me because I was told during a meeting of the relevant Estimates committee that this low interest rate came about because of some fault with the mortgage documents. When I looked at my own document again during the suspension of the sitting I noticed that a mortgage was entered into on 17 December 1964 by Mr Anthony and that Mr Sinclair entered into one on 14 August 1966. There is a time span there of nearly two years. Four years later, Mr Nixon entered into a mortgage. That does not bear out the officer's statement that this occurred through a fault with the mortgage documents. If that is correct, that fault existed for some four years, although the Minister did say that some special provision applied to Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to know now which Ministers of that three mentioned are still recipients of those low interest rate mortgages. Is it Mr Sinclair, Mr Anthony or Mr Nixon? Apparently two of those three are recipients. Mr Gorton is no longer a member of parliament and Mr Bryant is no longer a member of parliament. Mr Morrison would have obtained his loan when he was with the Department of Foreign Affairs and not when he was a member of parliament. He obtained his loan in 1974. He might have been a member then, but that is not applicable. Mr Grassby had a loan, as did Mr Whan, Mr Negus and Mr Fry. Mr Fry, according to my earlier perusal, would have received his loan when he was working for the Government and not as a member of parliament. However, on looking at those documents again I find that only three of the people listed on the manifest to which I have referred are in fact Ministers and still members of parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The date of discharge of Mr Morrison's mortgage was 12 December 1974. I do not think he was a Minister then, although he might have been. However, he had the good grace to discharge his mortgage. As far as I can see there is no date of discharge in relation to Mr Anthony. The document I have here states that as at 1 October 1981 Mr Anthony still owes the Government $15,005.51 and he is getting that money at an interest rate of 4.75 per cent. As at 1 October this year Mr Nixon still had a mortgage of $28,404.14 and he receives that at an interest rate of 6.25 per cent. Mr Sinclair's mortgage was discharged on 6 August 1974. So the two people in question are Mr Anthony and Mr Nixon. Yet we find that young couples in this country today are having great difficulty in getting housing loans. They have to pay anything up to 15 or 20 per cent in interest rates. If they want bridging finance they have to pay a lot more to get a roof over their heads. We have a government which is prepared to let two Ministers on top salaries have money at the cost of the taxpayer. In one instance Mr Anthony still owes the Government $15,000 which he is getting at 4.75 per cent. Mr Nixon, who is in the news quite a lot lately, owes the Government $28,404 which he is getting at a rate of 6.25 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I pointed out that Mr Morrison's mortgage which was being repaid at a rate of 4.75 per cent, was discharged seven years ago. For Senator Baume's information, he discharged his loan, which was taken out over 45 years, as soon as he became a Minister in the Whitlam Government. Mr Anthony and Mr Nixon have not seen fit to discharge their mortgages. No, they are hanging on to them at cheap rates of interest at the expense of young couples in this country and at a time when this Government is making less and less money available to the young people of Australia for home loans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that the least I can say is that it is a damn disgrace. It is time the Government did something to stop paying out these perks to Ministers of the Government. This afternoon we had an exercise which involved the waste and misuse of taxpayers' money by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) who used a BAC 111 aircraft to go to Armidale to visit his son at a cost of $1,700 an hour. These are the types of people who are governing this country today. It is time something was done about it. I am very pleased to say that through continual agitation we have been able to expose these practices. I hope that young people who are listening to this debate tonight, some of whom have to sell their homes because they cannot keep up with mortgage repayments because of high interest rates on their loans, take cognisance of what has been said. I will be only too happy to let them have a copy of the document with which I have been provided tonight on an official basis. As I said, I had a copy of this document quite some time ago. However, this matter was swept under the carpet when I raised it in the Parliament some years ago. That is not now the case. The matter is out in the public arena and I think the people at large ought to take some action to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I plead again with the Ministers who sit in the chamber tonight-there are three of them-to ask Cabinet or their ministerial colleagues at least to show some consideration for the young people of this country and pay off those mortgages. I think it is a disgrace that a man like Mr Nixon, who has all the perks of office at his fingertips, still owes the Government $28,404 which he is getting at the very low interest rate of 6.25 per cent. Why, we have returned soldiers in this country living on blocks of land for which they have to pay much higher interest rates for loans. They have to make a living off that land. I am not aware that Mr Nixon served his country in the armed forces. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) who is in the chamber would know of the problems being faced by many ex-servicemen today because they cannot make enough on their farms to keep up the payment on high interest loans. As a result, a lot of them have had to leave their properties. I do not know whether Mr Anthony ever served in the armed forces. But these are people of privilege who are able to take advantage of low interest loans, made available to them by their colleagues. It is time that the three Ministers in the chamber tonight said something to them. It is time they asked them to repay those loans which they have had for such a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> I think I have said enough. The public is aware of what Ministers of this Government are doing. My colleague Senator Walsh and I have repeatedly sought to establish in this Parliament how many members of the Cabinet have money invested in income equalisation deposits. Senator Walsh has spoken at length on that matter. We cannot get an answer. Members of the Government will not deny that this is the case so what are we to assume-that in fact they have these investments and are ripping off the general public. It is time a change was brought about. Of course, it is time we had an election so that we can get a government which is honest to run this country. We do not want people who do everything possible to line their own pockets, people who do not need the money but who are ripping it off the poorer people of this country-the workers. I say again that it is a damn disgrace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On this matter I want to ask the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) and those who are advising her how it is that such mortgages were issued with no interest rate escalation clause. When one takes out a loan with the Commonwealth Bank there is a clause in the mortgage document which allows the interest rate either to rise or to fall according to the conditions that prevail in the market place. It is extraordinary that two Government Ministers have mortgages with fixed interest rates for a term of forty five years. It is fairly obvious that both those Ministers are taking advantage of those low interest rates. If they have a need for funds, why should they have to use a bank overdraft which would cost them nearly 16.5 per cent when they can comfortably use $28,000 of the Government's money at an interest rate as low as 4.25 per cent? That is a ridiculous rate of interest. One would understand if that rate of interest were made available to returned servicemen.</PARA></TALK.START>

It appears that the Senate now needs to express an opinion that these Ministers should divest themselves of these loans immediately. They cannot possibly continue ethically to be in this position. The first question then which the Minister may be able to answer for us is why two Government Ministers should have mortgages at such low fixed rates of interest over a period of 45 years. That is not sound lending practice at all. That is rather ridiculous. Was it done in error? Someone mentioned that there was an error in the mortgages. If it was done in error, there must be some way in which that error can be corrected. But something the Ministers can do immediately is to take steps to divest themselves of those mortgages and to borrow money, at normal interest rates, to pay back the Government these loans which are greatly to their advantage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Georges raised the question of the fixed interest rate clause. I just state again that the mortgages granted up to 20 September 1974 did contain a fixed interest rate clause. All people who had a Commonwealth of Australia mortgage at that time had it under those terms. That was the arrangement that existed. In 1974 this was changed and all mortgages that were issued after that date contained a variable interest clause. Persons who took out mortgages after that date in 1974, of course, have a variable interest rate clause. But many thousands of people in the Australian Capital Territory-I would hesitate to speculate on the number, but it would be countless-who had mortgages in the early years of the settlement of the Australian Capital Territory would have a fixed interest rate clause in their Commonwealth of Australia mortgage instruments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another change was that prior to 1974 mortgagees were permitted to transfer their interest in a Commonwealth of Australia mortgage when they sold the property. I can only say that this historically was the basis on which these mortgages were granted. The changes that I have mentioned have taken effect. Those who took out mortgages prior to the date of change, regardless of who they are or what level of position they may have in the community of Canberra, still hold them at that fixed rate of interest. It is not something about which I can give any other information, except to say that that was the practice at that time and that is the way in which the mortgages were written.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can we get an assurance from the Minister that this matter and the opinion of honourable senators who have spoken will be brought to the notice of the two Ministers concerned? I do not think it is necessary for us to move a motion stating that it is the opinion of the chamber that those two Ministers should divest themselves of the two mortgages promptly. One is tempted to move such a motion and to enter into a wider debate but surely the Minister, especially as she is the Minister for Finance, would be prepared to give us an assurance that she will bring the matter to the notice of the two Ministers to indicate that there is an unfair advantage to them that they ought not to be prepared to accept. They ought to show, as I think Senator McLaren said, some example to the rest of the community even though they are tecnically entitled to continue with such mortgages. It is fairly obvious that to this point they have had no intention of reducing the principal amount because a very cheap interest rate is payable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These Ministers would have gained other advantages in the normal run of economic change through buying their properties. The value of those properties must have increased substantially but that is another matter. Everyone gains under this system from an increase in property value. They have had an advantage in that direction which, possibly, one would not criticise. One would allow one's criticism to flow to the lack of a capital gains tax. There has been some difficulty in governments coming to a decision to tax capital gain. Both Ministers have managed to advance themselves financially in that direction. But this is another matter which is of considerable concern. I ask the Minister to transfer that concern to the two Ministers involved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A couple of matters need to be cleared up because of the interjections from the other side. Firstly, Mr Morrison's name was mentioned. Now that I have had time to have another look at the document I find that the amount of the loan which Mr Morrison took out was $7,000. He discharged that mortgage on 12 December 1974. Mr Grassby took out a loan of $7,958. He discharged that mortgage on 18 March 1976. Two other honourable members took out loans. One is an ex-Labor member of Parliament, Mr Bob Whan, and the other, Mr Ken Fry still is a member of Parliament. When we look at the notes on the bottom of the document we find that both of these persons obtained the loans as private citizens prior to becoming members of Parliament. Mr Whan borrowed only $9,000 as a private citizen. No doubt many other private citizens in Canberra availed themselves of such loans at that time and would have been paying the same rate of interest. Mr Fry borrowed $11,970. Let us compare those figures with the amounts of money borrowed by these Ministers. The purchase price of Mr Anthony's house in 1964 was $18,910. The amount of the loan he received was $17,964. He paid less than $1,000 as a deposit, yet he received most of the purchase price of the house at an interest rate of 4.75 per cent. He still owes $15,005 and some odd cents. He bought the house in 1964, which is 17 years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>

He borrowed $30,352 from the Government. He still owes $28,404.14. Honourable senators can see that whilst there have been a few interjections from the other side, two of the people about whom there have been interjections borrowed their money as private citizens and have long since paid the money back, although they took out the loans for 45 years. But they were honest people and they paid back the loans. From looking at the document we find that the allocations for Mr Anthony and Mr Nixon, who borrowed nearly the full amount of the purchase price of those homes are shown under the heading 'remarks' as 'a ministerial allocation'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am concernned only about the sitting members of parliament and, particularly, the Ministers of this Government. I concur with what was said by my colleague, Senator Georges, that something ought to be done. The Senate ought to be in the position to take some action to see that these two Ministers divest themselves of the loans that they are now carrying on these two houses. As I said before, it is a disgrace that two Ministers-two Cabinet Ministers at that-are able to carry on like this and rort the system while we have other people, particularly young couples who want to buy a home and rear a family, who are unable to get money because of the penny-pinching methods of this Government. </PARA>

We have been somewhat diverted by the revelations made by Senator McLaren which are matters of concern.

That brings to mind that conscience should prevail in matters such as those exposed by Senator McLaren.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to raise a matter concerning the Department of Science and Technology section of the report. I asked a question on notice in which I sought information from the Department of Home Affairs and Environment concerning amounts spent on Great Barrier Reef research. I have received an answer through the secretary of the Committee from the Department of Science and Technology giving a list of the various research projects being undertaken on the Great Barrier Reef. It is an impressive list but I must express some concern about one area. In this document there does not seem to be any evidence that substantial moneys are being spent on research on the crown of thorns starfish infestation of the Great Barrier Reef. I may be incorrect in my scrutiny of this document but it is a substantial document which was sent to the Estimates Committee by the Department of Science and Technology. The question I raise is: Where in this document is expenditure on the crown of thorns infestation shown? I think one or two amounts are shown but they amount to a few hundred dollars. Yet last time I raised the question I think an allocation of $100,000 had been made for crown of thorns research. It is pleasing to note that today the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) took a definite step in the confrontation with the Queensland Government and has decided that the marine park in the Cairns area will be declared. </PARA>

It has taken almost two years of argument with the State Government for the Australian Government to come to the point where it has made a decision based on its powers. If I recall correctly, we have been arguing for quite a number of years that on this matter there is very little chance of co-operation with the Queensland Government. That has been proven today. The Prime Minister has finally decided that after two years of discussions the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park will be declared and the Australian Government will accept its responsibilities. That is pleasing. What is not pleasing is that, although the large sum of money provided for research on the Great Barrier Reef is not being dissipated, because every item of research that is mentioned is worth while, it seems to have been spread over research which covers a great area of investigation that does not attach itself to the reef complex. In particular, it does not cover the main problem which the reef faces at present, that is, the starfish infestation, which recent reports say is increasing. The infestation appeared to have fallen away but is now starting to reappear, and previously devastated reefs are being devastated a second time. Simply, the question is: How much money is being spent on research in the area I have mentioned?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said I would take interjections from my left. I think the situation with regard to Ministers of the Crown receiving loans at low rates of interest-if what was said is correct-is scandalous and should be fixed forthwith. Those people should pay off the loans, as I certainly would if I had a loan on the kind of salary they are getting. Having finished with that matter, I move to the Department of Transport. First of all I refer to the Department of Transport's F28 aircraft, of which it has three. I used to be that when I went to a meeting with the people from the Department of Transport they would come along with a list of aircraft they had and the hours flown during the previous year. Unfortunately, this year I omitted to ask that question, and that is my fault. Perhaps it is time that the Department included that information in its Estimates. It has a considerable number of aircraft and the number of hours that those aircraft fly each year is not very considerable. I would like to have had from the Department a list of the aircraft on its register and the hours that they had flown. I hope that it is not too late to get that list.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the interrogation-that is a word I use knowingly of the Department of Transport-I asked what hours were spent in training the people who are examiners of airmen. I think this is one area which the Department of Transport needs to examine. I believe the amount of money spent on training people to check the pilots of this country is pretty exorbitant. It will be seen that the amount allocated for staff training in the Department of Transport Estimates has increased by 25 per cent this year compared with last year and that, out of a total of about $1.5m, over $0.5m is being spent for overseas travel and training. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it very difficult to understand the situation where people who fly a particular type of aircraft for only 12 hours a year are then able to sit behind a pilot who flies 40 times 10 hours a year-400 hours a year-and criticise the way that he flies that aircraft. I am not yet convinced-I interpose that I have been offered to be shown around by the Department of Transport in Melbourne but I have not yet had time to see the situation there-that the amount of time which has been spent on training on one type of aircraft, particularly in relation to the Jumbos and some of the other bigger aircraft that are flying around this country, is of any real benefit. I think the Department may well be able to save money in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I see that a certain amount of the flying time-some 66 hours-of the F28s in this coming year is being spent performing VIP aircraft travel at over $2,000 an hour, which is a cost in excess of those of the other aircraft that I mentioned earlier today. I think I said that the BAC111 costs nearly $1,700 an hour. For the benefit of those who do not understand anything about flying-like Senator McLaren from South Australia-the hours apply to when the aircraft is flying and not when it is sitting on the ground, be it in any other place than the capital cities. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T7">Senator TOWNLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get back to those matters. There is plenty of time yet. We have another week of sitting. The point is that Department of Transport aircraft are put down to fly 66.05 hours of VIP flights at $2,290 an hour. The only time I have flown anything like the 0.05 hours is when I flew at Geelong. I flew there once. The aircraft got into the air, fell down towards the ground and hit a fence. The Department of Transport put that down as 0.03 flying hours and charged me for it. Thank goodness I was not charged at nearly $2,300 an hour because I could not have afforded it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point is that I was told that the Department of Transport had bought the F28s for some tremendous amount-they are the same kind of aircraft that are flown in Western Australia by what used to be called MacRobertson Miller Airlines-to check facilities at different airports. At the time I criticised the purchase of those aircraft. I really do not think the Department needs three of these aircraft. Let me put it in perspective. If a company wants to make a profit out of running an aircraft it expects to get something like 3,000 hours a year from that aircraft. Here we have the Department of Transport running aircraft that I imagine are doing 400 hours to 500 hours a year. These aircraft are costing this country a lot of money. I think the Department should look at whether it really needs these F28s. </PARA>
<PARA> Another subject I would like to talk about is the light aircraft situation at the Hobart Airport. The restrictions on light aircraft at the airport are becoming increasingly severe. The position used to be that when a pilot took off in a light aircraft he could fly at his own discretion in a certain direction and at a certain height provided he did not go into the primary area where the larger aircraft were flying. But recently the position has changed. It seems that unless a pilot can guarantee to separate his aircraft by at least 1,000 feet vertically from any other aircraft that happens to be in the area he is not allowed to take off. This restriction is costing a lot of people who are learning to fly and who are taking joy flights around the area a considerable amount of money. It is over-restriction. It is not required. Perhaps I can illustrate the situation by saying that if I were to take off from Cambridge Airport to fly to Moorabbin I would require virtually none of the facilities of the Department of Transport although the facilities are costed against general aviation. When a pilot is going across Bass Strait he likes to be in contact with Melbourne radio or Launceston radio in case he falls in the water; but if he falls in the water in Bass Strait he will not have much chance of being found anyway, as we have found out on many occasions. Many Department of Transport charges are being costed against general aviation that should not be because the facilities are not required. The example I gave is perhaps a difficult one because anyone who flies across Bass Strait is obliged by regulation to report. But if a pilot is going from Moorabbin to South Australia, on no occasion would he need to contact the civil aviation authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> I have limited time in which to speak but there are two other matters I would like to mention. It has been announced that an international terminal is to be built in Hobart within the next year or so. I am not convinced that the proposed site for the building will be to the total benefit of the State. It is unusual for somebody from a particular area not to encourage the Government to go ahead with a new building because people think it will be great, extra building will be going on and it will benefit the whole community. Hobart has four international flights each week, two departures and two arrivals. It is anticipated that the building will cost over $1m. I believe both Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans Australia Airlines are against the proposal to place the terminal on the site that has been chosen. It is to be built in an area that has just had a display put in it. There is a parking area there. The proposed building will limit parking facilities. The airlines that are operating in Hobart at present want the terminal incorporated in the present one and I think that is the sensible thing to do at this stage. I hope that is something that the Department of Housing and Construction will look at seriously in the coming months. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to ask what happened in regard to the recent search in which the F111s were brought in to look for an aircraft that disappeared somewhere between Sydney and Melbourne. Are the costs attributed to the Department of Transport or to the Department of Defence? While everybody here would want to find anybody who happened to be alive after an air crash-I know what it feels like-the introduction of the F111 is an expense that I believe should be borne by the Department of Defence as a defence training item, just as I am told that many of the VIP aircraft come under the vote for the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are some of the matters that came to my notice when we went through the estimates. I would like to comment on the amount of money that is spent in sending pilots overseas for training so that they can then judge the ability of people who do many more hours than they do in Australia. Finally, I thank once again for their help the people from the various departments who came became me as chairman. If at any time I appeared a little aggressive I assure them that that is the way I am. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise two short matters. In the first instance I refer to the Department of Science and Technology. In this I follow the remarks of my Queensland colleague Senator Georges on the extent of research in that State. I wonder whether the Department could ascertain for me the truth or otherwise of the assertion made by a naturalist in Sydney that, notwithstanding the fair acquisition of natural parks and wildlife refuges in Australia, not enough attention has been given to the retention of the correct eucalypt species which is the staple diet of the koala. I wonder whether we have any up to date research which would refute or endorse that assertion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second matter is directed at the Department of Transport. I wonder whether we could get a tally sheet for the last 12 months indicating the extent of off-shore spillages around Australia. I know that they fall into two categories: Those which are refinery mishaps and those which occur in the open sea. The latest figures that I received indicate, in the first instance, that there appeared to be a tendency for flagships under Liberian and Panamanian flags to be the worst offenders. Secondly, in a number of cases we did not detect the offence. With the emergence of our responsibility for a 200-mile fishing zone there is a greater need to weed out these vessels. The last point I wish to raise has been raised by Senator Sibraa and relates to coastal surveillance. I think that a table for the last 12 months will indicate whether we have improved our batting average on detection. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate to add my words to the matter raised by Senator Townley concerning the spending of over $1m on an international air terminal in Hobart. We have a situation in which there are two flights a week in and out of Hobart to Christchurch, both of which are Boeing 727s and both of which have an average loading of less than 60 per cent. Bearing in mind that neither Ansett Airlines of Australia nor Trans Australia Airlines agrees with the building or the siting of the terminal, on what set of priorities was this decision made? The upgrading of both Hobart Airport and Launceston Airport is needed. The upgrading of the tarmacs at both Devonport and Wynyard airports in Tasmania is needed. Yet it seems to me that suddenly bobbing up at the top of the priorities is this extraordinary building to be built in Hobart which it has been predicted will cost just over $1m. By the time it is built the figure will probably be near $2m. There is no suggestion that the number of flights to and from Christchurch will increase or that any other international flights will be commenced. One just cannot understand the priorities that were set. I wonder whether we could have some answer as to why this is a top priority. Apart from the fact that Mr Hodgman and Mr Goodluck make a lot of noise, I can see no reason for having this as the top priority.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise a couple of issues concerning the Department of Transport. Before I do so I wish to remark on Senator Grimes's comments concerning the Hobart Airport terminal. He may be surprised to know that I agree with his general comments on the matter. It strikes me as being silly to set up a separate terminal when presumably normal airport services, such as milk bars and newsagencies, would have to be duplicated in that separate terminal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main matter that I want to raise concerns the air bridge subsidy to Tasmania. As far as I am aware, this matter is still unresolved as far as the north-west coast is concerned. I have not heard anything in recent days as to whether it has been decided. Some honourable senators may be aware that Trans Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia have been flying from Melbourne into the north-west coast ports of Wynyard and Devonport. But TAA is withdrawing as from next February and is being replaced by East-West Airlines Ltd. TAA has been receiving the air bridge subsidy which applies to all flights into Tasmania. But, as I understand it, the Government has still not decided whether East-West, as the replacement provider of that service, will receive the subsidy. I am seeking an assurance from the Government that it will not be applying a discriminatory policy on the north-west coast. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LH4">Senator JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a matter of fact I will tell the Committee something about Queensland. I wish to speak about the estimates of the Department of Transport. Recently a light aircraft crashed in Brisbane because the radar system in Brisbane was out of operation. The plane had to be directed to a new flight pattern and had to fly across a mountainous area. It developed engine trouble and had to land. On landing, it overturned and a number of people were hurt. However that matter is secondary to another matter I want to raise tonight but it is not unimportant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some time ago in this chamber I asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner), who represents the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt), a question concerning radar facilities at the Brisbane Airport. I asked how many radar systems were operational at the various airports and whether there were backup facilities at the airport in Brisbane. Part of my question was:</PARA>
<PARA> Is it considered fundamental to air transport safety to have a secondary back-up radar system in operation at major terminals. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister's answer to that part of the question was:</PARA>
<PARA> All of the electronic equipment in each of the departmental radar facilities is fully duplicated. </PARA>
<PARA>I imagine that the Minister would have been advised then by some of the same transport advisers who are advising him tonight. They said that the radar facilities are fully duplicated. Following the crash in Brisbane I had a discussion with some of the air traffic controllers and was informed quite clearly that the radar service was out from 10.15 a.m. until 1.45 p.m. Water got into one of the radar systems. Whilst it is said that the system is duplicated, it is not actually duplicated. It is physically joined. If one part of the system is being repaired, the other part of the system is out of order. The answer to the question is very misleading when it claims that all electronic equipment in each departmental radar facility is fully duplicated. It is not fully duplicated; in actual fact the two radar systems are physically joined. As I have said, the air traffic controllers have advised me that if one area of that radar system has to be repaired the whole radar system has to be stopped. </PARA>
<PARA> People can claim that the crash of the light aircraft was not caused by the radar system, but I was advised that if the air traffic controllers had been able to bring the aircraft in on the flight path on which it attempted to land and radar facilities had been available the aircraft could have been brought in on that flight path. It was only because those facilities were not available that its position had to be altered and it was decided to divert the aircraft to a flight path which light aircraft normally do not take in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot understand why the Department of Transport is saying that one of the safety precautions is duplication of facilities. The metropolitan area of Brisbane does not have duplicated facilities; the two facilities are physically joined. They are not duplicated and if there is a breakdown in one there is a breakdown in the other as both facilities have to be stopped for repairs. This happened a day ago and the repairs took about three and a half hours. In other words, a major airport in Australia was without radar facilities for three and a half hours. I would like the Department of Transport to answer some questions in relation to this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak very briefly on the provision of funds for the upgrading of airports in various parts of Australia. Reference has been made to some of the problems in Tasmania, but I believe that people need to be reminded that Tasmania does not enjoy the advantage which the other States enjoy of Commonwealth expenditure on an interlinking highway. There is a very substantial saving for Commonwealth revenue in that a highway does not have to be maintained, as is the case with highways between every other State, between Tasmania and its nearest State, Victoria. Therefore there are considerations and compensations to which Tasmania is entitled and which do not apply to the other States. Substantial funds are being made available for upgrading airports-I do not object to that-and all that is required so far as Tasmania is concerned, further than has been announced to date, is that the Commonwealth stop the nonsense of talking about Launceston Airport requiring local ownership before it can be upgraded to take unlimited Boeing 727 aircraft landings. The amount of money involved is a tiny fraction of what is proposed to be spent on most of the other upgradings that are taking place around Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Launceston Airport is the gateway to Tasmania. Launceston Airport is the closest major airport to the nearest State-Victoria. Launceston traditionally has been the tourism gateway through which package tours, fly-drive tours and all the rest take place. I supported Senator Townley, or alternatively he supported me, about getting Hobart to be the site for an international terminal. Between us and with the support of others-I am not suggesting it was not a concerted effort-the development of the international route between New Zealand and Tasmania ought to, and properly did, go to Hobart. But because Launceston Airport, as the major domestic gateway, did not receive that international status as it would have liked, that does not mean that we then abandon what is the major travel link between Victoria and Tasmania. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator PETER RAE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Mulvihill should not introduce irrelevancies. Let us get back to the realities of the problem. The problem is that for a sum of money which is probably only a little over $1m, Launceston Airport can be upgraded-all it requires is a reinforcement of the main landing strip and the tarmac area-to take unlimited 727 aircraft. That means that it will be available to continue to be used as the main domestic tourism gateway into the State. Already we have the situation in which all of the hire and drive, and bus tour operators use that airport. The tourist industry, which is an extremely important industry to Tasmania-the figures vary, but the assessment is that it is probably the third most important industry to that State-goes through that airport. I point out to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) that at the moment the Government is talking about deferring the promised upgrading until and unless it eventually gets some priority over the capital cities-work there will never finish-or until a local ownership proposal is put forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate Select Committee on Passenger Fares and Services to and from Tasmania received evidence from the Department of Transport. I have not had a chance to check, but I think the final letter was received on 18 June this year which was very shortly before the report was presented. Repeatedly throughout the evidence given to the Committee the indication was that there was a proposal for a relatively minor program of upgrading for Launceston and Hobart airports-it was relatively minor in comparison with that which is required for other States, particularly Queensland and for Sydney, for that matter-and that the upgrading of both airports would proceed. Never at any stage was there a suggestion that such upgrading would be subject to local ownership. Never at any stage was there a suggestion that there was any question that it would happen. The only question was in which order it would happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the point which I am making is that I would like to receive an assurance from the Minister tonight-if he is not in a position to give it tonight, then as soon as possible-that we will stop the nonsense of talking about local ownership of the Launceston Airport and get on with doing what the Government has indicated over the past couple of years and certainly over the past 12 months was going to happen; that is, that in accordance with the development of the airline industry in Australia, in accordance with the type of aircraft which are likely to be used, Launceston will maintain its opportunity to be able to continue to serve its role as the domestic tourism gateway to Tasmania. Whilst we also encourage Hobart Airport to develop as the international gateway, the fact is that it is very much cheaper for the average tourist to be able to use Launceston as the ingress point for a circuit trip around Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, I will start talking about breach of faith; I will start talking about people who welsh on deals; I will start talking about a number of things and I will get more and more strident unless I receive an assurance that we will not hear any more about the upgrading of Launceston Airport being dependent upon some local ownership plan being accepted. I do not mind if the announcement is that that upgrading will follow in the next financial year what is being done in relation to Hobart Airport, but if somebody starts to say that the plan is at risk as to whether it will happen within the next couple of years, then I am afraid that the Government is likely to hear a very great deal more about this from Tasmanian senators on both sides of the chamber. I would regard as a total breach of faith any stepping back to a situation in which Launceston, as the main gateway to Tasmania, is disadvantaged in being able to fulfil that role. </PARA>

In regard to Senator Townley's broader concern as to the operation of F28s, I think we should point out that F28s are not purely available for running around Australia for the purposes of delivering passengers; rather they are available for specific purposes on non-scheduled routes.

<PARA>ACCIDENT INVOLVING CESSNA 185 VH-BVY</PARA>
<PARA> The accident to Cessna 185 VH-BVY which occurred near North Pine Reservoir on Wednesday 11 November 1981 is currently under investigation by the Air Safety Investigation Branch. As the investigation is in its early stages the information which I am able to make available at this time needs to be recognised as provisional and some cannot yet be confirmed. </PARA>
<PARA> The aircraft was en-route from Rockhampton to Archerfield on a private flight with three persons on board. It was identified on radar and cleared initially to enter Brisbane controlled airspace at 5,000 feet. When identified the aircraft was about 10 miles east of its planned track. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of pending radar outage for planned maintenance, this clearance was then amended to proceed outside controlled airspace to Archerfield via the light aircraft lane of entry reporting to Brisbane Flight Service. This clearance had no effect on the required track the aircraft would follow. He would be required to descend from 5,000 feet to below 3,000 feet and then, prior to 16 miles DME Brisbane, below 2,000 feet. </PARA>
<PARA> In the vicinity of North Pine Reservoir, at the northern extremity of the lane of entry, the pilot advised Flight Service of a rough running engine and shortly afterwards that he was unable to maintain height. </PARA>
<PARA> It is perhaps worthy of mention that the prescribed lane passes to the west of the built up area of Brisbane, thus the possibility of the accident occurring within the built up area did not arise. This lane has been designed to be outside controlled airspace to provide ready access to light aircraft proceeding to and from Archerfield and locations to the north. </PARA>

<PARA> A scheduled inspection of the radar antennae was carried out at 5 a.m. on the morning of Wednesday 11 November. As a result of this inspection it was decided that some maintenance of the primary radar feed system would be required and would be done at a time convenient to operations. Because of the excellent weather, it was decided that the maintenance would be done later that morning. </PARA>
<PARA> The airlines were advised by Notam at 8.35 a.m. that the radar would be off for maintenance between 10.15 a.m. and 2.15 p.m. on Wednesday 11 November. The maintenance actions were completed within the notified time and the primary radar restored to service at 1.40 p.m. </PARA>

If the Department of Transport officers have not read it, I commend it to their attention, as well as a number of complaints that I have had about the provision of air services in Western Australia through the Department. A moment ago Senator Peter Rae said 'we must stop the nonsense we are talking.' I would like to adopt some of his words and suggest that we stop the nonsense that we are engaging in at the Perth Airport.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5V4">Senator COLEMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Haines says 'No more than could possibly help it'. To get into and out of the airport involves a tortuous journey. Perhaps I might relate a recent experience in that regard. On the occasion in question seats on an Airbus were being allocated. It was impossible for people who wanted to use the other airlines to get through. There were four queues. They had to go out of the airport and come back in to get their seat allocation through the other airlines. We now have some distance from the departure lounge, what is laughingly referred to as 'the pen' but I believe is officially entitled the arrival lounge. It is some hundreds of metres from where the aircraft normally pull up. There are no toilets, nor is there provision for them in this new section; nor are there any telephones. I realise that the development is in its very early stages but I point out that it is distinct and apart from the building that is already in existence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask honourable senators to imagine a situation in which, some hundreds of metres from the actual departure terminal we have this little arrival terminal. In front of the departure terminal some boxes are now being created. I understand that they will be departure lounges which will take the traffic away from the present departure lounge but will not make it any easier for people arriving in Perth actually to get into the arrival centre. I was informed that in fact the idea of having the arrival terminal was for the aircraft to pull up, passengers to disembark, and luggage to be unloaded. Passengers would be taken through the arrival terminal and then the aircraft would proceed to the departure lounge area and park. It may have been intended that this should happen, but it is not happening. I assure the Committee that the operation is extremely dangerous at the moment because there is a lot of unmade ground between where the aircraft pull up and where passengers have to go to collect their luggage. </PARA>
<PARA> I strongly suspect that this problem has developed because there is no overall plan for the Perth Airport-which, as a matter of interest, is supposed to be an international airport already-and we already have international arrival and departure lounges which are not always in use and which to the best of my knowledge have been used for domestic aircraft on only two separate occasions. We are now reaching a situation where we have to have messages broadcast over the public address system in the departure terminal to say that an aircraft has arrived and passengers may be met in the arrival terminal. Then people go out into the open and trot over this hazardous little walkway to meet the people who have come from the eastern States. I would have thought that it would be a fairly simple operation for the international arrival terminal to be used for all incoming domestic flights. I would be rather interested to know whether there is any reason why this cannot be done. On the two occasions on which I have been on a domestic flight which has arrived there the operation has been very quick and very convenient, the luggage has arrived very quickly and we have been able to quit the building with a minimum of fuss. With the present situation we find that people are coming in the wrong doors and going out the wrong doors, do not listen to announcements and do not know when the flights have arrived. There is a great deal of chaos and confusion. </PARA>
<PARA> What concerns me most perhaps is what will be the order for the future. I am sure that those representatives of the Department of Transport who bother to read my speech of 22 October, which is recorded at page 1590 of Hansard will be interested in what I had to say. I raised the comments that had been made by Mr H. B. O'Keefe, Transport Australia's First Assistant Secretary, about the key equipment, some of which he said was almost 20 years old and being kept going with cannibalised spare parts. In that speech I made the very valid point that this was an extremely dangerous situation. The people of Western Australia and those who use the Perth Airport are entitled to know that the equipment that takes them up and brings them down is in good working order. I sincerely trust that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs can give me some comprehensive reply tonight-or if not tonight, at least in the very near future- as to the future of Perth Airport; whether there is a master plan and when I can see it and discuss it with his officers; and when in fact an appropriation is to be made for the upgrading of the equipment that appears to be so necessary to keep the airways in operation. Mr O'Keefe said:</PARA>
<PARA> If the Standing Committee on Public Works . . . gives the go ahead the new tower should be in operation by late 1984. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to think that we will have an overall plan and a new tower long before that time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems to me that tonight the chamber is doing its best to fulfil Mungo MacCallum's prediction that after last night's debacle the Senate's next trick would be to levitate, and the closest we are going to get to it is talking about airports. I really would hate not to be part of that. While we are discussing the Department of Transport and the airways in particular, I wish to raise two matters. One of them concerns the terminal building at Mount Gambier Airport. I imagine that that airport is in much the same situation as Perth Airport in that it is hardly an appropriate entry for tourists into what is for South Australia a prime tourist area. Although it is not exactly a Nissen hut, the terminal building in Mount Gambier is tin. I understand that it is in that state because there has been some bickering for some time between the Federal Government and the local government over whose responsibility it is to pay for, provide, build or whatever, a new terminal building. The debate was not enhanced in any way at all when a week or so ago the South Australian Minister for Tourism, Mrs Adamson, was down in the south-east to crown the festival queen and was chided by one of the local residents over the situation. Her solution was to suggest somewhat flippantly that since the south-east is a prime area for the timber industry perhaps a little self-help would not hurt and they could build it themselves. That hardly seemed, to any of the 500 people who listened to her comment, an appropriate way of solving the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter of the airport at Hamilton was raised by a member of the Mount Gambier community who was there that night. He made the point that it seemed somewhat inappropriate that a town such as Hamilton, which has a population half that of Mount Gambier, should have a terminal building so much better than the one in the south-east. I understand that Hamilton is in the electorate of Wannon. The name of the honourable member for Wannon escapes me at the moment, but he obviously has considerably more pull than the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter), in whose electorate Mount Gambier is situated. </PARA>

It is the gateway for tourism in the south-east, and that is an important industry for South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second matter I want to raise is in elaboration of a matter I raised in Question Time this morning. It concerns what seemed to me rather odd priorities within the Department of Transport in relation to an internatioanl airport in South Australia sited somewhere near Adelaide. Senator Townley was complaining bitterly earlier about the waste of $1m in upgrading a terminal--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Townley" NAMEID="8T7">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T7">Senator Townley</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whatever it was, it certainly sounded bitter from this side of the House, but since interjections were not being taken from this side we really could not be quite certain of the tone of the honourable senator's attack. However Senator Townley was complaining, he nevertheless was complaining about the fact that $1m was being wasted on that upgrading. If he thinks that is bad, we are spending or are about to spend somewhere between $5m and $7m upgrading Adelaide's airport so that it can take, according to the South Australian Minister for Transport, something like three or four international flights per week. While I do not disagree with Mr Wilson that South Australia is disadvantaged with international flights since for us to get anywhere overseas other than to Kangaroo Island we have to go via another capital city and add that domestic air fare to our international air fare, I would disagree with the short term solution which is being proposed, presumably by the Department of Transport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For those honourable senators who do not come to Adelaide with any frequency I point out that Adelaide's airport is in the centre of a residential area. It is some 10 kilometres from the city centre of Adelaide. It is on a large slab of prime residential land in a city which is bounded on its eastern side by the hills and on its western side by the sea and, therefore, is forced to spread north and south for any residential development and expansion. It seems to us rather absurd that the Government is planning to spend $5m to $7m to put in a temporary international terminal on the present Adelaide Airport site simply to accommodate three or four flights a week, unless the Government is planning on progressively increasing these flights over the years, as it does with taxes. It would seem much more appropriate to bring forward the projected time of building a proper international airport for South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment we are assured by the Premier of South Australia that that will occur somewhere around the turn of the century, although I would not hold my breath waiting bearing in mind the state in which South Australia now finds itself. We are also assured that it will be built well on the outskirts of Adelaide in a non-residential area. I therefore question seriously the priorities of the Department of Transport in spending this amount of money at this time when it is clearly planning to spend an even larger amount of money in the very near future to do the job properly. I ask the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) not only when the terminal facilities at the Mount Gambier Airport will be upgraded but also when South Australia will get its much-needed and deserved international airport terminal outside a major residential area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief, but I would like to comment upon just a couple of points which were brought up by honourable senators who spoke before me in this debate. The first point is that I do not wish it to be understood that I feel that Hobart Airport should have no money spent on it. Its present terminal should be upgraded rather than a new terminal built. I failed, I think, to make that clear. But I agree with Senator Coates-maybe this will be the one and only time that we agree-that the way in which money should be spent at Hobart Airport is by upgrading the present terminal rather than building a separate terminal. As I said earlier, I think both Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans-Australia Airlines would agree with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like another question answered. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) talked about the F28s owned by the Department of Transport which will spend 66.05 hours on VIP travel in the coming year. I want to know: If they have four tonnes of electronic equipment on board, how will they be suitable for VIP travel? Does that mean that the Department has quick change F28s; that it can rip out all those tonnes of equipment and put in VIP facilities? I would like, if possible, either now or in the near future, a list of just how those F28s will be used in VIP travel. </PARA>

I will need to take on notice Senator Mulvihill's question on koalas. I will get back to Senator Mulvihill as soon as possible on that. The oil pollution statistics can be obtained for Senator Mulvihill at relatively short notice. Again, I will undertake to do that as quickly as possible.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I understand that. I am sure that the honourable senator's concerns have been noted tonight by the Department of Transport. Opportunities will be provided for further discussions in that regard also. Two airports in South Australia were mentioned. Senator Haines referred to Mount Gambier Airport. Most of us know Mount Gambier Airport well. I believe this is an area of concern. As the honourable senator indicated, it is an important tourist area of South Australia and does represent a gateway to that State. I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) and I will indicate Senator Haines's very real concern. She made the point, when referring to the Adelaide Airport, that perhaps there ought to be a movement towards the establishment of another airport further outside of the metropolitan area rather than a redevelopment of the present airport. Perhaps I should just make one or two points on this because she was referring to priorities and that does include the question of finance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> An amount of $7m, which is currently in mind with regard to the extension of terminal facilities at Adelaide Airport so as to provide an international type facility, compares very favourably, in terms of priorities, considering a possible 15 years use that would be obtained from that facility, with the estimated cost of some $200m-$300m which might be involved in the development of another airport outside of Adelaide. Of course, we have to bear in mind the very considerable time it would take-maybe between eight and ten years-before such an airport could be constructed and got under way. The present facility which is in mind for Adelaide would be in operation, I think, within the next couple of years. Therefore, I believe the Government's priorities are correct in this regard. Indeed, this does give us breathing space as we look ahead to the increased services and usages as South Australia develops, particularly in the minerals area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment on the information that was given that only $5,000 out of some $1,250,000 has been spent on starfish research. I have received an assurance that the matter will be brought to the attention of various authorities. It seems to me to be extraordinary that research on starfish infestation should be allotted such a small amount. One would now have to ask: Where are the reports that resulted from the expenditure of some $110,000 over past years? I know that research has been undertaken in the past. I know that a report has been brought down. My opinion was that the report was not conclusive and suggested that instead of reducing the amount spent on research into the infestation problem there should have been an increase. I wonder whether competition and the arguments that exist between scientists have led us to fall in between their varying opinions as to whether there is cyclic infestation of starfish, whether it is of short proportions, or whether it is a cyclic infestation of great magnitude which could lead to the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef at a time when there are other pressures upon the Reef. I hope that is not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know that there has been some conflict between the scientists at the James Cook University and the scientists at the University of Queensland. I am interested to know how much research money is going to the James Cook University and how much is going to the University of Queensland. I would not like to put any money on it, but I would say that a substantial amount of the research money is going to the James Cook University. If that is the case and the James Cook University has some say in decisions as to where the money is to be spent, of course we would find that the priority given to the crown of thorns starfish problem has been downgraded. I will from time to time raise in the Senate the question of this infestation as I have done in the past. The fact that only $5,000 is being spent at a time when all indications are that infestation is increasing substantially is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> I am surprised that we have not come back to the matters raised by Senator Jones which concerned the safety of airports and of people. Senator Jones was not concerned with further extensions or upgradings; he was concerned with safety. A very real problem exists at the Brisbane Airport. The Estimates Committee was able to ascertain through questioning that a shortage of air traffic controllers at Brisbane Airport has presented a problem. This matter has been the subject of questions in the Senate and especially in the Committee. The Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) made a statement that a training program is now underway to make up for the shortfall of air traffic controllers. Questioning by the Committee revealed that for some reason or other a failure to anticipate the wastage by retirement at Brisbane Airport has led to a shortfall and that that shortfall has aggravated the problem. Because of their increased work load the air traffic controllers who were available have been affected. The point was reached where they began to fail. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have the ridiculous situation of a 9 o'clock curfew at Brisbane Airport. I travel from Sydney to Brisbane regularly. It is not a very comfortable feeling to know that on some occasions the last flight on which one is travelling has to come in much more rapidly in order to beat the curfew. That means that there is still a safety problem as far as Brisbane Airport is concerned because of a shortage of controllers. The Department of Transport does not seem to have taken emergency action to transfer air traffic controllers to Brisbane Airport. Surely there are controllers elsewhere who are not so much surplus but available to work at Brisbane Airport if they were paid the necessary working away from home allowance. I hope that the Department of Transport does not take economies into account when it considers the problem at Brisbane Airport. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jones also raised the question of radar equipment. What he has revealed is a matter of consequence. He was given the incorrect answer. In fact there is no backup system at all. In fact the systems are connected. When one fails the other must be shut down in order to repair it. In this case it led to an accident with a small aircraft, but it could have led to an accident with one of the larger aircraft. One could argue that the backup should not have been repaired until such time as it was convenient to close both down. But in an airport of the size and status of Brisbane Airport such an arrangement surely is not acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the matter Senator Jones has raised should be answered now. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) said that he had further information. What does he do? He incorporates it in Hansard, as if it is a matter of concern between himself and Senator Jones. It is a matter of concern for all once it is raised. I would have thought the Minister would have read the document and given us that information. Its incorporation in Hansard means that the Hansard reporter has taken the document with him. What was in that document? What can the Minister tell us here which may have some spread of interest and which could allay the fears of people who land at Brisbane Airport?</PARA>
<PARA> Surely the Minister and the Department of Transport must by now accept that the position at Brisbane Airport is unacceptable by any standards. At present we have daylight saving, which enables aircraft easily to beat the curfew. We want an assurance tonight from the Minister that at the end of this six-month period, when the normal hours between the two States are restored, there will be sufficent air traffic controllers to enable the curfew to be lifted. Again I say that this is a matter of safety. It is not a matter of just increasing the length of a runway or doing any other thing. It is a matter of making safe those existing facilities which are not safe at the moment. There will arise a situation in which aircraft landing in Brisbane will not be under proper control. Really that is not acceptable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I regret that I was not here to hear Senator Jones's speech and it would be improper for me to comment on it without having heard what he said. But I think Senator Georges raised one real point, that is, the manning of Brisbane Airport with air traffic controllers. It is a most inexcusable lapse of management on the part of the Department of Transport. I do not agree that safety is involved at all here. I think on most occasions we are safer if we do not have air traffic controllers around, as America has proved in the last few months. I accept that there is a need for them with regular public transport aircraft, but what I cannot understand is why the curfew had to be applied between roughly 9 p.m. and 12 midnight when there is an existing curfew between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Why the necessity arose to take controllers off between 9 o'clock and 12 o'clock has me completely mystified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been a lot of talk about the shortage of controllers, and I do not doubt that there is a shortage. But it is also a fact that the maximum number of controllers have not been rostered in Queensland. There are controllers pushing bits of paper around the headquarters in Wickham Street in the Valley and at Aviation House who could well be rostered for air traffic duties in Brisbane. Other controllers in Queensland acting as officers in charge of various posts up and down the coast could be pulled in, as could various other people doing administrative tasks around Australia who are fully qualified as air traffic controllers. We have an emergency insofar as Brisbane and Queensland are being penalised from both an economic point of view and a convenience point of view by not having the standard of control or supervision which the Department has taken upon itself to provide and which it is now not providing. I find that a most glaring oversight. </PARA>

Firstly, is the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) in a position to indicate whether the working party that was established to examine the vitamin supplement issue has met and, if so, how often, what progress has been made and what modus operandi has been followed? The second matter relates to the dialogue that has ensued between the mothers of the Down's syndrome children and the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar). This matter was featured in the Sydney Press last weekend. Apparently the Minister has ruled that those mothers are unable to get certain medical fund reimbursements. In the dialogue that ensued the Minister claimed that the West German specialist who is applying a cure has not supplied sufficient detail. That is fair enough. I suppose we have to be sure about any secondary effects. But I notice that the spokeswoman for the mothers of Down's syndrome children argued over 10 days ago that the information has been supplied. I feel that perhaps the Minister could be more specific, narrow down the dispute and say just where the West German information is lacking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have already spoken to the Minister about the third matter I want to deal with, which involves a greyhound named Rugby-quite a good name-imported from Britain. The dog arrived in Australia at the relatively new animal quarantine depot at Wallgrove, which is inland beyond Sydney. Formerly the animal quarantine station was at Abbotsford. I am a resident of the electorate of Lowe and I have a fair knowledge of the area. I know that there were great hopes that with the new centre the animal mortality rate would be virtually non-existent. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a letter from Mrs Schelling outlining the saga of Rugby the greyhound, which weighed 62 lbs when it arrived in Australia and which wasted away to 32 lbs, together with an extract from the National Dog Journal giving the other side of the story, which is headed 'Canberra Refutes ''Gross Neglect'' at Wallgrove'. </PARA>

<PARA>LETTER FROM MRS SCHELLING</PARA>
<PARA>Shaaltarah Kennels Kangaroo Ground 3097 8 May 1981 The Hon. M. J. MacKellar,</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament Offices,</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra, ACT</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> I enclose photograph of my recently imported Greyhound, 'Harestreak Triple Crown (imp. UK)'-house name 'Rugby'. It will attest even more to my plight than the also enclosed report by my Veterinary Surgeon, Dr Hugh Wirth, who is, incidentally, Victorian President for the RSPCA. The photograph was taken shortly after the dog's release from the new, 'luxury' quarantine station at Wallgrove on 24 April. He weighed 65 lbs in mid November, at 5 1/2 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Wirth has just informed me that Rugby died this morning-weight 32 lbs. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me point out that this Greyhound was not a racing Greyhound. He was in fact one of the only two living male exhibition Greyhounds from the British Kennel Club Stud Book to come to Australia. The other served his quarantine confinement as a kennel mate of Rugby and was in similar condition at release. His constitution was able to stand the necessary changes to diet and environment and he has gained 15 lbs to date. Poor Rugby was not so lucky and was first hospitalised on 27 April for intensive care. </PARA>
<PARA> It should not be necessary to point out that this dog represents the outlay of many thousands of dollars. Shipping costs alone amount to four figures and Rugby's value to the ancient breed of Greyhound in Australia was inestimable. He was acquired after extremely difficult negotiations, years of waiting and personal travel worldwide, study of the breed and pedigrees etc. etc. Since his breeder was reluctant to submit the dog to quarantine in any case, it is highly unlikely that she will ever send a replacement, if indeed a suitable one can be found. Rugby was a son of Englands top male-all breeds and was imported specifically as a mate for Australasia's No. 1 Sighthound, my Champion Solstrand Diamond Lil (Imp. UK), who won the 'Contest of Champions' last October, defeating the absolute top winning stars of all other breeds of canine from all over Australia. Needless to say she is world famous in the dog scene and her puppies by Rugby were eagerly awaited and in great demand. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not new to the business of importation of livestock into Australia. I have in my twenty years as a successful breeder, exhibitor and international judge of dogs, imported some 15 dogs from Great Britain, New Zealand and from USA. I have owned and, or bred some 100 Australian Champion Afghan Hounds, Greyhounds and Italian Greyhounds. I have also exported many dogs. My previous imports have been quarantined in Melbourne and in Perth. Never have I had the problems which I experienced in this instance. I am not alone in my disenchantment with the new NSW complex and can furnish names of others whose dogs were released in far from unsatisfactory condition. In addition, complaints about the attitude of one Miss Syder, Collector of Public Moneys, were universal. </PARA>
<PARA> I visited my dogs at Wallgrove on 17 March, some six weeks after arrival and found them both to be in extremely poor condition. I complained to the young attendant, known to me as Roy, and asked that the dogs' food be increased. In addition the dogs' feet were badly splayed and growing joints swollen due to their trying to maintain footing on the entirely unsuitable, shiny, slippery and seemingly constantly wet surface of the kennel. I had understood from publicity regarding the new kennels that 'vet bedding' was used. My dogs had no bedding, not even a raised wood platform, and had been forced to sleep on the same concrete floor. As a result they developed pressure sores on their already swollen and painful joints. Since both dogs were puppies going through what should have been their greatest growth period, their alarming weight drop had me concerned. I am of the understanding that dogs are weighed weekly whilst quarantined. Surely the dogs' weight charts should also have caused concern to the persons responsible. In the light of previous experience with Melbourne quarantine, I was naive enough to think that this would be rectified. </PARA>
<PARA> On my second visit, one month later, I was horrified to find that the situation had worsened. The dogs were even thinner, their feet and joints worse, and Rugby definitely lethargic and losing hair in handsful. This time they had some form of bedding-a bag of wood chunks, which was wet. At this time I had three breeder friends of wide experience with me, including one from USA. Let me say that we were all horrified and I was ashamed of our government, to say the very least. As there was only three days until the dogs would be released I felt that they would survive until I was able to instigate a reversal at home. It was always my understanding that all dogs were routinely dosed for worms on admittance and prior to release. I will direct your attention to the vet report in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know the qualifications demanded of attendants working in Wallgrove, nor do I believe that the blame can be entirely laid at the boy's feet. I was charged a fee of $30 for veterinary inspections and a 'Form QA12', declaring that the dogs were in good health was signed after final veterinary inspection immediately before release. Since wasting is a symptom of Leptospirosis, one of the diseases which quarantine is supposed to guard against, it could have been possible that a diseased dog was being released to spread that horror far and wide. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I am informed that Animal Quarantine will be transferred to the jurisdiction of Primary Industry, the case in question is entirely the responsibility of your department of government and there are many areas of Animal Quarantine which warrant questions being asked and satisfactory answers given. In spite of the fact that previous complaints along these lines have been totally disregarded in the past I intend to pursue this matter to the limit of my resources. </PARA>
<PARA> A copy of this letter is being forwarded, along with the photograph and veterinary report, to the Australian National Dog Press, the British Canine Press, the Greyhound press and to all commercial dog shipping agents in the UK. The breeder of the dog will take the matter as far as she can in Britain, and will personally visit Australia House. My own further actions will, of course, depend upon your actions. </PARA>
<PARA> I sincerely hope that you will find the time to give this matter immediate attention. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours faithfully, Lynette O. Schelling (Mrs)</PARA>
<PARA>EXTRACT FROM 'NATIONAL DOG'</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra Refutes 'Gross Neglect' at Wallgrove</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The following letter has been received from the Commonwealth Department of Health, Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst it is not our normal practice to enter into controversy concerning the use of government facilities, I feel compelled to comment on the letters which have appeared in your newspaper on the last 2-3 months dealing with the death of Mrs Schelling's greyhound dog 'Rugby'. </PARA>
<PARA> I must stay at the outset, that I have chosen not to comment earlier as the circumstances surrounding the death of the animal were unclear and, as is normal in these types of cases, a full investigation was being undertaken by this Department. </PARA>
<PARA> However I take strong exception to Mrs Schelling's continued attempts to discredit the staff at the Wallgrove facility, to question the integrity of the veterinary supervision, and to downgrade the facilities and their design. </PARA>
<PARA>1. The dog entered quarantine on 24 January at age 7 months and weighing 26kgs. </PARA>
<PARA>2. During its stay in quarantine the animal suffered diarrhoea on 3 occasions. On each occasion the diarrhoea was not persistent and was cleared up in a couple of days with routine treatment. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Mrs Schelling visited the animals twice during the quarantine period. During these visits the animal's general condition was discussed as was the ainmal's diet. At no stage did she register any complaint about the animal's condition or its level of care. </PARA>
<PARA>4. The dog was released from quarantine on 24 April to its owner. At that time the animal weighed 28kg, a gain of 2kg during the quarantine period. </PARA>
<PARA>5. The animal was in a fit condition and Mrs Schelling signed the release to that effect without any comment to station staff, other than to thank them for their efforts. </PARA>
<PARA> This Department has sought and obtained a report from the private veterinarian who treated the dog after its release from quarantine. We have also sought advice from a veterinary parasitologist at Sydney University concerning the claim that the dog was suffering from a ''horrendously high parasite infection''. </PARA>
<PARA> The veterinary report and a pathology profile of the animal prior to its death both indicate that the animal was dehydrated and that its symptoms were ''not inconsistent with the clinical pattern of canine parvovirus disease''. </PARA>
<PARA> The opinion of the veterinary parasitologist, was that any effect of the number of roundworms found on a dog of that size would be absolutely minimal. </PARA>
<PARA>No Gross Neglect</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of the above facts, I am quite unable to accept Mrs Schelling's accusations of 'gross neglect, severe undernourishment and a horrendously high internal parasite infestation', as the reason for the dogs death. Veterinary experts who have studied the history of the animal are almost unanimously of the opinion that the animal was infected with canine parvovirus. </PARA>
<PARA> On the broader aspects of the complaints, I would wish to point out the following facts:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Rugby was accommodated in a block of kennels under the control of an employee who has worked at animal quarantine stations for 11 years and is respected for his abilities and attitude by many importers. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. The officer who had direct responsibility for Mrs Schelling's dog was a recent employee at the station. He has however been involved in dog breeding for over eight years. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Staff at the station are recruited on the basis of quality and affinity with animals and all staff have undergone or are currently undertaking, the animal care courses offered by technical colleges. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Staff involved in animal care are not involved in day-to-day ground maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA> The staff of the Wallgrove Station are extremely dedicated and justifiably proud of their record of animal care. Since its opening in June 1980, the station has accepted 744 cats and dogs and to date there have only been two deaths in the station. Both of these cases were diagnosed as being caused by stress induced infection. Stress of travel is unfortunately commonly seen in animals coming such great distances by air and this demands, careful handling at the time of entry into quarantine. Since its opening, the staff of the station have received in excess of 100 letters of thanks and commendation as opposed to the one letter of complaint from Mrs Schelling. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Schelling's statement concerning the provision of bedding and the hosing out of kennels are incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA> All animals are provided with bedding. The bedding comprises two chaff bags partly filled with wood shavings. This type of bedding has found to be eminently suitable and sensible. It provides the animals with a warm soft sleeping surface which can easily be aired and is cheap to replace when soiled or damaged by the animal. The bedding is destroyed following the release of the animal. </PARA>
<PARA> Kennels are hosed out on an as required basis, dependant on the habits of the animals. Some boisterous animals (including Rugby) tend to spread excreta over themselves and their bedding. On average, kennels are hosed twice per day and remain wet for 10-15 minutes. During hosing down, the bedding is hung on the wall of the kennel. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to diet, animals are fed on a diet determined by the kennelman in conjunction with the veterinary officer. Animals are fed dry dog biscuits in the mornings and fresh meat of a night. The meat is either cooked or raw depending on the animals individual requirements at the time. Dietary supplements are added to the prepared food as required. Rugby was fed 3lb of meat per day plus biscuits, calcium and dietary additives to assist weight gain and was released weighing 61.6lbs (28kg) not 39lbs as claimed by Mrs Schelling. His diet was specifically raised with her. </PARA>
<PARA> All food is prepared in a central preparation area prior to distribution to individual kennel blocks. It is held in the grooming room prior to placement in each kennel. </PARA>
<PARA> Grooming and bathing of animals is performed on an as required basis. All animals are bathed as soon as possible following arrival and again within 48 hours of release. They are also bathed as required at other times. Records of baths and grooming are kept. Similarly, animals are brushed at least once per week, with long haired animals being groomed as often as three times per week.</PARA>
<PARA>Full Vet Inspection</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> All animals undergo a full veterinary inspection on arrival and are visited twice per week by a veterinarian during the course of their stay. Prior to release they again undergo a full veterinary inspection with particular reference to their history during their stay. </PARA>
<PARA> Criticism of the facilities at Wallgrove is particularly ill-founded. The station is the most modern in Australia and incorporates a number of design features intended to ensure quarantine security and also to assist in the welfare of animals. </PARA>
<PARA> The kennel compound is designed on a block concept with each kennel being of rabies proof design. This ensures that any spread of disease would be minimal and that in the event of exotic disease outbreaks, each block can be treated as a discrete unit. This is in contrast to other stations in Australia which for exotic disease purposes must be treated on a full station basis. Each kennel includes a sheltered sleeping area and an open exercise area. The roofs of all sleeping areas are fully insulated and portable heating and cooling equipment is available. All walls are completely impervious to maintain hygienic conditions and allow full disinfection when required. </PARA>
<PARA> The cattery is similarly designed on a block concept, with individual cat accommodation designed to ensure minimal disease transmission. They are specifically designed to avoid cross air circulation and prevent the spread of viral respiratory disease and other problem diseases associated with the caging of cats. Each cat cage includes a basking area where the animal can enjoy maximum sunlight without exposure to adverse weather. </PARA>
<PARA> Since its inception, there has not been a single case of upper respiratory infection transferred from one cat to another in the station. </PARA>
<PARA>Future Emergencies</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The size of the Wallgrove facility has been determined taking into account the foreseeable demand, any future emergency and to provide buffer accommodation against future changes in quarantine importation policy. I would point out that the station is already accepting animals from the Pacific region which are required to undergo nine months quarantine periods and again staff have had nothing but praise from importers of these animals. To date 25 dogs have performed the nine months at the station, one winning a show within two days of release. The large size of the facility has already produced tangible benefits for importers through its ability to accept large shipments of animals on charter flights, which has considerably reduced importing costs. It is worth noting that stud dogs represent only 5-10 per cent of the imports, the remainder being pets. </PARA>
<PARA> The record of the Wallgrove station speaks for itself, and I would suggest to any of your readers who may have doubts about the ability or attitude of the staff or the suitability of the facilities that they should contact the station and either discuss the matter with the Officer-in-Charge or arrange with him to undertake an inspection of the facilities. I believe that you will find that the Officer-in-Charge is justifiably proud of his staff and the facilities and that he can produce documented evidence to support the excellent record of the station. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also thank those who have written in support of our staff and facilities. This support is most important to the morale of the staff at theses facilities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a matter that concerns both the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) and the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar). I refer to health cards for overseas students. It is a matter I have been working on for some time in trying to put together a cohesive picture, which is very difficult. Senator Coleman asked a question about this matter only a couple of days ago and, if I recall correctly, received a totally unsatisfactory reply from the Minister. In fact, on 15 September as is recorded at page 730 of Hansard I asked the Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, a question about the matter of health cover for overseas students. In the response he gave to that question after Question Time he outlined for me health care guidelines for temporary visitors, including overseas students studying in Australia. At that time he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Overseas students who are sponsored by governments or other bodies are not eligible for health cards. </PARA>
<PARA>But a circular memo dated 10 August-more than a month before the Minister answered by question-to private students from the Australian Development Assistance Bureau states:</PARA>
<PARA> A private student who is financed by his home government or an international agency, or by an employer or other organisations in the home country will be eligible for a health card . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is, provided certain conditions are met under the residence test. Despite the fact that these students have to meet some conditions the Minister's answer appears to be in direct contradiction to the ADAB memo. What I would like to know is who was right. Does the Minister really know the rules of eligibility as they relate to overseas students studying in Australia? How well informed are his departmental officers as to the rights of those students? It seems that this, like most other aspects of the health card system, is in a state of chaos. No one is able to give a straight answer as to who is and who is not eligible. In fact, depending on to whom one speaks one can get a whole range of conflicting answers in relation to one set of circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> During the past week an overseas student doing post-graduate study at the University of Tasmania came to me to try to untangle the health card mess for him. His wife was ill and he could not afford the cost of health care on his scholarship. His wife had not been in Australia for the statutory six months. The student had been given the runaround and my staff was given the runaround, not because of any bureaucratic red tape but simply because departmental officers have not been properly informed about overseas students' rights or eligibility. They are still as confused about the new health card system as the rest of the population. One of the problems is the multiplicity of departments involved. The Department of Health decides one aspect of it. The Department of Social Security decides another aspect. If the students are from overseas the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs may be involved. The Department of Foreign Affairs through ADAB, in particular, is involved and the system is a total shambles. </PARA>
<PARA> A series of changes to the guidelines since 1 September has only added to the confusion of the departmental officers and the students are having enough trouble coming to terms with a new culture anyhow. I understand that eligibility guidelines have been changed at least twice since 1 September. If that is the case, why has not the Minister informed the Parliament that he has updated his previous answer to me, particularly in view of the fact that questions on this subject have already been asked? Surely he had a duty to update his previous answer when it proved to be wrong. A Department of Social Security memo dated, I believe, 21 October sets out the rights of these students under various headings such as New Zealand students in Australia, students sponsored by ADAB, students on university scholarships and so on. I ask the Minister whether he will table a copy of this memo so we will all know what is going on and when overseas students come into our offices seeking some accurate answers we can pass on the information. Does the Minister expect that the confusion will continue for some further time while his Department attempts to sort out the health care mess created by his Government? I would like to know when the Government will get its act together on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> A more recent memo dated, I believe, 2 November-only a few days ago-changes the eligibility of dependants of ADAB sponsored students. On 1 September dependants were not eligible for health cards. They had either to face the high cost of health care in this country from their own resourses or to take out health insurance with a private fund. Two months later the Government changed its mind and decided that dependants could have health cards after all. The 2 November memo said that section 19 (2) of the Health Insurance Act now ceases to apply to dependants of ADAB-sponsored students. I doubt that the students have been properly informed of this new access to health care in Australia. I doubt that Senator Chaney's departmental officers are aware of the change as they should be. I suspect that if last week these people decided to get a health card from the Department of Social Security in Hobart they would have been turned away. </PARA>
<PARA> When was the decision made to change this aspect of overseas students' rights? When were officers of the Department of Social Security, the Department of Health and the ADAB part of the Department of Foreign Affairs informed of the changes? I would like to know who first made the decision. Has an interdepartmental committee actually come to some final decision about the matter? Will there be any retrospectivity in relation to medical fees incurred during the two months that the students' dependants were not covered by health cards? That brings me to the point of the unrealistic demands on students who qualify for health cards. As I understand it-I have to put that qualification in the current unsatisfactory situation-ministerial approval was given for ADAB to meet the medical and hospital costs of families of sponsored students so long as prior approval was obtained for all treatment and the treatment is essential. Does that mean that the hospital or doctor involved has to check with ADAB before treatment is prescribed? If that is the case, who in ADAB gives the okay? Who decides whether the treatment is essential?</PARA>
<PARA> I note also that ADAB would not meet the cost of prescribing or purchasing contraceptives yet, by inference, any medical consultation or treatment for pregnancy-if conception occurred in Australia-would be covered by ADAB. To clarify that, ADAB would not pay the costs of a spouse who arrived in Australia more than three months pregnant but presumably would have met the cost of pregnancy which occurred in Australia, or if the pregnant woman arrived in Australia less than three months into her pregnancy. I understand that none of that applies from 1 November. The example serves only to highlight the lunacy of the whole system. </PARA>
<PARA> From 1 November ADAB ceased to meet the medical expenses of dependants. I understand that during the six month waiting period the Bureau will not cover costs either because of some misguided belief that this would render the dependants ineligible for a health card once the six month period had expired. Perhaps the Minister could explain whether this is in fact so. I seek assurance that all of these points I have raised will be investigated and tidied up, at least until a Labor government can get in and offer universal health care to all people in Australia. I am pleased to see that both the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume), who is the Minister representing the Minister for Health, and the Minister for Social Security are in the chamber. I hope they will caucus sufficiently to get their act together to provide some answers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In evidence, by way of letter, to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations former Primary Industry Minister Sinclair denied having any knowledge of the HOMPI-Holland Milk Products Inc.-rebate arrangement which breached the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade prior to the breach having been disclosed by the Committee. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Such an agreement, if known about, would have been totally unacceptable to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>In the House of Representatives on 17 September this year-at page 1484 of Hansard for those who want the reference-he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I strongly support the contention that action should be taken by a government with a chairman of a statutory corporation or a subsidiary of a statutory corporation if it finds there is a breach of an international arrangement. Such action was undertaken by me immediately evidence came forward to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that he said 'immediately evidence came forward to that effect'. Tonight on the radio program PM both those claims were contradicted by Mr Jack McGuire, the managing director of Murray-Goulburn Co-operative Ltd, a man of impeccable reputation and unassailable integrity. In May 1976 Mr McGuire approached Minister Sinclair to see whether an Australian Dairy Corporation decision to refuse an export certificate at a price below the GATT minimum could be reversed. Did Mr Sinclair tell Mr McGuire that any breach of GATT would have been totally unacceptable to the Government, as he had claimed to the Senate Committee? No, he rang the Corporation chairman at midnight. As Mr McGuire put it:</PARA>

<PARA> New revelations in the hands of 'P.M.' in the Asia Dairy Industries affair could involve the former Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Ian Sinclair, in further controversy. </PARA>
<PARA> Simon Nasht: The major criticism surrounding Mr Sinclair in the Asia Dairy affair is that while Minister for Primary Industry, he failed to ensure that many doubtful practices within the Dairy Corporation at the time were firstly not identified and secondly, once discovered, weren't corrected. Mr Sinclair denied these claims, saying that in many cases, the Dairy Corporation and particularly its former chairman, Tony Webster, were keeping the problems from him. Mr Sinclair says that when he did become aware of the problem areas, he acted quickly to put a stop to them. One of the main areas of controversy surrounds contracts made by the Dairy Corporation which breached Australia's international trading obligations under the GATT-the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In one particular instance in which the corporation was selling skimmed milk powder to the Philippines, the Senate enquiry which investigated these sales came to the damaging conclusion that it preferred the evidence of Mr Webster in these events rather than that of the Minister, Mr Sinclair. Mr Sinclair has attacked that finding strongly, and repeatedly defended himself by saying at no time would he consider contracts that meant GATT would have been breached. In evidence to the Senate enquiry, and I quote, ''Such an agreement, if known about, would have been totally unacceptable to the Government.'' And again, two weeks ago, he told Parliament in a carefully worded statement which centred on his responsibilities as the Minister, he said, ''it was not for me to do other than to direct that sales should not be made under the GATT arranged price. At no stage did I in any way accept that there should be international sales by the Dairy Corporation, its subsidiaries or any other private organisatoin that might have breached that direction.'' At the time in question, in the mid seventies, the world price for milk powder, was tumbling, leaving Australian producers with a huge excess of products which seriously threatened the industry. The price fell so quickly that contracts that we had overseas with buyers were taking our Government and private industry suppliers perilously close to the agreed GATT minimum price of $350 US a ton. In fact, the world price slumped below GATT in April 1976. Despite the fact that the price slumped below GATT in April and the Dairy Corporation was aware of this, Mr Sinclair has said the first time he was made aware of the possible treaty breaches was at the earliest, September that year, vital months later. However, ''P.M.'' has now information that Mr Sinclair was approached well before that date by a private company to approve a contract worth well over $5 million which was clearly in breach of the GATT minimum price, and despite his often repeated policy that the Government totally opposed such arrangements, he was prepared to take the approach to the Corporation chairman, Mr Webster. The context surrounding these events is important. In April 1976, Australia jointly negotiated with New Zealand to sell $5.25m worth of milk powder at a price perilously close and possibly under the GATT minimum because of deductions being made for freight charges. In any event, the money returned to the Dairy Corporation was nearly $10 under the agreed world minimum price, but in the desperate circumstances, it was approved. A report handed to the present Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon, last month, reveals that recent attempts by the Corporation to investigate this sale had been frustrated because crucial files are now missing and those left behind, have, in the words of the Corporation's General Manager, Brian Norwood, been deliberately falsified to demonstrate that the GATT minimum pricing arrangement had not been breached. At that time, one of the Corporation's board members was the managing director of one of Australia's largest dairy companies, Murray Goulburn Co-operative, Mr Jack Macquire. As Mr Macquire recalls it, on the very same day the Corporation approved the Mexico deal, his company applied for approval to export another huge pile of skim milk powder at least as big as the Government contract. The price offered to Murray Goulburn was $340US, in breach of GATT, but returning to Australia almost exactly the same as the corporation contract at a time when the industry was facing a crisis situation. Despite this, the corporation refused to give export approval because of the GATT breach, leaving Mr Macquire furious. He told the board of management he was left with no option but to raise the sale with the Minister. Soon after, a meeting with Mr Sinclair was arranged for Macquire by Canberra lobbyist, Mr Peter Cullen. It took place late at night at approximately 11.30 after the Minister had finished in Parliament. Reports of what took place at that meeting varied, but what is clear is that Mr Macquire pushed strongly to have Murray Goulburn's offer approved, using the Corporation's Mexico contract to support his case. Despite the fact that Murray Goulburn's offer breached GATT, Mr Sinclair was sympathetic. So much so, that despite the late hour, he agreed to reach Mr Webster and discuss it with him while the meeting continued. Mr Webster was woken up at a Canberra motel, and on a conference phone so everyone present could hear, Mr Sinclair enquired from his chairman as to why approval had not been granted. At least twice during a substantial conversation, Mr Macquire recalls Webster telling the Minister that the contract could not be approved because it would infringe the Government's GATT policy. Mr Macquire does not believe that Mr Sinclair was directing the Corporation's chairman to breach GATT, but it raises serious questions as to why, in the light of the Government policy, Mr Sinclair pursued the matter. Also, in the light of the Minister's evidence to the Senate enquiry that he was not aware of GATT breaches by the Corporation until late in 1976 the matter of the Corporation's Mexico deal being raised also becomes significant as this meeting took place months earlier. Mr Macquire has agreed to talk to ''P.M.'' about what happened that night in Mr Sinclair's office. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Macquire: We had an enquiry and a firm offer for powder that was less than the GATT price, and as is normal, the general manager of our company, I think it was, that submitted this to the Corporation, . . . inaudible . . ., it came up. I am not sure, exactly sure, if it was the same day or around about that time, for discussion and it got agreed to. The Corporation did not agree to make that sale on the basis that it was under GATT. </PARA>
<PARA> Question: But on the face of it, it was on terms that would have been very similar to the Mexican deal. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Macquire: Well, that's true. It would have returned 50c a ton more to the pool than the Mexican deal, and I was a bit concerned about it because I had watched a lot of powder from Australia because of prices that I felt were set higher than world prices come down from, say, $600, right down, and I was concerned that this was a sale that as it returned to the pool this amount, and I could see in the next few months it was going to go low, and it finally did go lower . . . inaudible . . . powder was finally sold, disposed as stock food. I think for around about $180. Yes. I was concerned about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Question: You must have been pretty worried. The industry itself was going through a whole lot of turmoil at the time. Here was a deal-even if it was 15,000 tons at the GATT minimum, it was worth $5.25m, to you. It was a big deal. You were going to get a price, in fact, that returned more, than the Mexican contract. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Macquire: That's true. </PARA>
<PARA> Question: It must have worried you . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Macquire: It did worry me. It worried me to no end. It didn't really affect our company as a company because whatever these prices came, and that view included some sales made at 6.5, some 6.75, not much, but some, but it was an equalised thing, and we I think were aware the Government had agreed to underwrite at 300, but it seemed to me it was a shame to miss this sale. </PARA>
<PARA> Question: Do you think it was a bit unfair?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Macquire: Well, I was concerned, and I felt it was. I made reference to that at the Corporation meeting, and I did say, well, I have got no alternative now but to go and discuss it with the Minister, which I came back either that night or the next morning to arrange an interview with the Minister to discuss it with him. </PARA>
<PARA> Question: So, you went to Canberra after that. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Macquire: Yes, I did. </PARA>
<PARA> Question: And you hoped to see the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Macquire: Yes. </PARA>
<PARA> Question: Now, I believe that meeting took place quite late that night because you had to wait for Mr Sinclair to finish his duties in the Parliament. Do you think he was sympathetic towards your problem? I mean, there was a mountain of skim milk powder in Australia at that time, and this was a deal worth perhaps more than $5 million, it was a way of at least starting to clear some of the backlog. Do you think he was sympathetic?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Macquire: I think he was concerned of the whole skim milk powder position of which I would imagine he would be aware about and I think he was concerned, but I had seen fit from my position in our company to go up and discuss it with him. Sure, I think he was concerned, as we all were. We would have liked to have seen the skim milk powder flowing out and being disposed of at sensible prices and I expressed to him my concern that it had been sliding continually down. The stock on hand in the EEC-government stocks, trader stocks-all pointed up to that the price would ultimately go down lower. </PARA>
<PARA> Question: Yet the Corporation was able to make a deal, but your company wasn't. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Macquire: Yes, but when we look at this in its true perspective-the Corporation-I was part of that decision, don't forget. We made what we believe to be a price that was not under GATT but it only came under GATT by a commission to the trader who organised a sale at this end. Now, that is the difference, really. </PARA>
<PARA> (Line from Canberra drops out)</PARA>
<PARA> Laurie Carmichael, the National Assistant Secretary of the AMWSU claimed today that a Federal Court judgment which stripped him of his position was part of an attempt to get rid of left wing leaders of Australian trade unions. Mr Carmichael's comments follow Mr Justice Shepherd's decision to declare last year's AMWSU null and void after he upheld allegations by Victorian branch officials of irregularities in the calling of the nominations. Mr Carmichael interviewed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Prime Minister said today that Australia should now think of putting behind them the deaths of five Australian journalists in east Timor in 1975. Mr Anthony told a meeting of the Australian/Indonesian Business Co-operation Committee that the tragic deaths of the journalists was still an obstacle to relations between the two countries. Mr Anthony interviewed. </PARA>
<PARA> Question: The obstacle seems to be, most particularly, with the Indonesians. Why are they so troubled by the fact that we continue to discuss this issue?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Anthony: Well, it obviously is a sensitive matter with them, and I wouldn't have mentioned it other than I realised it is an impediment to our relationships and it was an occasion at the Australian/Indonesian business Co-operation Committee today to mention this and also I hope to get a message, in as tactful a way as I could to the Australian media who do play very heavily on the issue, and no doubt feel very strongly about it. But, I think one must realise that the incident did happen six years ago and today it is still causing trouble between our two countries. I think it is fair enough to say that these expressions that some of our journalists use-and I can understand their feeling-is provocative and doesn't help towards good relationships. </PARA>
<PARA> Question: So, really, isn't it. It is a toss between the importance we attach to economic and diplomatic relations with Indonesia and what journalists and the families of those journalists who died regard as an unsatisfactory explanation of what happened in East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Anthony: Well, I don't want to use the word toss up. I think that is making trivia of it. It is a serious, but look. If you can't get resolution of it, and a lot of people have tried over the period of time, then is it to our advangage to keep on harping about it, knowing that it is impairing important relations with one of our closest and most significant neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA> Question: Can I make the point again though. I mean, even if there are sections of the media that do harp on this issue, it is for them a discussion that takes place within the context of Australia. One wonders why we allow ourselves to be so concerned about the importance attached to a domestic discussion by the Indonesians. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Anthony: You are saying it really doesn't matter if we do make these noises. </PARA>
<PARA> Question: No, not at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Anthony: Yes you are. </PARA>
<PARA> Question: I'm not. I didn't say that at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Anthony: Well, we do know they are reacting to it. And we do know it is an obstacle to good relations between our two countries, and recognising that and understanding that, then we ought to act appropriately. </PARA>

<PARA> (Back to the previous Asia Dairy interview)</PARA>
<PARA> Simon Nasht: Before we lost the line, you will recall that the managing director of the Murray Goulburn Co-operative Mr Jack Macquire was discussing the events of a meeting he had in Mr Sinclair's office in 1976. He was seeking approval at that meeting for a bid contract of skim milk powder which had been refused by the Australian Dairy Corporation despite the fact that the Dairy Corporation had approved its own contract for a sale of a similar amount of powder to Mexico. </PARA>
<PARA> Question: You didn't think it was strange at all that the Minister should discuss a contract that was possibly in breach of GATT with the chairman of his corporation?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Macquire: No, I don't think so. </PARA>
<PARA> Question: But you went there to try and get the contract pushed through, didn't you?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Macquire: I went there to take up our case. What the hell was going to happen to this damn powder. Here was a chance of selling-yeah, sure. I was aware that the 340 was under GATT, but I knew every other bugger, countries were doing the same thing and what the hell . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Question: You thought it was sound business?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Macquire: I thought it was just commonsense that we should otherwise we would be left on the damn, left behind by other countries doing these deals and they were doing it by no interest rate and 180 day interest rate at 1% and some countries-they were doing it by putting it on palettes and shrink wrapping it and all those damn things which to me added up to what's cost, lands in the warehouse of a buyer overseas. And I felt that this was-the hell with convention. Those were desperate days. </PARA>
<PARA> Question: Do you think Mr Sinclair understood your problems?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Macquire: I think he understood my problems. He wouldn't have bothered I don't think to have rung the chairman if he wasn't sympathetic towards what I was saying, but-and I think that is why he went to the trouble to ring Webster-I can only summise that. </PARA>
<PARA> Question: He did discuss . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Macquire: I wouldn't say he overly pursued it. He raised the matter on my behalf, and a general discussion took place on powder and the likely possibility of sales of powder . . inaudible of Australia and what likely prices they could be sold at. Derivations were mentioned as a possible outlet for Japan, for school lunch programmes, stock feed possibilities in Japan were discussed, I think, with Webster and the Minister. And it sort of-the conversation finally sorted of drifted out. I said before when the Minister closed the phone down, he said, ''Look Jack, you heard what I said. You heard what Webster said. Nothing much I can do about it. You appreciate that for me to override the chairman of the corporation would be something-it would have to be very grave before one could do that sort of thing'' . . . inaudible . . . I said well thanks for trying to do something, Mr Minister . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Question: So, for then, the Minister left the matter, even though he understood that it was proposing a possible GATT breach, but he left the matter there?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Macquire: He left the matter there and I say again the sale never went through. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr McGuire's evidence establishes beyond doubt that Mr Sinclair misled the Senate Committee in his letter dated 16 March, and he misled the Parliament in his 17 September statement. According to Mr Sinclair, the sanctions of both are, of course, identical. Under any previous Prime Minister his resignation would have been demanded by now. This veteran of assorted villanies now has yet another of a multiplicity of scars, any of which under any previous Prime Minister would have disqualified him forever from a ministerial position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It may be appropriate now to look back in history at various statements made by the Prime Minister on the question of ministerial propriety. In the House of Representatives in July 1975 he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Ten per cent or even 50 per cent of the truth is as good a way of misleading this Parliament and the Australian people as a downright lie. A half truth, a partial answer, and the slipping over of the full facts are a misleading of this Parliament . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In a radio broadcast on 12 March 1978 the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> One of my Government's first promises when we were elected just over two years ago was to restore the integrity and honesty of government. Without integrity-without the appearance and reality of integrity-no Government can hope to have the confidence of the people or the trust of the people. </PARA>
<PARA> My Government has demonstrated again and again our fundamental commitment to restoring integrity to public administration in Australia. Our record in this regard is without parallel in history. </PARA>
<PARA>And I certainly agree. Nobody who has looked at the record would dispute that the record of this Government on the subject of ministerial responsibility is without parallel in history. On another occasion, on the question of ministerial responsibility, as quoted by Mr Kerin, in the House of Representatives on 29 October and recorded on page 2691 of Hansard, the Prime Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is certainly true that Ministers cannot be aware of everything that occurs in their departments . . . But if a major blunder occurred in a department, of real importance to Australia, and if the minister were unaware of it, that minister should take responsibility for the mistakes of his department and offer to resign. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a statement which has grievous implications for the present Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon), if it is to be taken seriously. The previous Minister for Primary Industry of course, as I have already stated, under any previous Prime Minister would have been disqualified for life from ministerial rank. Mr McGuire's revelations have implications going well beyond establishing the fact that Mr Sinclair misled the Parliament. For example, a Department of Primary Industry officer was present at the May 1976 meeting to which Mr McGuire referred and must have been aware of the phone call to Mr Webster. Why was no memo written and recorded in the Department of Primary Industry files? Or was a memo written, filed and culled when the Department's files were subsequently sanitised, as they were?</PARA>
<PARA> This Murray-Goulburn deal, Mr McGuire stated tonight, ultimately fell through for reasons he did not state. But what other sales by private firms in that period from April to November 1976 at prices breaching GATT were discussed or authorised by the Minister, by the Chairman of the Corporation, and by other people? Is it not fortuituous that the export certificates for that very period are not in the Corporation files and that those export certificates alone are missing? The certificates for all products other than skim milk powder, for all exports by the Corporation trading as a principal, and for skim milk powder by private companies, for every period other than that crucial period are in the Corporation files. Only the certificates for that period are missing. Is that not fortuitous? Who had access to those certificates? Who has them now?</PARA>
<PARA> On 14 October I gave the Senate details of a meeting and phone call very similar to that now revealed by Mr McGuire. Needless to say, Mr Sinclair denied it in Parliament the next day. That information was given to me by a source that I know to be reliable. I also know the answer to the mystery of the fortuitously missing files. The files have been taken and are held by the former Chairman of the Dairy Corporation, Mr Webster. A typically sordid National Country Party deal has been arranged under which Mr Webster is guaranteed immunity from prosecution. In return, Mr Webster will not drop the missing documents which would further incriminate a guilty Minister. It is a matter for some reasonable speculation whether those files will survive any longer. Of course, there is always the nagging doubt, is there not, that somebody else had a photocopy of them before they were removed from the Corporation file. That is probably the best guarantee of all that the originals currently in the custody of Mr Webster will not be destroyed, as I am reliably informed other written evidence from the Department of Primary Industry was destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> A statement was to have been made today by Senator Chaney. Unfortunately, that did not occur because of lack of time, and I do not blame Senator Chaney at all. He was to have stated when incorporating the speech made a couple of weeks ago by Mr Nixon, appropriately adjusted for the Senate, of course, that the Government believes that the documents now before the Parliament clearly demonstrate that the Government has tackled this issue both properly and thoroughly. It is now very clear from Mr McGuire's evidence alone that that is not so. The Government has not tackled this issue properly and thoroughly. It has not even covered up for previous and present National Country Party Ministers properly and thoroughly, much less exposed all the facts to the public, revealed all the facts to the public, properly and thoroughly. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to raise briefly a few other matters. On the question of the non-prosecution of Mr Webster, Mr Nixon stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Federal Police, the Crown Solicitor and Counsel are all of the view that there is insufficient evidence available capable of establishing beyond reasonable doubt the commission of any criminal offence by Mr Webster. </PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, Mr Nixon, in making that statement, reversed the chronological sequence. The original opinion to that effect came from some obscure Melbourne lawyer called Peter Clark, whom nobody seems to have heard of. It was endorsed by the Solicitor-General, who I think my learned legal colleague described a couple of months ago as a hired gun, and was accepted, at least in part, by the Australian Federal Police. There are many other aspects of the investigation and the presentation of the papers, not the least of which is the fact that the police report of 11 March was not tabled, on the advice of-guess who?-Lindsay Duthie, the Secretary to the Department of Primary Industry. This can be seen in document 110 of those that were tabled by Minister Nixon a fortnight ago. This is the same Lindsay Duthie who organised dry runs of Senate Estimates committees for all the first assistant secretaries in the Department on the morning before the Estimates committees were held just to make sure that they got their lines right and who, significantly, kept Mr Wallace right away from the Estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA> The police investigation portion of the reports which Mr Nixon tabled a fortnight ago have not touched these heavy issues: Who pinched the export certificates from the Corporation's files? Who falsified the records of the Corporation's sales as stated by Mr Norwood in a letter of 28 September which is document 111? Was it the former Corporation employees Peter Foster and L. Page as alleged on the program AM on 28 October? If it was Messrs Foster and Page, were they acting on Mr Webster's instructions? Was Mr Webster acting, if not on the instructions of Minister Sinclair, at least with the knowledge of Minister Sinclair?</PARA>
<PARA> I could go on at great length about defects and deficiencies in the investigation which has so far been conducted. Of course, the greatest defect of all about the investigation which Mr Nixon has said will continue is that it is to be conducted by the Department of Primary Industry. Mr Nixon has said that the Department which was the subject of the inquiry will continue the inquiry and finalise all the outstanding matters. Apparently he expects us to be satisfied with that. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other very curious matter to which I wish to draw attention in the documents filed by Mr Nixon. I could make a lot of other comments; I hope that I get an opportunity at a more appropriate time to do so. I mention in passing that the documents that were tabled were not in fact numbered. They had an index. Document No. 75 in the index-if anyone wants to go through the documents, as many people have, and number all the documents sequentially, it is No. 75-is a letter from Mr McCartney to Mr Nixon dated 18 August 1980 which is stamped 'Confidential'. What fascinates me about this document is that it is photocopied back and front-two pages-and the two pages have been typed by different typewriters. There is absolutely no doubt that the two pages have been typed by different typewriters. Moreover-I am not certain of this as I am not an expert on the subject but I will be seeking expert opinion on this-it appears to me that the words 'Page 2', which is written on the top of the reverse side of a single sheet of paper has been typed on the typewriter which typed the first page and not the typewriter which typed the second page. </PARA>
<PARA> There may, of course, be a perfectly innocent explanation for this but there are other possibilities, especially when one looks at the cramped style of what is purported to be page one as compared with the open typing style of what is purported to be page two. One of the possibilities is that this letter originally may have consisted of three pages. Pages one and two may have been retyped and put on to a single sheet, and then the same typewriter was used to type the words, 'Page two' over what could originally have been page three of the letter. If that should be the case, it obviously opens the possibility that sections of the original letter may have been deleted. If there were deleted, I presume that the Government would be running a grave risk to have done so without some consultation with Mr McCartney. Perhaps it decided it would take the punt for all the Country Party's faults. Nobody who has looked at its record over the years could ever accuse it of having been unwilling to take political gambles. </PARA>

<PARA> I do not intend to say much more tonight.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to go into any detail in relation to the matters that Senator Walsh has referred to but I wish to support, just briefly, the action taken by the Government to investigate this matter further. I suggest that it is not entirely unreasonable that the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) would have the Department of Primary Industry investigate and report in relation to some of the matters. Whether that report is finally accepted or whether it is the subject of further discussion or committee consideration, if it is published, is a matter upon which this chamber can inform itself and make a judgment at a later date. But I resist the innuendo that there is something unreasonable or impossible in that course of action being taken. I do not want to create further debate at any length in relation to the matter. I believe that the reaction of the Government to date in relation to the report on the Australian Dairy Corporation, Asia Dairy Industries and other Asian subsidiaries-a report of one of the committees of the Senate-has been both prompt and detailed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree that a number of matters still require explanation and that a number of matters possibly require further investigation, and I do not want to go beyond saying that. So far as the letter to which Senator Walsh referred is concerned, he was not a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations at the time it investigated the Australian Dairy Corporation and Asia Dairy Industries. Therefore, he would not have available to him the material that was available to the Committee. Having had my attention drawn to that letter I will see how it compares with the material which the Committee has and see whether anything further needs to be said in relation to it. I do not wish either to stir a debate or to exacerbate the matter in any way but rather to acknowledge some of the points that have been made and leave it at that for the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Rae for his comments which to some extent pick up points that I wish to make on this matter. The only additional point I wish to make relates to the statement which was put down in the House of Representatives on 29 October. It was hoped that it would be put down contemporaneously in this place but that did not happen because of pressure of Senate business. It was hoped that it would be put down today during the 90 minutes allocated to tabling papers but that again was precluded through pressure of other business. The statement makes it quite clear that there are still concerns about certain elements of this matter, including elements raised by Senator Walsh in the Senate tonight. The statement, of course, predates the interview on PM this evening which was referred to by Senator Walsh and the transcript of which was incorporated in Hansard. I did not hear the broadcast and I have not had a chance as yet to read the transcript of it. I will quote from part of the statement which was put down by the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon, and which was to have been put down in similar terms by me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, I just draw to the Senate's attention the fact that the Government has made a very early response and therefore not yet a complete response to the matters raised by the Senate Committee. As was pointed out by the Minister for Primary Industry, it is generally accepted policy that the Government undertakes to give a detailed response to the recommendations of parliamentary committee reports within six months. In line with this policy, the Minister will be requesting the Auditor-General to report on the Holland Milk Products Inc. rebate arrangement and his Department to report on the ownership of the Dairying Industry Stabilisation Fund, which is irrelevant to the matters raised tonight in time for the Government to respond further to the Senate Committee report during the 1982 autumn sittings of Parliament. By that time, the Government should also be in a position to comment on the general issues of principle, which again are not relevant to the points raised by Senator Walsh tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> What is relevant, however, is the fact that, as was pointed out in the House of Representatives some weeks ago now, the advice from the Australian Dairy Corporation is to the effect that it is not possible to determine precisely whether the actual net f.o.b. price was in breach of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade minimum price for skim milk powder. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. There are two aspects of concern and these matters were adverted to by Mr Nixon some weeks ago. I think they are basically the substance of the matters which were again raised by Senator Walsh in the Senate tonight. I quote from the statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first relates to conclusions reached by the Management of the ADC that a deliberate effort had been made by past ADC Management to establish incorrect records in order to be able to demonstrate that the GATT minimum price had not been breached. </PARA>
<PARA> The second is the inability of ADC Management to locate certain documents in respect of this matter. The report states that during the period in question the then Chairman of the ADC, Mr Webster, abolished the central filing system. While that system has since been restored, the earlier action has resulted in difficulty being experienced in locating some documents relevant to that period. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw to the attention of the Senate-what has been said by Senator Walsh may be thought by some honourable senators who have not read the statement put down in the House of Representatives to be a matter of discovery-the fact that the statement put down by Mr Nixon on behalf of the Government does advert to the fact that documents are missing. Mr Nixon went on to say in the statement that he had asked his Department to investigate all aspects of the report and that he would make further information available at the appropriate time. In that context, I express agreement with the view put forward by Senator Rae a few minutes ago that that is an appropriate initial course to be taken, and whether any further steps need to be taken is a matter to be judged in light of what that investigation shows. But to suggest at this stage that there is something sinister in taking that step is to presume a situation whereas, as Senator Walsh himself has conceded, there can be innocent explanations for some of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think it will assist the Senate, the Australian public or anybody else if I simply repeat what has been put down in a statement in the other place. I have referred to the most relevant passages of the statement, in answer to the matters raised by Senator Walsh tonight, which indicate that the fundamental fact which is central to the concern expressed by Senator Walsh, namely that there are missing documents and so on, is something which is on record and which is the subject of investigation. The significance of the statements by Mr McGuire on PM tonight is something on which I cannot comment. I have not read the statements and I certainly have not had the chance to put them in the context of the information that has been put down. I will have the opportunity, no doubt, to do that at a later time in the Senate. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Commonwealth is in consultation, through the Foreign Investment Review Board, with State governments on measures that might be introduced to establish a register of beneficial foreign ownership of rural property because information is not at present available on the total amount of land owned by foreign investors in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Foreign Investment Review Board statistics made available to my Department by the Treasury indicate that there has been a substantial increase in new investment by foreign residents in recent years, part of which has been attributable to intending migrants. Details are set out in the attached figures. These figures relate to proposals approved by the Government; they do not indicate whether all the transactions actually took place nor is statistical information available on sales by foreign interests to Australian residents of previously foreign owned land. This information will not be available until comprehensive procedures are established, should the State governments decide to introduce such measures in pursuance of the consultation now proceeding.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I confirm that at its meeting in Darwin on 3 August 1981 the Australian Agricultural Council did not adopt a recommendation put forward by New South Wales to seek the appointment of a Council nominee to the Foreign Investment Review Board. When the Board was set up in 1976 it was not intended that the members of it represent particular sectors of industry and commerce.</PARA>
<PARA> Council considered the matter and agreed as an appropriate alternative, that there should be a co-ordinated Commonwealth/State approach to the question of foreign investment in rural land and, inter alia, that the Board should continue to consult the States in respect of all major proposals for foreign investment in rural land.</PARA>
<PARA> This approach recognises that while the Commonwealth has overall responsibility for assessing foreign investment proposals, the States have responsibility for matters such as land administration and agricultural production.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Councils' decision was made only three months ago and I see no reason to reopen the matter so soon after its consideration. However, it is open to another member or members of Council to request reconsideration of the decision should they wish to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> It is for the Senate itself to decide whether it wishes to conduct an inquiry into the extent of foreign ownership of rural land and related matters.</PARA>
<PARA> It will be of interest to the honourable senator, however, that the Council also agreed that the States would co-operate with the Commonwealth in obtaining a factual basis on which to assess the extent and effects of foreign investment in rural land.</PARA>
<PARA>STATISTICAL INFORMATION</PARA>
<PARA> The tables presented below provide information on proposals by foreign interests for the acquisition of Australian rural properties since 1 April 1976 that have been approved by the Government under its foreign investment policy. These statistics exclude proposals which have been approved but which the Foreign Investment Review Board has been advised (as at 30 June 1981) will not be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that the $350,000 exemption threshold for the acquisition of real estate normally would not apply to proposals for foreign interests to acquire Australian rural properties as most rural properties constitute businesses within the meaning of the Foreign Takeovers Act. The tables therefore include all proposals for the acquisition of Australian rural land approved by the Government regardless of the consideration involved.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Committee of Inquiry into Telecommunications Services in Australia, has been directed to examine the question of supply of telecommunications equipment in Australia, as part of its review of the extent to which the private sector could be more widely involved in the provision of telecommunications services.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, Mr Malcolm King, a consultant to the Department of Communications and Member of the Committee of Inquiry, has already carried out a preliminary analysis of the relationship between Telecom Australia and suppliers of telephone attachments in the private sector, including the opportunity for Australian manufacturing industries to compete in the design and manufacture of telephone equipment. This work will be directly relevant to the consideration of the Davidson Inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA> I expect the question of controls over the supply of telephone equipment will be fully canvassed, therefore, by the Davidson Inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In the past, Telecom has not had a monopoly over the supply of telephone equipment although it has supplied a large proportion of the market. In supplying its part of the market, Telecom has had to take account of the Government's former policy on local preferences and its own commercial judgment on factors such as security of supply and technical compatibility with the telecommunications network. I expect Telecom will continue to make decisions based on a variety of considerations in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government appreciates the importance of the Australian telecommunications equipment industry. This concern for the future of the local industry is reflected in the Government's direction to the Davidson Committee to have particular regard to the scope for and ability of Australian industries to compete and participate in the telecommunications equipment industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 9 September 1981:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Is the Attorney-General aware of the alarm expressed by teachers and schools throughout Australia over the implementation of the Copyright Amendment Act 1980, under which teachers and their schools can be held liable for copying and distributing to students full texts of certain educational matter covered by copyright.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Does the Attorney-General agree that while teachers respect the rights of copyright owners, they still have a right to provide their students with the best educational material available and that in some instances that necessitates the copying and distribution to students of full texts of works covered by copyright that may not be commercially available in sufficient quantity at a given time.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Will the Attorney-General consider a system of blanket licensing, funded by the Commonwealth in respect of copyright fees, or reimbursement or subsidisation of education copyright fees, so that teachers can maintain their instructional standards without the threat of prosecution for doing so, since a teacher's workload already extends well into his private time and more time will be wasted keeping records for the statutory licence procedure.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2185" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="QLD">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Acting Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Concern has been expressed in regard to the Copyright Amendment Act 1980. In the first instance that concern had been based upon the assumption that the Act had introduced a new liability as suggested in Part (1) of the question. In fact, liability for infringement had been provided for by the Copyright Act and was not introduced by the amendment. The Copyright Amendment Act 1980 extends to educational institutions a new statutory licence to make multiple copies of some categories of works without the need previously required of obtaining the permission of copyright owners. That statutory licence is subject to those insitutions meeting claims for equitable remuneration by copyright owners except where the Act provides for free copying. Since that has become better understood, concern expressed has related to particular provisions of the amending Act. The Attorney-General's Department is monitoring the operation of those provisions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Copyright Amendment Act 1980 does recognise that teachers have special needs for making educational material available to students. Section 53B (2) provides that the copyright in a work is not infringed by the making of copies of the whole or a part of that work by an educational institution for the teaching purposes of that institution. Section 53B (5) qualifies this by providing that sub-section (2) does not apply in relation to copies of more than a reasonable portion of a work that has been separately published unless the person making the copies is satisfied, after reasonable investigation, that copies (other than second hand copies) of the work cannot be obtained within a reasonable time at an ordinary commercial price.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The proposal for a system of blanket licensing was very extensively considered before the amendments embodied in the Copyright Amendment Act 1980 were formulated. The proposal was rejected by the Franki Committee on photocopying and was opposed by the Working Party of the Australian Education Council. It is understood that that remains the position of the Australian Education Council. A blanket licensing scheme under which the Commonwealth was required to fund the payment of remuneration to copyright owners would not be appropriate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The decision to extend service pension to Australian mariners who served in a 'theatre of war' in the 1939-45 War has yet to become law. The administrative details of establishing identity and eligibility of Australian mariners need to be resolved and the delay of the extension until February 1982 was mainly to permit sufficient time to finalise these arrangements. Other extensions of service pension eligibility have had effect from February or later following the Budget announcement.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The exact number of Australian mariners who will be eligible is not known nor is it known how many will apply for the service pension. The best estimate that can be made is that approximately 3,400 mariners and 2,000 wives may satisfy age and income tests for service pension.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The proceedings apparently referred to in the question are Adler V. Dowdell, Nielson and Federated Millers and Mill Employees Association of Australia.

Successive Attorneys-General have taken the view (see, for example, answers to Senate Question No. 965, Hansard, 28 October 1981) that in ordinary circumstances an applicant for legal aid from the office has the right to have kept confidential not only the grant or refusal of aid but, also, the very fact that an application has been made.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) On 18 February 1977, the Commonwealth Government entered into a formal agreement with the Tasmanian Government under the States Grants (Nature Conservation) Act 1974 for a survey of the resources of the State's South West. The South West Tasmania Resources Survey Steering Committee, which consisted of Mr P. Murrell (Chairman), Director-Tasmanian National Parks and Wildlife Service, Professor J. D. Ovington, Director-Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service and Dr P. Tyler, Reader-Department of Botany, University of Tasmania, commissioned Mr Peter Waterman to lead the survey.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Although I received unofficial copies of the report in mid August, it was not until 14 October 1981 that I officially received two copies of the report from the Chairman of the South West Tasmania Resources Survey Steering Committee in accordance with Section 5 (2) of the Commonwealth-State Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Federal Government allocated $351,322 to Tasmania for the conduct of the survey, the total cost of which was $450,732. The Tasmanian Government also provided services and resources which were not costed.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The survey described and evaluated the natural resources of the South West, including wilderness values, in order to identify those attributes of the area which may require reservation as a National Park. The Survey published over 60 discussion, occasional and working papers and contains sufficient data to enable preparation of regional management plans by the Tasmanian Government to commence.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 20 August 1981 (Hansard, page 145) Senator MacGibbon asked me a question, without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in the Senate. The question concerned press speculation about the method and cost of an evaluation of the objectives and implementation of the report of the Review of Post-arrival Programs and Services to Migrants (the Galbally report).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The report of the Review of Post-arrival Programs and Services to Migrants-the Galbally report-was the most thorough review of services to migrants this country has undertaken. In accepting the recommendations of the report (30 May 1978) Hansard p. 2727) the Government accepted a commitment to an independent evaluation of implementation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In the three years since the Prime Minister tabled the report, the Government has significantly expanded and improved the post-arrival programs and services available to migrants. It is timely to conduct an evaluation of the objectives and implementation of the report, to ensure that taxpayers' money is properly spent. This is consistent with the Review of Commonwealth Functions decisions and with our firm commitment to migrants.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I should point out that the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs (AIMA) is an independent statutory body established to advise the Government on matters relating to multicultural affairs. It can readily bring together the skills, expertise and access to the ethnic communities necessary to carry out a thorough evaluation. No other body is in a better position to conduct this sort of evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The evaluation will-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) assess the effectiveness of the implementation of the Galbally report's recommendations;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) determine whether the report's overall objectives are being achieved;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) determine whether the report's objectives and recommendations remain valid; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) recommend whether the objectives and recommendations should be pursued in the future and what changes (if any) should be made.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The government is committed to funding those Galbally programs which evaluation demonstrates are both needed and effective. The evaluation process will commence shortly and consultations with interested parties, including State Governments and ethnic communities, will be part of the process.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) There is no substance in the newspaper report that an additional $460,000 is to be provided for the evaluation. Most of the cost will be met from existing funding and other resources and additional funds of up to $150,000 will also be available.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 22 September 1981 (Hansard, page 849) Senator Jones asked me a question, without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry in the Senate. The honourable senator's question was as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is it true that the Department of Primary Industry requests other departments to undertake species tests on behalf of that Department? If so, what direction has been given to any department and which departments have undertaken those tests? Has any direction been given in relation to species tests of meats contained in export cartons? What tests have been undertaken to determine types of meat-in particular, kangaroo, buffalo, horse and donkey? Can the Minister inform the Senate of the time and date of such tests?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied me with the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> Following the detection in the United States of America of substitution in meat exported from Australia the Department of Primary Industry introduced a species testing program for beef products exported to the United Staes of America. Assistance was obtained from a number of laboratories both Commonwealth, State and private, throughout Australia, with ability to undertake the required test. Two tests were used; an agar gel diffusion test (AGDT), most commonly, and an iso-electric focusing test (IEFT), on a limited number of samples. Procedures to be followed in the AGDT were advised to participating laboratories in early September and the assistance of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Division of Meat Research obtained to evaluate these and other candidate tests in terms of reliability, sensitivity, specificity, simplicity and cost so that standardised procedures may be drawn up. The test methods for the ADGT which are in routine use have been approved by the United States Department of Agriculture as have the sampling procedures being employed.</PARA>
<PARA> The laboratories that have performed species tests on export meat for the Department of Primary Industry are:</PARA>
<PARA> New South Wales-Australian Government Analytical Laboratory (AGAL);</PARA>
<PARA> Queensland-Quantum Ltd, Government Chemical laboratory, Department of Health, Queensland (State Government);</PARA>
<PARA> Victoria-Veterinary Research Institute, Department of Agriculture (State Government), AGAL;</PARA>
<PARA> South Australia-Department of Science and Technology (State Government), AGAL;</PARA>
<PARA> Western Australia-AGAL;</PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania-Mount Pleasant Veterinary Laboratory, Department of Agruculture, (State Government).</PARA>
<PARA> From 14 September the population sampling program on meat being held in store for export to the United States of America was progressively replaced by a planned program of statistical sampling and testing of meat from all registered export establishments. Export meat from any species and for all destinations is included in this testing program. Detailed directions have been given to inspection staff on the statistical procedure to be used in selecting samples for testing and over 2500 samples per week are now being tested.</PARA>

Did the Minister also direct police to carry out active surveillance of Mr Bruce McGuinness, another respected black activist, who is the national director of NAAIHO-the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation? Is this part of the campaign initiated by the Australian Government to prevent Aborigines from meeting and talking to representatives of black African countries? Is the Minister aware also that, as far as I can ascertain, no Detective Sergeant Fisher is a regular member of the police force in Victoria? As the Australian Government is responsible for security arrangements at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and has taken the extreme measure of having members of the Australian Federal Police sworn in as members of the Victorian Police, can he advise whether Detective Sergeant Fisher is in fact a member of the Australian Federal Police at other times? Can the Minister also advise whether members of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and other security organisations have been sworn in as Victorian security officers during the currency of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting?</PARA>
