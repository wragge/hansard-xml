<PARA> (1) Note that legislation establishing plant breeders' rights in other countries has had serious adverse effect, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Virtual monopoly control of seed production has passed into the hands of a few large international corporations seeking to profit from the exclusive rights over plant genetic materials created by such legislation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, by referring to the statement on health that was brought down by the Minister for Health the week before last, and particularly to page 4 thereof, on which the Government, having set out what are called general objectives in relation to health, goes on to enunciate a number of what are called in the statement 'firm measures' to bring those general principles into effect. I refer particularly to firm measure No. 2, which states that all Australians should become far more responsible for their own health care and more aware of the full costs of health services available to them. I ask: In view of the recent reversal in relation to health funding for the State of Queensland, to what extent does the Government have principles in relation to health care? How far is there a firm commitment to the principles that the Government has announced, and is there in fact to be a differentiation amongst Australians, on the basis of the geographical area in which they live, in relation to the application of this Government's health care principles?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government did announce new arrangements for public hospital funding and a new basis for the Commonwealth and States to share the responsibility for such funding. It is a fact that the new arrangements will result in more responsibility being taken by Australians and their becoming more aware of the costs involved. What the honourable senator has failed to pick up in his question is that the State of Queensland was able to demonstrate the particular problems which it had and that, as a result, an arrangement was made to cope with them. There is no question of anyone moving away from principles. I am surprised at the question.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is is not a fact that the particular circumstances are that Queensland has been able for a number of years to provide free hospital services for its citizens. In light of the philosophy expressed in the statement of the Minister for Health, I will rephrase the question and ask: In Fraser Government terms, is it a fact that there is no such thing as a free lunch or free health care unless someone happens to have been getting free lunches for a long period?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether he has seen, or had brought to his attention, the Australian Broadcasting Commission's television program 'If the Bomb Drops', which shows the inadequacy of the civil defence of Australia in the event of a nuclear attack. Is it true that no adequate Federal plans exist to meet such an attack and that State schemes are patchy and ineffective? Is it also true that civil defence against a nuclear attack has been downgraded in Australia over the past several years compared with defence against natural disasters, which I commend the Government for upgrading? Does he accept the assessment of the Department of Defence that the possibility of a nuclear attack against Australia cannot be ruled out? If so, is the Government behaving responsibly in exporting large quantities of uranium without at the same time having adequate safeguards in the event of our uranium being returned to us in the form of nuclear weapons?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1879" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take the last part of the question first. The Australian Government subscribes to and is a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Under that Treaty Australia will not manufacture atomic weapons, nor will it assist in any way any other nation so to do. In its supply of uranium for peacetime electric power generation it subscribes to the International Atomic Energy Agency and to all the auditing of that Agency. Through its own Australian Safeguards Office it monitors the movement of its own uranium and its products throughout the world so that, with the assistance of the International Atomic Energy Agency and of its own monitoring, it can quite safely assure that it will not be providing uranium for fissile weapons of an aggressive or offensive nature. We are implacably opposed to contributing at all to the amount of fissile material for war purposes, although I have to say sadly to Senator Chipp that the volume of existing material, such as plutonium, held by major powers is quite enormous and that additional amounts as far as they are concerned are almost irrelevant. The danger in that regard would be from terrorists or others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, I did not see the program referred to in the honourable senator's question. I will make some inquiries about it. I do not have details in particular about our present civil defence facilities. They do not come within my responsibilities, so I will seek out the details. I am not aware that the facilities have been downgraded. In fact Senator Chipp commended the upgrading of the natural disasters program. The two programs are co-partners-one marches with the other. Senator Chipp may shake his head, but I have been on the receiving end of such things. I know that both natural and man-made disasters often have basically the same sorts of consequences. That is not to say that one should not do better. I would not comment on any assessment by the Defence Department or by others of the probability of war, nuclear or otherwise. The whole of history is strewn with people who have made assessments and predictions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to either the Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs or the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources, whichever is appropriate. Has the Minister noted the Industries Assistance Commission report on trade trends in which the Commission again draws attention to the heavy cost borne by efficient industries because of the high level of protection afforded to Australia's less efficient high cost industries and warns that unless the Australian system of protection is changed adjustment pressures will be borne most heavily by the country's most efficient industries? The IAC report particularly noted the motor car industry and the clothing, textiles and footwear industry as industries receiving particularly heavy protection. Will the Government take note of this further warning by the IAC of the adverse effects on the Australian economy and on our competitive export potential if the Government persists in granting high levels of protection to these industries?</PARA></TALK.START>

He makes the point that unless we seek to shift towards a more liberalised industrial structure which is based on market trends rather than on high levels of protection we will suffer damage in the longer run. I think it is evident from the progress which this Government has made on various issues-I believe it is evident from some legislation dealt with in this chamber last night in regard to the Customs tariff legislation-that there are movements towards a liberalisation of our protection in various areas.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister whether he can clarify for this chamber the situation which appears to have arisen in what seems to be the continuing State-Commonwealth financial arrangements. In view of statements by the Prime Minister yesterday that the Commonwealth had exhausted its financial responsibilities to the States and that there was no further money-not one cent-available for the States, and the later revelation that he had, in fact, attempted to make a private financial arrangement with the Premier of Queensland to the extent of a further $16m, can the State Premiers, including Mr Bjelke-Petersen, still continue these negotiations with the Commonwealth to arrange more funds under special circumstances or is the situation as the Prime Minister said earlier in the day, that the Commonwealth has exhausted its financial responsibilities to the States?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1881" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What, in fact, the Prime Minister has said is that during the Premiers Conference discussions occurred on two main matters-the tax sharing arrangements and the new hospital and health financing. As to hospital and health financing, Queensland made a very strong claim that because of its past financing system for hospitals it was going to get by way of the Commonwealth's return of funds very considerably less per capita than other States and something like half of what Western Australia would get. Queensland asked that consideration be given to that. The Commonwealth indicated that the Minister for Health would be meeting on the Friday with State Ministers and the whole matter could be looked at. At the Premiers Conference the Commonwealth concluded its decisions on tax sharing and that is the right, the responsibility, of the Commonwealth so to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So it is correct to say that the Commonwealth had reached its decisions to set tax sharing at 9 per cent plus the other absorptions. It is equally correct to say that at the Friday meeting of the Health Ministers Queensland further advanced its cause and indicated that because of its very low base for hospital charges it would take a very considerable time for Queensland to achieve the kind of statistics that the Commonwealth was seeking and that other States might reach in time, and that what was necessary for Queensland was to have adequate bridging funds in that time. It also indicated quite clearly that it supported in principle the health program of the Commonwealth Government, that it wanted to reach the goals as quickly as it could but that it would need a particular amount of money.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth therefore decided as a once-off measure to provide $16m which would, when compared with the disbursements to the other States, give Queensland no preference at all, but a reasonable status amongst the other States. I remind the Senate that four out of the six States have made it abundantly clear that they agree entirely with the principles of the health scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has also indicated that whilst it believes it is possible for the States to recover at least 60 per cent of their present moneys out of the imposition of fees to those who can properly pay fees, there will be a review of this capacity towards the end of the next financial year, and the matter will be discussed again. The States generally accept the principle. They now have the undertaking that there will be a review. A particular disbursement was made as a once-off situation to Queensland on the very equitable grounds that Queensland had very special factors that no other State had.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The decision to provide support for ethnic schools arose from a recommendation in the report of the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs-Review of Multicultural and Migrant Education, September 1980. The program is being implemented this year and will provide up to $30 per student per annum to approved ethnic schools providing instruction on a part time basis in community languages and related cultural material. Grants will be made through the Schools Commission on the basis of applications from ethnic school authorities. The program is intended to provide support for such authorities which are at present ineligible for other forms of Commonwealth education funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A survey conducted by the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs last year indicated that approximately 100,000 students were enrolled in part time ethnic schools.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is no coincidence at all. It is my habit to get together a brief each day on each of the subjects and departments for which I am responsible in the hope that all honourable senators, except Senator Cavanagh, will want factual replies. I am advised that the Public Service Board approved certain arrangements relating to increments for electorate assistants and that these were consistent with the approach adopted recently for electorate secretaries and personal secretaries and were not inconsistent with the practice adopted in category reviews undertaken in the Public Service. The arrangements adopted should be seen against the usual practice adopted when individual positions in the Public Service are upgraded, that is, the position is declared vacant and the previous occupant has to compete for promotion to the new position. If successful he or she goes to the minimum of the new range if that is higher than the previous salary, notwithstanding his or her length of service in the job at the previous level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised that in the case of electorate assistants and electorate secretaries the Board decided, because of the across-the-board nature of the increase, that more generous arrangements which give some recognition to length of service should be applied. I am advised that the general practice when salary is adjusted retrospectively-such retrospectivity is granted only in special circumstances-is that extraneous payments such as overtime and shift penalties are adjusted with prospective effect. I am also advised that in addition to national wage increases electorate staff have received the benefit of the 4 per cent interim work value increase, which was awarded by the Full Bench last August and which was backdated to 22 May 1980, and also the increase which took effect on 19 November 1980. The staff will receive any further increases awarded by the Full Bench in the Public Service clerical administrative case. If Senator Kilgariff has further questions on the matter I would be happy to seek information for him.</PARA>

He said that the first he had heard about the doubts the Esso company held on the proposed Rundle shale oil project was on 18 January 1981. Was the Minister aware that in September last year Mr Jim Kirk, the Chairman and Managing Director of Esso, told a meeting of the Securities Institute of Australia in Brisbane that serious technical problems had been experienced with the project, that the estimated cost of stage 1 had increased to $1,500m and that Esso was not even sure that it would be able to sell the products because of their likely high price? If the Minister was aware of the reservations held at that stage by Esso, did he have them investigated? If he did, what advice did he receive in response? Will the Minister acknowledge that there were good grounds for doubt about the future of Rundle in September last year and that the subsequent talking up of the project against Esso's advice was only to promote the electoral advantage of the Government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I indicated to the Senate in answer to a question-Senator Button may well be aware of it; it is recorded in Hansard-I discovered only several months ago that Mr Kirk had made roughly the kinds of statements that Senator Button has indicated. I said that a number of statements, including my own, had been made over that period urging caution. The fact is that on a number of occasions I drew attention from public platforms to the magnitude of the enterprise and the huge amounts of money involved. Many a time honourable senators have heard me indicate in this Senate that the proposal was to do something that was unprecedented-to shift one million tonnes of rock a day-and that that in itself offered huge challenges. So, over that period, a considerable amount of warning was given. The fact is that in that period, following Mr Kirk's statement-as I now know, and it may or may not be related-there was a much increased trading on the exchange. I have been able to show this Senate many times that both the Australian partners' shares halved between that time and the days before I went to Rundle. So, in fact, there was no talking up of shares. The shares were being successively, day by day, reduced in value over the whole period. I have shown that the heavy volume of trading was ahead of my own visit and that what I said was absolutely true-that I had no reason to believe there would be any change in the timetables or the volumes that Esso would produce until in fact I was given the briefing. Until then I had not received from anyone any such information. As soon as I received it, the Government and I acted on it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I understand that the Treasurer issued a Press release on 11 May with regard to bank mergers. I believe that in that statement he noted that any merger of banks in this country was subject to the provisions of section 63 of the Banking Act, which requires the consent of the Treasurer before banks may enter into amalgamation arrangements or effect a reconstruction. However, the Treasurer pointed out that the section also provides that the consent of the Treasurer shall not be unreasonably withheld. We should consider the questions raised by Senator Townley against that background. Many people would argue that more competition between banks is desirable, particularly when that can give greater service, consistent with the security that people require of a banking system in this country. We ought to note also that in recent years there have been many changes in the financial arrangements in this country, with the growth of credit unions and the development of other facilities. Therefore, when we are talking about banking facilities we are not simply talking about a number of major banks. There are also within the States the State banks, and perhaps a much wider range of assistance can be given by the use of their resources. I will ascertain whether the Treasurer has any direct comment to make on the matters raised and, if so, I will advise the honourable senator.</PARA></TALK.START>

I ask: Now that the second Irish hunger striker, Frankie Hughes, has died, will the Minister reconsider the suggestion I put forward previously, that this Government approach the British Prime Minister, Mrs Thatcher, in an effort to save the lives of the remaining three hunger strikers. If this suggestion is considered to be unacceptable, will the Government approach the United Nations with a view to examining the possibility of having the British troops repatriated and their role taken over by a United Nations peacekeeping force?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The latter situation would be, of course, in defiance of the whole question of natural sovereignty. The United Nations would not consider it. There is no question at all about the sovereignty of Northern Ireland. It is in general well accepted that the internal affairs of a country are sovereign matters for that country. The British Government has a direct and sovereign responsibility for peacekeeping in Northern Ireland, and in fact Northern Ireland is part of its democratic responsibility. I do not want to inflame this matter in any way. I have said that here previously. The British Government has taken the view-I believe the correct view-that the persons who have been gaoled have been gaoled for criminal offences and not for political offences. That is the first thing. They have been gaoled for acts of armed aggression. I think Bobby Sands was gaoled for armed robbery and subsequently for being in possession of arms. These are crimes in this country, as they are in any democratic country. The ordinary processes of law take place and then the ordinary course of punishment takes place.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom has made the intentions of her sovereign Government quite clear. Her Government has set a standard for the world in observing the rule of law. I am utterly sure that it will observe the rule of law there as it does elsewhere.</PARA>

He also stated that his general view is that strong national interest considerations would need to be involved before the Government sought to interfere with normal commercial processes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator O'Byrne drew attention to a question asked of me at the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science conference held earlier this week and to my reply that I thought a majority of post-graduate students would be covered. I said that I would seek information and I sought to do so. In 1980 there were an estimated 21,000 higher degree students in Australia of which 7,000 were full time students and 14,000 were part time students. Of the full time students, approximately 4,000-or a majority of the full time higher degree students-had either Commonwealth Government awards or awards from universities and colleges of advanced education. This figure excludes, of course, private overseas students who are required to pay a levy in lieu of fees. In 1980 there was also a significant number of students enrolled in recognised double degree and diploma combinations. Students enrolling in these courses will be exempt from the payment of fees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No figures are available to indicate the number of students in receipt of awards other than Commonwealth or university post-graduate awards. A considerable but inestimable number of part time post-graduate students are employed by universities or CAEs and would probably continue to receive free tuition. Many of the 14,000 students studying part time for higher qualifications are teachers studying for specialist qualifications which will be exempt from tuition fees as they are a recognised double degree or diploma combination. I should add that the commencing figures for post-graduate studies in 1980 are as follows: Total enrolments in new post-graduate studies for masters and doctor of philosophy degrees only, 5,000; total enrolments for new post-graduate diplomas, 19,000. It will be seen that a significant number of students in the post-graduate area have support programs from one source or another.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Grimes asked me a question about the indexation of the weekly income limits for low income groups under the new health arrangements for the disadvantaged. I replied to that question at the time but I wish to amplify my reply. I stated that the figure, which is presently $160, will vary twice a year. That is quite correct, but the full figure of $160 will not be indexed. In other words, it has a component which will be indexed and other components which will not be indexed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The weekly limits were specified on the basis of the cut-out point for unemployment benefit for a married couple without children. That is the level of private income at which entitlement to unemployment benefit ceases. At the May 1981 married rate of benefit of $111.10 a week, this cut-out point is $139.10. The weekly income limit for a married couple without children or a sole parent with one child is $20 above this cut-out point, rounded up to the next whole dollar. That is the figure of $160 which I gave yesterday, and which applies to the current rates of benefit.</PARA>
<PARA> The weekly limit for a person without dependants is 60 per cent of this amount, that is, $96. When the married rate of unemployment benefit is increased each May and November in line with movements in the consumer price index in the preceding December and June quarters respectively, the cut-out point for unemployment benefit increases by the same amount and therefore the weekly income limits under the health arrangements will also automatically increase. The six-monthly indexation of the married benefit rate will obviously not lead to a full CPI increase in the weekly limits for disadvantaged status as a low income family. That is because certain elements-for example, the $20 and the earning limits-are not automatically indexed. The Government will have to review the limits on a regular basis, as it reviews other non-indexed benefits.</PARA>
<PARA> For each child of a married couple or each child of a sole parent after the first child, the basic weekly income limit increases by twice the rate of additional benefit for children, which is currently $10 a week each. That is an adjustment of $20 for each child. This additional benefit rate, which determines the additional component for children in the weekly income limit for disadvantaged status, is also subject to review.</PARA>
<PARA> That may all sound terribly complicated, but from the point of view of those who wish to seek the benefit of this provision it is straightforward that the present income limit for a married couple is $160. It will rise on a twice-yearly basis by amounts which will be announced at the time. An additional amount of $20 a week is allowed for each child. That amount will vary when and if there are additions to the benefits which are provided for children. So the position of potential beneficiaries is quite straightforward. The income limits will be clearly laid down and beneficiaries will know where they stand.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise this matter of public importance today because of the crisis situation we have reached with regard to the Government's decisions concerning education. Honourable senators will note that it is the whole of the education system which we believe will be damaged by the ill-considered and ad hoc decisions of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, otherwise aptly known as the razor gang report. I assert that the education decisions in that report are indefensible. I do not believe that any Government senator speaking after me in this debate will be able to defend any of those decisions on the grounds of financial responsibility, or of administrative efficiency, and certainly not on the grounds of their doing anything to improve access to education or creating more equality in this society. In fact the overall effect of all of the Government's education decisions will be directly to the contrary, that is, to deny access to an increasing number of Australian citizens and to ensure that access to higher education, in particular to higher degrees and post-graduate work, will be the domain of an elite. It will not be an elite based on ability-a situation, of course, which is defensible-but an elite based on the ability to pay, which is in the interests of nobody and is certainly not in the interests of this country. The razor gang's attack on education is not just an attack on education options for individuals; it is an attack also on research and development in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say at the outset that we are not an over-educated community. That is a claim which is sometimes made by Government senators and by other people outside this place, but it is totally unable to be substantiated. It is a myth perpetrated by self-seeking politicians and anti-intellectual elements of the Press. We are, in fact, an under-educated community. We are failing to keep pace with Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. I quote the figures from the 1976 census with regard to the measurement of higher education in this country. I quote from that census because they are the most recent figures available. When we look at the population aged 15 years and over we find that only 1.97 per cent of people have bachelor's degrees, only 0.42 per cent of people have graduate diplomas and only 0.35 per cent of citizens have higher degrees. In the face of statistics like those, I do not think anybody can argue with any sense that we are an over-educated community. </PARA>

I think it is worth emphasising too that the enrolments of students in the secondary system are very low-dangerously low-if we compare them with enrolments in OECD countries. In relation to full time school enrolments of 15 to 19 year olds, Australia inauspiciously ranks No. 14 on an OECD table of 23 nations with only a 45 per cent involvement in contrast to comparative figures of 74 per cent for the United States of America and 70 per cent for Switzerland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation regarding the Australian Research Grants Scheme, which was, of course, the major means by which the Federal Government supported research in this country, is also very seriously damaged by administrative and financial recommendations of the razor gang. I should like to quote from a document on the Australian Research Grants Scheme prepared by the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations in April 1981. The document points out that in 1981 the ARGS was allocated only $16m, which of course is considerably less in real terms than its initial grant in 1966. So, in terms of Federal involvement in research, Federal support for research so vital to Australia's economy, we have actually been going backwards since 1966. The document goes on to point out:</PARA>
<PARA>Unless Australia's research capability and its human resources are developed together with its physical resources, we will become a quarry for other nations which develop both. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Research Grants Committee has made a number of pertinent comments. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>The reduction in the average grant in real terms means that the Committee is unable to recommend sufficient support to enable the best investigators to achieve their research potential. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee further said:</PARA>
<PARA>The extent of the withdrawal of support for worthwhile projects can be gauged from the increased number of proposals judged by the Committee's external assessors to be of good quality which could not be supported. In 1980 there was 112 such cases; in 1981 this figure has risen to 296. </PARA>
<PARA>The ARGS is having to reject an increasing number of the highest standard research projects which would, of course, be of great benefit to our economy and our society. Again, overseas comparisons put us in a very poor light indeed. An overseas comparison done by the ARGC points out that Australia ranks thirteenth among the developed countries in terms of research spending, far below countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Japan, Belgium and Canada, and ranks equal to Finland, Ireland and Italy. Only Ireland, New Zealand, Spain and Portugal spend a smaller percentage of their gross domestic product on research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that the Fraser Government is unprepared to support in a way that even compares modestly with other OECD countries any sort of serious effort in research and development in this country. I remind honourable senators that this is at a time when the structure of the Australian economy is totally inappropriate to meet current economic problems and when we are falling behind in every area of advanced technology, planning, entrepreneurial skills and any other ability which would enable the economy to be revived. It seems that the Fraser Government prefers to put people on the dole rather than allow them to develop their skills and knowledge in tertiary institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons for the very high rates of youth unemployment in Australia, when we compare our rates with countries such as Austria, West Germany, Holland, Sweden and Japan, is that we have such low participation rates in post-secondary education. The Tertiary Education Commission's recent report on rates of participation in tertiary education, of that section of the population aged between 17 and 29 years, found that only 4.4 per cent of the population are in universities, in colleges of advanced education only 4.9 per cent, and in technical and further education institutions only 16.5 per cent. When we compare those figures with the exceptionally high figures of youth unemployment for the same age bracket-for example, we have 25 per cent of young girls unemployed in some parts of Australia-we can see what is happening. Instead of allowing and facilitating the movement of young people from school into higher education or vocational training, we are simply putting them on the dole, forcing them to join the unemployment statistics. How any government can defend that action is completely beyond me. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser Government and the razor gang are selling Australia short by these latest decisions on education. They are depriving us of a prosperous economic future by depriving us of new skills and new solutions to current economic problems. I speak for those on this side of the chamber when I say that we do not want Australia to be merely the world's quarry. Australia ought to be a world leader in relevant aspects of new technology-for example, solar energy, agricultural technology, medical technology, irrigation technology. These are all areas in which Australians have achieved very distinguished breakthroughs in research in the past, but they are areas in which we are now falling behind. We will fall further behind now that the most talented and motivated people will be denied the opportunity to pursue a higher degree. </PARA>
<PARA> After Question Time today Senator Carrick tried to defend his claim that there are enough post-graduate awards to cover the able post-graduate students. I was interested to follow the figures that he put forward, but those figures do not answer our criticism. Our criticism is that the vast majority of people currently engaged in post-graduate study do not have access to a post-graduate award or degree. Many of those people, we are informed by their representative organisations, will have to withdraw from post-graduate study. The statistics from the Tertiary Education Commission's triennial report show that in 1980 there were 21,629 students at higher degree levels in universities and colleges of advanced education, of which 14,277 were part time enrolments; that is, some 66 per cent of the total. Of course no scholarships are available for part time students. So already two-thirds of students at higher degree levels have no access to any sort of post-graduate fellowship. In relation to 1980 commencing students, there were 5,589 new enrolments for higher degrees in universities and only 1,148 were receiving an award. This latter figure represents about 20 per cent of the total. So if we extrapolate from those figures-we have no more precise figures available-we can say that between 15 and 20 per cent of higher degree students have awards of some description. I ask Senator Carrick: What will happen to the other 80 per cent? It seems to me, from representations that I have received from student bodies and from staff associations, that a vast majority of that 80 per cent of students will not be able to pursue their post-graduate studies. Why are we wasting four-fifths of the able post-graduate students' abilities by having this ludicrous new system of imposing fees and student loans?</PARA>
<PARA> One of the worst aspects of the Government's education decisions is that they have been taken contrary to the advice and experience of those people who ought to advise the Government, namely the Vice Chancellors and the staff associations. I will quote briefly from a letter written on 11 May by the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations to my colleague Mr Dawkins. The letter is signed by Dr Darvall, the President, who states:</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the government's decision to introduce fees for post-graduate students. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw to your attention the close link between research and post-graduate work in Australia's universities. An attack on post-graduates is an attack on research, indeed an attack on the whole basis of Australian universities as they now exist. </PARA>
<PARA> Many post-graduates-particularly those engaged in research degrees-are supporting themselves only by part-time work and many could not afford the fees. The direct effect of the government's decision will be to decrease post-graduate enrolments at a time when we most need to invest in our human resources. </PARA>
<PARA>Why is not the Government taking note of the people who are involved and who know what is happening? Why instead does it pursue with its ideological fanatacism, an attack, an onslaught on wider access to education within our community?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there is a sinister explanation which Senator Coleman has suggested. I think that the Fraser Government feels that it will not profit by having a community in which education, understanding and the ability to criticise are prevalent. The Fraser Government believes that its best interests are served by keeping people ignorant, frightened and able to be manipulated. Why has the Government decided to put this unnecessary obstacle in the way of people seeking higher degrees? Certainly financial savings for the public purse, which is supposed to be the rationale of these decisions, cannot be regarded as a satisfactory explanation. The amount of money gained by the imposition of fees will represent a minimal amount of the education budget-less than half of one per cent. Most of that amount can be cancelled out by the administrative costs of gathering the fees. So there is no financial reason for these changes. There must be an ideological reason. It appears that the Government is determined that higher education, along with first class health care, will be accessible only to the affluent in our community. This is a drastic and tragic reversal of national educational policies which have been developed by all Federal governments since the end of the Second World War. The effect on individuals as well as our society generally will be disastrous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The decision to restrict eligibility for the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, to introduce a student loans scheme and to impose tertiary fees, in contradiction of an unambiguous election promise, will together exclude the majority of able and motivated students from higher education. One group of people in our society which particularly benefited from the expansion of higher education and from the abolition of tertiary fees by the Whitlam Government was that group comprising female students. Enrolment figures in all of our tertiary institutions show a marked increase in the number of women students who were able to enrol following the abolition of fees. Many of these women are mature age students who are taking up an opportunity which was denied them earlier for financial reasons. They have proved to be excellent students and successful graduates and many of them are now engaged in post-graduate studies or contributing to the work force, particularly in areas such as teaching. That is a development which I hope all honourable senators will applaud. </PARA>
<PARA> Mature age women with children to support will simply not be able to pay fees nor will they be able to burden the family budget with a student loan. So their opportunity to improve themselves, to raise the standard of living of their families and to make a contribution to society, will be destroyed. Many post-graduate students from modest backgrounds are married and in the age group in which it is most desirable to begin a family. It will be impossible for post-graduate students, with family commitments, to avail themselves of a loans scheme or to pay fees. So again post-graduates' families will be penalised heavily by the new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision further to restrict eligibility for TEAS is a decision to restrict a scheme which is already grossly inadequate as a form of financial support for students without wealthy parents. The conventional methods of supplementing tertiary assistance, namely part time jobs in the general work force or part time tutoring within universities, have both virtually disappeared. When we look at the most disadvantaged group of people in our society-the Australian Aborigines-we find that their participation in higher education is so low as to be statistically insignificant. I believe that the future of Aboriginal people depends to a very large extent on a significant number of Aboriginal people acquiring skills in areas such as medicine, law, administration and so on so that they will be able to deal with the enormous problems which face their communities and with the prejudice that resides in the white community. The imposition of fees and the burden of having to take on a loan is totally oppressive and totally out of the question for this group. </PARA>
<PARA> The Curriculum Development Centre, which is also the subject of attacks by the razor gang and which may disappear if the States are not prepared to foot the bill, has made a major contribution to Aboriginal education by developing for the first time, in consultation with Aboriginal communities, national programs of English and mathematics instruction. I believe it will be a tragedy for the future of Aboriginal people in this country if that particular education program, which is currently being developed by the Curriculum Development Centre, goes under because the Government is not prepared to foot the bill to the tune of a couple of million dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> Denying students access to our tertiary education makes no economic sense. On the contrary, it is the squandering of a public investment which has already been made. We have an impressive network of publicly funded tertiary institutions throughout Australia. The facilities are there, the staff are there and the students wish to study. By depriving the students of the opportunity to use the facilities already established the Government is creating a situation of waste and instability within those institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the current trends in tertiary education, which have been documented by the Tertiary Education Commission, we find that in higher education there have been increased enrolments in part time and external studies but a decline in full time enrolments. There has been an increase in the proportion of older students studying but a decrease in the number of younger students studying. Within all three sectors of tertiary education there has been an increase in the number of women students. If we examine those trends, which were established before the decisions of the Lynch committee, in terms of the decisions of the Lynch Committee we can see how absolutely destructive those decisions are because all of these trends demonstrate that prevailing assistance for full time study is totally inadequate and that full time enrolments are declining even without allowing for the razor gang's decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The appropriateness of a loans scheme, which may in some instances apply to wealthy students undertaking medical or legal studies although I would be critical of such a scheme even in respect of such groups, is entirely dubious when it is applied to the increasing proportion of older students and to women students. Students in either of those groups, as I have pointed out, are not in a financial position to take on the economic burden of a loan and of course they will simply drop out. The growth that we badly need in our tertiary institutions will stop. The decline in enrolments by younger students is already a serious problem and that will increase. The main reasons for the decline in enrolments by younger students are that the financial support for their studies is so inadequate and part time jobs are not available. So they will be condemned to unemployment at public expense while lecture halls, libraries and laboratories are left empty; again at the expense of the public purse. The whole situation is irrational and discriminatory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; This debate is predicated on a number of assumptions which have been made by Senator Ryan and various academic unions and groups none of which, of course, we are asked to believe have any self-interest in this matter. These responses are to the decisions which have been announced by the Review of Commonwealth Functions. I therefore think it is important to understand something about the background of what exactly that review was seeking to do. The decisions taken by that Committee of Review were not made with education as the sole target of its inquiries, nor were the decisions that were made about education taken in isolation from all the other decisions announced about the structure, the role of and the services to be provided by the Commonwealth Government. Clearly the background to the Review of Commonwealth Functions was the desire in the community for the Federal Government to be in a position to be able to offer lower rates of tax and for there to be less general imposition on Australian citizens while at the same time preserving and continuing to supply the services regarded as necessary and proper for a Federal government to be providing. That desire can be achieved in any number of ways. It can be achieved by a better delivery of the services that are to be provided; it can be achieved by more efficiency in the provision of services to be offered; or it can be achieved by avoiding unnecessary waste and duplication where there is more than one party to the provision of any particular service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been clear from the outset-it has been clear from the time of the 1974 and 1975 elections at least-that this Government has had a commitment to a genuinely federalist system of government based on a reallocation of resources and responsibilities between Commonwealth and State governments that had got so badly out of kilter not only in the period 1972 to 1975 but also in the period prior to 1972. It should therefore have been no surprise to anybody that the relocation of functions and the reallocation of resources between the Commonwealth and the States take place across the board and that no special exception would be made for the education sector. This discussion today invites the Senate to apply three tests to the decisions made by the committee of review. The three tests-all explicit in the terms of Senator Ryan's proposal-are: Has the decision on education damaged the system? Was the decision ad hoc? Was the decision ill-conceived? I propose to deal with a number of the decisions announced in the Lynch committee report and test them against that background. </PARA>
<PARA> The first relates to the abolition of the Curriculum Development Centre. All State governments have within their education system extensive curriculum development operations to meet their own requirements because whether we like it or not State education systems in many respects are still different and distinct from each other. We eventually acquired an overriding Commonwealth Curriculum Development Centre. The Government has said that clearly it is duplicating a number of the functions currently being performed by the curriculum development bodies in the States. After all, the Commonwealth itself virtually no longer provides direct education which could be influenced by Curriculum Development Centre recommendations other than in the Australian Capital Territory. If the States themselves believe they could get benefit out of the work of the CDC all they have to do is to undertake to pay between them half of the costs of the CDC. That is not an unreasonable statement to make. We have said that if the States are prepared to pay half of the costs of the Centre we will keep it in operation. We have also said that where there are significant national undertakings of a curriculum development type, we will ensure within the Commonwealth Department of Education that appropriate research is undertaken on them. Therefore the specific matter mentioned by Senator Ryan, that of the Aboriginal education program, is one that will not disappear because the CDC may not continue to exist. Clearly it is one that will be capable of being picked up within the other resources that the Commonwealth will make available-I will come to this later-under the question of research and the allocation of funds for research. Thus the CDC arguments put forward by the Labor Party do not stand up. </PARA>
<PARA> I come now to the abolition of the Education Research and Development Committee. We have simply said that instead of having a separate committee the Commonwealth Education portfolio will be provided from the Budget with a total amount for its research activities; they will be earmarked for research and they will be capable of being used by the Commonwealth Department of Education for research on whichever projects it happens to regard as worthy of funding or being in need of additional research. It can be seen from the statement put down yesterday in the House of Representatives by the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) entitled 'Science and Technology 1980-81' where, across the whole broad spectrum of Commonwealth Government research activity, research is taking place into educational matters. It is not simply confined to the Commonwealth Department of Education. </PARA>
<PARA> I come now to the introduction of the system of student loans. I will say very little on this because my colleague Senator Teague will be discussing this at some length. I simply say that in May 1977 the Butcher Committee on Student Loans was established to examine the desirability and feasibility of introducing a system of loans for Australian post-secondary students. The first recommendation of that committee was:</PARA>
<PARA> A system of loans for needy students at the post-secondary level of education should be established as a supplement to existing grants schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>Where is the ad hockery, where is the ill-conceived nature of a decision which is based on a recommendation made by an expert committee to a government in fact some four or five years ago? What is ad hoc about responding to a committee established by the Government to investigate a particular matter and which recommended a system of student loans? When the Government gets round to saying 'Yes, we will pick that up. We in fact will have a system of student loans', Senator Ryan says: 'That is an ad hoc and ill-conceived decision'. The Government has made a clear statement on what it intends to do as far as the rationalisation of the position of Colleges of Advanced Education is concerned, and that is to ensure again that we get greater value for the education dollar while in no way depressing the quality of education available. I quote from the report of the Tertiary Education Commission for the 1982-84 triennium. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission proposes to adopt the following policy objectives in relation to higher education for the 1982-84 triennium:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Resources to be reallocated from teacher education to other activities. This reallocation should be completed by the year 1984. To achieve these objectives, the Commission will be recommending in Volume 2 levels of funding for 1984 for CAEs involved in teacher education which will reflect their decreased teaching responsibilities; it will be recommending increased levels of funding for those institutions which are expanding their effort in the technologies and business studies. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Institutions which are predominantly concerned with teacher education to be consolidated into larger units by their incorporation into multi-purpose or multi-campus CAEs or by integration with neighbouring universities. </PARA>
<PARA>The test that Senator Ryan wanted to put forward was that the decision of the Government was ad hoc and ill-conceived. The fact is that the Tertiary Education Commission, which from time to time is used as one of the great touchstones of Labor Party debates on education, clearly in its triennial report to the Government has recommended a reallocation of resources from teacher education institutions and a consolidation of institutions. Unless it be thought that any swifties were being pulled regarding the institutions to be affected, I draw attention to the supplementary report of the Tertiary Education Commission entitled 'Summary of Recommendation on Guidelines'. In paragraph 9.46 on page 269 will be found the list of institutions which the TEC recommends ought to be rationalised, merged and integrated. That is the same list as appears in the Lynch committee report. That is neither ad hoc nor ill-conceived. It gives effect to a recommendation made to a government by its own principal and primary expert body advising it on post-secondary education-the Tertiary Education Commission. Therefore, that as a decision negates all of the tests-damage, ad hockery or ill-conception-that Senator Ryan has sought to put forward in her matter of public importance. To say that this was done without the benefit of expert advice flies in the face of the clear and demonstrable evidence that the Government's primary advisers have suggested this course of action. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to refer to what we are proposing for tertiary education in Western Australia. Grants to the Murdoch University and the University of Western Australia will be dependent upon closer integration of the resources of those two institutions. Again, that is in response to an earlier comment by the TEC and indeed the Williams Committee about the integration of universities in Western Australia. Again, that comment will be found in the latest volume of the Commission's report. Its recommendation has been picked up. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad that the Opposition Whip, Senator Robertson, has come into the chamber at this stage, because the next decision made by the Lynch committee was not to proceed with the funding of a university in the Northern Territory in this triennium. It is amazing that that was not criticised by Senator Ryan. After all it is not a matter that only I have raised. Senator Button, Senator Ryan and Senator Robertson have clearly indicated that the Labor Party is not in favour of the establishment of a university in the Northern Territory. That point has been made by honourable senators on this side of the chamber. That is one of the decisions which was made by the Lynch committee and announced in its report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's matter of public importance says that it is concerned about damage to education or about the decisions being ad hoc or ill-conceived. What in fact it means is that it does not agree with some decisions announced by the Lynch committee. Those decisions with which the Opposition does agree are excluded by it from the categories of being damaging, being the result of ad hoc decisions or being ill-conceived. Therefore, presumably parts of the Lynch committee recommendations on education are not damaging, not ad hoc and not ill-conceived but, indeed, are to be welcomed by the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Schools Commission. The Government has indicated clearly on page 22 of the report of the Lynch committee that the role of the Schools Commission, in terms of its direct involvement at a State level, is to be wound down. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> There will be a reduction in the Schools Commission's direct involvement in program administration and information collection. Accordingly, the activities of the State offices of the Commission will be scaled down and the Buildings Unit in the Central Office disbanded. </PARA>
<PARA>It is absolutely right and proper that responsibility for the structuring, building, administration and development of schools within the separate States is a matter for the separate States to pursue in a way in which they consider appropriate and their electors consider appropriate, and in line with their clear constitutional responsibilities. The Government has said in the Lynch committee report that it intends to integrate the Education Program for Unemployed Youth with the school to work transition program. The two-volume report entitled 'An Evaluation of the Education Program for Unemployed Youth' prepared for the Commonwealth Department of Education by G. D. Hubbert contains recommendations that are in no way incompatible with recommendations which the Lynch committee has made on the integration of the EPUY scheme with the more broad, general and comprehensive school to work transition program. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the matter of fees. I know that my colleague Senator Teague will be saying something about this matter also. I think it was mischievous for Senator Ryan to trot out the sort of figures which she did about who will be disadvantaged at a post-graduate level. She said, for instance, that part time students are not eligible for post-graduate awards. What she disguised was the fact that a very large proportion of those part time students are part time students because they are also part time employees of the university concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that in a moment. If Senator Ryan can contain her impatience everything will be revealed to her. It is entirely fallacious to lump together all part time students as if they had no means of support or assistance from their own institutions. If one looks at the intake of master and doctor of philosophy students in 1980, one finds that approximately 2,000 of the initial 5,000 students who commenced studies in 1980 were in one respect or another holders of post-graduate awards or awards through universities as a result of which they would be exempt from the payment of fees under the scheme which the Government has announced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ought to make clear four points about tertiary fees. First, from the beginning of 1982 fees will be introduced only for second and higher qualifications in universities and colleges of advanced education. No fees will be imposed for undergraduate students. Secondly, fees will apply only to those enrolling for the first time in 1982. In other words, those continuing in their studies should not be affected. Thirdly, fees will not apply to recognised double degree and diploma students. Many part timers are in fact doing double degrees and recognised diploma combinations-for instance, those who have their original degree in education who are taking diplomas which relate to special education, education of the handicapped or education of the blind. Fourthly, students in receipt of Commonwealth Government or university post-graduate awards will be exempt. From that point of view, the hysterical outburst on behalf of the various union and academic groups engaged-as numerous lobby groups are as a result of the Lynch committee recommendations -in an exercise of self-preservation of their own particular bailiwick, of the things that are particularly important to them regardless of the overall contribution that this situation will make, is not surprising. </PARA>
<PARA> For a general response to the matters raised by the Opposition I turn to the comments made by Dr John Bremer, the editor of the 'Higher Education' supplement in the Australian. He is a person who has been quoted in the past by honourable senators on both sides of the chamber. It has been accepted that he is a person whose knowledge on higher education is such that his comments should be taken seriously and be carefully weighed. In the 'Higher Education' supplement in the Australian of 6 May 1981, Dr Bremer wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, the Prime Minister must be praised for having finally forced some decisions upon the tertiary education sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The inability of higher education to come to terms with such things as deadlines, budgets, society needs and power is notorious. The health of higher education has been deteriorating but little has been done-or even proposed-except the usual prescription of more money. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the standard Labor Party prescription. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> That is simply unrealistic. Institutions and State co-ordinating bodies have shown little ability to reform themselves, and even the restricted attempts at change have caused turmoil and chaos. No wonder they have not got very far. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Prime Minister has finally laid it on the line, and he deserves full marks for courage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Tate has the opportunity to read the rest of the article he will see that it states that there are probably more restrictions coming in terms of financial responsibility. That is a good thing too. Dr Bremer went on to indicate that he has a view about the Tertiary Education Commission. I have discussed that. Clearly the decisions that were announced in the Lynch committee report followed recommendations made by the Tertiary Education Commission itself in relation to a number of matters. These include college reorganisation, the situation in Darwin, the situation at the university of Western Australia, and the provision of earmarked funds-$5m,-in each of the next couple of years to facilitate what the Commission has recommended as a transition to get a greater degree of business studies and appropriate courses into universities and colleges. These recommendations, made by the Tertiary Education Commission, were picked up in the Lynch committee report and were enunciated in statements by the Minister. Dr Bremer went on to indicate that he has criticisms of what he regards as some of the 'rhetorical fluff' that goes with the statement. That may well be a fair enough criticism but it does not in one jot detract from the central proposition that making post-secondary education in Australia face up to its financial responsibilities is a good thing in itself. One should not be surprised that vice-chancellors, the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations, the Australian Union of Students or the Federation of College Staffs, or whoever it happens to be, see their own self-interests and positions threatened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The tests which Senator Ryan has sought to put to the Senate this afternoon to show that it will damage the education system can be demonstrated to be false. The decisions were not ad hoc when one can demonstrate-whether by way of the Butcher Committee, the Tertiary Education Commission or Dr Hubbert's study of the EPUY-that there was nothing ad hoc in the responses to reports and recommendations that had been before the Government either in the couple of months immediately prior to the presentation of that response, or for a longer period of time. To state that they were ill-conceived when they are clearly part of what Dr Bremer and others recognise is an overall attempt to introduce some rationality into the post-secondary education system, in Australia, demonstrates that each of the three tests which Senator Ryan herself erected in her motion by accusations fails when weighed up against the facts and the decisions properly and rightfully made by the Review of Commonwealth Functions committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the proposition brought forward by Senator Ryan because I believe it brings into the Senate chamber much of the dismay and the protest which has reverberated around Australia, not only at meetings of tens of thousands of students over the past 10 days or so but also, I believe, in many homes in Australia as families have begun to realise the impact which these decisions will have on the opportunities for their children whom they hoped would be succoured and helped by the Australian Government rather than be hindered, obstructed and impeded, which will be the effect of these proposals. Senator Puplick accused those who speak in this way of merely fostering some sort of hysterical self-interest, but what he failed to point out was that the former Federal Minister for Education, the senior Minister in this place, sat quietly in the chamber right throughout the debate. Of course, he put Senator Puplick up on the chopping block because Senator Puplick will be departing from this chamber in two or three weeks' time. Not a Minister has entered the debate to defend the razor gang's degradation of the Australian educational system. Instead we have people of the calibre of Senator Puplick, whom the electorate rejected, making a few rhetorical flourishes in a last desperate attempt to gain preselection in some future round.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall make some general points because Senator Puplick has very selectively referred to certain editorial and journalistic opinion. What comes through from any fair-minded reading of the criticism of the razor gang's foray into the educational system is the fact that it has quite missed its mark. In the name of smaller government the Cabinet has come up with a recipe for even more bureaucracy in the educational system. States and Territories will have to duplicate, triplicate, septlicate, if there is such a word. It will fragment and create a situation of political dependence throughout the States and Territories. At least before we were approaching what I believe was a real hope within the Australian community that we could create a national education policy in the sense of an education policy which indeed was for the whole Australian nation and which provided equality of educational opportunity for all Australians. But that hope, I believe, has been overborne and extinguished by the razor gang mentality which, as Senator Ryan has pointed out, really will create another elite within the Australian nation. When we discussed the overseas student fees legislation in this place some two years ago it was quite apparent that it would benefit the elites from overseas rather than the ordinary overseas person seeking the benefits of our education system. There has been a slow dismantling of that hope and aspiration of the Australian people which reached its fruition in the setting up of the Tertiary Education Commission and such bodies in the Whitlam years. This has been done without a mandate from the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the real political point which honourable senators on the opposite side of this chamber have to answer. It is all right for Senator Puplick to say that reports came into being about four or five years ago. They languished in the Government's archives until an opportune moment arrived, as it did a few weeks ago. They have been dusted off and decisions have been made, ostensibly to save a few dollars, placing some reliance on those reports. But six months ago when the Government faced the electors at no stage was there any mention that families would have to bear the cost of raising loans for their children who perhaps had to travel to distant centres for tertiary education. At no point in that election campaign were post-graduate students told that they would have to find perhaps $1,500 to $3,000 a year to pay for attaining their second degree. At no stage has the Government obtained from the Australian electorate a mandate for this dismantling of the Australian educational system. Of course, in exactly the same way-the analogy is perfect-it dismantled Medibank and created medibungle No. 5 only a matter of weeks ago without a real mandate from the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Puplick were correct in saying that all that one had was the hysterical outburst of a few student groups, perhaps one could understand the line he took. Not only do we have student, university and college of advanced education groups speaking in this way, but we also have the President of the Queensland branch of the Young Liberal Movement saying that the education cutbacks would guarantee the Government's defeat at the next election. Even more distinguished than that comment is that coming from Professor Bruce Williams, the Vice-Chancellor of Sydney University, whose remarks have been quoted to us time and time again, particularly when Senator Carrick was Minister for Education. He said that the terms of reference of his famous Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training instructed it to have regard to the Government's policy commitment to a widening of educational opportunities. This week, as a result of the razor gang's decisions, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> This Government has not lived up to its declared commitment. </PARA>
<PARA>He further said:</PARA>
<PARA>I oppose the fee scheme, for example, because it is a bad scheme. It will restrict opportunities and distort the allocation of resources. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the opinion of perhaps the most eminent academic who has conducted an inquiry into the Australian education system in recent years. To get down to the nitty-gritty of the situation, the imposition of fees for post-graduate tertiary studies has already been rebuffed by the very universities which will have to play an administrative role in collecting these fees. One finds, for example, that the University of Adelaide Council, which I would not have thought to be one of the more radical bodies within the Australian community, stated last week that it will refuse to administer the loans scheme as proposed by the Lynch committee on the grounds that it will deter disadvantaged students from tertiary study and diminish equality of opportunity. This is not merely a body of academics. Half of the members of the University of Adelaide Council, as with most councils, come from the general community. </PARA>
<PARA> I can assure honourable senators on the opposite side of this chamber that it is the whole community which is upset and dismayed at the way in which the Government is requiring those universities to divert their resources from teaching and to undertake administrative functions which will prove unbearable for those institutions. One has to think only of the simple mechanics of trying to recover bad debts to have some glimpse of the inordinate administrative strain which universities and colleges will be put under in trying to help to administer the Government's proposal. It is well known, for example, that two major banks in California have refused in recent times to grant student loans on the ground that the cost of chasing up defaulters has proved unbearable and unworkable. </PARA>
<PARA> We have no indication from the Government of how the loans scheme is to work. For example, we have not been told whether sheer market forces will operate in this field. If a person is to obtain a degree which promises some certainty of employment, of high earning power-such as in the fields of engineering and medicine-will the rate of interest he pays be lower than that paid by a student entering a field with poorer prospects of employment or salary levels that are only average? Who will guarantee the repayment of the loan? The Government makes a lot of the fact that the potential earning power of the student will form the guarantee for the loan, but what banker would loan money to a student before he had succesfully completed his first year of studies, before there was any evidence that the particular degree could be successfully undertaken by him and the potential earnings thereby realised?</PARA>
<PARA> What I found most objectionable in Senator Puplick's tirade was the implication that the opposition, the groups outside who were making a noise about this matter, were acting only out of self-interest, out of some hysterical attachment to their own ivory towers, to their own pursuit of a comfortable academic existence. What they are concerned about, and what I am particularly concerned about, is the effect on this nation's future capacity to deal, for example, with the resources boom. Senator Thomas, the Deputy Government Whip, would well know that the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, in its examination of alternatives to Australia's petroleum-based fuels, and in its inquiry into the aluminium industry, time and again has received evidence from engineering institutes, from the major corporations concerned and from government departments, that Australia is facing a critical shortage of the technologists, engineers and post-graduate trained personnel needed to make accelerated resources development, and the benefits that that will bring to Australia, a reality. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be no doubt that the decisions taken by the razor gang will stem rather than accelerate the flow of such qualified people into the work force. There is no doubt, as is made clear in submission after submission and letter after letter flowing into our offices, those decisions will reduce the supply of the properly trained scientists and technologists needed for these resource-led projects. I hold in my hand a letter from Dr Scott, the Dean of Science at the University of Tasmania, who makes the following point:</PARA>
<PARA> The fees are likely to be beyond the means of many students who now successfully undertake higher degrees in our Faculty without scholarship support, and who then go on to make valuable contributions to the development of this country. </PARA>
<PARA>That is surely the point-that the national research effort is dependent upon a regular movement of trained research personnel from the universities and colleges into the work force. The fact that the post-graduate research programs are now to be put in jeopardy by this Goverment seems also to put in some jeopardy the whole future of Australia's economic development. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to indicate very briefly the deleterious effect which the imposition of the requirement that a student should supplement his Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowance-if he is lucky enough to get one-or substitute for it a loan, will have on the participation rate of persons who live in centres away from the cities which house our tertiary education institutions. If one considers, for example, the position on the north-west coast of Tasmania, an area with which I am familiar, and the 1980 enrolments at the University of Tasmania, it becomes clear that whereas quite ordinary suburbs in Hobart such as Glenorchy and Bellerive send some 62 and 109 students respectively to the university, towns on the north-west coast, such as Devonport or Burnie, send in the region of 90 and 53. In fact, whereas Hobart's suburbs contribute some 1,100 students to the University population, only some 250 come from the whole of the north-west and west coasts of Tasmania. I predict that as families find it more and more difficult to raise the money to send their children to Hobart or Launceston to engage in tertiary studies, that disparity in numbers will become even more apparent. That is what the Government seems to fail to understand. </PARA>
<PARA> I still believe that there is some chance that the Government will see reason and modify its proposals, but if they are implemented there is no doubt that they will help to create within Australian society an elite of people whose access to health care will be dependent upon their financial resources and whose access to educational opportunity will equally be dependent on the financial resources that they can muster. That seems to represent an idealogically motivated attack on the education system. It is ad hoc. It is certainly without a mandate from the Australian people and it deserves the condemnation that has been expressed in this chamber and in dozens of meetings throughout Australia in the past week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a proposition by honourable senators opposite that some educational damage flows from the recently concluded Review of Commonwealth Functions, which is popularly known as the report of the razor gang. The report has focused on three main areas: The impact of proposed amalgamations of colleges of advanced education, the introduction of loans and some fees for tertiary students and, thirdly, the Schools Commission and the Curriculum Development Centre. I propose to touch on those three areas but, principally, to discuss the introduction, for tertiary students, of a system of loans and the payment of some fees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, I return to the direct mandate given by the people of Australia to the Fraser Government to implement a review of government functions. In 1975, 1977 and 1980 the people of Australia endorsed the Fraser Government's election program, whose consistent aim was to reduce government expenditure, reduce Commonwealth functions in favour of some of their returning to the States where appropriate or being administered by private enterprise. Government supporters offer no apology for the full-bodied pursuit of those programs, so clearly and continuously announced and advocated in the election context throughout the 1970s. The Review of Commonwealth Functions was one of the first tasks of the newly re-elected Fraser Government and a committee of five Ministers was set up to carry it out. That has been done carefully, comprehensively and fully over the last six months. The Governor-General, in opening this Parliament, said:</PARA>
<PARA> My Government will give particular attention to encouraging the growth of the private sector and to increasing the freedom of choice of taxpayers in spending their own incomes. It will be an important policy objective to continue to restrain public expenditure so as to provide scope for reducing the burden of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA>At another point, the Governor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA> But my Government does believe profoundly that it is vitally important that the power and functions of the State should be limited and contained. It does believe that the state is likely to be in many ways an inefficient and wasteful provider and that many services can be better supplied in other ways. And it does believe that the expansion of private enterprise is the best means to achieve the well-being and health of a society. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no apology for the Review of Commonwealth Functions. Indeed, any government so elected would be lacking in meeting its obligations to the people if it did not carry out periodic reviews in order to make sure that dead wood was cut away; that inappropriate functions were abolished; that efficiency was introduced and savings made. The Australian people continue to urge the lowering of taxes. That can be achieved only by a review of expenditure. There were some 400 decisions in the review announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) a fortnight ago. A handful of them related to education. As there have been reassessments in all areas of government, it is appropriate to find some areas of education that may be looked at. I believe the responsibilities and the funding programs of the Commonwealth were lightly touched in the review. In the process all Ministers were carefully consulted and other opinions were sought. The public knew that the review was being conducted. It ran its race for six months and it was far from being an ad hoc or lightly thought through process. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether it be with regard to loans or fees, the amalgamation of colleges of advanced education or the Schools Commission, the charge that the Opposition has made that the decisions are ad hoc cannot be sustained. The proposed loans scheme flows directly from the report of the Butcher committee which was brought to this Parliament four years ago. The amalgamation of CAEs is a direct fulfilment of the report of the Tertiary Education Commission which was brought to this Parliament only a month ago and which was widely commended and happily received by both the Government and the Opposition. The review of the Commonwealth's involvement in schools and in the Curriculum Development Centre was made after the fullest consultation with the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) and his Department. So the decisions are not ad hoc, are not damaging to education and are not lightly considered. </PARA>
<PARA> The details of the loans scheme, which is to operate from 1 January next year, have yet to be determined by the Government, but it is clear that the guidelines of the scheme will follow the findings of the Butcher report of four years ago. The scheme will be supplementary to the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, which will not be abolished. It will be retained and the loans scheme will be added on to it. Senator Ryan said in her opening remarks that that would restrict access to education. I believe a supplementary scheme-supplementary finance-for tertiary students can only improve access to education for tertiary students. At the moment a number of students are quite ineligible for tertiary allowances. They are students who fail subjects, post-graduate students without awards and students from wealthy families. </PARA>
<PARA> I administered a loans scheme when I was employed at the University of Adelaide. I had six years of very careful experience of not only some superintendence of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme but also of student loans. In those years I was happy to see hundreds, even thousands, of students assisted to be successful in their studies through even small loans. Students who fail, post-graduate students who want to continue their studies without awards and students who may receive no support from their parents because of a disagreement but who are ineligible for TEAS support because of the means test on the income of their wealthy parents will welcome a loans scheme for tertiary students. All those categories of students will have new access to finance which will enable them to complete their studies. If the Butcher guidelines are to be followed, up to $8,000 may be borrowed. Repayments will be made over 15 years. There will be one year after graduation when no moneys will be required to be repaid. </PARA>
<PARA> Students from lower income families, who the Opposition says will now be denied access to education, will have the same ability to borrow. Their loans will be guaranteed not by their parents, by banks or by tertiary education institutions but by the Government. Such students will be required to pay back any loans that are necessary to meet their needs while they are students during a period when they are employed and when they have an income. Whether they come from low income families or from high income families, when in employment they will have the same means to repay the loans which helped them to get that employment. The Opposition is being pessimistic and alarmist because it has not taken up the quite generous terms of the Butcher committee report on student loans. I believe it is unfortunate that tertiary students have been given an exaggerated and pessimistic outlook of their prospects. I maintain that the addition of a loans scheme can provide additional finance to tertiary students and will give them very real benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is unfortunate-Senator Tate referred to this-that the Council of my old university, the University of Adelaide, reacted recently in the context of that alarm and exaggeration by saying: 'We will not administer such a loans scheme. We will not raise these fees'. The alternative would be for the loans scheme at Adelaide University to be administered by the Department of Education whereby students would not have the same access to it and would not have the same speed of decision and the same service. I believe the University of Adelaide, through its Council, should reconsider the very quick decision it made and should make sure that it is able to serve its students. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the staff of the University of Adelaide, Professor Prescott, a man I admire and a member of the physics department, wrote a letter to me in which he said that the recent proposal concerning post-graduate students, if implemented, 'would cripple my department within 18 months'. I must respect the view that he put to me, but I believe he has reached a false conclusion because there will be the same ability for post-graduate physics students to enrol in that centre of excellence, the University of Adelaide physics department. The fear of a decline in research he alluded to in his letter to me is also ill-founded because the implication is that the number of post-graduate students will decline and hence the ability of the department to sustain its research will decline. Yet the post-graduate students without awards who are studying in that department at the moment will be all the more able, by receiving loans, to continue the physics research programs they are undertaking. I do not believe Professor Prescott's estimation is correct. I would like that to be noted in this debate so that in a year or two we will be able to see where we are. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the Butcher committee's proposals were made on the basis of terms of reference given to it by the Fraser Government. They are summarised at page 10 of the Butcher committee's report in this way:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's policy that all qualified students should be able to undertake tertiary education without hardship is specifically referred to in the Committee's terms of reference and the Committee accepted this as the starting point for its consideration of the subject and the touchstone on which all proposals should be tested. </PARA>
<PARA>That says that all qualified students should be able to undertake tertiary education without hardship. The loans scheme will provide additional finance for Australia's tertiary students. I believe it should be welcomed and will bring greater access to education for those students. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me put the situation with regard to fees into perspective. Undergraduate degrees, approved double degrees and degree-diploma combinations, students already involved in a second degree program, overseas students-who already are paying the equivalent of a fee for their studies-and post-graduate students with awards will not be subject to fees. The minority of tertiary students who will be required to pay an appropriate fee will have access to the loans scheme to pay it. The disadvantage they may suffer personally will be that over the 15 years after they graduate they will have to repay the loan. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have time now to refer to the amalgamation of colleges of advanced education. I note only that these colleges will not be abolished. The Commonwealth will continue to fund 30 colleges and Murdoch University and the University of Western Australia but under new, more appropriate, better arrangements for the provision of educational programs in those places. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard section 5.30 and sections 5.42 to 5.52 of volume 1 of the Tertiary Education Commission report, because these sections directly set out the finding of the expert body on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>COMMISSION POLICY</PARA>
<PARA> 5.30 The Commission proposes to adopt the following policy objectives in relation to higher education for the 1982-84 triennium:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Resources to be reallocated from teacher education to other activities. This reallocation should be completed by the year 1984. To achieve these objectives, the Commission will be recommending in Volume 2 levels of funding for 1984 for CAEs involved in teacher education which will reflect their decreased teaching responsibilities; it will be recommending increased levels of funding for those institutions which are expanding their effort in the technologies and business studies. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Institutions which are predominantly concerned with teacher education to be consolidated into larger units by their incorporation into multi-purpose or multi-campus CAEs or by integration with neighbouring universities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission believes that the policy under (b), which is already well advanced in some States, is a key element in the achievement of (a). The effect of it would be to reduce the number of separate institutions in the advanced education sector which are devoted principally to teacher education. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>CONSOLIDATION</PARA>
<PARA> 5.42 The second part of the Commission's policy relates to the consolidation of single-purpose teacher education institutions into larger units. Three main considerations have led the Commission to adopt this policy. The first of these relates to the adjustments which will be required over the 1982-84 triennium. The Commission believes that larger institutions, such as the proposed multi-campus institutions in Sydney and in Adelaide, will be better able to handle the problems associated with change than single-purpose institutions acting on their own. The larger institution should be able to leave positions vacant without the dislocation that this would cause in a smaller institution; it can redistribute workloads among the larger number of staff which are available to it in any one field; it has greater capacity to redeploy staff within the institution, especially if it is a multi-purpose institution; and it should also have a greater capacity to retrain redundant staff. Moreover, the greater absolute turnover of academic staff of the larger institution and its broader range of work provide opportunities for starting new academic activities. The Commission notes that considerations of this kind were important in TEASA's proposal for the development of the multi-campus CAE in Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.43 The second consideration relates to the range and quality of educational choices which can be offered to students. Larger institutions, especially those which are diversified, are able to provide a wider range of options for students in their choice of subjects and awards; ultimately, this widens their choice of occupations. Larger institutions are also able to offer better services to students and a wider range of teaching and promotion opportunities to staff and should therefore attract higher quality staff. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.44 By providing a wider range of options for teacher education students, it will also be possible for institutions to meet fluctuations in demand for the various types of teachers, particularly in secondary education. While the Commission, in consultation with the States, has undertaken a broad assessment of the demand for primary teachers and secondary teachers, it has not undertaken a study of the demand for, say, secondary mathematics teachers or physical education teachers. The creation of larger and more broadly based institutions, even if some are entirely devoted to teacher education, should make it possible for States to plan more readily their intakes into specialist streams and for institutions to adjust to these demands within their total teaching resources. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.45 The third consideration relates to cost. While significant economies are unlikely in the short to medium term, the Commission believes that there are economies of scale to be gained from the establishment of larger institutions. Institutions are funded on the basis that there are minimum overheads; these tend to inflate the operating costs of small institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.46 In taking this position the Commission has not adopted as desirable any particular minimum size for higher education institutions. The Williams Committee commented that teachers colleges can be both economical and small.(3) However, the Commission does not hold as an article of faith that 'big is better', and the issue of cost has been less important to it in formulating its policy than the considerations relating to flexibility and quality. It nevertheless believes that a staff of some size is an important element in providing depth and diversity in higher education. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.47 In advocating consolidation rather than the abolition of some institutions, the Commission has recognised the inherent difficulties involved in such proposals. While it does not preclude abolition as the most appropriate solution in some cases, the Commission considers that consolidation is likely to be the more feasible and successful policy. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.48 Consolidation may take three forms:</PARA>
<PARA> merger of one or more single-purpose CAEs with an existing diversified CAE (as is occurring between the former SCV Toorak and Prahran CAE):</PARA>
<PARA> merger of a number of single-purpose or largely single-purpose CAEs to form a new multi-campus CAE (as proposed in Sydney and Adelaide);</PARA>
<PARA> merger of a CAE with a neighbouring university (as has been proposed between the University of Wollongong and the Wollongong Institute of Education). </PARA>
<PARA> In each case, it is critical to the achievement of the objectives outlined by the Commission-greater flexibility and improvement of quality-that the institutions amalgamate under a single governing body. This body should be the employing authority for the institution. It should have the ultimate responsibility for the disposition of academic resources; in particular, it will need to have the capacity to allocate resources according to need. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.49 The Commission supports the proposals to establish such governing bodies for the proposed multi-campus institutions in Sydney and Adelaide. However, it does not, in general, wish to prescribe particular solutions for local problems. State authorities are in the best position to take into account all the factors-educational and non-educational-which need to be considered in these matters. On the other hand, the Commission has to base its recommendations for funding on what it considers to be a rational use of resources. It therefore urges the States to give further consideration to the possibilities of consolidation as advocated by the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.50 University/CAE mergers. The Williams Committee took the view that it had not been clearly established that there would be net advantages from amalgamation of the neighbouring universities and CAEs at Townsville, Armidale and Newcastle. The considerations which led to this conclusion were that ''the economic size of the colleges of advanced education involved is not large, and the problems created by different philosophies and different criteria and procedures for the appointment of staff are considerable''. The Committee recommended greater collaboration between neighbouring universities and CAEs, and in particular arrangements for joint appointments or part-time secondments of staff in the field of teacher education.(4)</PARA>
<PARA> 5.51 The Commission supports the view of the Williams Committee regarding increased collaboration. It is concerned to ensure that the combined resources of neighbouring institutions are used to the maximum benefit of the region concerned, and it believes that sectoral boundaries should not inhibit this. The Commission therefore wishes to encourage the State authorities and institutions concerned in Armidale, Newcastle and Townsville to consider again possible forms of co-operation and association which go beyond informal arrangements. The trends in enrolments in education in the three cities would add weight to such moves. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.52 In the Commission's view, the solution which would produce the best quality of education and widest range of choices for students is integration of the two institutions in each city under a single governing body. In this respect the Commission supports the steps which have been proposed in Wollongong towards such integration, and it suggests that the State authorities and institutions concerned in the other three cities should examine the possible application of the Wollongong approach to their situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the damage done to the Australian education system as a result of the decisions of the so-called razor gang. Try as one might, one has to take account of the views of some people who think that damage has been done and analyse whether those views are accurate. I begin by saying that the Liberal Minister of Education in Victoria, Mr Hunt, speaking about the proposals for colleges announced by the razor gang, was reported in today's Australian as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Instead of Victoria's consensus plan, 'a unilateral, blunt, insensitive and ill-considered announcement-which disclosed no appreciation whatever of the problems involved for staff, for students and for institutions-was released in Canberra last week,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> 'It was an unnecessary announcement, for the problems which it addressed had been virtually resolved and the steps necessary to achieve the results desired by the Commonwealth were already in course of discussion with the colleges concerned in a consultative way.'</PARA>
<PARA>Later in the article the Minister is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> We have been unable to ascertain any rational basis for it, . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In the Canberra Times of 12 May a report appears under the heading-I apologise for speaking in these terms-'Torrid reception for Carrick'. That article reports the Minister for National Development and Energy Senator Carrick, as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . most second or higher degree students already receive scholarships. </PARA>
<PARA>The response by the Vice-Chancellor of Griffith University was reported as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Vice-Chancellor of Griffith University, Professor F. Willett, told the conference that in view of the energy options and technological development outlined by Senator Carrick, he questioned whether this was the right time to discourage second or higher degrees by people seeking to further their education. </PARA>
<PARA>In that connection I draw the Senate's attention to the report of the Tertiary Education Commission for 1982-84, volume 1. Paragraph 3.21 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The trend away from full-time study for research degrees evident in recent years is likely to be a reflection of the decline in the numbers of scholarships available for research students both from the traditional source-Commonwealth Postgraduate Awards-and from the universities themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>One can go on with this exercise of digging up quotations from particular sources that suit particular people. I was very surprised to find that one of Senator Teague's sources was the platform of the Liberal Party of Australia at various election campaigns in years gone by. I think the important thing to consider is that the Liberal Party made promises about education as it made promises about health and all sorts of other matters, which have been abandoned. When considering education it is important to determine whether decisions about education policy are, in fact, a function of a committee like the so-called razor gang or whether they are a function of the education Ministers, the Department of Education and all those educational advisory bodies which the Commonwealth Goverment has to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA> Where I differ particularly with some of the things said by Senator Teague is that I had never heard it expressed as a promise and a policy of the Liberal Party, before Phil Lynch's razor gang got to work, that access to tertiary education in Australia should be restricted further as a matter of educational policy. The first time it was expressed was 10 days ago when this group of drop-outs from small business who were determining the fate of the Australian economy for the next few years got together and made decisions on educational matters. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, they did express it. It is quite clear that eligibility for assistance under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme is to be even further restricted. The sop for that is a loans scheme the details of which, as Senator Teague says, are not yet at all clear; they are to be worked out. The device is to introduce a loans scheme. Senator Teague almost said: 'Well, it will not matter so much about the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme because students will be able to get the money through the loans scheme'. That is a decision about access to education. A decision about access to education ought to be based on the Government's view of education policy and not on the deliberations of a committee such as the Lynch committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since the Fraser Government came to power we have been subjected to more volumes of reports about education than has perhaps any other parliament in the history of this country. The report of the Williams Inquiry into Education, Training and Employment made recommendations about, for example, Murdoch University. Sir Charles Court knocked those recommendations of the Williams committee about Murdoch University on the head very smartly. That suggestion of the Williams committee has now been suddenly dredged up again and recycled by the razor gang, as all decisions on education have been recycled in the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA> We can look at the Williams committee, the Auchmuty report and the undertaking of the Fraser Government to create centres of excellence in universities. What has happened to all those things? For years we sat in the Senate and had Senator Carrick tell us that he could not answer questions on education because the Williams committee was going to deal with all those matters. What has really happened as a result of the recommendations of the Williams committee? Practically nothing. What has happened-except in relation to single purpose colleges-as a result of some of the recommendations of the Auchmuty committee? Practically nothing. These are the reports by which the Government recognises that the way to determine education policy is by the expert advice of bodies of this kind. That has just not been done. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why the Minister in Victoria has described-to use the words of our matter of public importance-the decision of the razor gang as being 'ill-considered'. He used words much stronger in their purport than that. On all these matters the purport of the razor gang is that the capacity to take educational advice about educational matters, which we have ignored over a long period, is no longer to be relevant. What is to be relevant is the sort of macho politics of making stunt-like, tough-sounding decisions about the Commonwealth Public Service and about institutions which some members of the community do not particularly like. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about the TEC report? I have said nothing about that which disagrees with the honourable senator on that point. But I have pointed to the fact that the Minister in Victoria, a member of the Australian Education Council-another body which is kept going at considerable expense to seek agreement about relationships between the States and the Commonwealth on education matters-has apparently been totally ignored in relation to the decisions which have been made about colleges. Once again, the question is which body performs the educational advisory function. The question of student fees is one which concerns me in relation to education policy. People concerned about education policy are concerned about the next 20 or 30 years and not just about what will happen tomorrow, which is what the razor gang was concerned about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many examples are given in this document of the Government's total unconcern about what will happen 20 or 30 years ahead in areas such as education. The Government is concerned about the next election and about putting on a bit of an act for the electorate at this stage to try to retrieve certain damaged fortunes. The Government's decisions about research are a complete reversal of those made by this Government in 1976 and 1977. As Professor Willett points out, there is to be a winding back of this Government's involvement in educational research and research funding generally. Such a winding back is bad for the future of this country. A decision about access to tertiary education is a decision about the future of this country and about what will happen to young people who go into education now and in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> A third example which is of importance is the Curriculum Development Centre. I know that it is not said that the Curriculum Development Centre will necessarily be abolished. I think that will be the result of the razor gang's deliberations. I pointed out last week that only a month ago the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) opened the new building for the Curriculum Development Centre in Canberra. In the course of opening that building he went to great lengths to explain what a great body the Centre was. A month later its abolition was announced. Is that good government in terms of educational policy making? I would have thought not. The report of the Tertiary Education Commission and particularly the report of the Myers Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia express great concern about curricula in Australian schools and the capacity of curricula to adapt to technological change. That concern has been expressed by a national education planning body about an issue of national importance. The razor gang apparently did not take such matters into consideration. Apparently they are not relevant to education planning and the important thing is the short term consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the Senate do not say for a moment that there should not be greater accountability for money spent in some areas of education, as indeed there is in other areas of government activity. We are saying that the Government has gone about this question in totally the wrong way and has produced a rather bizarre set of decisions which really do not stand up. I shall give the Senate some examples. There is to be a restriction on eligibility under the Adult Secondary Education Assistance Scheme to those seeking qualifications for employment. That is an extraordinary and important view about education. Adults can have the benefit of that scheme only if they are seeking a job. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that, but those are the implications of the statement. A decision about education has been made by people who do not know anything about education. That is the problem. It is a question of function. I have already referred to the Curriculum Development Centre. It is to be abolished unless the States contribute certain amounts to it. In the context of the Myer report into technology, which this Government commissioned, and in the context of the Tertiary Education Commission report, the decision to abolish the Centre was a silly and short-sighted one. That is what we object to. The same thing can be said about the decision to wind back research activities. That is a silly, short-sighted decision. Insofar as student loans and student fees are concerned, we believe the decision to introduce fees for second degrees to be, again, a short-sighted one. This Government has successfully created an environment in which there is much apprehension about the reintroduction of fees generally. The Government has created that environment on its own head. It has done that because of the terminology of the razor gang report on that issue. I do not know why the Government says that it will not now fund the university in the Northern Territory. It never said that it would do so. Why does that statement appear in the razor gang report?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One can work through the proposed cuts to various programs which in terms of money will amount to nothing but a piece of political stunting. On the other hand, the TEC report is concerned with educational priorities. We find a very severe comment at pages 30 and 31 of that report about the proposed Australian Defence Force Academy, which is to cost $80m. Nothing is said by the razor gang about that institution, although the Public Works Committee of this Parliament unanimously condemned the proposal as wasteful. All the problems in relation to student fees and post-graduates could be solved if the educational priorities were right and the $80m to be spent on that institution were released in favour of the sorts of proposals that I have indicated the Opposition regards as more important. </PARA>
<PARA> One could go on at length about this statement but the important quetion is one of priorities. I refer to educational priorities in terms of expenditure, not in terms of the sort of material which appears in the ministerial statement on the Review of Commonwealth Functions, which is a very messy document in the light of the educational goals of this Government, which have been expressed over many years and which change from one report to another. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button, as usual, has made an interesting contribution to the debate. I lament, however, that he has not done justice to his own case in all instances. I take one of his latter points first. That was a reference in support of his case to the Tertiary Education Commission report. He referred to the matter of the Australian Defence Force Academy and the comments on that subject contained in the Tertiary Education Commission report. I indicate to the Senate that the case which has been presented to the Senate by Senator Button was not advanced at all by his reference to that report. Under the heading 'Matters Outstanding' the Tertiary Education Commission refers to a number of items including the Australian Defence Force Academy. It outlines the progress of plans for that academy. It concludes as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of arrangements for the Commission to give advice on the academic activities and facilities of the Academy, first raised between the Ministers in 1977, is still under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not an expression of concern; it is a reporting to the public that the matter is still outstanding between the Tertiary Education Commission and others. So that reference did not support Senator Button's case as he might have liked it to do. We are debating a matter raised by the Opposition, which it claims to be a matter of public importance, namely, what it alleges to be 'damage to the Australian education system' resulting from what the Labor Party claims to be 'ad hoc and ill-considered decisions'. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier speakers for the Government this afternoon-Senator Puplick and Senator Teague-have put a case for the decisions that the Government has made. Further, they pointed out that what the Senate was engaged in-this was possibly the case until Senator Button spoke-was an ad hoc debate ranging over a number of points relating to education. I think it was Senator Puplick who pointed out that all that was being said to the Senate today was that the Labor Party did not like certain items relating to the Government's education policy. The Labor Party is at liberty to say that it does not like them. It is at liberty to say that it would do something different, and to make its case to the Australian public. But it has not supported its own case that damage has been done and that the decisions were ad hoc and ill-considered. In fact, a number of the Government's decisions in the area of Australian education policy were not touched on and could not be argued against in the Senate this afternoon. So we have not had a case put to us in those terms. </PARA>
<PARA> We heard some interesting comments from Senator Button, who struggled rather vainly at the end of his speech to try to put up a case supporting the matter which the Opposition claims is one of public importance. He tried to put forward a coherent and logical case. He did his own case more justice by approaching it in those terms. He did not do his case any justice by voicing criticism such as: Decisions are being made about education by people who do not know anything about it. He made that statement in relation to certain assertions about the Adult Secondary Education Assistance Scheme. A dispute was going on at the time between him and Senator Teague as to the significance of comments and conclusions that could be drawn about the Government's decision on a recommendation flowing from the Cabinet Review of Commonwealth Functions. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe Senator Teague said that it was his view or the Government's view that education was restricted only to the matter of qualifications for employment. The Government's decision is to the effect that this sort of assistance will be restricted to students needing qualifications for employment. I hope that we all know that education is related to employment. Certainly the case put to members of parliament by those who argue the case for education is that the community and the nation gains direct monetary and economic benefit from a more highly educated work force. That is one aspect of education, but it is not the only one. The Government does not claim it is by way of its policy decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other aspects. A review such as this has to determine priorities. It is very easy for Opposition senators to say that all manner of assistance should be available to people in order to seek education for self-improvement and that it should be funded out of the public purse, but governments that have budgetary and total national economic considerations apply priorities to issues such as that just as they do to many other issues. Obviously the community would expect that first priority, given not unlimited budgetary capacity, in the matter of this type of education ought to go to those who are using that education in order to improve their qualifications for employment. Enough has been said in this chamber and around the nation in recent times about the urgent need for Australia to address itself to changing demands for skills in the work force. We must meet that urgent demand by meeting the first area of priority, and that is to enable those who want to upgrade their work skills through the education system to have reasonable access. That is not to make a case against adults being educated in order to improve themselves to get more out of life or whatever, but a case must be made for the public purse meeting that expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been much talk today on the subject of fees and loans. Much has been said about the recipients and whether they will be better off or worse off because of these decisions. No attention at all has been paid to the people who provide the funds that we are asked to give under the circumstances. I hope, in the course of my speech, to address a small amount of attention to that aspect. It is relevant to a general Labor Party case on education. Senator Tate is wrong when he says that the whole community is dismayed by the Government's educational decisions as a result of this review. The whole community would have grounds to be dismayed if it could not believe that after the massive amounts of funds that have gone into education within the last decade in Australia there was not some lessening of urgent need. The population of Australia is stabilising. The student population, in many areas, is stabilising. In a couple of areas, such as my own State and Western Australia, of course, the student population is continuing to increase, but that is because of local factors related to the attractiveness of conditions of life. However, the general Australian position is that the student population is stabilising. Governments are not trying to cope in the same urgent way that they were with the educational consequences and demands on facilities as a result of any sort of baby boom. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian community could be dismayed if it were led to believe that the enormous amounts of money that have been spent on infrastructure and training in education within the last decade had not resulted in a lessening of the pressure for large sums to be spent. I think all of us-I include educational institutions-need to realise that the public expects the injection of funds not to continue at the same rate. Our nation has evolving and fluctuating needs. New needs come to the fore and areas of need in the past are now more demanding that they were. Education has to be seen in those terms and in terms of a national priority. We have never at any stage, as the Labor Party would like to suggest, stated that education is anything other than a high national priority, but priorities within education and the priority of education in terms of urgency have changed. The area of tertiary education is a good case. I would be interested to take up some of the detail of the points Senator Button raised in passing; time does not enable me to take up all of them. However, he made some reference to tertiary areas. The Opposition would have been very unwise at any stage to suggest that the decisions relating to colleges of advanced education were ad hoc or ill-considered. Senator Puplick and Senator Teague covered the aspect at some length; I shall not cover all of it. I would like to point out the alternative. If the States wish to pursue some existing institutions which have a limited rationale or wish in the future to pursue plans for new institutions which are not part of the national education policy that Senator Button referred to they may, but they will foot the bill. They will do so from their own resources and they will justify to their own voters and constituents their own priorities for these institutions as against more urgent local priorities. It is in that context that the Government has taken its decisions. Nobody can argue against following the Tertiary Education Commission's recommendation. The Victorian Minister for Education is arguing against it. I understand that the Queensland Government might venture a thought or two on the subject also. But the choices which are open are clear and the basis for the decision was certainly not ill-considered or irrational. </PARA>
<PARA> Time for the debate is running out and I want to say just a couple of words on the subject of fees and loans. The point that needs to be made is that we are not talking about all fees. Throughout this debate Opposition speakers, whenever they have referred to the subject of university fees, have mentioned only student fees. They have not distinguished between the non-imposition of fees for first degrees or for recognised combinations of bachelors degrees and further bachelors degrees which are not first degrees or higher degrees. I say something very briefly about this matter. Senator Button said that access to further education will be restricted after the report because of recommendations relating to the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. Nobody would argue that some of the recommendations relating to eligibility for TEAS are restrictive, but not all are. I point out that one consideration in relation to TEAS makes the recommendations less restrictive, and that is the Government's decision that periods of registration for employment with or without receipt of unemployment benefit will be taken into account in determining the two-year qualifying period for independent status. That is a liberalising of the conditions for TEAS which will still be available to students in need. It will not be available to students who wish to make decisions of a personal or luxury nature. The loans will, of course, be additionally available, and this seems to me to be fair. </PARA>
<PARA> One should realise that those in the lower income earning strata of our society who are paying tax contribute to fees in the same way as do higher income earners. Students themselves need to understand that there are people who will never in their lives be in as privileged a position as they are and that these people have made a contribution towards the cost of their education. These people will continue to make that contribution towards the cost of the first degree. I do not think that those who are in a position to earn or who are in a position to take alternative sources of money such as loans which can be repaid because of higher earning capacity, ought to demand as a right that those who will never earn as much as the earning potential that they are acquiring for themselves ought to pay and that they ought to receive support from those people as of right. It needs to be remembered that not all people who feel the pinch are students. There are people working very hard who feel the strain of financial disability and who are themselves funding students in our tertiary institutions, and recognition ought to be given to that. </PARA>
<PARA> Debates on education in the Senate are almost invariably interesting, and in the range of issues covered this afternoon this also has been an interesting and I think a worthwhile debate, if only in giving the opportunity to canvass at length the basic issues related to decisions of the last few days.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bill before the Senate, the Census and Statistics Amendment Bill 1981, seeks to amend the Census and Statistics Act 1905 by incorporating a few, and I stress a few, of the recommendations arising from the report of the Law Reform Commission. Some of the provisions relating to secrecy or confidentiality are to be tightened up. In particular, the secrecy provisions binding officers of the department are to be extended to retired officers, the penalties are to be increased, and it is to be possible for a householder filling in the census form to by-pass the official collector and post in the information direct and anonymously. They are the only three changes which this Bill makes. More significant than the changes which are to be made and the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission which are to be adopted are those recommendations of the Law Reform Commission which are not to be adopted and for the ignoring of which, as is the custom with this Government, no explanation at all has been given. Indeed, the second reading speech of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) occupied just under one-half page of Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Very few of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission are to be adopted. Most of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission are ignored and the Government, in its customary contemptuous style-contemptuous, that is, of the Parliament and the public-gives no explanation at all for not adopting the other recommendations. It applies the same principle, or perhaps one should say lack of it, to the deluge of legislation which it brings before this Parliament to grant exemptions from various sections of the taxation legislation for various client groups of the Government and those who successfully lobby it. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) claims that he is zealously guarding public funds and that he is merely a trustee of taxpayers' funds. It seems to have escaped his attention that in offering tax concessions to his various cronies he is not in fact offering concessions from himself or from the Government; the tax concessions which he offers to his cronies and clients are paid for by all the other taxpayers in Australia. Some examples of this of course are the ridiculous provisions-the Malcolm Fraser pre-election special-for storage of fuel, originally on farms and now extended, and of course the notorious 14 April 1980 so-called drought relief provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the more important of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission not adopted by the Government, for which no explanation has been given, is the recommendation that greater provision be made for the questions which are actually placed on the census form being issued in the form of regulations and therefore subject to debate in Parliament. Most important probably is the recommendation that census information, the forms in non-identifiable form, be retained in the Archives for 75 years with a general prohibition on examination, but one which can under very special circumstances be breached. The very special circumstances which were cited by the Law Reform Commission were if the information is required for the purposes of medical research. </PARA>
<PARA> The Law Reform Commission quoted extensively from a report of the United States House of Representatives which drew attention to the unique information which census forms could provide in helping to determine causes of diseases which have been shown to appear in what are called 'hot spots'-that is, particular areas of the country where the incidence of a particular disease is very much higher than the national average and where the reason for its being very much higher has not been identified. Unless there is information about people, not with names attached, about movements of people throughout the country over a very long period, such cause and effect cannot be accurately correlated because of the long incubation periods for many diseases of this type and the mobility of the population. After the passage of this Bill, Australia will continue to destroy original records almost as soon as some of the information has been taken and placed on computer tape. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to some other general deficiencies about census procedure in Australia which were noted by Ralph Willis in his customary lucid style in the House of Representatives. Some 27 categories of statistical material collected will be abolished as a result of the decisions of the so-called razor gang. There is no valid reason for continuing to collect that sort of statistical information. For example, the quantity of crayfish in cold storage in Western Australia at a particular time does not appear to have any particular value. I think Ralph Willis cited the number of eggs set and chickens hatched. We have no serious quarrel with the Government's abolishing the collection of the overwhelming majority of that information. There are very serious deficiencies in the type of information currently collected for which the Government ought to recognise and then make provision. Instead it is moving in the opposite direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Less information is being collected and collated about the degree of foreign ownership in various Australian industries. I have a question on notice about this matter, but as yet it has not been answered. To the best of my knowledge there is not and has never been any comprehensive information available about the degree of foreign ownership of land in Australia. From time to time various surveys have been conducted in limited parts of the country, but on a national basis there has never been an attempt to record the degree to which land is in foreign hands or the degree to which it is being accumulated by foreigners. This is a matter about which a great deal of concern is expressed throughout the country. No plans are in existence to remedy that information gap. </PARA>
<PARA> The information provided in the 1976 census was only half processed and half placed on record. The spurious reason given for that was that it was an economy measure. In the aftermath of the so-called razor gang's recommendations it is pertinent to remind the Senate that we went through a similar exercise in 1976 when the Government said that it was indulging in this ruthless exercise of cutting fat off government departments and eliminating unnecessary and wasteful expenditure. In 1976 we had the same sort of public relations campaign about government efficiency and wise husbandry of taxpayers' money that we have seen in the last fortnight. It had the same puny and often foolish results. One of the foolish consequences of that last specious exercise in cost cutting was the decision not to process much of the information from the 1976 census. Having incurred the major expense of collecting the information, the Government declined to incur the relatively minor expense of placing on record and processing the information. It was a particularly irresponsible decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the data on civilian employees is still collected, but by decree of government it is not published. Of course the reasons for that are political. The Government prefers a survey which is less reliable but more likely to present figures which are favourable to it in its political campaign. Likewise the household expenditure surveys which were last conducted in 1975, six years ago, provide an enormous amount of valuable information-valuable to those who are concerned particularly about income distribution and whether the effects of particular policies on income distribution have a regressive or progressive impact. The 1975-76 surveys were extremely good, but like all surveys of that nature they have become dated and will be less reliable as time goes on. As far as I am aware, the Government has no intention to update that valuable information. On behalf of the Opposition, I move as an amendment to the motion that the Bill be now read a second time:</PARA>
<PARA>At end of motion, add, ', but the Senate is of the opinion that the Bill is deficient in that it fails to give effect to the recommendation of the Australian Law Reform Commission's report ''Privacy and the Census'' that identified census information should be held in archives with access forbidden for 75 years, except for strictly limited access for purposes of medical research'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Census and Statistics Amendment Bill 1981 is an important Bill. The Australian Democrats support some aspects of it, but other aspects worry us very much. The aspects that worry us are the heavy increases provided in the Schedule to the Bill regarding the penalties against persons who do not fill in census forms as directed and even heavier penalties against persons who provide information which is not true. I wonder how many Australians realise that if they provide false information in their 1981 census forms they will, as a result of this Bill, be liable for a fine of $1,000, six months in gaol or both. This will apply if the Bill is passed in its present form. The Australian Democrats do not believe it should go through in its present form. We believe it is absolutely fantastic that this Government should propose an amendment to an Act which provides a new provision, which was not in the old Act, that we will put a person in gaol because he did not fill in his census form correctly. I foreshadow an amendment to this Bill, in the Committee stage, to remove that penal sanction from the Schedule.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I implore all honourable senators, who have any conscience, to support us because this matter is quite disgraceful in a society in which we say there should be fewer penal sanctions, not more. That amendment is proposed to section 26 of the Census and Statistics Act. The Democrats point out the draconian increase in that penalty. The fine under the present Act is $100, with no penal sanctions-no gaol term. Of course I am aware that it has been necessary to increase these fines substantially because of erosion caused by inflation. I think the penal sanctions have got to the stage where they are out of reason. The amendments to sections 17 and 18 of the Act will provide a penalty of $500 for not filling in, strictly in accordance with the instructions, a census form. I contrast these sanctions with those applied to other crimes in the community, such as dangerous driving, which is a serious offence against a person and property. Where are we going with this legislation?</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats also find it disquieting that the penalties provided under section 24, for a census official who betrays his trust, a serious matter, and reveals information from the census forms are no higher than the same $1,000 fine, six months in gaol or both. We believe that penalty ought to be higher than that which applies to a person who does not fill in a form correctly. I would have thought the offence to society was greater in the second case. Here we have a Bill which provides the same penalty for both offences. I ask the responsible Minister to tell me at some stage the reason for that anomalous state of affairs applying in an area which is so controversial and which has such possibilities for injustice as the census. It touches every man, woman and child in this country. Section 12 of the Act demands that the name, sex, age, condition as to and duration of marriage, religion, birthplace, profession and occupation of all persons be given. I repeat that under the legislation names must be given. On the face of the new Bill now before us a refusal to give a name could attract a fine of $500. The giving of a facetious or false name such as Donald Duck or Karl Marx, as I understand has happened in the past, would, under the terms of this legislation, if it is passed, make a person liable to a fine of $1,000 and six months gaol. It is that possibility of gaol that the Democrats do not like. We do not believe it should be an option in this Bill. It was not in the old Act. It was not previously in the legislation. We are wondering why it has been put in this legislation. As I said earlier, in the view of the Democrats, penal sanctions should be used less in our society, not more. When it comes to introducing them in matters relating to the filling in of the census form we begin to wonder just what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats applaud the new provisions in this Bill, which are intended to ensure that when the 1981 census is taken all collectors and interviewers handling the census process, even though they work on a casual basis, will be bound by the law forbidding disclosure of details of census information and be subject to penalty. I repeat that we are worried about the fact that an officer who betrays his trust in this regard, perhaps enormously and massively, would appear to attract only the same penalty as a person who flippantly or facetiously supplies wrong information. We also support other aspects of the legislation such as the use of a special sealed envelope by persons who wish to maintain the privacy of their census schedule by by-passing the census collector. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is very important for a number of background reasons. The first is that the fictional world of 1984, in which all details of a person's private life will become available to a big brother type government, is tending all the time to come relentlessly closer in terms of fact as well as actual calendar date. Citizens are right to fear the proliferation in the world of secret lists, which modern computer technology makes it so easy to organise and use, and citizens are right also to resist the incursions of that world into their private life. It is not only a tendency of government but also, as we are reminded disquietingly from time to time, a part of the commercial world and I think that tendency is to be deplored. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fair to ask the question: Is information compulsorily provided for the census by individuals necessary for the overall welfare of the state? I think we must assume it is and that the Government would be flying blind in many of its activities without statistics about the society. I would not like anybody listening to me in this broadcast to believe that the Democrats are saying that people should not take this responsibility seriously where they can. By filling in the census form they are contributing manifestly to the needs of society and to its greater objectives. However, there should be a process of the greatest restraint, especially now that penalties for non-compliance are becoming so high, to see that material is not included which persons would perhaps not wish to make available and which cannot be absolutely justified in the national interest. I use the word 'absolutely' advisedly. </PARA>
<PARA> There is great irony in the matter of the census legislation being brought before the chamber at this time when we have already embarked upon consideration in the Committee stage of the so-called Freedom of Information Bill which, as I have said at another time in this place, might better be described in its present form as the Official Secrets Preservation Bill. In other words, here we are this evening discussing the imposition of stiff penalties on citizens who do not give out information about themselves to government and at the same time the moguls in the high levels of the Australian bureaucracy-in many ways the secret government of Australia-are doing all they can, with the full support and connivance of the Government, to prevent any members of the public from getting lawful access to information about the Government. The irony of this contrast can be extended to the situation in which later today we will be speaking to the listening public on generalised first reading material at a time when we could be discussing the Freedom of Information Bill in the Committee stage. But that Bill may or may not come on tomorrow after a long delay and at a time when the public cannot hear our deliberations on that vital and significant Bill on the nature of Australian secret government. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a further matter of interest in this legislation. The Democrats are pleased that in this Bill the Government has implemented some of the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission. But we say: 'You have made a start. Why not do some more?' We support the Labor Party amendment which has been moved by Senator Walsh insofar as it relates to matters that have not been taken into account in this legislation, but there are other areas to be considered. Other significant reports that Mr Justice Michael Kirby and his team on the Commission have brought forward in recent years have been unpardonably delayed by this Government and we would like to see them brought forward. I mention just a few of them. The Criminal Investigation Bill was introduced by Attorney-General Ellicott on 24 March 1977-four years ago-and lapsed on 8 November 1977. Since then it has been in the melting pot in the Attorney-General's Department and an interdepartmental committee. The supplementary report on complaints against police dated 9 June is another example. We have seen the adoption of most but not all of the recommendations of the Commission in the Complaints Against Police Bill. That Bill was introduced on 26 February 1981-only two and a half years later. The defamation report of the Commission dated 9 June 1978 has seen no action. That admittedly has been the subject of controversy but both the Attorney-General and the Minister for Administrative Services announced proposed legislation. The matter apparently is sitting with the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, a committee whose track record does not at the moment inspire confidence. It has been with that Committee for nearly three years. There are other examples that I could mention. I do not want to delay the Senate unduly on matters which are not strictly relevant to this Bill but as the Law Reform Commission is in play in this matter I think some of these things are worth mentioning. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats would like careful consideration of the amendment that we propose to move in the Committee stage. I am sorry that I was unable to bring it to the attention of honourable senators earlier. We have been studying this Bill only today and the particular which is the subject of our amendment caught our attention. As a result, we foreshadow an amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise just to make a few comments on the remarks of Senator Mason. As he has focused most of his argument on the penalties that are set out in the Bill, I think it should be noted, firstly, that the penalties are of course maximum penalties and therefore in the general case they are not likely to be applied with their full rigour. The second point essentially is that the history of this kind of legislation is that very few persons have been prosecuted under its provisions. Consequently, in the main there has been a very good adherence to the law. We expect that position to be maintained under the new arrangements. I think Senator Mason ageed that it is reasonable that the penalties ought to be raised to a level in line with inflation and according to current community standards in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that the most important point that Senator Mason sought to make and the one upon which he dwelled is the one which is the subject of the proposed amendment and that is in relation to section 26 of the Act which is referred to in the Schedule. He seeks to delete the words 'or imprisonment for six months, or both'. I draw the attention of the honourable senator to the fact that section 26 of the original Act refers to persons knowingly doing something in relation to any form or document, et cetera. The word 'knowingly' is the essential element of the section. There must be an intention on the part of the person in fact to mislead or make some incorrect entry and therefore defeat the purpose of the census. I think reasonable people would accept that a very tough penalty ought to be applied in that situation. Consequently, the Government adheres to the view that the penalty set out in the Bill should be maintained. On that ground, we reject Senator Mason's foreshadowed amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I intend to refer to only one of the points raised by Senator Walsh. That is the reference to the Australian Law Reform Commission's recommendations with regard to the census schedules being kept for most purposes for 75 years. The Government has noted that the recommendation expressed by the Commission is at this stage only a provisional one and that its Chairman considers that it would be a matter on which the Commission should not put forward any recommendation. The Government has carefully weighed up the various arguments on this matter and has decided against accepting it. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the census is to collect statistical information. The legal obligation on people to answer census questions is accompanied by strict measures to ensure the confidentiality of the information provided. It would be inconsistent with that purpose and with that guarantee of confidentiality to retain information on identified persons or households for the research purposes referred to in the Commission's report. There are, of course, other difficulties such as maintaining archives which include the huge number of records necessary in this particular situation and ensuring the confidentiality of documents kept in that kind of area for a period of 75 years. Not only would this be a tremendously costly exercise but also in practical terms it would be very difficult to achieve. I wish the Bill a speedy passage. </PARA>

I reiterate that the purpose of this amendment is to remove the penal sanction of imprisonment for six months which could be applied to persons in Australia who supplied false information knowingly when filling out their census forms. The Australian Democrats' view is that the sanction of a $1,000 fine, which is provided for in the Schedule, is enough. It increases the previous fine of $100.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I have only just seen the amendment. (Quorum formed). Unfortunately the Census and Statistics Amendment Bill 1981 was called on a little earlier than either the Opposition or Senator Mason anticipated. Perhaps Senator Mason thought that the procedures which have been followed during the last week or so-the Notice Paper has been changed about six times a day-would again be followed today. For once, today we have stuck to the Notice Paper. I have only just seen the amendment that has been moved by Senator Mason. Its effect is to remove the risk of imprisonment for a householder who records false information on a census form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After discussion with the few of my colleagues whom I was able to consult in the limited time available we unanimously agreed that this penalty seems to be somewhat harsh for a householder, a private citizen. Another clause provides for some risk of imprisonment in the case of an officer in a position of trust in the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It seems to the Opposition that in that instance the risk of imprisonment is not an inappropriate penalty but in the case of a private citizen it is inappropriate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the position needs to be clarified a little more. The question is: What is a suitable penalty for an offence of this gravity? Much of the legislation we support imposes penalties of $1,000 or imprisonment for six months, or both. We must consider whether this is a very harsh penalty to be imposed on a person who has committed an offence by knowingly giving incorrect information on a census form-that suggests that it is done deliberately-to mislead the Australian Statistician. Unless a multitude of people engage in this practice the effect of such action would not be very serious. The figures relating to how many houses are in Australia, the earnings of the population or some other question might be out by a fractional point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst I think every effort should be made to ensure that the information given on census forms is honest and truthful, I think the penalty provided for in the legislation is a little hard on anyone who even knowingly makes a false statement on a census form or to the collector of that form. A fine of $1,000 can be imposed. Under the amendment that fine remains. Does the Government think it is then appropriate to imprison people for six months and to fine them $1,000 because they mistakenly or knowlingly made a false statement to the collector or on the census form? By all standards, I think that is a harsh penalty. Much discussion is going on at present about the effect of penalties. I doubt whether penalties of any sort are a useful deterrent. They simply make people more careful that they do not get found out. If a person intends to commit a crime he does not worry about the penalty. If the crime provides for a harsh penalty he may take extra precautions so that he is not found out. I do not think penalties imposed prevent other people from committing similar offences if they so desire. </PARA>
<PARA> A penalty is imposed when a person does something that the Act says is wrong. If a person has committed a wrong action I do not know that punitive action solves the matter. We know that penalties must be imposed to stop a person from deliberately doing such things and I think the imposition of a fine of $1,000 would be a good lesson. Of course, we also have to face the fact that very often the courts do not impose the maximum fine. We may only be playing with words. To give a court or a judge power to fine someone $1,000 and to imprison him for six months because he puts in a false census return seems to me to be a harsh step for a sympathetic, democratic government to take. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has examined this proposal involving sections 24 and 26. I am concerned about the proposed amendment to section 26 because I think it is here that the Committee ought to have some regard to protecting the rights of the citizen. Honourable senators will recall the way in which the census is conducted. It is conducted largely with casual labour. People distribute the census paper and then collect it and the census is then based on the information made available by the persons in each household. Are we going to tell each of those census collectors that they shall warn the persons filling in the census form that they are to be subject to a $1,000 fine or imprisonment for six months, or both? That seems to me to be placing a tremendous responsibility on the census taker as well as on the citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that the Australian Democrats are correct in drawing the attention of the Committee to the harsh way in which this matter can be dealt with in the courts. Of course we do not condone the giving of false information in a wilful fashion by the person filling in the census form. Nevertheless, a tremendous responsibility is placed upon the court to adjudicate in cases where a fine of this nature and imprisonment of this nature can be imposed. Let us face it, it is a jurisdiction and a power which the legislation proposes to give the courts and it is very harsh so far as the average citizen in concerned. Whilst we do not want to see the Bureau of Census and Statistics put in a position of having no power to collect information, when it comes to the question of imposing a penalty upon millions of our citizens I think the Committee is entitled to say that this is a power of imposition which ought not to be given to the courts. After all, at the moment there is a $100 fine with no threat of imprisonment, but the Government is proposing that that $100 fine should be increased to $1,000. It is proposing that there be a $1,000 fine or a penalty of six months' imprisonment, or both. That is a very tyrannical proposition and one which ought not to be approved without a great deal of consideration by the Committee. I am sure that the Government itself has not realised the punitive nature of these particular provisions. They strike at the very heart of the rights of the citizen. </PARA>
<PARA> I just fail to see how any citizen could be warned about the consequences of being frivolous. Let us face it, there are plenty of people who see a bit of humour in filling in forms and who could place themselves in this invidious position whereby their livelihood could be affected, whereby a large fine could be imposed and whereby, in fact, they could find themselves placed at a considerable disadvantage by being put in gaol. Such a situation contrasts, does it not, with what happened about the doctor here in Canberra who quite clearly was found guilty of a very contrived arrangement to defraud Medibank. He was fined $27,000 yet he served a paltry six days in gaol. When one compares that sort of penalty with the penalty that is suggested in proposed section 26 in the Schedule, it seems to me that Mr and Mrs Citizen are placed at a decided disadvantage. To suggest that a citizen should be put in the same category as an officer of the Australian Bureau of Statistics who might wilfully divulge information concerning the privacy of the individual or of the census form seems to me to be totally foreign and repugnant. In that case we would be comparing a wilful action that might be taken by a public servant with an action by a citizen of this country who might be doing it just for a lark. </PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator GIETZELT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee, prior to the suspension of the sitting, was examining the amendments proposed to sections 24 and 26 dealing with punishments relating to the Census and Statistics Amendment Bill which is before the Committee for its consideration. I was canvassing the view which the Opposition has about these two new sections. The amendment to section 24 proposes to delete the words 'The Statistician, an officer, or the occupier of a dwelling' and substitute 'A person who is, or has been, the Statistician or an officer'. I was drawing the Committee's attention to the fact that in these circumstances an officer is invariably a casual member of the Statistician's staff employed for the purpose of collecting information from the householder or the occupier of the dwelling, as he is identified in the legislation. I was pointing out that we are asked to approve proposed section 26 which establishes the same sort of penalty for breaches of the legislation insofar as they are wilful acts by either the officer or the occupier of the dwelling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to the Opposition, as indeed it seems to the Australian Democrats, that this cannot be sustained as being a fair and reasonable approach. Clearly, if the information relating to secrecy is breached by the officer, one can concede that that is an offence which is covered not only by this legislation but also by the Crimes Act and by the Public Service regulations. We submit to the Committee that to suggest that the same sort of penalty should be applied to the occupier of a dwelling-that is, citizen A or B-is harsh, tyrannical and unfair. Whilst it is conceded that in some instances the occupier of the dwelling may wilfully give false information, it cannot be said that the penalty for that should be equal to that for an officer who wilfully gives information relating to facts collected as a result of the Statistician's activities. Distinctions exist which ought to be recognised in the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats. In fact, we probably ought to go a little bit further than that amendment. The amendment seeks to take out the penalty of imprisonment for six months or imprisonment plus a fine. I draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that we are talking here of a citizen being subject to a penalty of a $1,000 fine or six months' imprisonment or both. There is a discretion, it is true, that the judge can exercise. However, it is a very harsh punishment for some facetious, nevertheless wilful, disregard of the responsibilities of a citizen should these matters come to a point at which there is a dispute between the citizen and the officer acting on behalf of the Commonwealth Statistician. </PARA>
<PARA> We express grave disquiet about having the same type of penalty included in the Schedule, as suggested by the legislation currently before the Committee. We certainly urge that proposed new section 26, as far as it relates to the citizen, should have a different type of penalty. It may be conceded that there are occasions when the citizen, for a variety of reasons, is anti-authoritarian, unwilling to respond to governments, angry with governments or prepared to defy governments and authority because of some previous experience. That person should not be placed in exactly the same category as a person who is an employee of the Crown-that is, the Statistician or the officer appointed to represent the Statistician-who wilfully gives information knowing full well that it is in breach of this legislation, the Public Service regulations and, in some respects, a breach of the Crimes Act. We ask the Committee to exercise some discretion in this matter and not just blindly follow the Executive recommendation and the adoption of this proposition in the House of Representatives. To the extent that the amendment moved by Senator Mason removes that part of the penalty that suggests that there should be imprisonment as well as a fine, the Opposition is prepared to support the amendment. </PARA>

I do not mind the increase from $100, which, I think, in 1905 would have corresponded to much more than $1,000 in today's terms. When one relates average weekly earnings to a term of six months one is talking about $5,000 not $1,000. I do not care what the fine is, but I care about sending people to gaol for incorrectly filling in a form. Television services in this country now help people not to learn English and are designed to help people never to have to understand English. What will happen when people get a form which they have to fill in for census and statistics purposes at the end of the financial year? Some of those people will not necessarily be able to understand what they are doing. It could be construed that they had wilfully filled in the form incorrectly and therefore are liable to go to gaol.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I exercise my right to speak again to the amendment because I wish to stress to honourable senators my conviction as to what I see as its deep and basic importance. To the Australian Democrats it is very important as a matter of principle. By way of background, let me say that we are debating a Bill to amend certain aspects of the Census and Statistics Act, which will decide the conditions under which the census will be taken this year, which will affect all Australians and to which we must all legally contribute. The Bill, as proposed, includes new penalties for Australians who do not fill in the census form as instructed or who knowingly give false information. I concede to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner)the significance of the word 'knowingly', but there again we have a difficulty of interpretation. Whether a person can be said to know that he is giving false information has always been a difficult legal principle to establish at the best of times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The objection of the Australian Democrats is to the proposal that those who give such false information in filling in a form should be subjected to a fine of $1,000 or six months in gaol, or both. The existing Act provides for only a $100 fine. No gaol term has ever been provided for that kind of offence. Thus, the Government's proposal is quite new. Earlier the Minister in charge of the Bill, Senator Messner, made excuses for what I see as an intolerable provision by saying that the courts would interpret it lightly. I suggest that, as members of parliament, we have no right to shuffle off our responsibilities to the courts; that if we say that a certain thing can be done we should accept responsibility and not say: 'Oh gosh, probably, although we do that, the courts will be okay and will not injure people'. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically, as a matter of principle, we must decide whether it is right to introduce in Australia the principle that an Australian can be put in gaol for not filling in a form correctly. That is really what it amounts to. I have quoted before in the Senate the proverb which marked the absolute and cruel centuries in Japan under the dictatorship of shogunate-'Official exalted; people despised'. I suggest that we cannot in Australia tolerate legislation under which a person who-admittedly perhaps for stupid reasons-makes fun of the bureaucracy may then be sent to gaol for it. I commend the amendment, which proposes to remove the gaol option. </PARA>

Firstly, I would like from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) information as to the way in which 'knowingly' filling in a census form is to be interpreted. I can imagine that some of those who have come to this country as I have will have difficulty in understanding properly the forms or the questions. Some of them, I am sure, will put down a wrong answer, although not knowingly or intentionally. I wonder what the attitude of the court will be to someone who has done that because he has not understood a question. Some of the questions that I have seen in the census forms are not worded in a way that some of us would describe as proper. It is necessary that the Minister explain the situation and give us an assurance that it will not be merely a matter of hoping that the court will decide that a migrant did not understand a question or did not interpret it in the way in which the court or the collector of the forms might interpret it.

Certain people are selected at random and asked to give information as to whether they are employed, how many people live in their house, what is the status of such people, whether they are employed, receive unemployment benefit and so on. From time to time a number of honourable senators receive representations from people who object to giving such information. Will the increased penalties catch people who refuse to participate in such surveys? If so, one would have to look very seriously at the amendment and seek to reduce the effect of the rather draconian measures embodied in the Bill.

Each time we have a census, certain members of this Parliament-one could name the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) and Senator Townley-complain repeatedly, I believe misguidedly, both in this Parliament and in the media about the nature of the forms and the number and type of questions asked. If elected members of this Parliament are advocating that the census form is intrusive, that people should not be obliged to answer it-I repeat that I believe they are wrong in so doing-we have an interesting situation in which people who take their advice could be sent to gaol for six months. That is an intolerable situation. No matter how misguided our fellow parliamentarians might be, they are entitled to advocate their views in the Parliament. If people follow those views they are likely to be sent to gaol. I add that argument to the cogent arguments in favour of the amendment. Therefore I support the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address myself to two or three of the points raised. They are similar in nature. Firstly, in regard to Senator Mason's amendment I repeat the point that I made during the second reading debate: Section 26 of the substantive Act, to which the amendment relates, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>No person shall knowingly make in any form or document filled up or supplied in pursuance of this Act or in answer to any question asked him under the authority of this Act any statement which is untrue in any material particular. </PARA>
<PARA>The two key words there are 'knowingly' and 'untrue'. They suggest that there must be intent designed to mislead or to provide false information. That would need to be proven for a prosecution to succeed under this legislation. I wish to make just a few other general points. Firstly, I refer to the whole question of upgrading the penalties. The penalties set out in the substantive Act were laid down in 1905. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Townley" NAMEID="8T7">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T7">Senator Townley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I mentioned that.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Senator Townley mentioned that. There have been some increases in those penalties. The penalty contained in section 11 has been increased from $20 to $500. I have not done the sums, but I think it is reasonable to assume that that is not an unreasonable change when we consider the difference between 1905 money values and today's values.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Section 26 concerns an important issue. As I stated in the second reading debate, the section provides a reasonably tough penalty. However, it is a maximum penalty. I now point out that, of course, it relates not only to the census but also to the whole area of the collection of statistics by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. That is a very important point because, as honourable senators would know, the Australian Bureau of Statistics collects statistics on behalf of the Government from all kinds of organisations, including business firms, commercial enterprises and industrial organisations. That is very important information for obtaining correct forecasts and histories as to the direction of the economy, and so on. For that reason a rather stiff penalty has been written into the legislation. As I stated, it is a maximum penalty which is certainly subject to consideration by the courts when considering their judgments. I believe that to be an important area of concern in predicting trends in the economy of the country and in obtaining reliable information upon which government decisions and, for that matter, commercial and private decisions about the direction of the Australian community in the next few years will be made. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of Senator Lajovic to the point I have made that the relevant section refers to a person who knowingly provides untrue or false information. I am no lawyer, but I do not think it is by any means possible to draw the conclusion that people who by accident or by misunderstanding provided false information in a form, whether it be census information or information of a more general statistical kind, could put themselves in a position of being successfully prosecuted and imprisoned. I cannot give the honourable senator an assurance. Naturally enough, if such a thing occurred it would have to be considered by the courts, and that is a matter which I cannot comment upon. But it seems to me to be reasonable to draw that kind of assumption from the information before us at present. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Townley asked why we needed to provide a penalty of this kind. Essentially we are seeking to get information. It is obvious that it is not likely that the penalties will be applied in most cases. We will be able to ensure that people comply with the law, in which case the penalties will not be applied. That is the main ingredient of this kind of legislation. That sort of provision is common throughout other legislation that this Parliament has decided upon over many years and it is a widely accepted principle of administration. In that sense I do not regard this as a draconian measure. I see it as a measure which tries to prevent the provision of deliberately misleading information in the gathering of statistics. I do not think we can look at it in any other terms. Indeed, the history of the principal Act is that since 1905 very few cases have reached the stage of prosecution. </PARA>

Senator Georges commented in regard to a number of matters. I think I may have cleared up one or two points in his mind by saying that this legislation concerns not only the census but also a broad range of statistical returns. Senator Georges cut across several points in relation to the census.

People who do not comply with requirements in respect of statistical returns under section 17 of the substantive Act would find themselves subject to a similar penalty. People who contravene the general provision of section 18 of the substantive Act would find themselves subject to a penalty of the same amount. What I am pointing out to Senator Georges is that that does not bear in any way on the amendment which has been moved by Senator Mason because it does not touch on section 26, which provides that no one shall knowingly provide information which is untrue in respect of not only a census but also the whole range of statistical returns.</PARA></TALK.START>

I hope he would agree, as Senator Grimes, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, has already said, that the provision of information of this kind is important for government purposes. Indeed, Senator Walsh has just acknowledged that. I agree that the need for information of a statistical kind so that we can make proper judgments as to the direction of the Australian community is of the utmost importance. Accuracy is the next most important question. I believe that is what Senator Mason's proposed amendment is all about. Unfortunately I think he missed the point.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T7">Senator TOWNLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walsh knows what was said. It was the second most ridiculous thing I have ever heard said in this Parliament. The point I make, as I just said, is that I am amazed that more Liberal senators are not objecting to the proposed admendment to this section. It will put on the statute book something that I regard as being totally unnecessary, particularly in light of what the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) has just said. In reply to one of the questions I asked a moment ago about how many people in fact had been fined under the $100 penalty, the Minister did not give me an exact number but he intimated to me that it would be very few. I know that it is very difficult at this stage to get an exact number. I do not need an exact number.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point is that it is not known that thousands of people have been giving wrong information. To say what is proposed will be the upper limit of a penalty is just not good enough. Let us take the extreme argument which is what engineers often do when they are trying to analyse something. Let us look at the situation in which we could have imposed a $1,000 fine or the penalty of death. If a person were to go to court knowing that the maximum penalty was death he would have to have a much more expensive defence than if the penalty were just a $1,000 fine. People can perhaps survive a $1,000 fine, but not many people can survive the death penalty. I suppose that in these days in this country people can survive even the death penalty because of the crazy rules we have on our statute book. I am not prepared to support another crazy rule. It is proposed in section 26 to increase the fine of $100 laid down in 1905 to $1,000 or imprisonment for six months, or both. </PARA>
<PARA> I said a moment ago that I am quite prepared to see a higher amount imposed than $1,000 if the purpose is to make sure that we get accurate information. I agree that accuracy of information is important. The census will affect 14 million or 15 million people. I would be surprised if we had had 100 charges brought under the penalty of a $100 fine over the last 50 years. At this stage the percentage of such charges is just too small to bother working out. In other words, we are putting on the statute book for a future government or a future Attorney-General-we do not know what their attitude will be or how they will want to use this piece of legislation if it is passed as it is-something that is completely unnecessary and which may be used in a way in which we do not intend it to be used. For those reasons I cannot support this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> I will be supporting the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats. As I said earlier, I apologise for not having moved it myself. I know it is correct for the Government to want accurate forecasts but in my book what the Minister has said is just no excuse for what the Government proposes. He said that this is the maximum penalty and it is not likely to be applied. When the courts are looking at the penalty to be applied to someone they do not look at what the Minister says. If the Minister says tonight that the courts will treat these matters leniently that is all very well. But, as I have said, I would not be at all surprised if we had another Minister one day. The courts look at the words of the Acts. They do not look at what the Minister says. They look at the words and sometimes one word can make all the difference between a very severe penalty and one that is more sensible. I hope that common sense will prevail, that the Government will see how unnecessary is the modification contained in the last part of the Schedule and that it will agree to the amendment that has been moved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) has applied himself to the fears of the Opposition in relation to section 26. I will respond to the queries that have been raised by Senator Townley and Senator Lajovic. I stress to them that in no way has the Minister's reply satisfied their concern or, in fact, our concern. I make a plea to those members of the Government who on many occasions have shown a concern for the civil liberties of the citizen to look at just what section 26 seeks to do. I also draw attention to the Minister's reply. The Minister is glossing over the fact that we have two distinct problems. In his reply he referred to the fact that persons who knowingly fill in forms in a false and misleading way are entitled to be penalised because of the importance of maintaining some reliability in respect of information. He is ignoring the fact that we are extending that provision to the average citizens of our country. Section 26 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No person shall knowingly make in any form or document filled up or supplied in pursuance of this Act or in answer to any question asked him under the authority of this Act any statement which is untrue in any material particular. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously if we were to ask, for example, a big corporation about the degree of foreign ownership or the degree to which it engaged in trade or commerce and a person in that corporation knowingly withheld that information, it would be wrong to suggest that that person would not be entitled to be penalised. We do not make that assertion. But to suggest that that person should be placed in the same category as the six million householders in Australia-the persons Senator Lajovic and we on this side of the chamber are concerned about-is wrong, having regard to the fact that we are now a country of migrants. </PARA>
<PARA> A very substantial proportion of our citizens are migrants and a very substantial proportion of them do not understand our customs, our traditions and the way in which forms should be filled in. Who is to estimate whether they knowingly or wilfully mislead or make any statement which is untrue in any material particular? Who is to make that assessment? The census collector, the person appointed by the Australian Statistician's Office, could make that assessment based on the prejudice that that person may well have about a particular group of citizens living in a particular area, which is the way in which many of our migrants live in this country today. Let us face the fact that a residual racist and chauvinist position exists in many sections of our community. </PARA>
<PARA> I would not like to delegate, through the Senate, to a collector the right to make that judgment in respect of the way in which a person responds to the six-yearly census that is to be carried out under the terms of this Act. I would not like to put that person, therefore, in the same category as the manager of a major corporation, a large industrial undertaking or a company in our agricultural sector if, in the judgment of the collector, that person has wilfully withheld information. If that person had come from a country whose customs led him to fear authority-that is the position in respect of many people who come to Australia-one could understand his reticence and his desire to withhold information because of the environment in another land. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems wrong to give, as this legislation seeks to do, to a person appointed by the Crown-a statistician or an officer-the right to make that subjective judgment in respect of that person and then, as the Minister has sought to do, to equate it with a more wilful act taken by someone who is Anglo-Saxon and who wants to withhold from the Government for a whole variety of reasons information about the way in which our society, industries or commerce are operating. One would have thought that rather than leaving it to Senator Townley and Senator Lajovic to be concerned, those members of the Government parties who from time to time have shown their desire to be associated with protecting the rights of the individual would have entered the debate. We are protecting those rights, I believe, if we at least take the step of supporting the amendment moved by Senator Mason. One would have thought that more and more Government senators would come in so that we could let them see the trap into which we are being led in being asked to give approval to the provisions of the Bill before the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> After all, no explanation that is acceptable to the Opposition has been given by the Minister as to why imprisonment is needed. People associated with criminology, people associated with our penal institutions and people concerned with the welfare of our citizens have already pointed out that there are too many people in gaols in this country and that imprisonment is not the form of punishment that ought to be imposed for misdemeanours committed within the community. The Government suggests that the fine should be increased from $100. That is the figure in section 26 of the Act as it now stands. There is no evidence that that fine was inadequate. Senator Townley was quite correct to raise the point. Where is the evidence that the present fine does not act as a deterrent? If it is argued, in the effluxion of time, that $100 is too small a fine or penalty and that the fine ought to be raised to $1,000, we will not quibble with that. We do quibble with the inclusion of a provision for a penalty by way of imprisonment as well as by a fine, which penalty is to be determined in some court based on the subjective analysis or assessment made by an officer acting on behalf of the Commonwealth Statistician. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not a minor question. I think it is a major question. The Parliament ought not to be taking steps that are likely to inflict further punishment upon the citizens of Australia, having regard to the great variety of citizens that now go to make up Australia. We have a completely new type of population make-up from what we had at the end of World War II. Those of us who have anything to do with our communities know a great deal about Australia's new citizens and their fear about authority and their inability to comprehend all the forms and formats upon which our society operates today. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that in all the circumstances the Minister has failed to understand the concern of the Opposition. He has failed to take into consideration the fact that we believe that if section 26 of he Act has to be amended, the form of penalty imposed on citizens who unknowingly supply misleading information in filling out census forms ought to be different from the form of penalty that is imposed on citizens who wilfully and knowingly supply misleading information to the Statistician in respect of ordinary census activity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Gietzelt has raised the question of whether there is some lack of even handedness in the treatment of those who commit an offence in filling out census forms compared with those who commit an offence in supplying statistical information provided to the Government as required under the Census and Statistics Act and at the direction of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. In regard to his argument I make the point that there will be no special extension as a result of these amendments to cover those who provide information for the census at 30 June this year. The substantive provisions that applied previously apply now. They have applied since 1905. The Act was originally drafted in that form. All that are to be changed are the penalties. Senator Gietzelt has queried whether there ought to be any change in the amount of the penalties. He claimed that no substantive problems have arisen as a result of non-compliance with the Act and that therefore the $100 penalty ought to apply. The fact is that the Australia Law Reform Commission in its recommendations has stated that the penalties ought to be upgraded. Consequently the Government is--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In that case, I fail to observe the difference in our arguments. I fail to see that there is any debate between us. I answer the points made by Senator Gietzelt in those terms. Senator Gietzelt sought to make a major point in relation to those who might, by accident or through misunderstanding, in some way provide false or wrong information. I put it to him that quite clearly the substantive Act in section 26 speaks of knowingly providing information which is untrue. That is the specific point on which I sought to answer Senator Lajovic's remarks earlier. Naturally that is what the Government would be concerned about but clearly that will be a matter for the courts to decide in the event of any prosecution being launched. As I sought to make clear in response to Senator Lajovic's remarks, I believe that where genuine misunderstanding was clearly stated in evidence in any court it would be very difficult for anybody to prosecute a person under that section. It is these penalties about which we are talking. Of course, whatever I have said in this area is in no way an assurance. As I have pointed out to Senator Gietzelt it will be a matter for the courts to decide. A maximum penalty is provided. It will be a question for the courts, in the proper exercise of their judicial powers and their judicial rights, to determine penalties as they judge particular issues.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having listened to the response of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) to my earlier queries, I am now inclined to oppose the Bill. We have discussed the Bill in the party room. I think we considered it only in relation to a universal census. The Minister has said that the penalty provisions of the Bill will also apply to the collection of random information from time to time. I believe that he has admitted that the provisions cover the gathering of statistical material, including random sampling at any time. I would like the Minister to explain exactly what random sampling is. How does one arrive at the guidelines for random sampling? My understanding is that the Australian Bureau of Statistics decides that it wants certain information from a certain area. It then selects at random from, say, 30,000 homes in that area a sample of, say, 30 homes. Having selected those homes at random it compels the occupants to give certain information. Using that information it comes up with some statistical data.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand from the Minister's response that the increased penalties will cover any person chosen for such a random sample who refuses to give the required information. There is considerable difference between a random sample and a universal census. Everyone is required to participate in a universal census but only some people are required to participate in a random sample. The same principle applies in relation to small businesses. So the Bueau will say to a certain number of people selected from the community: 'Give us this information. If you do not do so or wilfully give false information you will be up for a fine of $1,000 or six months' imprisonment'. No person is prepared to give false information in a random sample. My experience is that if a person refuses to give that information, the statistician will say: 'You must give the information'. If the person asks 'Why me?' the statistician says: 'You and you alone must give this information. If you withdraw you wreck the whole sample'. That occurs quite often. A young person is confronted at the door by a member of the Bureau who says: 'We want this information, and we are going to call in a fortnight's time, and thereafter again in a fortnight's time, and you must give this information'. The person says: 'I do not want to give it. It is personal, it is private. I am not working. I am on unemployment'. Who knows? He may be afraid of officers of the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> We know the practices of officers of the Department of Social Security who try to establish some de facto relationship. They can go through a house, look in the various rooms and cupboards, see whether there are double beds or single beds, and whether the double bed has been used. People in depressed, underprivileged, disadvantaged conditions make their own arrangements these days. Maybe they are ripping off the Department, but they do not want to expose themselves to the statistician. Possibly the statistician will say that all the information is confidential, but the person who is asked to provide this information is not certain of this. Therefore he says: 'I do not want to participate'. Then the statistician says: 'You will be fined'. The person says: 'I will risk the fine'. Previously the fine was $22. Some people are prepared to risk a fine of 22 bucks rather than have their privacy invaded. What has the Government done now? It has increased the fine to $500. It has not been increased 10 times, it has been increased more than 20 times. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Instead of a fine of $27,000. Let me get back to the Bill. We cannot leave a discretion to the magistrate or give the magistrate scope to the extent that we have in this Bill-that is, $1,000 or six months in one instance; or, in the other instance, $500. I am getting very close to the point of opposing the whole proposal, because the Minister said there have been only a few occasions since 1905 when people have been taken to court. If that is the case, why change? Who imposed this change? Was it the statistician who is having difficulty collecting the information that he wants? In any case, the razor gang has decided that the statistician is collecting too much information. Perhaps it would have been better for the Government to impose further restrictions on the statistician rather than increase his power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I seriously suggest to the Committee that these penalties are far too great. We have now had it revealed to us that this section catches not only those involved in a national census but also those involved in a random sample. That makes it most unfair. I would suggest that the Government take another look at the legislation and not persist with these heavy penalties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to ask the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) a question about section 26, about those people who have given information, knowing that the information is untrue, and about the penalties that may be imposed. The Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, of which I am a member, currently has a reference on Australia and the refugee problem. We have been interviewing a number of refugees all around Australia. The majority of those refugees are Vietnamese who have come from camps in Thailand or Malaysia or refugees from eastern Europe who have come from Vienna. It is quite obvious to all of us that a number of them gave false information which facilitated their entry into Australia. These refugees come from the two largest groups of refugees. I refer to Vietnamese and people from eastern Europe. These people in particular are often very wary of officials and official forms but they are especially wary when somebody visits them at their home and asks for detailed information. The danger that I see and what worries me is how this information that is collected could be used in the future. If a person gives information to a Government department in order to get into this country and years later on a census form gives different information, can the Minister tell me what penalty he will receive under section 26 or whether the provisions of that section apply to him?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to Senator Georges I think the point must be made, as he would quickly acknowledge, that if penalties are set out in an Act of this kind in order to bring about actions by people against whom the penalties may be levied in the future by courts, the success of the legislation may be indicated by the lack of prosecutions. I sought to make that point earlier. There is substantial compliance with the law as a result of penalties being provided in legislation. I think Senator Sibraa would acknowledge too that all census information and other statistical material provided is confidential between the Australian Bureau of Statistics and those people who provide the material. In respect of the census, which seems to be his particular concern, the forms would be destroyed as soon as possible after they were processed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Census and Statistics Amendment Bill 1981 provides evidence as to why the business of Parliament should not be conducted in the way in which increasingly it is being conducted and in which in the last few weeks it always has been conducted, that is, the practice of the Government, followed in the case of this Bill, of bringing legislation into the House of Representatives one Thursday night and having it forced through the House the next Thursday night. In retrospect I recognise that the penalties question was not given adequate consideration by the Australian Labor Party. I will explain why that happened. The Economics Committee of the Party which handles taxation legislation meets at lunch time on Thursdays. This Bill was introduced on the night of Thursday, 30 April. The Party Executive had to make a recommendation on the Bill the next Tuesday and the Caucus had to make a decision on Wednesday. In other words, there was no opportunity for the Economics Committee to meet in its normal fashion and discuss the legislation prior to a Party decision being made. I say that partly because of the comments made by Senator Georges. It was not the practice, when I first came into Parliament-I do not think it was the practice for many years, if ever, before that-for legislation to be rammed through the House of Representatives in less than one week. But this year under the Fraser Government that has become standard practice. It is now the norm.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In response to the first speech of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) in the Committee stage of this Bill, let me state that these penalties do not upgrade the penalties of 1905. In section 26, to which Senator Mason's amendment refers, the financial penalty is updated by the provision of a fine of up to $1,000. The six months' imprisonment is added. This is not a question of updating 1905 legislation. It has been updated and a term of imprisonment of up to six months has been added. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Messner said that there have been few prosecutions under this legislation. I accept that statement as being true. I cannot say that I have not heard of a prosecution under section 26 of the principal Act against a person for knowingly supplying untrue information. If there have been almost no prosecutions the logical argument which flows from that is that there is no need to increase the financial penalty, let alone impose for the first time a possible term of imprisonment. The argument that it is necessary to have severe penalties such as this in order to collect accurate information to assist with economic forecasting is revealed as humbug coming from a government which decided to defer, for a considerable period, the processing of much of the information that the last census produced and indeed to abandon processing some of it altogether on the spurious grounds of economy. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the penalties imposed in this Bill compared with penalties imposed in other legislation other very serious inconsistencies are revealed. Some breaches of the Income Tax Assessment Act carry a penalty of imprisonment. An amendment that went through the Parliament last year concerning the destruction of company records in association with tax evasion schemes is one example which comes to mind. I do not believe that there are any breaches of that Act relevant to putting inaccurate, untrue or false information into a taxation return which carry the possibility of imprisonment as a penalty. The motives of people who submit false information and understate their income on their tax return are obvious. They aim to cheat the Government of revenue. That is theft. But they do not risk imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA> For a wide variety of reasons people may insert false or inaccurate information in census or other Bureau of Statistics data collection. For example, people have inhibitions about previous marital or reproductive experiences which may or may not seem to be rationally justified so they supply information that they know to be inaccurate. Surely that is a peccadillo especially when compared with the deliberate understatement of income with the intent of defrauding the Australian Taxation Office of revenue. That is theft. Other examples have been given by Senator Lajovic and several of my colleagues of people who have had unhappy experiences with authoritarian regimes in other countries and who are reluctant to supply personal details. For example, it is easy to imagine someone of Jewish ancestry being reluctant to supply personal details given that Hitler went back three generations to see whether he could find a Jewish ancestor before someone was declared a Jew and exterminated. Obviously such people would be reluctant to supply information, given their unhappy experiences, yet are we saying that for a peccadillo which does no serious harm these people ought to be imprisoned for six months?</PARA>
<PARA> Nothing that the Government has put forward justifies the penalties which the Bill proposes. Indeed the arguments presented by Senator Messner, who is handling the Bill, not only strengthen the claims which are made in this amendment that the penalty of imprisonment ought to be waived, but also could quite logically be held up as an argument in favour of reducing the substantial increase in the financial penalty imposed. Nothing that has been said in this debate persuades me that the Opposition ought to do otherwise than support the amendment that Senator Mason has moved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister has not replied to my satisfaction in respect of the issue that I raised about the universality of section 26 as it is applied to Part IV of the principal Act. Section 16 provides:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Statistician shall, subject to the regulations and the directions of the Minister, collect, at least annually, statistics in relation to all or any of the following matters:</PARA>
<PARA>The section then defines the matters as vital, industrial and social; employment and non-employment; imports and exports; interstate trade; agricultural; banking, insurance and finance; and so on. The point I raised with the Minister concerned the fact that the provisions that apply to people who withhold information or who give misleading information wilfully ought not to apply to the members of the six million households in Australia. I think we ought to have some assurance from the Minister because we are dealing with two classes of people. Yet, as Senator Walsh correctly stated, section 26 puts into the one area these people who can act in such a way as to prevent economic forecasts being made, for example, and who therefore play a wilful role in providing misleading information and those citizens who do so unknowingly. Because of ignorance or fear of authority or for any other reason these people are placed in exactly the same position as those who may wilfully give misleading information under that section of the principal Act. I would like the Minister to concede that these far-reaching effects ought not to be part of the Bill before the Committee. Therefore, there is some sense in the way in which the amendment seeks to rectify the obvious injustice and unfairness in respect of these two different categories of people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am again drawn into this discussion not only on the question of penalties but also on the question that was raised by Senator Georges in relation to random sampling. It was mentioned that this penalty applies to any false statement that is made under the provisions of the legislation which include the gathering of statistics at any time. My knowledge of random sampling relates to a case that was brought to my attention. A householder rang me because the person was very concerned that the collector of statistics had called around to the home with the intention of asking the members of that household to fill in a form on the day. As the people were not home a card was left asking the householders to fill in the particulars. They did not think they should have to do this, so they refused to fill in the form. They got from the department a letter which said that under the Act it was essential that they fill it in and which threatened that legal proceedings would be taken against them unless they did so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the time I made representations to the Minister. The people involved were a working-class couple who had no interest in the statistics; they resented the intrusion into their privacy and they did not want to participate in the survey. As they said, the majority of the people who lived in their street would willingly give the information that was required by the Bureau of Statistics. I was informed in the reply I got that under the Act the people were compelled to fill in the return. I was told that if the Bureau had accepted my suggestion and did not insist on getting information from this couple but instead had gone to another house to get the information it would then be a case of getting statistics from selected people, that as the Bureau had picked that household at random it was obliged to get a reply from that household. As I said, in this instance the couple were not interested in statistics; they did not know what it was all about; they did not know how to reply and there was a good deal of resentment. If they had expressed their resentment by saying, 'I will not help. I will give a wrong statement', I could see the justification for the operating methods of the Bureau and I suppose people in this situation must be subject to some penalty. But surely it is not necessary to fine them $1,000 and to impose a penalty of six months imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA> On a consideration of the application of these provisions, as the Minister has failed to give a satisfactory reason to justify the retention of this provision, he should take the matter back to the Government to see whether it insists on retaining this draconian penalty, particularly as it appears to divide the members of his own party. I should think the Liberal Party in its present state would not want any more divisions within its ranks on minor questions such as this. </PARA>

It is not a matter of being wilful about it; it is just that the position that some individuals will find themselves in under this legislation has been overlooked. But the amendment now before the Committee which seeks to remove the imprisonment penalty is one that is worthy of support. If by delaying the legislation by further consideration of the amendment and by seeking further information I might prejudice the acceptance of this amendment I would prefer not to press my arguments tonight-I will take them up at another time-to ensure that the amendment gets the support that it deserves. Nevertheless, the Minister should not come into this place again with the proposition that if I see him privately at some time subsequent to the debate he will give me the information. It really is not good enough. The normal procedure is, if a Minister does not have the information but is prepared to send for it, he should then report progress.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that the Committee is back to order. I ask the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) exactly when the information that I seek will be given. I am concerned about the manner in which the random sampling is carried out and the number of people involved. What is the extent of the select few about whom mention has been made? I ceded my time and did not pursue the matter previously because it was suggested to me that the amendment was worthy of support and that no further delay should be allowed before it was put.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I again ask whether the Minister can give me the information now. He has two advisers with him. They should be able to give me some idea of how and the extent to which the random sampling is carried out. The chamber would then know exactly what it is about to agree to in relation to the individual people who are specially selected for the purpose of gathering statistics. The Minister indicated that if these poeple refused to participate they would be liable to a $500 fine. If people agree to participate but, because of the sensitivity of their circumstances, are not able to give all the information which is sought, they are liable to a $1000 fine and six months imprisonment. There is some concern in the community. I have a telephone message in my hand to which I cannot respond. The message is from a person who says: 'Please phone me urgently re debate'. I would like to phone that person but I will not have an opportunity to do so. This is the first time when I have been speaking that I have receive a telephone message from a constituent who wants to give further information. The person has probably been disadvantaged by the legislation. Senator Evans may have some views he wants to put to the Committee. By all means let him do so. Perhaps he would be prepared to support me when I say that individuals caught in a selective situation may be penalised as outlined in the legislation. All I am asking is for the Minister to use his advisers to give an example of what happens. The Minister told me that he could give me a briefing; a briefing is not good enough. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to say a few words on the third reading of the Bill. The chamber has been treated in a shameful way. Genuine questions were asked. Honourable senators were concerned about the ramifications of the Bill and the heavy penalties imposed. We want to know about the application of the penalty. Does it apply to some random selection concerning the gathering of statistics? There may be many examples that would justify false information being given. If we knew that everything was fair and above board in connection with the whole method of random sampling we might be quite satisfied with the Bill. But the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) has indicated, in relation to two Bills, that he will obtain information and brief honourable senators later. Possibly we would be better briefed by that method, but the information is necessary now so that honourable senators can decide how they should vote.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We consider legislation which is binding on the whole of Australia. The information we seek should be made available now. Perhaps legislation in a certain form would not be agreed to if information which is to be given at some future time were available at the time of making the decision. It is unfair that honourable senators, without the knowledge of the full facts, should have to make a decision binding upon all the citizens of Australia. That is what happens under this Minister. It simply is not good enough. Many opportunities were given to the Minister to report progress and to seek leave to sit again. The debate could have been adjourned until his officer could give him the information. He refused to do so. When an honourable senator moved that the Committee report progress the Minister opposed the motion. I think the Government should ensure that we are better informed on the decisions that we have to make in this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill arises from the beef industry incentive payment legislation of 1978 which introduced a scheme under which, for a variety of prescribed and usually trivial treatments, cattle producers were entitled to a Government payment of $10 per head of cattle to a maximum of 200 head. This legislation retrospectively legalises the system which has been used by the Department of Primary Industry to assess eligibility for payments to producers both in an individual capacity and as members of a partnership. The Department of Primary Industry has processed these claims in a way which has maximised the payments to the individual.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This scheme, promised in 1977 and legislated for in 1978, has been plagued by maladministration, fraud-this attracted the attention of the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee and the police-and finally advice from the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) that the procedures followed in assessing the magnitude of claims were illegal. Hence this Bill. It is not surprising that this happened because the original legislation was a Malcolm Fraser National-Country Party pre-election special, an off-the-top-of-the-head political response to the strident demagoguery of Barry Cassell and the Cattlemans Union of Australia. The legislation was as ill-considered as other Malcolm Fraser off-the-top-of-the-head specials such as the 14 April assistance for farmers affected by drought which provided tax concessions for water conservation which were supposed to help those whose problem was that they had had no rain. Overlooking that fundamental defect, the scheme provided tax savings of up to $105 for every $100 invested in certain types of water conservation and distribution. It was the sort of scheme which was guaranteed to induce a gross misallocation of resources and a gross distortion of rational investment decisions. Since then one of the last pre-election specials of the same calibre was the immediate write-off for fuel stored on farms, on the grounds that this could provide a strategic reserve. It has been extended beyond farms since then. As a result of this scheme it will cost approximately $174m to provide the tanks to store six months supply. The cost to the Government because of the concession will be $78m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am dealing with the sort of background from which schemes such as the Beef Industry Incentive Payments Scheme are generated. That was one of the pre-election specials. The couple of others which I have cited and the one I am referring to now which I am about to finish will provide storage for a quantity of fuel at a cost of $174m in total, at a cost to the Government of $78m, when under a more rational system the same quantity of fuel could be stored for a total cost of $38m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To return to the Bill, the rationale for the original legislation in 1978 was that it would help struggling beef producers. Certainly at that time a large number of beef producers had very low incomes. A rational government, looking at that situation and anxious to help, would devise some sort of assistance which was related or tied to income. Not so governments of the Liberal and National Country parties. The irrational tradition of the Liberal and Country parties decrees that one treats an income problem by subsidising something other than income and by relating the payments to some criterion other than income. In this case the method chosen was the per capita subsidy for doing almost anything to do with cattle. One of the procedures which qualified a producer for the $10 a head subsidy was the speying of heifers. Speying is a form of sterilisation. At the time-this is, September 1977-the scheme was announced I put out a Press statement, extracts from which I will quote, with regard to the subsidisation of the speying of heifers. I stated:</PARA>
<PARA> With this panic move, the Country Party has maintained its record of aggravating booms and slumps with ill conceived myopic policies . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Herd numbers in Australia and overseas have been falling rapidly in the last two years . . . </PARA>
<PARA> There is a near certainly of a major beef price recovery within two years-perhaps even a boom approaching 1973 dimensions. </PARA>
<PARA> The heifers which the Government is sterilising should be mated now so their offspring will be able to catch the high prices two-three years hence. </PARA>
<PARA> During the last boom-just before the crash, Mr Anthony foolishly stated 'demand for beef will rise so fast we'll be flat out trying to keep up with it'. </PARA>
<PARA> Now that the industry is about to emerge from its slump, the same people are subsidising the destruction of the industry's foundation-its young females. </PARA>
<PARA>I observe for the record that within nine months of that statement having been issued beef prices rose appreciably and the boom in 1979 approached 1973 dimensions. Not only was this a stupid policy, and not only was it predictable at the time that it was a stupid policy, but also it was in fact predicted. Because the payments were not related to income, although they were rationalised on the grounds that they were providing assistance for beef producers who had low incomes, the system was of course extremely inefficient. The specialist beef producers, of whom the greatest numbers are found in Queensland, who might have herds of several thousand cattle and who were incurring heavy annual operating losses because that was their only source of income, were restricted to obtaining $2,000 from the scheme. On the other hand, wheat farmers in Queensland and in all the other mainland States who had very high incomes were able to collect a windfall of $2,000 for the couple of hundred cows they happened to have. Again, of course, it was not surprising that a policy which was supposed to treat a low income problem but was related to something other than income, and indeed something which might have almost nothing to do with income, was ineffective in meeting its proclaimed objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> The procedures for application for the grant were so loose that an employee of the Department of Primary Industry who had no cattle, realising that this was virtually an invitation to raid the Treasury, decided to do just that and submitted a false application for payment. This employee was caught-there may have been some others who were not caught-and was ultimately charged and convicted. Prior to being charged, as soon as he was under suspicion of having completed a false declaration, he was suspended from his position in the Department of Primary Industry. I am not criticising that procedure. I just observe that a completely different rule applied to his Minister at that time who also was under suspicion but was not stood down from his position. </PARA>
<PARA> Questions regarding this scheme are still unanswered. Precisely who received money from it? In particular, which, if any, Ministers who introduced what was a grossly inefficient and a very expensive scheme-it cost $118m ultimately-obtained any financial benefit from it? On 6 March last year I addressed, except for the changes of names and designations, identical questions to Mr Hunt, Mr Anthony, Mr Adermann, Mr Street, Senator Scott who was a Minister at the time, Mr Fraser and Mr Nixon, which asked whether they or any company in which they were a director or shareholder received any payments under the Beef Industry Incentive Payments Scheme. With the exception of Mr Nixon, identical answers came back on 18 September. The answer from the responsible Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister did not receive any payments for the operation of his property under the Beef Industry Incentive Payments Scheme. My Department has no knowledge of any company of which the Prime Minister is a director or a shareholder and is therefore unable to provide answers to those parts of the honourble senator's question. </PARA>
<PARA>In short the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) did not receive any payments for his property in the Western District. He may have had an interest in some other company which received payments, but the Minister was not in a position to say whether that was so. The same answer was provided from all the other Ministers I have named, except Mr Nixon. Mr Nixon's answer was different. He said that he did not receive any payments for the operation of his property. The answer went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> No payments were received under the Scheme by any company of which the Minister is a director or a shareholder. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, that was a more complete denial of the possibility of any payment having been received. That is not surprising because the Minister is in a position to know his own business-or one would hope he is. He is not necessarily in a position to know the business of the other Ministers about whom questions were asked. Mr Nixon, prior to that time, in response to a similar question concerning the former Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Sinclair, which was put on the Notice Paper on 3 March 1980 and answered on 19 March 1980, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> No payment was made to the Sinclair Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd or any of its directors under the Beef Industry Incentive Payments Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>So he went further with Mr Sinclair. It was not just a question of no payment being received by the Sinclair Pastoral Co. No payment was received by any of the people who were directors of the Sinclair Pastoral Co., said Mr Nixon. In the case of the other Ministers he did not go that far. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, I put the questions on notice again on 26 November 1980 and added to 'company' the word 'partnership' so that the question then read:</PARA>
<PARA> Did any company or partnership of which the Minister is a Director or shareholder-</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, I extended the scope of the questions. On 25 November I put a similar motion on the notice paper under General Business. That motion was due for debate on 9 April of this year. On that night, prior to the Senate's resuming after dinner, I was asked by a senior official of the Department of Primary Industry whether the answers to those questions had come through. I said that they had not, at least not to my knowledge. The official told me that the answers had been prepared and were to come through. That placed me in the position of not knowing whether to proceed with the motion in that I believed that the answers were probably in the building somewhere. In the event, I did not have to make that choice because the motion did not come on for debate. However, neither have the answers appeared. Five weeks later the answers, which I was told by a senior official of the Department had been prepared, have still not been presented. That begs two questions: Was I being fed inaccurate information on the night of 9 April to deter me from moving the motion in my name because it would be embarrassing to somebody, or to several people; or was I being told the truth by the official of the Department of Primary Industry-that the Department had submitted the answers to the Minister-and is the Minister sitting on them in his office? I do not know what the answers are but the chain of events would certainly lead towards one or other of those conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition does not oppose this legislation. Given all of the idiocies and inequities that were built into the Bill from the beginning-which are not related to this amending Bill-and the other reservations I have mentioned, the procedures being adopted by the Department in sorting out its sole trader and partnership applications are quite sensible and equitable. Thus, the Opposition does not oppose this Bill, which retrospectively legalises the procedures that the Department is following. However, we again draw attention to what a stupid piece of legislation this was in the first place. I hope that the Parliament will see less of that kind of legislation in the future. However, I regret to observe that the events of the last couple of years have shown us that we are likely to see much more of that kind of stupid legislation-indeed legislation which is even worse-because of the Government's growing propensity to introduce measures related to the Income Tax Assessment Act, apparently because of the belief of the Prime Minister that if money is not appropriated and shown in the Budget Papers, government assistance to industry is costless; that it must be directly and overtly appropriated in that way. I am afraid that the Government's attitude to agricultural policy and many other policies has deteriorated from the low point of 1977 at which the original legislation was introduced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Bill, which is purely and simply one to tidy up the Beef Industry (Incentive Payments) Act 1977. That measure was originally passed to assist the meat producers of Australia at a time when their industry was in a very heavy state of over-supply, had experienced a series of very bad seasons and was trying to sell meat on a hopelessly depressed world market. Their situation in those days was extremely difficult. The measure made a great deal of difference to a tremendous number of small producers who had completely run out of carry-on funds, because it allowed them to proceed on a basis that kept them in business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian cattle industry, because of its size and diversity, quite often runs into trouble. If it is not one part of Australia that is in difficulty, it can easily be another. That is largely attributable to the nature of the continent itself, which creates differences in weather and seasonal conditions. However, many of the problems of the industry in the last 20 years have been caused by over-stocking. Farmers generally have pushed further into marginal country, further than the country would stand. Considerable areas of new land have been brought into production. Often the land has not been able to stand the grazing or cropping to which it has been subjected. This has also brought with it the scourge of the ferral invader. Whereas a few years ago we used to talk very largely about the rabbit problem alone, we now have an impressive list which includes rabbits, goats, buffaloes, camels, donkeys and pigs, all of which are making severe inroads into the fringe development area of Australia. In addition, the kangaroo population is now estimated to be approximately five times the size it was 200 years ago when the white man first came here. Parts of this country which have been over-grazed and over-cropped may take 100 years to recover. In some places the ground cover has been destroyed and it will take a long time to get it back into production. </PARA>
<PARA> One is also quite safe in saying that the wheatlands, which also have pushed into what was traditionally sheep and cattle country, are unlikely to contract. It is also unlikely that much more new land will be opened up. But largely the fault is with the farmers themselves. They saw that there were opportunities to be taken and believed that the country would support development. Regrettably, in some areas that has not proved to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Much research has been done into the type of stock, the type of country and the methods of management that are necessary, but much more research is needed if we are to assist in getting the cattle industry on a more regular and stable plane. I have been especially impressed by the work that has been done in Queensland by Richard Wilson of Banana Station. He has undertaken extensive cross-breeding programs and research into various types of cattle that are more appropriate for the climate and conditions of that part of Australia than are the more traditional breeds. I have read a great deal of the material that he has produced and have seen some of the work that he has done. Although he is often controversial and is always trying to do something new, he is also very often right. He is seldom popular with many of the traditionalists with whom he associates. </PARA>
<PARA> The general program needs all the help we can give it. It is unlikely that beef numbers will increase appreciably. I cannot see that in the foreseeable future we will be able to reach a cattle population which is in excess of 30 million. Its numbers are far more likely to remain at 27 million or 28 million. This means that if we are to see an improvement in the meat industry it must be achieved on the basis of the quality of the meat itself. Each animal must be better than the comparable animal we are now talking about. Breeding must develop-we must look for the optimum growth for age and the optimum meat for feed, and we must produce the carcasses which the market wants. We also have to produce livestock that is easy to manage and easy to reproduce. Whilst I naturally have my own preferences in that regard, it is not a matter of choosing any particular breed but of how each breed copes with a particular situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think a kill in excess of 5 million a year is quite unlikely. Accordingly, at the moment there is a vast overcapacity in the processing industry. I heard recently that in many parts of Australia the processing industry is working at about 40 per cent of capacity. Naturally that provides excessive overheads, much higher costs and, in turn, lower returns for the producer. That will require a conscious effort to bring about adjustment. There is no question of resorting to the 'she'll be right' complex, because she will not be right. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst production in the meat industry is important, it is not nearly as important as the selling of the product. As over 50 per cent of the total production now in our market has to find a home overseas, traditionally the United States and Japan, we need to consider diversification very much and we must at all times be aware of the difficulties that can arise if anything goes wrong with one or other of the major markets. We consistently look to such places as the European Economic Community and Korea and even the Middle East and Eastern Europe as possible markets. But wherever meat is to find a home, diversification in the meat industry is very desirable and certainly needs to be fostered. </PARA>
<PARA> Marketing methods is one area I believe we need to work on as a means of cutting cost, improving returns and getting better education for the growers of the meat. If we want to have a good argument at any time in the meat industry we can start to discuss the methods of marketing livestock. So that I may pick my own adversaries, I can say quite openly that I dislike saleyards. I believe they provide the worst method of selling livestock. That method is expensive and inefficient. It produces unnecessary handling and it produces bruising and discomfort for the stock. All in all, I believe a negotiated on-the-hoof price is the best method possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know of anybody in the industry who wants support. Everybody wants the total industry, growing and processing, to operate free of help and hinderance. The processing industry is very troubled at present and I am afraid that, having had a very bad year this year, it looks as though it will have another very bad one next year. We certainly do not see a happy picture when we look at the great many processing companies which have had far more bad years than good ones over the last decade. The beef production industry depends very heavily on having a sound and stable processing industry as part of it. Without a sound and stable processing industry growers can never be sure of the best returns. I think we may still have far too many disasters in the processing industry in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to rationalise our meat inspection, and the Federal Government will have to take a lead if the States are not prepared to take a reasonable attitude. We have to cut costs and we have to make them fit in with the requirements we are actually looking for. There needs to be more directional assistance in breeding, in feeding, in recording and in processing-all the way through. I am pleased to support this Bill. I hope that by tidying up the 1977 Act, we will never need legislation of that type again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge the support which has been given to the Bill by the honourable senators who have spoken. I thank Senator Archer for his speech in support. The Bill legalises what have been described by the Opposition tonight as the sensible procedures which were devised by the Department of Primary Industry to deal with such payments. It simply legalises the position which has arisen. I do not believe the Bill needs any considerable debate this evening. I wish to say only one thing to the Senate. It is interesting to contrast the speech on the Bill by Senator Walsh in this place with the speech made by the Opposition spokesman on primary industry in the House of Representatives, Mr Kerin. In both cases the speakers on behalf of the Opposition chose to make speeches which went beyond the ambit of the Bill, as did Senator Archer, because it is a vehicle for talking about the beef industry. But Mr Kerin made a speech which related to the general policy which ought to be followed with respect to the beef industry. He made a plea for greater Commonwealth assistance. Senator Walsh gave a great deal of attention to trying to indicate that something could be pinned on members of the Government. It was fairly typical of the sorts of speeches we hear from him in this place. I make that comment because I think the contribution of Senator Walsh could have been made only by him. It was not the sort of speech which is made by other honourable senators from the Opposition or from this side of the chamber. I do not believe that sort of speech assists the Parliament or the public to assess the value and worth of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not oppose the Quarantine Amendment Bill 1981, although we will move an amendment expressing our concern with projected changes to the quarantine procedures in this country which have emerged during the time this legislation has been before the Parliament. The Bill is comprehensive. It introduced many changes, but further changes foreshadowed in the report of the so-called razor gang are not mentioned in the legislation. That causes us some concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill extends the application of the principal Act to provide for the operation of a high security animal quarantine station in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. It implements some of the recommendations of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources on the inadequacy of the quarantine services in this country. It changes the law to enable the apprehension, detention and forfeiture of foreign vessels landing in Australia without authority and it brings Australia into line with international practice by removing the liability for Australia to pay compensation for imported livestock and other animals which are destroyed in accordance with the Quarantine Act when such animals have been in quarantine since importation. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not oppose these measures because they tighten the Act and because quarantine is important to our national security. It is clear that if anything is clearly a national responsibility it is the protection of this country from the importation of exotic animal and plant diseases. We have been blessed, as we have said in similar debates on this matter, with the absence in this country of some of the great scourges of mankind. One can think of plague, rabies, foot and mouth disease and numerous animal and plant pests and disorders. The fragility of our fortunate state is demonstrated by the isolated but frequent cases of cholera which have appeared in recent years and the odd outbreaks of exotic animal diseases, particularly fowl diseases, which have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, there are those who put our country at risk through the illegal importation of animal products or animals themselves, as occurred in the recent instance of the hamsters and gerbils which were introduced for gain, for profit. These people, in fact betray our country. They are potentially the cause of enormous economic loss and social damage. For instance, if foot and mouth disease got into this country we would be very fortunate if we could confine it or, in fact, wipe it out. The introduction of a disease such as rabies, which is increasing in its incidence in countries nearby, would mean an impossible task for the authorities in wiping it out because of the ample supply of native and feral animals which would act as vectors for the disease in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic and social sabotage by people who would put us at risk is inexcusable and such people should be dealt with accordingly. But even without such idiotic behaviour we are at risk because of our vast coastline, our vast unoccupied areas and a shrinking world which allows access to this country in hours rather than days or months as was the case in the past. The increasing volume of visitors, many of whom do not understand our unique position and our need to protect it, adds to the risk. Therefore, it is of great concern that we see in the report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions-the so-called razor gang-that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will also explore with State governments the appropriateness and feasibility of transferring to the States the remaining Commonwealth operational elements of the administration of quarantine. That would leave policy matters in relation to quarantine with the Department of Health for people and the Department of Primary Industry for animals and plans. </PARA>
<PARA>This reference is the reason I will move the amendment in the name of the Opposition. We will do this to flag the risks we see to this country. There is no need for the national security of this country to be placed in jeopardy because we insist-because of some blind, ideological views-that the States, wherever possible, should have powers over things such as quarantine. Viruses, bacteria and animal pests recognise no boundaries-certainly no State boundaries-and we should recognise this fact. If this statement means-and it is not obvious just what it means-that the quarantine service is to be spread around the State governments with local views and local prejudices it is a step backwards. It is clear that such a step backwards would not benefit the present privileged position we have with quarantine. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that we cannot, without a huge work force and without draconian powers, completely insulate this country from the various threats in this area that we will be talking about. For instance, we cannot alter the wind, the effect of the habits of the birds, and the tides. However, we can increase the efficiency of our surveillance and we can give those who supervise our quarantine services better support. It is my understanding that the people who will be following me in this debate will be emphasising this matter. There can be few, if any, countries which put surveillance procedures out to private tender without the control that such a process requires. </PARA>
<PARA> No country views the efficient surveillance of its borders as a suitable function to be performed for a limited time in the week or as a function to be sold out to the lowest bidder. That is not security at all and it is open to all sorts of abuses. We must ensure-I am sure the people who follow me will emphasise this-that we have adequate facilities for the interception of offenders, for the detection of offenders and for the diagnosis and the elimination of diseases when they arise. This cannot be done if the function of quarantine is hived off to the States which have differing interests, differing values and differing priorities. I emphasise that this is a national problem, that quarantine is a national function and that we should keep it as such. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation, as far as it goes, certainly assists our quarantine services. Therefore, as I have said, we do not oppose it. Because of the lateness of the hour and the delay in the program I have no desire to go into the legislation any further. Others who follow me will do so. In view of our concern about this short and undetailed remark in the report of the so-called razor gang, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that the maintenance of efficient and comprehensive quarantine arrangements is vital and that any transfer of remaining operational responsibilities to the States would jeopardise this and therefore should be opposed'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great pleasure that I support the Quarantine Amendment Bill 1981 and the amendment that has been moved by the Opposition. It is a fact that Australia is remarkably free of those plagues and diseases which could ravage our agricultural industry, as has been pointed out by Senator Grimes. But it is also a fact that the legal and administrative structures under which our quarantine arrangements have been constructed were, until very recently, based on a turn of the century concept whereby the introduction of exotic human diseases was the paramount concern. That has changed considerably. Now, of course, the introduction of diseases which might ravage our agricultural, pastural and plant industries is of prime concern. In that case, of course, human beings could well be the vector for the transmission of such diseases into Australia. For that reason the Opposition-indeed, I think most senators around the chamber-has welcomed the various changes to the principal Act which have been introduced since 1979 in order to give a legal and administrative structure which is more in keeping with the new appreciation of the exact danger we are facing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no need to emphasise greatly the absolute urgency and paramount need for all Australians and all visitors to Australia to take note of our favourable disease-free status and the enormous impact this makes on our trading position in agricultural products around the world. Of course, freedom from exotic disease is an absolute prerequisite for access to many, if not all, of the markets with which we would want to trade in agricultural goods. It is not only exotic diseases which could create very severe illnesses within an animal population or a severe retardation of growth within a plant population with which we are concerned. The introduction of any disease which might hinder the otherwise good growth prospects of animal or plant material and which might create uncertainty in the minds of those who would import our products is of considerable danger to our trading position. Therefore, I support entirely Senator Grimes's remarks that what is needed, amongst other things, is such an administrative program as has been occurring in recent times-it is to be commended-whereby all those coming into Australia are fully warned and briefed as to the dangers of introducing some material which could be a carrier or vector of disease. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my task to look at the Bill a little more closely. The first section of the Bill deals with the creation of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands facility and the application of the Quarantine Amendment Bill to that Territory in order that it may, in its operation, be safeguarded in the same way as is mainland Australia and, indeed, Tasmania. I mean by that the more traditional area of Australia as opposed to these far flung Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The facility for the quarantine station was purchased some time ago from Mr Clunies-Ross. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the existing quarantine facility is totally inadequate in that much genetic material of great potential value to our pastoral industry cannot be imported into Australia. This means that there is a prohibition on the import of cattle, sheep, pigs, deer and goats from almost all countries. If Australia is to handle the import of such animals and genetic material in order to improve the quality of our livestock industries, then the speedy completion of these facilities-I note in the second reading speech that it is hoped that they will be completed in September 1981-will be of great benefit to the Australian nation insofar as it is dependent on a viable, prosperous and improving pastoral industry. Of course an integral part of those quarantine functions of Cocos Islands and something which will enable them to be more extensively used will be the completion of the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory at Geelong which, I believe, is taking somewhat longer to complete than was originally anticipated. Nevertheless, the Opposition very much welcomes the construction and completion of the Cocos Islands facility insofar as, as I say, it would enable the importation of genetic material from those countries where direct importation into Australia would have too high a risk factor. The fact is that we need to be able to import particularly, for example, tick resistant and heat resistant strains of cattle, and the Cocos Islands facilities would enable us to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> The application of the Bill is appropriate and sensible and therefore is to be welcomed. What we do not see here is any establishment of priorities in regard to the application by importers to enable them to use the facilities on Cocos Islands. It will be recalled that the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources thought that some 50 per cent of the facility ought to be available to national and State agricultural agencies, which would work out their priorities between themselves, and that the other 50 percent should be available to private importers of genetic material. I think the Committee thought that a committee should be established in order to enable priorities to be sorted out amongst those private importers. The Opposition certainly welcomes the creation of the Cocos Islands facility as being extremely important to Australian agriculture and, as I say, looks forward to the completion of the facility in 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major section of the Bill deals with the practice of granting pratique to vessels as they come within Australian jurisdiction. Pratique is a technical term which refers to the permission granted by quarantine authorities to a vessel which is deemed to be free from infection to unload cargo and passengers. Australian usage has permitted quarantine authorities to take some steps in relation to materials on such a vessel even after pratique has been granted. Very serious questions were raised before the Senate Committee, I think particularly by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, as to whether in fact quarantine authorities lost their jurisdiction over the vessel once the certificate of pratique-that is, pratique as opposed to freedom from infection-had been granted. The amendments to the Quarantine Act do make it clear that despite the fact that pratique has been granted there will be an opportunity for the quarantine authorities to exercise their powers in relation to the vessel. As I say, that was a legal difficulty which was put to the Senate Committee of which Senator Andrew Thomas is the Chairman. That Committee recommended that the amendment before the chamber be introduced and to that extent, of course, it will have the support, I believe, of the whole chamber. The granting of pratique by radio was also a matter which our Committee suggested ought to be undertaken in order to avoid delays. We found that on balance this could be undertaken without any great risk to the Australian quarantine situation. That, too, has been provided for in the Bill and therefore is to be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA> A further large section of the Bill deals with the conferring of extra powers on officers in the quarantine service. Once again, this is totally in accord with the Senate Committee's recommendations and, in fact, is a follow up to some amendments which were made in 1979 to ensure that the quarantine officers did have sufficient powers and were able to exercise them and were backed up by a system of provisions of offences and penalties which adequately expressed the community's concern that quarantine be regarded as a matter of paramount importance. We found, for example, that there was a lack of powers to inspect and confiscate after entry. We found that there was a great reliance on the Customs service to provide many of the powers which should have been and which would be well vested in the quarantine service. It was felt that quarantine officers ought to have as much power as is necessary to discharge adequately the responsibilities which the Australian people intend that service to have. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason, new powers have been put in the Bill for the examination of imported animals, plants and goods before and after release from quarantine and the ability to take samples and to make tests. The quarantine officers also are able to ask questions, to require documents or samples and to undertake tests in relation to goods which are subject or which are suspected to have been subject to quarantine. There are powers to enter premises under warrant for the purpose of examining goods. Finally, there is a power to order imported goods, animals and plants, into quarantine on disease grounds in a way which is clarified and expanded. Once again, I think the whole chamber would welcome this strengthening of the powers of quarantine officers. </PARA>
<PARA> One section of the new Bill which gave me some concern is the retraction of a situation which was achieved in 1979 whereby compensation was payable to those who had goods, including animals or plants, destroyed under the Act for disease reasons. Those arrangements were introduced in 1979 and were then justified, I thought properly, as a means of encouraging co-operation from owners and to facilitate prompt action in exotic disease eradication operations. Certainly the Senate Committee found that in relation to an outbreak of exotic disease within Australia there was an absolute need to have such compensation arrangements clearly understood by all persons operating within the agricultural community, including veterinary officers and the farming community in order that there would be no hesitation on their part in notifying a suspicion that such an exotic disease existed and so that they would be confident in doing so, knowing that they would be compensated for any destruction which would follow the confirmation that, indeed, such disease did exist. Therefore I was somewhat surprised initially to find that the provision for compensation for goods, including animals or plants destroyed when in quarantine was to be removed from the Act. The explanation given by the Government is that an importer of such animals or plants can insure against the risk of the animals or plants being found either to be diseased or to be a carrier of a disease, and that that insurable risk ought to be part of an importer's costs of bringing material into Australia. On balance, but only on balance, the Opposition has decided not to oppose this provision. </PARA>
<PARA> One notes that the Government has certainly not taken on the wrath of ordinary pet owners in Australia. Compensation will still be paid for cats or dogs that are brought into the country and are destroyed while in quarantine. Those who introduce materials for more commonly understood agricultural reasons will have to insure against the risk of destruction by the quarantine service. It should be noted, of course, that many, if not most, of the cats or dogs introduced into this country would not be household pets but would be imported by a business enterprise which was concerned to ensure that it had breeding strains which would enable it successfully to engage in commercial transactions in relation to those animals. So it is a little difficult to understand why the distinction should be drawn unless, as I have said, the Government thought it was not worth tempting the wrath of pet owners throughout Australia by doing away with compensation in that instance. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall deal very briefly with the question of coastal surveillance. I know that Senator Sibraa will deal with this matter by illustration of events within his knowledge. It is true that quite a number of unauthorised landings in Australia have been reported from time to time. Quite often they involve small fishing vessels from areas to the north of Australia. The powers of the quarantine service to deal with these intrusions have proved to be inadequate and in fact have been able to be legally more or less ignored or rebuffed. This is obviously an intolerable situation. The Bill goes some way to create a legal situation within which the powers of the quarantine service to deal with such intrusions are clarified and made firm. On the other hand, the question is whether surveillance will be adequate to alert the quarantine service to the fact that such an intrusion has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember very well that we on the Committee were shocked to have brought to our notice the instance of quarantine officers in or just out of Darwin who, after being notified of a possible intrusion by a vessel which had perhaps landed on a beach some miles from Darwin, were forced to hire a helicopter from a private contractor who landed them on the beach without a radio because there was not the weight capacity in the helicopter to enable them to take a radio with them. They were left there for some 36 hours before they were able to make contact once again with the private contractor who had gone off to fulfil other duties under the various arrangements for charters that he had already entered into. In other words, it is a question not only of legal power but also of an adequate surveillance mechanism and follow-up facilities. That will involve money being made available to the quarantine service. My anecdote was not meant to reflect on the skill or concern of the quarantine officers involved but on the inadequacy of the present provision of facilities to that service by the national Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am alerted by Senator Sibraa to the fact that at times the private helicopter is not available. I can imagine that in that instance the alleged intrusion would go without any inspection by Australian authorities. Of course, who is to say whether the intrusion is merely that of a fishing vessel which is harbouring on some beach, perhaps bringing onto the Australian coast a couple of chooks or some small animal which carry some disease, or whether it is by drug runners, refugees or some other persons? I am sure that Senator Sibraa will follow up this matter in his remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many Opposition senators are still of the view which finds expression within the Senate Committe report, that the location of quarantine services within the Commonwealth's administrative arrangements needs again to be seriously looked at by the Government. This matter is brought up from time to time. We acquired some support from the razor gang report which states at page 35 that policy matters in relation to quarantine should be left with the Department of Health for people and with the Department of Primary Industry for animals and plants. One would want some comments from the Minister about the exact intent and perhaps even the timetable behind that rather vague sentence. In other words, it was the contention of the Committee, as I remarked at the beginning of my speech, that because human disease introduced from abroad now manifests itself within the community and not at the quarantine barrier, so short are the travelling times from the lands where the disease might be present, the question of exotic disease control really becomes one of general community public health. In fact, the Commonwealth Department of Health has an overall policy role and, indeed, a managerial role in relation to the Fairfield Infectious Diseases Hospital for the extremely rare and uncommon exotic diseases which might be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to animal, plant and general quarantine the argument is strong for such matters to be handled by the Department of Primary Industry in a way which does not impair the integrity of the quarantine service. The lines of responsibility must be such that the head of the quarantine service within the Department of Primary Industry has direct access to the Minister and not be subject to a legitimate fear by some people within the community of pressures arising within that Department to do with the maintenance of our trading position vis-a-vis other countries. The integrity of such a service has to be assured and maintained. On balance, the Committee and, I believe most honourable senators, would take the view, as do most State departments of agriculture and the majority of members of the Australian Agricultural Council, that reponsibility should be within the Department of Primary Industry so that there is a comprehensive, integrated care for Australia's agriculture in relation to the possible introduction and spread of disease throughout the animal or plant population of Australia. I simply raise that matter. I note the amendment moved by the Opposition. I would perhaps not go as far as Senator Grimes went because there may be some operational areas in which State departments of agriculture could be usefully involved, as indeed they are in many instances. The Committee saw a good example of almost total identity of operational and Commonwealth responsibilities in the Northern Territory. The extent to which that can take place with the States is a matter for debate. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Opposition feels is that it would not be right for the Commonwealth under the razor gang report to transfer operational elements of administration of quarantine to the States without first making the larger administrative changes by shifting responsibility for animal, plant and general quarantine from the Department of Health to the Department of Primary Industry. I also affirm the Senate Committee's confidence in the integrity and concern of the officers presently within the Department of Health and engaged in the control and running of our quarantine service. Our proposal is simply to place that service within, as we see it, the more appropriate Commonwealth department. With those remarks, and while supporting the amendment, I once again emphasise that the Opposition very much welcomes this further improvement to the legal structure relating to our quarantine protection. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak in favour of the Quarantine Amendment Bill, and congratulate the Government upon its introduction. The Government is concerned mainly with the health quarantine station for the Cocos (Keeling) Islands but also with many other matters. Almost all the provisions are precisely in line with the report on the adequacy of quarantine measures by the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, which I had the privilege to chair. We have heard a quite detailed account from Senator Tate, who was a member of the Senate Committee. I believe that that investigation was the most exhaustive, lengthy and detailed investigation of quarantine that this country has ever seen. I am pleased to say that the Government has accepted almost all the recommendations contained in that report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The importance of quarantine to Australia cannot be overemphasised. It is of absolute importance to the export industries of our country. Although mining and other export industries are growing in importance, the rural exports of Australia are still worth, in round terms, $5000m a year. It takes only a small scare like the blue- tongue scare in Queensland recently, which turned out to be no threat at all to our rural industries, to persuade countries that import many of our products to ban the importation of those products for a long time. We had the ridiculous situation of the People's Republic of China, which was importing quite a lot of our wool, stopping its imports of wool from Australia, although the wool itself had no relationship whatsoever to the bluetongue disease. Not only stock directly affected by the outbreak of a serious disease, but also the whole agricultural export industry in Australia would be affected because of the suspicion which would be created in the minds of overseas countries in relation to the risks involved in importing our products. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the changes contained in this Bill are in line with the Senate Committee's report, and I do not intend to deal at any length with those changes. Senator Tate made the point that the Cocos Island facility is an important link in our chain of quarantine protection. He also made the point that the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory at Geelong is intrinsically tied up with the Cocos Island facility. Each member of the Senate Committee has encouraged the Government to complete the building of that facility at Geelong with all possible speed. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to address myself briefly to the amendment moved by the Opposition. I am sorry that Senator Grimes, who moved that amendment, did not consult his colleagues who were members of the Committee, because it is totally unrelated to the matters that I am sure his colleagues would have talked about. The amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that the maintenance of efficient and comprehensive quarantine arrangements is vital and that any transfer of remaining operational responsibilities to the states would jeopardise this and therefore should be opposed.'</PARA>
<PARA>There has not been any suggestion of moving the ultimate responsibilities for quarantine from the Commonwealth to the States. Senator Tate dealt at some length with the Review of Commonwealth Functions, and he quoted a paragraph from its report. It did not talk about the abrogation of responsibility by the Commonwealth in transferring quarantine matters to the States. </PARA>

<PARA> I raise now that one matter that has not been dealt with to my satisfaction by the Government. It concerns Cocos Island and the priorities committee. One of the recommendations that was made by my Committee-and I know it is only a small matter, but I consider it to be rather important-states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that access to a portion (say 50 per cent) of the Cocos Island Animal Quarantine Station should be offered to recognised Commonwealth and State government animal research establishments, and that an Expert Committee on Import Priorities be established to apportion the facility between those research establishments. </PARA>
<PARA>The last sentence of that recommendation is the important one. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee further recommends that access to the remaining portion of the facility be by strict order of application. </PARA>
<PARA>I briefly explain the reasons why the Committee came to that conclusion. We believe that there are research facilities and organisations and State and Commonwealth government breeding stations in Australia which need access to overseas genetic material, and we believe that a priorities committee could allocate the animals to those facilities. There will be a considerable demand on that Cocos Island facility by private inporters. And why not? It will be an expensive facility, and the importers will have to pay the full cost for the time that those animals spend at the Cocos Island station. I believe that that should be so. Why should the other taxpayers of Australia supplement that cost?</PARA>
<PARA> Imagine being a member of a review committee that decides the priorities first of all between varieties of animals. Who would say that it is more important to introduce a pig into Australia than it is a goat? Secondly, who would be game enough to make the decision that a particular breed of cattle is more important to Australia than another breed of cattle? Senator Archer is a very successful breeder of a particular breed of beef cattle in Tasmania. I am sure that he would say that his breed of animal is more important than other breeds. But we get conflicting views. We are told that there is a need in Australia for a different breed of cattle suited to the tropical areas. We have breeds of cattle that do very well in the tropics and I believe that the economic return for Australia would be greater if we could import for the more temperate zones breeds which are superior to the animals we have now. </PARA>
<PARA> That is only part of the argument. This review committee which has been established will not only have to do the things that I have suggested, but also decide between individual animals. I have been interested in genetics almost all of my life. I have spent my lifetime in stud sheep breeding. I know that to try to test animals overseas to determine which have the superior genetics is impossible. These animals need to be tested in Australia under local conditions. So this Government is placing the review committee in an impossible position in deciding which varieties of animals and which individual animals within a variety should be important to Australia. As I have said before, with the exception of a portion of the facility which should be devoted to research, the whole of that facility should be available according to strict order of application. </PARA>
<PARA> The details of the Bill have been covered in some detail by Senator Tate. I am sure that Senator McLaren, who was also a member of the Senate Committee will make a valuable contribution to the debate as well. The Committee was investigating an interesting subject. As I have said, we are pleased that the Government has adopted further of the recommendations contained in its report. I strongly commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The broad purpose of the Quarantine Amendment Bill 1981 is to incorporate the Cocos (Keeling) Islands into Australian quarantine arrangements so as to provide a secure off-shore quarantine station, to extend quarantine powers and activities provided for in the Act, to remove the liability of the Commonwealth to pay compensation for imported livestock and certain other classes of animals destroyed in accordance with the Act, where those animals have been in quarantine since importation. The Bill also draws together changes resulting from the decision to establish an off-shore quarantine station on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands which is expected to be completed in September this year, changes resulting from the 1979 findings of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources in its report on the adequacy of quarantine, and various other measures which the Government considers necessary to continue Australia's geographic isolation from many of the worst human, plant and animal health risks found in nearby and distant countries. Mass international air travel, Australia's participation in large volume international trade and the unauthorised landings in Australia of refugees and others have contributed to the growing quarantine risks that face this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I rise to speak briefly on this Bill because I feel strongly about the absence of an efficient, thorough, highly skilled coastal surveillance system, especially in northern Australia. The basic substance of the Bill is totally worthless if proper coastal surveillance measures are not enforced. Therefore, I strongly support the recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources in its report on the adequacy of quarantine which states:</PARA>
<PARA> That some aspects of the coastal surveillance program be reviewed immediately, particularly in regard to the training of observers, the need for staggered flight times and the provision of the necessary facilities to respond to surveillance sightings. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a shame that the Government has not seen fit to implement this recommendation by including it in the Bill. When one looks at the current coastal surveillance program, the importance of the Committee's recommendations become even more obvious. As Senator Grimes pointed out, the situation today in northern Australia is that coastal surveillance is carried out by private enterprise through a tender system. The ridiculous nature of this sytem is best described in an article in the Australian Financial Review of 13 April 1981 which referred to a dispute concerning which aircraft company should get the contract to patrol the coast. I seek leave to incorporate that article in Hansard. I have checked it with the relevant Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted,</PARA>
<PARA> The article read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>CONTRACT ROW HALTS PATROLS</PARA>
<PARA>By JOHN LOIZOU</PARA>
<PARA>THE three specially-equipped Nomad aircraft used to patrol about 500 kilometres of coastline north and east of Darwin have been grounded for the second time this year for want of a decision by either the Territory or Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The aircraft, which carry an observer, and patrol from Darwin to Bathurst and Melville Islands and as far east as Milingimbi, usually make three to four patrols a day. They have not been in the air since midnight in Friday . . . less than 24 hours after the crew of a Nomad spotted the first Indo-Chinese refugee boat to arrive off the Territory in two years. </PARA>
<PARA> That vessel has since been escorted into Darwin by the crew of a navy patrol boat. </PARA>
<PARA> The aircraft were first grounded in early February with the closure of Northern Airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> Northern Airlines wanted to sell its contract to patrol the coast to Transecutive, of Melbourne, a subsidiary of Edward Souery and Co Pty Ltd. The contract was awarded to Northern Airlines by the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Territory Government agreed to a 50-day probationary licence but the Nomads were grounded until Transport Australia and the Foreign Investment Review Board gave their approval. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then, however, the Territory Government has agreed that Ansett Airlines should inherit the major routes within the Territory formerly flown by Northern Airlines. It also agreed that Ansett should get the surveillance contract. </PARA>
<PARA> Transexecutive has objected and the Australian Government, which has ultimate authority as to who gets the contract, has yet to announce its decision. So the 12 pilots and 12 observers who crew the aircraft are having a rest and the eight engineers who maintain them are catching up with non-essential tasks. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of them worked for Northern Airlines, then Transecutive-now they believe they will work for Ansett. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile, the gap is being filled by Arnhem Air Charters, the company which flew the surveillance zone for two years, as its proprietor, Mr Ossie Osgood, says without 'missing a day' until the Australian Government stipulated that the Australian built Nomad had to be used. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EJ4">Senator SIBRAA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Northern Airlines, which was originally awarded the contract by the Federal Government, wanted to sell its contract to Transecutive but the Northern Territory Government wanted Ansett Airlines of Australia to get the contract. At the time that the article to which I have referred was written the three specially equipped Nomad aircraft used to patrol about 500 kilometres of coastline north and east of Darwin had been grounded for the second time in 1981 owing to this dispute. Even though the coast was being patrolled by another airline company, the whole tender system is obviously in need of some drastic changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The private enterprise nature of the system is itself an obstacle to an efficient coastal surveillance program. The airline company involved is determined to make a profit from the contract, which in turn leads to cost cutting measures, which can only reduce the airline's efficiency. I pose to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) and Government senators the question: Why would somebody, under this contract, fly an extra patrol if he thought that he had sighted something when really the whole basis of the contract is a profit motive? Also a matter of great concern to me is that private airline companies have no special security clearances for their employees such as those that exist for staff employed by the Department of Defence or the Northern Territory police if they carried out this surveillance work. Senator Tate referred to the possibility of people associated with drug running being able to infiltrate private companies that were carrying out surveillance. I believe it would be unlikely that anybody who had been associated in any way with drug running would be able to get a job in the Department of Defence or with the Northern Territory police. I think those two organisations would have much better internal security than any private firm that is carrying out surveillance work. </PARA>
<PARA> What is particularly ludicrous about coastal surveillance procedures to the north and east of Darwin is that surveillance is done on a five-day, eight-hour basis. I believe, therefore, no surveillance is carried out during the weekend. Recently I was working in Darwin on a Senate committee. Everyone in Darwin that I spoke to knew what time the planes flew and what routes they flew. Consequently one does not need to be a genius to work out that a person could land in Australia outside the surveillance times. It would not be very hard to find out the airline routes if a person wanted to come into Australia. When one learns of these facts it is amazing that so many people have been caught. The scope for the importation of prohibited goods, whether by boat or plane, is alarming. I will quote from the second reading speech of the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) in the House of Representatives. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> During coastal surveillance operations, a number of unauthorised landings in Australia have been reported. In the main, these breaches of quarantine legislation have been by foreign fishing vessels. These quarantine breaches by small craft in remote areas of Australia pose grave threats to the introduction of major exotic diseases. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on in the Minister's second reading speech, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Quarantine actions of this type have highlighted serious practical deficiencies in the relevant enforcement and penalty provisions of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister went on to detail new measures to enforce penalty provisions of the Act. That is all very well but the person who commits the offence must be caught first. Since the surveillance system works on a roster of eight hours a day and consists of a run down the coast and back, which everyone in Darwin seems to know about, I cannot see the Government using this Act very often to prosecute many people. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer again to the Minister's remarks as far as unauthorised landings are concerned. Not only should these unauthorised landings never occur but also the Minister has wisely chosen not to mention the number of unauthorised landings that are never reported because of the sloppy coastal surveillance procedures which I have already detailed. The ease of landing in Australia, or something coming very close to it, can be seen from a recent episode involving an Indonesian boat, supposedly supplying Indonesian fishing vessels, which was spotted very close to Darwin but was some hundreds of miles away from the fishing vessels that it was supposed to be supplying. I say 'supposed to be supplying' deliberately. The fact that it was hundreds of miles away from the fishing craft must raise great doubts about the real purpose of this boat being in that area. The fact that the supposed supply ship was so near to Darwin is a serious question but the events leading up to the searching of the boat raise even more serious questions about Australia's coastal security procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> After the boat was spotted attempts to board it were anything but swift and organised. I believe the Royal Australian Navy took eight hours to arrive at the site. I am not criticising the Navy. I realise that it was not possible for it to go directly to the Indonesian fishing boat because of the tides involved, the amount of time it took to get up steam to get out of Darwin and because of the reefs in the area. Those factors made it fairly arduous to reach this vessel. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Northern Teritory police then went to the area and they were the first to reach the Indonesian fishing vessel. They went to the area in a flat bottomed surfcat type boat. Even though when the Northern Territory police left Darwin to carry out this mission the seas were not particularly rough I believe that their lives could have been placed at risk in this exercise because they did not have the right type of boat that was needed to carry out the surveillance. Senator Tate mentioned the fact that a helicopter had been hired and used in the past for surveillance purposes but on this occasion the helicopter could not be hired because for a start it belonged to a private company and further it was undergoing repairs. What a farcical situation this is. This surveillance work is work for the Department of Defence. It is work for a proper coast guard. It is not work for the Northern Territory police. Even though I realise a very good argument could be made for the Northern Territory police having helicopters it may be that if the police had helicopters they could be required to be used in times of flood or when searching for a missing person in the Territory. Of course there could be instances of Northern Territory police helicopters not being available for coastal surveillance work. That is the main reason I say this sort of work should be the work of the Department of Defence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No wonder we have so many foreign fishing vessels coming into Australian waters. They are fairly secure in the knowledge that our coastal surveillance procedures are totally inadequate. I think this has been proved by the fact that refugee boats have been able to turn up very close to Darwin and very close to the Australian coastline completely unannounced. Therefore I was stunned to read the so-called razor gang's statement on quarantine operations which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will also explore with State governments the appropriateness and feasibility of transferring to the States the remaining Commonwealth operational elements of the administration of quarantine. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister: Does this mean that the Federal Government will be taking even less interest in coastal surveillance than it does at present? I believe it is imperative that the Federal Government take full responsibility for proper coastal surveillance procedures. I repeat, coastal surveillance is not a job for profit making, cost cutting private enterprises. It is a job for the Federal Government to undertake seriously and efficiently or else, as I said at the beginning of my speech, the quarantine regulations under debate tonight might just as well be thrown out of the window. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on the Quarantine Amendment Bill I concur with what my colleagues Senator Sibraa and Senator Tate have said. Senator Tate and I were members of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources which inquired into quarantine matters. I am somewhat disturbed to say the least that it has taken such a long time for the Government to introduce legislation to put into law some of the recommendations that Committee made. Its report was tabled in this Parliament on 21 November 1979. Quite a lengthy period has passed since that date. The legislation is only now before the Parliament. I was reminded by Senator Sibraa, who spoke about coastal surveillance, of the occasion the Committee visited Thursday Island. I was astounded at the very slipshod method of coastal surveillance in that part of Australian waters. We saw a coastal surveillance plane taking off one day. The two observers on that plane were a couple of school teachers on their honeymoon. They were supposed to be looking for people involved in the smuggling of drugs or whatever else might be coming into the country. I leave it to the imagination of honourable senators what that couple would be doing when they are on their honeymoon. I am sure they would not be looking for any contravention of the law. That is an illustration of our slipshod coastal surveillance methods. My colleague Senator Sibraa has outlined a few of the other matters which were brought to his attention on a recent visit to Darwin. These sorts of things need to be tightened up very rigidly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the Committee was visiting Darwin we also saw some of the hulks that are beached in the backwaters of Darwin harbour where the boat people arrived. The hulks are still there. They have not been destroyed. They have to be fumigated regularly at great expense to the Australian community. When I asked some of the officers there why the hulks were not destroyed I was told there was some conflict with foreign policy, that we might offend some government, the owner, the people who have bought the boats or those who charged these so-called refugees for passage to Australia. I was told that the Australian Government might find itself in some international problem if it were to put a bomb under these boats to destroy them. In my view, as I said to the officers there, this is what ought to be done with them and it ought to be done pretty quickly if it has not already been done. I have not been to Darwin recently to have a look at this area but perhaps during the Committee stage I might ask a question of the Minister for attention by his officers as to whether those hulks are still there and if so what is the cost to the Australian taxpayers of having them fumigated regularly, and what risk do they still pose to the Australian community. Irrespective of whether the Government may tread on the toes of some foreign country, in my view these hulks ought to be destroyed, no matter who owns them. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Thomas mentioned the National Animal Health Laboratory at Geelong. As I have said in this Parliament on many occasions, the laboratory was a brainchild of the Whitlam Labor Government. When I was at Geelong just a few weeks ago with a Senate committee inquiring into the aluminium industry we passed very close to the laboratory. I was very pleased to see that it is nearing completion but I was disappointed to think that it is not yet operational. Had it not been for the monetary strictures placed on the construction of this laboratory by this Government when it came into office the laboratory would now have been fuly operational and we would have been seeing the benefits from it. But because of the financial strictures placed on it by this Government in its wisdom-a very poor sort of wisdom in my view-that laboratory is not yet operational and we are now witnessing some scientists-I do not agree with them-putting the point of view that this establishment will not be of any great benefit to Australia. I do not know why they say that because all of the people with expertise to whom I have spoken have pointed out that it will be of great benefit to Australia. I think in time to come the primary industries of this country in particular, will be very proud of the laboratory and very grateful that the Whitlam Labor Government had the foresight to initiate the construction of that laboratory. </PARA>
<PARA> At the beginning of my remarks I made some criticism of the Government for its delay in introducing this Bill. I want to quote from the Adelaide Sunday Mail of 20 January 1980, some 15 or 16 months ago. The article was written by a journalist by the name of Kevin Love. The articles is headed 'Vets urges action on imported diseases'. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The nation's veterinary surgeons have urged the Federal Government to take urgent measures to protect 'the health and financial well-being of every living Australian' under stricter quarantine measures. </PARA>
<PARA>That was said way back 16 months ago and we have this Bill in the Senate only this evening. As I said, it has taken a jolly long time. Dr Fulton was the veterinarian quoted by Mr Kevin Love. Dr Fulton was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . his organisation's 2500 members hoped the Government would move quickly to implement the full recommendations of a Government Standing Committee report on the Adequacy of Australian Quarantine Resources. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Fulton went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the report, tabled in the House of Representatives in the final week of last year's Parliamentary session, ranked in importance with reports on Australia's future military defence. </PARA>
<PARA>How right he was because quarantine is of great importance to this country, not only to the human race but also to the agricultural industry on which we depend so greatly. We in the Labor Party are fully aware of that importance. I am disappointed that while the Minister in his second reading speech said that this Bill is embodying most of the important recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee it does not go far enough in my view. Once again while one arm of the Government is doing one thing another arm of the Government is doing something else. As I said in the Senate yesterday, it is quite apparent that the Government's left arm does not know what its right arm is doing because a recommendation in the razor gang's report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will also explore with State governments the appropriateness and feasibility of transferring to the States the remaining operational elements of the administration of quarantine. That would leave policy matters in relation to quarantine with the Department of Health for people and the Department of Primary Industry for animals and plants. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, that is where it ought to be. This Bill contains no real mention of animal quarantine being given to the Department of Primary Industry. That is why I say that one of the two arms of government-the people on the razor gang, and the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) is one of them-is not taking cognisance of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources. I do not know how many other Bills which come before this Parliament will be at odds with the recommendations and determinations of the razor gang's report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee made a recommendation on the structure of the Australian Agricultural Health Service. In its report it set out a suggested organisational structure by way of diagram. I have shown this diagram to the Hansard officer who was at the table earlier. He said to me that he did not think there would be any great problem in having that diagram incorporated in Hansard. If it is possible I should like incorporated in Hansard the one page diagram setting out the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee in regard to the Agricultural Health Service and the suggested organisational structure. If it is incorporated in Hansard people can be aware of what the Committee recommended in relation to the setting up of the Australian Agricultural Health Service. The recommendation of the Committee is somewhat different from the recommendation in the razor gang report that the Government will explore with State governments the appropriateness and feasibility of transferring to the States the remaining operational elements of the administration of quarantine. In view of what the Minister said in his second reading speech I think the Government should have put something concrete in this Bill so that the Committee's recommendations in this sphere are in actual fact put into operation. I seek leave to incorporate that one page diagram in Hansard. </PARA>

The Hansard official at the desk at that time said that there should be no problem with its incorporation because the Government Printer has printed this particular diagram previously and the size of the page to be incorporated is about the same size as the page of the Hansard record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point which attracted my attention in the Minister's second reading speech was his statement that clause 35 of the Bill would insert a new section. The Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I draw the attention of honourable senators to clause 35 of the Bill. This clause inserts a new section which relates to the provision of quarantine information to travellers to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on that certain things are intercepted at international airports. He raised a most important point when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, proposed section 74AA requires the masters of all vessels travelling to Australia, including aircraft, to advise everyone on board of our quarantine requirements. The content and form of such advice are to be in accordance with approvals of the Director of Quarantine. </PARA>
<PARA>With the Minister having said that, I hope that the Government does something to police this new provision. I have said in this Parliament previously and at the inquiry of the Committee that on several occasions on my return to Australia from overseas I have filled in the necessary forms to indicate that I have visited farms. I have visited poultry farms, pig farms and cattle farms overseas because of my intense interest in agriculture. When I returned to Australia through Sydney airport on one occasion, the officer looked over the counter and said, 'Your boots look pretty clean, off you go'. That was after I filled in the form. </PARA>

As I say, I have had personal experience of this not being done. It is just not good enough. If I and many other people to whom I have spoken are prepared to advise that we have been on farms but then are not put through the fumigation procedures, what is the position with people who do not fill in the forms properly? How many people come into this country and put our agricultural industries at risk?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My remarks are backed up by Press reports of recent times in which there is reference to very minimal fines. I am pleased to see under this legislation that the fines have been increased. In my view, no fine can be too great for those people who put primary industry in Australia at risk. An extract from the Brisbane Courier-Mail of 13 September indicates that a Mr Evans, SM, in handing down a reserved decision in a case involving a number of botanical specimens, fined a man $200 and ordered him to pay $250 professional costs and $18 court costs. That is a very small amount to fine any person for bringing into Australia specimens that could have spelled the death knell of our cereal industry, one of the mainstays of Australia's primary industry. Yet, this person got away with only a minimal fine being imposed. It concerns me how this material gets into Australia in the first place. There is not proper surveillance and there is not proper supervision. An article in the Adelaide Advertiser of 31 October is headed: 'Smuggled sausages cost wife $261'. That is another example of people being able to get things into the country. I am only referring now to the people caught. A report in the Brisbane Courier-Mail of 13 December states:</PARA>
<PARA> The quarantine division's senior port inspector for Queensland, Mr Max Schmidt, yesterday showed a storeroom of prohibited imports at the Eagle Farm quarantine station. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have said, these are only the goods that have been found. What about all the goods smuggled into this country which have not been found? The article went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Last year, there was a 70 per cent rise in containerised shipping and a 37 per cent increase in airport workloads in Brisbane, but no additions to quarantine staff. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government was falling down on the job. Despite the fact that we have a big increase in containerised shipping and a 37 per cent increase in airport work loads, there has been no increase in staff to survey this extra quantity of goods coming into the country. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA> A big staff increase was expected next year but, for now, it was a case of working a great deal of overtime. </PARA>
<PARA>After the report of the razor gang I am worried that instead of there being an increase in staff, there probably will be a decrease which will put primary industry at risk, all because of the financial cuts brought upon us by this Government. The Brisbane Sunday Mail of 14 December reports:</PARA>
<PARA> A 120-tonne consignment of South American nuts has been impounded by Federal quarantine officials at a wharf at Newstead, Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA>How did 120 tonnes of nuts get into the country? That consignment should have been looked at before a permit was given to import it-before the nuts were put on the vessel. Probably it was like a great heap of sorghum which we saw in a wire netting enclosure in Brisbane some years ago. A barge owner brought it into Australia and it was lying around for in excess of 12 months because the departments concerned were fighting between themselves in regard to whose responsibility it was to destroy it. For all I know, it may still be there. This is where the quarantine system in this country breaks down. </PARA>

Because the departments could not decide who would pick up the tab for destroying the sorghum, it was still there. These things need to be tidied up. I could quote ad infinitum reports of these cases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another matter I mention is a Press statement which was issued on 12 May-just this week-relating to an Italian woman in Adelaide who brought in seeds and potatoes in her luggage. She was fined a miserable $140. What was her excuse? She told the court she had not understood the law and that the person on the aircraft who had helped her to fill out the Customs form said nothing to her about plants or seeds. If one can believe the woman-I prefer not to believe her-there again is a breakdown in communications between Customs officials, quarantine officials, and the people in charge of the aircraft. She did not say whether it was one of our aircraft or an overseas aircraft. These are things to which we have to give due consideration. The sooner it is done the sooner primary industries in this country will be fully safeguarded. </PARA>
<PARA> A joint Press statement by Mr MacKellar, the Commonwealth Minister for Health, and Mr Moore, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs makes astounding reading. It is headed 'Children and parents asked to find hamsters' and states:</PARA>
<PARA> Children and parents throughout Australia are being asked to help Quarantine and Customs Officers track down two varieties of rodents-hamsters and gerbils-which have been smuggled illegally into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>How do these live animals get in here? There must not be strict surveillance. That is the only way in which they could get in here. That Press statement was put out under the dateline of 28 April. Another news release from the Minister for Health, Mr MacKellar, under the dateline of 6 May-last week-is headed 'Minister offers compensation to aid rodent eradication campaign'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> People who hand in hamsters and gerbils which they have acquired recently will receive a refund of the purchase price, the Minister for Health, the Hon. M. J. R. MacKellar, said today. </PARA>
<PARA>It will not be much assistance to Australian primary industry just because the Minister for Health has decided he will pay some reward to people who hand in hamsters and gerbils. He might get a few. The refund will provide pocket money for some child, but what about all those which they do not capture?

<PARA> I received a letter from a person who gave evidence to the Committee. He is the only person who has contacted me as a member of that Committee and expressed some concern about what has happened. It is Mr Murray Fenner of 30 Keyes Street, Ashburton, Melbourne, Victoria. He is a pigeon fancier and breeds racing pigeons. He referred to some of the chapters in our report dealing with pigeons and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. He quotes chapter 6 and page 37 of the report, under the heading 'Animal Quarantine'. He goes on to quote also chapter 7, and the comments on 'the Inadequcy of Existing Quarantine Facilities.' I wish to quote only part of this man's letter because I think the Government ought to take cognisance of what he suggests to assist these people who engage in the racing pigeon sport in Australia. Whilst some people might think it is not an important matter, it is very important to the people who are engaged in this sport. I know Mr President runs feedstock mills and no doubt he sells a lot of pellets to racing pigeon owners. It is a very lucrative business for many people. This man is concerned. He states in this letter:</PARA>
<PARA> From the extracts I have quoted may I ask you some questions and put forward what, I believe, is a practical proposition in enabling safe importation of racing pigeons. </PARA>
<PARA> 1. Are you in agreement with me that it is better that birds should be legally imported so that they can be subjected to the most thorough veterinary checks, and this would almost eliminate birds imported illegally and not subjected to such tests?</PARA>
<PARA>I agree wholeheartedly with him. Having been a poultry farmer, I know the havoc that can be wreaked in Australia's poultry industry through birds coming in illegally. </PARA>

<PARA> 2. What has been done to improve the situation, as the Senate inquiry suggested it should, as a result of tabling the findings before parliament?</PARA>
<PARA>Belatedly, something is being done now. We are debating this legislation. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> 3. As you may or may not be aware Australian pigeon fanciers sent some of their best birds to an international pigeon show called the Tokyo Olympiad. Due to a mistake by Japanese officials they were sent back to Australia. On arriving back they were summarily destroyed by our quarantine officials at the airport. They were not, as your committee suggested, subjected to veterinary checks as the existing importation ban does not require for the existence of Newcastle Disease to be found. Don't you think that this should not be the case?</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly, I agree that veterinary tests should have been done before the birds were destroyed. Had the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Station been in operation-and in Committee I want to ask when it will come into operation and what facilities will be available-these people may not have lost their best racing pigeons. Mr Fenner then puts a proposition:</PARA>
<PARA> I have a proposition which I think would enable racing pigeons to be introduced through the Cocos Island Quarantine Station into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The major source of overseas racing pigeons would come from England, Belgium and Holland. After purchase they could be presented for examination at such places as the Central Veterinary Laboratory at Weybridge, Surrey, England. If they pass through with no evidence of disease then they could be imported and isolated at the Cocos Island Quarantine Station. There the pigeons would be subjected to virological and serological test, which I am told, if completed on a regular basis over several weeks could accurately determine whether a pigeon had Newcastle Disease. In conjunction with these tests the pigeons would be kept in isolation with young chickens during their first moult for a period of 3-4 months. If, after all tests were conducted and there being no evidence of Newcastle Disease, then they could be safely imported to Australia. All the expenses incurred in ensuring that the pigeons had not got the disease would be payable by the importer concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope you read and take seriously this letter and let me know what your opinion is and what can be done?</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with what Mr Murray Fenner has said, and I hope that when the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Station becomes operational there will be facilities not only for the isolation of racing pigeons but also for the isolation of breeding stock for the broiler industry and the laying industry in Australia. I have much pleasure in supporting the Bill before the House and the amendment moved by Senator Grimes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, my intervention will not be lengthy. I did not have the opportunity to serve on the all-powerful committee of which Senator Sibraa, Senator McLaren and Senator Thomas are members. However, from the extensive evidence on marine science taken by the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment, it is quite obvious that Australia is on the threshold of a great expansion in its fishing industry. The danger-and this confirms what my colleagues have said about quarantine fudging-is that we are going to permit many foreign trawlers to operate within our 200-mile zone. Whatever may have been said in the past about Indonesian and Taiwanese vessels and their pirate operations, now that it will be legal for them to enter our 200-mile zone there is added danger, and more vigilance will be needed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wonder whether those who have talked about surveillance have considered the cost factor involved in the United States idea of using the small airships of the 1930s for surveillance purposes. I know that the cost is much less than that for other types of aircraft, and I know that the idea has been discussed. However, for some reason the Government has remained silent on it. We all know of the humiliating situations that have occurred with our own patrol boats being outdistanced and outpowered by foreign fishing vessels. I want to develop a little the question of how effective our liaison with the Department of Primary Industry will be. No doubt it will keep a register of the various foreign trawlers who are potential transgressors of our quarantine laws. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer further to the matter of deterrence. I appreciate that section 20 of the principal Act provides for punitive action to be taken. Reference has been made tonight by Senator McLaren to the vessels of boat people and to undue sensitivity being exhibited in regard to offending particular countries. I believe that at times we tend to overdo such sensitivity. These are the very people to whom we have extended such sanctuary. I do not believe that Australia, as a paid-up member of the United Nations, need kowtow to anyone. </PARA>
<PARA> If a registry were prepared by the Department of Primary Industry, I ask the Minister how effective would be the liaison between the relevant bodies at any given time. With such a registry it would be possible to learn what foreign trawlers were on various portions of our coastline. I am reminded by what Senator McLaren has said about bird quarantine of a case which occurred in the Gosford or Wyong area. I will not mention the name of the alleged culprit or culprits but I believe it began with the letter 'M'. In that case many birds were destroyed and there was talk of court action being taken to obtain compensation. On an earlier occasion during the sitting of the Estimates Committees-I did not have the opportunity to bring up the subject at the most recent series of sittings-I directed a question on the matter to one of the advisers of the Minister for Health. I was told that it fell in a grey area. I am wondering what was the outcome in the case of the birds in question, whose owner claimed that he was the innocent victim of circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to pursue a little further the question of the imposition of punitive measures. On numerous occasions, both inside and outside Australia, people have engaged in illegal bird importation or exportation. I am curious to know how effective is the liasion with the Department of Foreign Affairs in regard to having cancelled the Australian passports of persons who are convicted of such offences. Recently, during the sittings of Estimates Committee D I asked the representatives of the Department of Foreign Affairs about that situation as it affected convicted drug runners. The officers were not positive as to whether the Federal or State law enforcement bodies provided the Department with the names of offenders so that their passports could be confiscated. That would be a very effective means of limiting the activities of people engaged in such profitable but illegal sidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> In light of expected foreign fishing operations within the 200-mile zone, I ask: How effective is liasion expected to be with the Department of Primary Industry and, for that matter, with the Royal Australian Navy? Is it contemplated that an additional acquisition of patrol boats will take place? Also what more can we do to further the cancellation of passports of wrongdoers, not merely in repect of bird smuggling but right across the board?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In common with all honourable senators who have preceded me, I welcome the second reading debate on the Quarantine Amendment Bill, which I will be supporting. Most of the proposals in the Bill-they are substantial-flow from the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources inquiry into quarantine matters. As a member of that Committee, I am even more happy to see that our recommendations have been implemented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take this opportunity not to address the precise clauses of the Bill, all of which I support, but rather to note that quarantine can be improved by means other than the use of direct legislation. I refer, for instance, to better consultation with the States. In the administrative field even bigger steps towards effective quarantine measures can be taken. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer briefly to three areas: The report of a fortnight ago which followed the Review of Commonwealth Functions, and especially page 35 thereof; contingency plans in various primary industry areas; and the importation of aquarium fish. These three vital areas, in which quarantine is important, do not depend on new legislation being brought before this Parliament or upon any amendment being made to the Quarantine Act. Rather, they require effective consultation by the Commonwealth with the States to ensure that the procedures followed are totally adequate and well prepared. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation No. 34 of the Senate Standing Committee states that detailed contingency plans should be discussed publicly allowing full debate and involvement of those affected by the plans. Recommendation No. 35 states that the Bureau of Animal Health should take the initiative in organising exercises to test the efficiency of contingency plans. In the event of an outbreak of an exotic disease in Australia can we be sure that the industry, the State authorities and Commonwealth authorities are fully prepared to eradicate and limit that outbreak?</PARA>
<PARA> I am still not convinced that there are adequate contingency plans for each primary industry in Australia. There are in the poultry industry. This very cohesive industry has discussed this matter with State authorities and worked it out very carefully. But I have yet to be persuaded that there has been adequate consultation with members of the beef industry in all States and that there is a clear line of action in the tragic event of, say, foot and mouth disease occurring in one area of the industry. This is not a matter for legislation. It is an urgent matter for administrative action. It requires consultation with the States. Whilst the Commonwealth is responsible through its quarantine provisions to keep exotic diseases out, the eradication of any outbreak is the responsbility of the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area which I wish to deal with relates to acquarium fish. For over three years the Australian Fisheries Council has discussed ways of improving the procedures and standards within Australia for the importation of aquarium fish. The current pitch of this debate has come to a disagreement by some of the States on the list of fish species which the Commonwealth is prepared to accept. At the Australian Fisheries Council meeting which was held last September in Darwin the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) and the Minister for Science and the Environment (Mr Thomson) both indicated their support for a quote long list of fish species that could be safely imported into Australia without damage to indigenous species and without the danger of exotic disease being carried by these fish. </PARA>
<PARA> The aquarium fish importation industry is a very responsible and representative industry. For all of these years it has been most co-operative in discussions with the government authorities in determining a revised list. It has been able to convince Commonwealth Ministers that the list ought to be approved. I am afraid that some very conservative State public servants have been able to advise State Ministers that a very much more restricted list-only 100 species rather than 400 species-be the list that can be approved for importation of aquarium fish species. I believe that it is time for this matter to be exposed in this Parliament and not just to be tucked away in a small agenda item to be discussed by the Australian Fisheries Council so that the consultations which have been so thorough and good between the industry and the Commonwealth can now be accepted by the States. </PARA>
<PARA> My final point relates to the Review of Commonwealth Functions. Not only will the Government now be exploring with the States the appropriateness and feasibility of transferring to the States the remaining Commonwealth operational elements-I stress the words 'operational elements'-of the administration of quarantine but also the Government has indicated that the responsibility for quarantine policy matters relating to animals and plants will be transferred to the Department of Primary Industry. This major remaining recommendation of the Senate Committee now appears to have been acted upon. I welcome that. I believe that the superintendence of policy for quarantine will be better placed with the Department of Primary Industry. The operational elements of quarantine will be transferred to and administered by the States. This is only underlining the important State role in the present operational elements of quarantine. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course this matter is directly the subject of the Opposition amendment, which was initiated not in this chamber but in the House of Representatives. The amendment is inappropriate and is not supported by honourable senators on both sides. The Opposition amendment has been not well thought through and is, in fact, in total contradistinction to the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee. I think it is in opposition to what is good practice in maintaining quarantine operations. I take the opportunity not only of supporting the Bill but also of stressing, in the three examples I have given, the important, vital and urgent administrative matters that I believe must still be undertaken by the Commonwealth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I think you and I are the only two members of the Senate who are not experts on quarantine matters! I thank honourable senators for the contributions they have made in what has been a remarkably well informed and constructive debate. I will return to that aspect before I conclude my remarks. A large number of matters, some of quite a technical nature, have been raised. I hope that I will be able to respond on some particular matters individually to honourable senators later. I will have to get some extra information. If I do not cover some of the important matters in my speech perhaps honourable senators will raise them in the Committee stage. I hope that honourable senators accept that where particular questions have been put I will try to make information available later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of coastal surveillance has to be covered in my response as a number of honourable senators have expressed concern about its extent and adequacy. The facts show that aerial surveillance is not carried out on a five-day basis; at present seven day a week surveillance is carried out. The operations take place during daylight hours and finish in time for a daily report to be submitted. They are carried out 365 days a year, subject only to the limitations of weather. Since the reference of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources to the predictability of the routes and times of coastal surveillance aircraft-this important matter has been raised by honourable senators-substantial flexibility has been built into the system over 11 of the 12 sectors flown. The opportunities for variations in routes between Darwin and Kununurra, which is the 12th sector, are very limited because of the coastal configuration. It should be noted that no coastal surveillance system-not even that of the United States Coastguard-can intercept all possible unauthorised landings. But the quarantine task is to detect any unauthorised landings and to respond as quickly as possible. This is done. Nevertheless, the points that have been made by honourable senators during the conduct of this most notable Senate inquiry and in the debate tonight are taken on board. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Grimes, Senator Sibraa and Senator McLaren talked about the quality and extent of coastal surveillance. These comments formed part of the valuable content of the Senate report. These comments were something to which the Government had to respond even before the Committee's response came into the Parliament. I will not dwell on this matter. If there are matters relating to aircraft surveillance on which I need to respond I will come back to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish now to talk about the matter of training. Senator McLaren drew attention to coastal surveillance observers and I think it is proper that I respond to that matter. Since the time of the Senate Committee report, training has been substantially improved under the auspices of the Department of Transport which is responsible for the co-ordination of coastal surveillance and Department of Transport officers have been outposted to monitor the performance and to attend to training. That is progress. Whilst this does not guarantee that every observer performs in a first class way at all times, there is little doubt that the efficiency and performance of observers has improved substantially. I say again that that is as a result of observations, suggestions and contributions made from within this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer briefly to Senator Tate's observation on the resources available for coastal surveillance. The total coastal surveillance program is under review by the Government during 1981. This review which will include the consideration of resource adequacy-the point made by Senator Tate-is before the Government. It should be noted that despite shortcomings which have emerged the coastal surveillance program has become an integral part of Australia's quarantine protective framework. There may be scope for improved efficiency and effectiveness. This was foreshadowed by the Government decision that a thorough ongoing review should be undertaken. It is actually implicit in that decision that there could be improvements in the performance. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other surveillance matter was raised by Senator Mulvihill and it related to the question of patrol boats. Patrol boats in the coastal surveillance program are mainly used in fisheries work but they are available also, where appropriate, for quarantine responses. At present nine naval patrol boats are available for coastal surveillance and response actions. The disposition of new patrol boats now coming in to service is a matter for the Department of Defence. I think they would be used in the coastal surveillance program. There were a number of other matters. I hope to be able to respond to particular questions that remain unanswered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tate asked a number of other questions relating to the Senate Committee's recommendations 42 and 43. Those recommendations deal with access to a portion of the Cocos (Keeling) Island animal quarantine station. I will come back to that matter. Honourable senators might raise any matters to which I should respond during the Committee stage of the Bill. The only other thing upon which I would like to comment briefly is the amendment which has been moved. I wish to emphasise what Senator Teague has said, that the Government is committed to a strong and efficient quarantine service. This is really demonstrated by the comprehensive Bill before the Senate. We want a service which must continue to play an effective and major role in Australia's general, social and economic well being. No decision will be made by the Government to weaken the quarantine service or compromise the quarantine controls upon which we rely so heavily. In fact the Senate Committee's report was welcomed by the Government, as honourable senators would be aware. This was made abundantly clear in the Government's response which was tabled in the Senate in September 1980. The response indicated acceptance of substantially all of the Senate Committee recommendations. It is important to note that the Senate Committee strongly endorsed the long established practice of delegation of animal and plant operational quarantine functions to the States. The Committee states on page (vii) of the summary of its report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The delegated role of the States in undertaking the operational role in respect of plant and animal quarantine has been very successful and should be continued. </PARA>
<PARA>That was part of the report of the Senate Committee. In view of my previous point, it must be regarded as totally responsible and in accordance with the spirit of the Senate Committee report, at least to go ahead and examine the feasibility of extending an arrangement which the Senate Committee so heartily endorsed. I could give other references from the report which are along the same line and which make the same point. I think it sufficient to say that those arguments, combined with those advanced by Senator Teague, indicate that the Government does not wish to accept this amendment but wishes to pick up the spirit of all the speeches that there should be a strong and effective quarantine service. It only remains for me, in commending the Bill, to pay tribute to all members of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources who contributed to the report and to say that it has been a most notable contribution to Senate committee reports. I pay tribute to the Chairman, Senator Thomas, and hope that the acceptance in this Bill of substantial portions of that report and the extension of an effective quarantine service will meet with the approval with most honourable senators. I commend the Bill.</PARA>

We have some difficulties with the practicality of the proposal. I am advised that it is difficult. Senator McLaren asked other questions in relation to bird quarantine which I am in a position to answer. There is a total prohibition now on avian material imports and a proposal is now being developed for avian material quarantine facilities on Torrens Island.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a number of occasions this year in the Senate I have raised problems relating to invalid pensions in Queensland. I consider it is necessary to bring this matter forward again tonight because I am concerned that the situation is getting out of hand. Whilst the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) has expressed his concern at the matter which I have raised, I do not believe that action, at least effective action, has been taken to overcome these problems. There are two distinct problems relating to invalid pensions in Queensland. Apparently, both have resulted from administrative changes. The first relates to delays in processing invalid pension applications. I have been advised that these applications were previously determined by a local Commonwealth medical officer. Now they have to go through the senior medical officer of the Commonwealth Department of Health. That is, all invalid pension applications in Queensland are determined by one person.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I first raised this matter, the Minister advised me that over 700 invalid pension claims have been awaiting medical examination in Queensland for over two months. From remarks that have been made to me, I believe that this may be merely the tip of the iceberg. From my experience, I know that the waiting period is much longer than two months. Six months or more seems to be more common. </PARA>
<PARA> The second problem relates to the delay in hearing appeals against the departmental decision not to grant an invalid pension. The situation with appeals has recently changed so that appeals are no longer forwarded to the Department of Social Security, but to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. Medical officers were to be appointed to the Appeals Tribunal. This has happened in all other states but, to my knowledge, in Queensland the Department seems to be having trouble recruiting a medical officer. As a result, appeals are being pigeon-holed pending a medical officer's appointment. These delays in both areas are causing both financial and emotional problems. I have received many complaints about these delays. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall mention some cases. One man applied for invalid pension in October 1980, six months ago. Whilst he is eligible for an alternative benefit-sickness benefit-this is being paid at reduced rate because he has a small amount of other income. Income tests for sickness benefit and invalid pensions are quite different. Whereas his separate income now reduces his sickness benefit quite considerably, he would probably be able to receive a full invalid pension. At present, because of the delay, he is also missing out on certain fringe benefits. Another man retired on grounds of invalidity approximately 10 months ago applied for an invalid pension. His application was rejected and he submitted an appeal. This appeal is now gathering dust as the Tribunal waits indefinitely for a medical practitioner. This man is not eligible for any sickness benefit because his wife is working. One man told me he had been waiting for two years. He first applied for an invalid pension in April 1979. In April 1980 he submitted an appeal. He is still waiting for the result of that appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> I also relate the problems facing a woman in Queensland who has a handicapped daughter who attends a subnormal school. Her daughter recently turned 16 years of age. She applied for an invalid pension 12 weeks ago and is still waiting. For some reason that I cannot determine at this stage, she is no longer receiving a handicapped child's allowance. The mother has outlined to me the costs associated with keeping her daughter at a special school. Financially, it is very difficult for this family. When I spoke to departmental officers about this, I was told that this girl was not eligible for sickness benefit because she was still at school. Thus I suggest to the Minister that here is at least one case of quite significant disadvantage. Earlier today I telexed the Director of the Department of Social Security in Brisbane to see whether he could grant a special benefit to this girl in the meantime. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I find the problem in Queensland at the moment to be absolutely intolerable. The Minister must realise that in some cases, people are not eligible for an alternative benefit. In other cases, the alternative benefit is not as satisfactory as an invalid pension. We must not forget the stress that these long delays put on the applicant or the appellant. I mentioned to my Whip earlier this evening that I would be raising this matter and I believe that a message was passed to the Minister. If the Minister has been able to find any further information about how this problem will be rectified in Queensland in the meantime, I will be happy to hear it. If nothing has yet been done I urge the Minister to ensure that the problem is rectified as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was given notice that Senator Colston would be speaking on the adjournment and no more than that. I am not sure where responsibility for the deficiency in information lies. That does not really matter because I must admit that when I heard late this evening that he would be speaking I assumed that he would be speaking on this matter, which he has raised, I think, twice before on the adjournment. He has raised two distinct problems.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think once on the adjournment and once by question. But the matter has certainly been raised in the Senate before. It is a matter which I have indicated to the Senate before that certainly has had my personal attention. With respect to the delays in processing applications, my understanding is that the delays are essentially occurring not in the Department of Social Security but in the Department of Health. That is, of course, of no consolation either to the applicants or to Senator Colston and I do not put that forward as a reply. It is true that the requirement now is that these matters be seen by a senior medical officer or a senior officer of the Department of Health. This is the procedure which has been followed for some time now with a view to having a uniform assessment of these applications. It is a change in procedure which, I am sure, is a wise one, but in the case of Queensland it certainly has led to some difficulty and some backlog.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The last time when I looked at this was, I think, a matter of a day ago, before I had noticed that it was coming up on the adjournment debate. My latest advice is that the Department of Health is working to obtain another position in Queensland to ensure that these cases can be cleared more expeditiously. It being late in the evening, I have not had an opportunity to speak either to Mr MacKellar or to Mr Viner on the matter, but I think some action should be taken to try to expedite that attempt by the Department of Health to better equip itself to deal with the backlog that has been mentioned. When the matter came before me yesterday, I sought a letter from my Department to the relevant Minister to add my voice to the request; so, the matter is receiving attention at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the question of appeals is concerned, I think that I have already put the position before the Senate. There was a difficulty in Queensland in obtaining the appointment of a medical practitioner to the appeals tribunal. That difficulty arose from the levels of remuneration which were payable to medical members of those tribunals, which levels were somewhat below the levels paid to medical practitioners on other similar tribunals. To get around that difficulty, the matter was sent off to the Renumeration Tribunal. I think one or two weeks ago-I think it was the day of the hearing of Estimates Committee H, and certainly within the last fortnight-the Remuneration Tribunal brought down a new determination which, I was assured, would mean that a medical practitioner could be appointed speedily to the Queensland tribunal. I have to say that because of the lateness of the hour I have not been able to check whether an appointment has actually be made, but I will seek that information and pass it on to the honourable senator as soon as possible. Those matters have been of concern to me. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have already indicated, I accept that it is not satisfactory that there should be administrative delays in dealing with these matters. My instruction to the Department was that the people should be treated in a way as to prevent detriment to them because of the delay. In the case of some situations-for example, people who have been perhaps taken off the invalid pension-there is less of a problem because the entitlement continues for a period after that decision is made. But it is certainly true that new applicants may have to rely on a different form of benefit. I invite the honourable senator to submit particulars of detriment cases to me and I will endeavour to see that they are dealt with as well as is possible under the existing law. I do not think there is anything further that I can add in response to that, but I respect that I do invite the honourable senator to draw my attention to cases of particular difficulty in the hope that I might be able to be of assistance to them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very late hour and I wish only very briefly to take advantage of this opportunity which I know Senator John Martyr appreciates to raise a matter in the Senate of very grave concern to many young adults and their parents living on the north-west coast and west coast of Tasmania. This concerns the ability of families from those regions to enable their children to participate in tertiary education in Tasmania. It is a fact that the people in the north-west and on the west coast of Tasmania do face the necessity of sending their children either to Hobart or to Launceston to participate in the education opportunities offered by the University of Tasmania or by the College of Advanced Education. Of course this requires an expenditure of money by those families which is getting to such proportions that even more children are being denied the opportunity to develop their full talents than has been the case even historically in Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over many months I have received submissions from such bodies as the Mersey-Leven Committee, the Tasmanian Council of State School Parents and Friends Associations and, more recently, from the Devonport Regional Catholic College Parents and Friends Association as to the level of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowance and the point of parental income at which some sort of allowance becomes available. All these bodies emphasised the fact that families in the region are finding very real hardship in sustaining the tertiary education of children sent away to Hobart or to Launceston. But perhaps-this is why I rise very briefly on this occasion-I can make the matter somewhat more personal by quoting from a letter from Mr and Mrs Evans of Devonport, Tasmania. They wrote to me saying, amongst other things, that they had sent a young son to the University to Tasmania. They said:</PARA>
<PARA> In our case we are not entitled to any allowance, the cost to send our son to University in Hobart will be $3,200 this year. With only one income this will not be easy. It is of immense significance that smaller numbers of North West Coast students continue with Tertiary education than in other areas. Unless Students win scholarships parents can't afford to help them to go on with their education. </PARA>
<PARA>That very plaintive cry from those parents is, I believe, merely one parental voice amongst many in the north-west and on the west coast of Tasmania. To illustrate this more comprehensively, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard-Senator Peter Baume has agreed to its incorporation-a table showing full time bachelor students enrolled in 1980 at the University of Tasmania by home postcode. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Amongst other things that table shows, for example, that in 1980 the town of Devonport sent 90 students to the university; the town of Burnie sent 53 students; the town of Ulverstone sent 35 students; the town of Deloraine, the centre of a very rich pastoral area, sent only two students; and Queenstown, a very rich mining area, sent only four students, whereas suburbs within the Hobart area such as Glenorchy sent 62 students and Bellerive, which is by no means an affluent middle-class area, sent 109 students. So, a pattern emerges whereby in 1980 the suburbs of Hobart sent 1,100 students to the university, whereas towns in the north-west and on the west coast sent only 250 students. That disparity of about four to one will, in my view, only be exaggerated by the Government's proposals that families fall back on a loans scheme in order to supplement the diminishing real value of the TEAS allowance if, indeed, they qualify for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not my intention to enter into a debate on government policy. That would be a wrongful use of the adjournment. I wish merely to point out the very real distress which families in this region are facing. I guess it would be only a sample of hardship faced by many families in regions throughout Australia, whereas, as I say, by sheer geographical necessity young adults need to be sent away from home to cities which have the tertiary institutions available. So, I bring this particular plight to the attention of the Senate and ask that the Government give very real consideration to an improvement of the TEAS scheme when it formulates the proposals it will bring before the Parliament in the Budget session. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 February 1981 (Hansard, page 77) Senator Walters asked me a question without notice as to whether the Federal Government recently undertook an experiment which proved that private contractors could do road construction work for about one-third less than it would cost with normal day labour by the Department of Main Roads.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided me with the following additional information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The former Bureau of Roads examined in 1969 the feasibility of undertaking a study which might enable firm conclusions to be drawn about the comparative costs of the two methods of construction. This examination was undertaken following a request to the then Minister for Shipping and Transport by the Australian Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau considered that such a study would be feasible if the full co-operation of the States, where most road construction is undertaken, was obtained. However, it pointed out that the study would be complex because of the number of difficulties involved in attempting an objective assessment. These difficulties included, for example, the problem of finding road projects which would be sufficiently similar as to provide an adequate basis for comparison and the likelihood that variations in costs between individual contractors could be as great as those between contractors and day labour. In the event, the Bureau concluded that the results to be obtained from such a study were unlikely to warrant the costs involved.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Housing and Construction undertook a very limited study in 1976 which compared maintenance expenditure undertaken over a four-year period by private contract on a Commonwealth stores building with maintenance expenditure by day labour in other years. Neither Capital Works expenditure in general nor road construction works were considered and hence no conclusions can be drawn from this study about the relative cost of road construction work undertaken by private contract and day labour. Moreover, the conclusions from this study would not be relevant to a comparison of road construction methods.</PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore not possible to conclude, on the basis of available information, that private contractors will always do roadworks at a lesser cost than day labour. The relative cost efficiency of each of these methods of undertaking roadworks would be established on a project by project basis where day labour and private contractors are free to compete by tender for the work. From the viewpoint of achieving value for money, this is the very reason for the Government's decision to make grants to the States and the Northern Territory for national roads conditional upon the application of open tender arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 February 1981 (Hansard, page 154) Senator Sibraa asked me a question, without notice, concerning the utilisation of spare seats on Qantas flights between Perth and the eastern States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided the following information in response to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The utilisation of empty seats on Qantas flights was examined by the Domestic Air Transport Policy Review Committee which reported in 1978. The report recommended that domestic airlines be allowed to charter spare Qantas seats for the use of domestic passengers. Following the review, discussions with the airlines highlighted a number of difficulties with the proposal. These included health, immigration and customs requirements, problems of interconnecting domestic flights and possible industrial implications.</PARA>
<PARA> The recent report of the Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares also referred to difficulties associated with such a proposal. The report pointed out that the availability of seats on international flights for domestic use would almost certainly reduce the frequency of flights to and from Perth offered by the domestic airlines thus reducing the choice available to travellers. Moreover, the availability of seats on the international flights would depend upon the seasonal demands for seats to and from foreign ports.</PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry also noted that while schedules originating in Melbourne or Sydney for westbound services may follow a timetable, there would be no avoiding the likely interruptions and delays with incoming international flights eastbound to Perth towards the end of their journeys. Thus the regularity of eastbound services from Perth might be less certain than is now offered.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government is prepared to facilitate negotiations between the airlines in an endeavour to achieve a satisfactory solution to this issue.</PARA>
