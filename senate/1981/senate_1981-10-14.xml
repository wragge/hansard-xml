<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the projected repeal by the Queensland State Government of the Aborigines Act 1971-1979 and the Torres Strait Islander Act 1971-1979 will almost certainly lead to the degazettal of all Aboriginal reserves in Queensland, as happened with Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>
<PARA> That, if the Aboriginal communities from these reserves are placed under similar shire council legislation on fifty year leases, they will be exposed to serious encroachment on their land by mining and tourist interests.</PARA>
<PARA> That, on past evidence, these interests will clearly have the full backing of the Queensland Government and the rights of Aboriginal people to land rights and self-management will not be granted by that Government.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Commonwealth Government has the constitutional power to legislate and acquire land for Aboriginal people since the amendments to the Constitution in 1967, but it is your petitioners' sincere belief it has already failed in its duty before the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Aboriginal people of Queensland have stated that they want land rights and self-management.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should make use of its constitutional and legislative powers to grant full land rights and self-management to the Aboriginal people of Queensland.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 266 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable President and Senators in the Parliament assembled. This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The proposal to introduce fees for higher and Second degrees will mean that access to post-graduate and recurrent education will be limited to the rich. Australian research and ability to cope with technological change will suffer; this proposal must be seen as a step in the direction of the introduction of fees for all tertiary students.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The proposed introduction of a loans scheme for students will mean graduating with a heavy debt or being denied a tertiary education if loans are refused because a student is seen as a ''poor risk'' (particularly affecting women and those doing non-vocational courses); only the rich will be able to get a tertiary education without course restrictions and the burden of indebtedness.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. In regard to the proposal to restrict eligibility for TEAS and the foreshadowing of reviewing TEAS levels only in the light of the availability of loans; it should be noted that any further downgrading of TEAS, which is already inadequate, can only further limit access to education.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The proposed restriction of Adult Secondary Assistance to those needing qualifications for employment will severely restrict access to a full high school education and necessary bridging education to tertiary education for those who left school early.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The proposal not to fund 30 Colleges of Advanced Education if they are not rationalised is an attack on teacher education. This attack will create teacher shortages in the mid 1980s, restrict access to education now and endanger the future quality of teaching available to Australian children.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) post-secondary tuition fees not be introduced for any courses or for any category of students;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that the TEAS scheme be extended so as to more fully meet the real financial needs of students;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) that a comprehensive loans scheme not be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) that there be no restriction of Adult Secondary Assistance;</PARA>
<PARA> (v) that the proposal not to fund 30 CAEs unless they are rationalised be rescinded.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 825 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable, the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that the introduction of tuition fees for post-graduate and second degree students will:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) severely limit access to such levels of study. The ability of a student to pay tuition fees will be the main criteria for entry to such courses. The restricted availability of Commonwealth post-graudate scholarships and the difficulty of finding part-time work in employment related areas further restricts the ability of post-graduate students to pay tuition fees.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) result in higher attrition rates in post-graduate and second degree studies. Recent surveys have indicated that up to 50% of students would be unable to continue their studies if tuition fees at the level of $1,000 per year were introduced. Inability to continue study is both a personal tragedy and a waste of the community's resources.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) limit Australia's capacity to cope with technological, economic and social change. Many degree students who will have to pay tuition fees undertake further study to upgrade their qualifications to cope with changes in their area of employment. Many are forced to undertake retraining in areas outside their current employment because of declining job opportunities in such areas due to economic change. Further study for many students will bring no financial benefit but simply allow them to extend their contribution in the course of their work. For example thousands of teachers have undertaken further study to gain expertise in such areas as migrant education, remedial literacy and numeracy teaching, curriculum development and so on.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) further restrict access to such study for women students. As a result of the abolition of tuition fees the proportion of women students in tertiary education has increased significantly. Mature age women students have benefited by the opportunity denied them when they left school.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) seriously undermine Australia's research effort. Approximately 22% of Australian research takes place in tertiary institutions. The bulk of Australia's basic research is undertaken in universities. The introduction of tuition fees threatens Australia's capacity to cope with major structural change in the economy.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of complaints that are made quite frequently about delays in the hearing of custody and property disputes in the Family Court. I am not immediately aware of complaints about specific delays in Queensland. I do not know exactly what the delay is in Queensland at present. But there have been delays and there are delays of varying periods in different registries of the Family Court in Australia. There are delays in most courts in Australia. It is always a problem for litigants when these delays occur. Unless we largely increase the number of judges and thereby greatly increase the expenses of running our system of justice in courts generally, it is very difficult for people to have their cases heard immediately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the Family Court area, apart from increasing the number of judges to some extent, we have been relying on increasing the number of counsellors and deputy registrars. In custody cases they attempt-in a large number of cases they are successful-to settle the dispute, whether it be related to access or custody. The deputy registrars conduct conferences to try to resolve property disputes, and in many cases succeed. That has proved to be a successful way of reducing the number of cases coming to court which demand the time of judges and thereby cause delays. There has been quite significant success in this direction. Despite the interjections that Senator Evans has been trying to make and despite all his speech making on the subject last night, there has been in fact quite considerable success in the Melbourne registry. I note that he acknowledges that, and I thank him.</PARA>
<PARA> When I became Attorney-General four years ago there were very serious delays in Melbourne, and we set about tackling them. Very considerable reductions in delays have occurred there. I believe, and the Chief Judge of the court believes, that this is the most appropriate way of tackling the problem. I am answering the question generally because as I said earlier I have no specific information about the particular complaint in Queensland that Senator MacGibbon raises at present. I will look into that and provide him with a specific answer shortly.</PARA>

Can the Minister justify this delay which, I might add, is a repetition of last year's situation and which is apparently inexcusable in the light of the fact that all States have had their nominations in for some time? Further, can the Minister explain why Cabinet keeps postponing what is really a very simple decision, if it is not due to the fact that this Government has given a very low priority to women's issues? Finally, can the Minister say exactly when the announcement of the composition of the National Women's Advisory Council will be made and thus put an end to the concern being felt among many women's groups in the community that this Government really does not care about the status of women in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

This Government has a continuing and firm commitment to the welfare of women. More than that, from time to time the Senate has had before it a large number of petitions which have drawn attention to the composition of the National Women's Advisory Council and which have asked the Government to take into account certain views. I take it that the honourable senator would want the Government to give the fullest possible consideration to all viewpoints that have been put before it. It is not a question of justifying delay. The question is that the Minister involved considers the appointments to the National Women's Advisory Council to be important appointments. He considers the Council to be important. He considers the job to be one that has to be done with proper consideration. The consideration of the appointments is continuing, and the appointments will be announced at an appropriate time when those considerations are complete.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am told that they get their fuel from a mining company at Groote Eylandt. Will the Minister investigate the allegations and let the Senate know the results as soon as possible?

I remind the Senate that the Australian Medical Association is still the majority association representing doctors in Australia. It is a proper body to undertake such a study and I believe it is a sign of the emerging and continuing role of the AMA in matters of social importance that it should seek to carry out such a study.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Social Security. Is the Minister aware of the hardships placed by the current Government on recipients of invalid pension benefits who have the long term hope of rejoining the work force? In the International Year of Disabled Persons, what incentive for disabled Australians to seek work does the Government see in the 50c in the dollar reduction in pension which occurs when the net income of disabled people is as much as $50 a week below the poverty line? Will the Minister comment on why disabled people should accept this disincentive of reduced pensions when the Prime Minister's annual travel budget is itself twice the cost to the Australian community as would be the raising to the poverty line of permissible earnings for people working in sheltered workshops?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1162" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The invalid pensioner, in common with a number of other social security beneficiaries, is subject to an income test which is in fact designed to ensure that there is incentive for the invalid pensioner to increase his or her income. That incentive is provided by the fact that there is an income test free area and by the fact that for earnings above that income test free area the reduction in pension is not dollar for dollar but, as the honourable senator indicated in his question, on the basis of 50c in the dollar. That means that the invalid pensioner continues to receive a part pension as his or her earnings increase, and that applies, of course, whether the pensioner is in or outside a sheltered workshop. Of course, for those invalid pensioners who are able to assume employment the question as to their continuing eligibility for the invalid pension does arise; that is, if they are not in a sheltered workshop situation. But of course the invalid pension is predicated on the fact that the person is 85 per cent disabled for work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter of incentives is a matter which is very much in the forefront of the debate which is proceeding in Australia and which this year is being promoted in the community by the disabled themselves on the merits and the adequacies and inadequacies of the income maintenance system. One of the strong demands which is being made by the disabled is for an easing of the income test either by a lessening of the withdrawal rate or by an extension of the income test free area. With respect to those demands, as recently as last week I had discussions with disabled people who are participants in the national committee of non-government organisations for the year of the disabled and we discussed the matter on the basis that the disabled, through the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of the Disabled, are promoting discussion. A great number of papers have been put together on the best approaches which might be adopted in the income maintenance field for disabled people.</PARA>
<PARA> I have indicated that I do not believe it is appropriate for the Government to pre-empt the conclusion of those discussions, that we should await their conclusion and then give them careful consideration. For example, I have arranged to meet a group of disabled people in Sydney on Friday week on the very subject that the honourable senator has raised. It is very much on the Government's agenda at the moment, but I would not expect decisions to be taken within a matter of weeks. Rather, as I have indicated to those disabled people who have been in touch with me, I would expect to receive the results of the extensive discussions which have been promoted by ACROD and which ACROD is now in the process of refining and finalising.</PARA>
<PARA> In fact, people on the invalid pension or people in sheltered workshops do have something of an advantage over other social security beneficiaries. Honourable senators would be aware that these people receive their pensions free of income tax so that in fact the disincentive for them in terms of additional earnings is less than it is for other social security beneficiaries who have to pay tax. The withdrawal rate of 50c in the dollar is not complicated, until they get up to earnings of about $80 a week, by the fact that income tax is also deducted. This is not the occasion on which to make a lengthy speech on that matter. But I acknowledge that the question of disincentive is a serious matter which is being raised in a number of quarters at the moment. I do not believe it is a simple matter. It is not unrelated to the whole shape of the social security system. The issue is raised not merely by those who are invalid but also by supporting parents, by the unemployed and by other people dependent upon the state for support. I can only say that in trying to arrive at sensible conclusions in this matter the Government will be listening to the views of the disabled themselves and will, within the limits of what is available from taxpayers, move to improve the system as much as possible.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have read a number of comments published in the Press alleging that the Government's policies in its Budget are a threat to academic freedom. Quite rightly, the Australian Financial Review rejects that as absolute nonsense. The fact of the matter is that institutions do not have licence or total liberty to do what they want in anything. Educational institutions have been set up over the years for specific purposes. Individual faculties in individual institutions have been decided by State and Federal governments over the years. Academic freedom is breached when a government or anyone else invervenes in the philosophical or methodological teaching of a subject. The freedom is to teach the subject matters, the facts and opinions objectively. There is no attempt whatsoever by this Government to intervene in terms of academic freedom. The decision of whether there ought to be a school of engineering is a very proper decision for a government in terms of its responsibility for taxpayers' money. I repeat: All State governments have done this at regular intervals; it is absolutely normal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the people of Australia that we have a Tertiary Education Commission, headed by Professor Karmel, one of Australia's leading academics, who himself has a full understanding of academic freedom, and advised by individual councils, including a Universities Council. Indeed, the essential recommendations that at this moment are being carried out by the Government are based upon those emanating from the councils and from the Tertiary Education Commission. There is no likelihood that the Commission or the Universities Council would seek by any action to breach academic freedom. So the answer to that assertion is that it is absolute nonsense. It is true that this Government has the responsibility for the spending on education of massive amounts of taxpayers' money. It has a right and proper responsibility to see that that money is spent properly and well. I must say that I hold in lesser regard than hitherto many people, whose statements I have read in the newspapers, for having attempted to use absolute propaganda for such purposes when they ought to have known better.</PARA>

The major decisions of the Council were as follows: The Council endorsed the management guidelines in the three-year rolling program prepared for the Capricornia section of the marine park. The Council agreed to recommend that action proceed immediately to enable proclamation of an area which would protect a colony of potato cod, which is a particular attraction to divers because of the unusual size and tameness of these fish. The Council noted the detailed reports of a working group on proposals for the boundaries of the proposed Cairns section and-this is the part Senator Missen is concerned about-the full implication of those boundaries.</PARA></TALK.START>

For the current year an amount of $2.9m is provided in the Budget as grants to these bodies. Also included in that amount is a small sum in relation specifically to inquiries and experiments into the desirability and effectiveness of premarital counselling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We know, of course, that a number of churches do this work. There is quite a deal of interest in it but there is also a great deal of scepticism about its effect. At this stage more attempts in that direction would be justified. I think there are two views among the experts in this field as to how far it is likely to be successful as a general provision. It seems to succeed when carried out by some churches and by people who are members of churches who have a real sense of commitment to the exercise, but how far it would be effective if it were in any way imposed is of great doubt.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the question that Senator Watson specifically asked is in relation to another pamphlet on the subject. As I said, there is quite a bit of information provided in pamphlet form about the location and activities of the marriage counselling organisations. I will look specifically at his question to see whether anything further can be done to publicise premarital counselling.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Education by saying that no doubt the Minister recognises that Australia must continue to upgrade its technological base, particularly in areas such as engineering, electronics and other applied sciences, if we are to employ Australians rather than to have to import qualified people; yet the funding of universities, whether for research, equipment or staff and buildings, has been severely restricted. No doubt the Minister is aware that no matter how the figures are juggled, significantly less money is available to support much-needed courses and research programs. Does the Government recognise that the scientific sections of universities need an immediate increase in cash and that the university staff in those areas need encouragement so that our relatively short term needs in scientific areas will be available from locally produced graduates? Will the Government examine the possibility of directing special funds to the engineering and science sections of universities if savings cannot be made by cutting back in the pseudo-disciplines that can be described only as punk sociology?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the past six years the Government has concentrated very heavily on turning a considerable amount of its tertiary funding towards the technical base. The establishment of the Tertiary Education Commission, with the technical and further education element as an equal part alongside universities and colleges, is an indication of the Government's desire that the technical-technological side of education should be upgraded. Very considerable amounts of money have gone into that. My understanding and my recollection is that a study was made of the number of engineering schools in Victoria. The name of the chairman escapes me now, but that report, from memory, made the finding that there were too many schools. I want first to make the comment that there has been a rationalisation.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think Senator Macklin answered his own question by referring to the fact that Australian warships did enter Tokyo Bay very soon after the surrender of Japan at the end of the war and, of course, were nowhere in the vicinity of the atomic blast at Nagasaki.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, concerns Federal spending in the crucial area of child care and pre-school facilities. Will the Minister confirm that the Government has made major cutbacks in the allocation for pre-school facilities for four-year-olds as well as for other child care programs? Is it not a fact that, as a consequence of such cutbacks, many community organisations will have to shelve or drastically amend their plans? In this regard I refer to a statement by Mr John Chappel of the Uniting Church's McNeil Child Care Centre in Sydney, in which he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We were assured that an operating subsidy would be given. We need the subsidy if we are to keep this centre for low income people. We could easily charge $70 a day and make it an elite place for the rich.</PARA>

Further, and in closing, I refer the Minister to my letter to him on 28 September this year wherein I asked for details of the cutbacks as they affect South Australia. Will the Minister provide the details sought of such cutbacks in order that he and his Government can stand publicly accountable for their actions?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the first part of the multiple-point question is no, there have not been major cutbacks for the pre-school programs at all. In fact the major responsibility for pre-school programs rests with the States. Although there is a Commonwealth contribution, that contribution has been static for a number of years with a block amount being made available to the State as a contribution to those pre-school services. It has been quite clear for a number of years that this is not seen as an area of Commonwealth responsibility with the Commonwealth being responsible for increases in pre-school educational arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the Child Services Program generally is concerned, there has been no attempt to try to hide the situation. I issued a Press release at the time of the Budget which set out quite clearly the funding for this program. There is an increase in funding this year of approximately $6.1m which, as the statement makes explicit, will permit maintenance of existing funding commitments but which will not provide for new initiatives during the financial year. That has been clearly stated and I thought it was a matter of public knowledge. So I am not quite sure why the honourable senator suggests in his question that there is something which has not been disclosed.</PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested that the Government's approach is to turn child care centres-I think really the question related to child care rather than pre-schools-into elite places for the rich. Quite the contrary is the case. My concern about the long day care arrangements which we subsidise at present is that, even in the face of very substantial Commonwealth subsidies, we find in some areas that the least well off in the community, those whom we would most want to guarantee access to these facilities through Commonwealth financial assistance, do not have access because the cost of the services is in fact in excess of what they can afford. To take one example, I recently opened a centre based day care facility to which the Commonwealth contributed about $300,000 in capital and has committed about $86,000 in recurrent expenditure.There are places for about 30 long day care children and I think 30 part time care children in the centre. I am told by the organisers that the level of fees to be charged puts this centre beyond the means of many people in the area whose children they would wish to attend. A very substantial Commonwealth subsidy is going to benefit a relatively small number of children and is not necessarily getting to the most needy in the community. It is in that context that I am examining the general funding arrangements with respect to that program.</PARA>
<PARA> Under my predecessor the Commonwealth made its objectives in this program quite clear. First, it wanted to ensure that facilities were available to those who had a great social need for them. The previous Minister, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, indicated in the material that she put out in her time as Minister-I think this goes back to 1976-that people with social difficulties, including migrants, Aboriginals, single parent families and so on, should get priority in Commonwealth funded centres. There was also an emphasis that the subsidies which were available should also be used to ensure that those who might not otherwise have access for economic reasons should have access. I think it is perfectly reasonable that we should look at this program and make sure that what I would see as highly desirable objectives of the Commonwealth are in fact met when we fund child care arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it quite clear that the examination of the program at the moment is being carried out to ensure quite specifically that Commonwealth funding does not go to fund elite places for the rich but rather that members of the Australian community who would not otherwise have access and who need access are able to get it. I would also like to say that I think most Australians would accept that the primary obligation for the care of children rests with parents and that the role of government is to intervene and to assist in those cases where, for a variety of reasons, the parents themselves may not be able to meet their obligations. So I reject the sorts of accusations implicit in the question. The Government has the matter of child care under careful consideration. That is a matter on which I have been keeping the public and, I would have thought, the Parliament well and truly informed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen the letter. The Government believes that of all the resources in Australia the most precious and indeed the most limited is water. It therefore believes that the subject should have a very high priority, and it has set out so to do. I think the figures as to how much money has been spent within that program of $200m are correct. It is true also that within that time, but not with the financial commitment up to this year, the Government has undertaken to pay for the cost of the actual construction of the Burdekin Dam. The preliminary work on the Burdekin Dam is being done by the Queensland Government, but I think in last year's dollar terms the cost is in the order of the best part of $90m and is likely to be in the order of $200m. So, the Government has made some very significant forward commitments and has increased the amounts to the Bundaberg water projects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are very busy at this moment trying to get the River Murray Waters Agreement into place. We are undertaking a number of schemes.

There is also a survey which should come to fruition fairly soon regarding the research capacity in Australia for water and I hope that we may be able to deliberate on it in the months ahead. Frankly, of course, we rely on the co-partnership, and we get it, of the six States and the Territory in the asessment of water. The States in general do a very good job. Only recently we have been working in conjunction with the New South Wales Government in looking at the Clarence River and its prospects for the future. A great deal of preliminary work is being undertaken at the moment. I can only say and stress that I regard water as one of the real delimiting factors to our potential growth in Australia and it is a matter on which we place the highest priority for the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-As Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence I take this opportunity to make a short statement relevant to allegations about conditions in East Timor. The matter concerned the possibility of my Committee investigating and reporting on newspaper allegations of army recruitment jeopardising food supplies, of reported murder and of atrocities in East Timor. Let me say in the first place that my Committee is finalising a draft report of an inquiry into the refugee situation in Australia. In determining our next reference we considered whether or not an attempt should be made to look at the East Timor situation and decided on balance, not to proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst I would want to express an absolute abhorrence of the alleged areas of criminal and inhuman behaviour, wherever in the world it may occur, a number of matters should be raised. It would seem unwise to begin inquiries forthwith into allegations without seeking their clarification and evaluation through formal channels such as the Australian Embassy in Jakarta, already instructed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street). We need to consider seriously anybody's right to interfere in the internal matters of other countries. Uppermost also would be the Committee's very restricted capacity to carry out an in-depth and balanced investigation in this circumstance. Rather, then, than this being an appropriate area for my Committee to investigate, it would seem proper that the allegations be examined through the normal national avenues. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government is certainly not unmindful of our social, economic and security involvement with Indonesia; our continuing trade and seabed negotiations. Similarly, we have shown constant concern for those whose security has become the responsibility of the Indonesian Government. The Australian Government continues to monitor the food situation in that land and since 1975 has provided more than $5.5m for humanitarian assistance in both food and cash grants chiefly through the two Red Cross organisations. The efforts of relief agencies and the Indonesian authorities have had considerable success improving the physical and health conditions of the East Timorese. This is the consistent report of visitors and the International Committee of the Red Cross in its periodic reports. There is still concern at the slow progress seen in the family reunion program, but some 347 of the list of 625 East Timorese, somewhat more than half, have so far come to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> So in conclusion I say that the Committee in its program of inquiry concluded the advisability, capacity and practicality of inquiry into allegations relating to East Timorese and believed the matter was more appropriately one for the Minister for Foreign Affairs. </PARA>

It was suggested that it could be seen to be interfering in the internal affairs of another nation since de jure recognition had been given to the brutal annexation of East Timor by Indonesia.

I take it that the members of the Committee on this side of the House will take this up on a subsequent occasion and propose to that Committee a reference to investigate fully the allegations because Timor is very much within our region. The events in Timor are very much our responsibility.

If there are allegations of atrocity in East Timor at this stage we ought to investigate them and not take the word of the various officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs as I think the Chairman of the Committee has taken their assessment because we have found in the past that their assessment has not been correct, that the information and advice that came out of our Embassy in Indonesia was advice that suited the Indonesian authorities to the disadvantage of the people of Timor and, if I might say so, to the disadvantage of the people of Australia.

I was made aware then of the fact that the Committee was proceeding with another reference on the defence arrangements with our neighbours of which notice has been given today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is only right that the Chairman should have explained to the Senate that there had been some discussion on this matter and that in fact the Committee has not-at this stage anyway-sought any reference on the matter. I certainly would not be a party to trying to impose on a committee a reference which the committee did not seek and which it did not feel was within its capacity to deal with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I know that. I am merely saying that I would not move that. Senator Georges put a particular proposition to me that I should proceed to try to move a reference. I say that I would not do that in respect of this Committee. That does not mean that there should not be investigation into this subject by a committee of this Senate. That is a different matter altogether. This Committee has considered this matter to some extent and has not sought a reference in this respect. I appreciate the statement which the Chairman of the Committee has made. I believe that that should not be a subject of any criticism. If the Committee members want to change that view and do something different then I think that is a matter entirely for them. Also, the Senate may decide here whether it ought to send to some committee of the Senate a reference to look into this matter. That is well within the competence of this Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am certain that other senators on this side of the chamber and I are very determined that there will be more investigation of this matter. We will not be content to accept even the views of the Australian Ambassador in Indonesia or even necessarily those of the Department of Foreign Affairs or any other department; we will want to be satisfied about the facts of these most serious allegations. Obviously, this matter will be heard of further in this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I feel I must make a statement in order primarily to dissociate myself from some of the sentiments expressed by the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. As Senator McIntosh mentioned earlier, I did raise the question of East Timor in a previous meeting of the Committee. At that stage it was decided by the Committee that we should look at an item with reference to defence and defence co-operation. However, since the raising of Senator Missen's question yesterday I have had the opportunity to express once again my opinion to the Chairman of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I stated, in contradiction to what had been mentioned in the Senate earlier, that I disagreed with the assessment that the position in East Timor was settled and that Indonesian policies had been of benefit to the people of East Timor. I disagreed with the statement that it was an internal matter of another country and that we had no right to assess either our role in respect of that other country or the rights of persons in that other country. As did Senator McIntosh, I referred to the situation of dissidents in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. I believe that the reference discussed in the last day or so and raised by Senator Missen is one that could quite properly be investigated by a Senate committee. I think the facts and the information raised in recent days and covered in Australian national newspapers probably lend cause to the reason for our investigating this matter. However, I am a little disappointed that Senator Missen was quite prepared yesterday to raise the question but in his contribution today to some extent has run away from it. I will not say any more. I appreciate this opportunity to clarify my position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I believe there has been some misunderstanding in relation to this issue. Yesterday Senator Missen sought to ask a question of Senator Scott, the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. Mr President, you had a few words to say about the matter and stated that you would have something to say about it later. At about 9.30 last night I went to see Senator Scott to discuss the matter. Senator Missen was in Senator Scott's office when I went there. The three of us had a round table conference. At that stage it was believed by all of us that you, Mr President, would not be making any statement on the matter last night. It was not long after that when I walked into the chamber--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">The PRESIDENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My statement depended upon the procedures yesterday within this chamber.

I did that when I had the opportunity in between debates last night.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SO7">Senator PRIMMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I put it this way: It was our assessment that we believed you would not be making a statement later last evening. With that in mind there did not seem to be a great deal of haste, or not the haste that there ultimately proved to be, in our discussions. As Senator Scott, Senator Bolkus and Senator McIntosh have said, the question of a reference on East Timor was discussed by the Committee. That has been the normal practice of the Senate Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee in the years I have been on it. When searching around for a reference it is normal for a round table discussion to take place and for some consensus to be arrived at as to what finally would be the reference that the Committee would take on. It was done exactly that way this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose the one suggestion that came through fairly loud in those discussions was that the Committee over the last few years has persistently taken on references in relation to foreign affairs and has not had a look at a defence reference, I think, since we did the Army reference in about 1974. It was felt that perhaps at this stage the Committee may well get into the area of defence rather than foreign affairs. Another question that arose was the interference in the affairs of another sovereign state-if Timor is a sovereign part of Indonesia, which I believe it should not be. The other question of course that arises in relation to these matters is the hardy perennial of the Committee's inability to travel. I may not have expressed this view but certainly I feel that if the Committee were to undertake intensive investigation into East Timor our inability to travel as a committee would be an inhibiting factor. Anyhow, the end result was that we went for a defence rather than a foreign affairs reference. I do believe there is ample scope somewhere within this Senate for an inquiry into Timor. I believe this Senate has an obligation to conduct such an inquiry to try to find out the facts, and perhaps more so, to look a little into the future, not forgetting what has happened over the last five or six years in East Timor but with that background trying to work out some way whereby this Parliament or this nation can in some way redress the crimes committed against the Timorese since 7 December 1975. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief. I was quite shocked when I heard Senator Scott read his statement. I was clearly under the impression that it represented a decision of the full committee of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. To my mind, the action of the honourable senator was unethical. Whether it was intentional or unintentional does not really matter, but if it was intentional that compounds the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was not happy about the way in which the subject of the reunification of families was glossed over by an apologetic sort of reference to the fact that more than half of the families are now here. We have been negotiating this matter for the last three or four years and I doubt whether half of the families are in fact here. Nothing has been done by the Government to speed up reunification of families. That ought to be done and we ought not to be apologising for it either. </PARA>
<PARA> I am reminded of the action of the Premier of Queensland, who at the time of the invasion of East Timor sent a telegram to the President of Indonesia expressing his congratulations. One would think that Senator Scott had had the Premier of Queensland draft his statement before he made it to the Parliament. What has happened is not good enough. I agree with those members of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence who have already spoken. We have reached a stage at which the matter ought to be referred by the Senate to an appropriate standing committee if the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence is unable, because of a minor change of direction in its responsibility, in favour of defence rather than foreign affairs, to handle the matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. In the issue of the Adelaide News of Monday 7 September, certain statements were made about my association with the Irish hunger striker in Sydney, Mr Eamonn O'Connor. I do not generally read the Adelaide News and have only just become aware of this matter through a clipping from that newspaper which was sent to me. Hence. I have not been able to raise the subject earlier. The news item, under a Melbourne dateline, states.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate is expected to ask the Federal Government to declare its position on demands by an Irish hunger striker in Sydney, Eamonn O'Connor, when Parliament resumes this week. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr O'Connor, 27, has received support from the A.L.P., the Democrats and Tasmanian Independent Senator Harradine in his bid to press the Government to ask the British Government to agree to the demands of the hunger strikers in Belfast. </PARA>
<PARA> Queensland Senator George Georges (A.L.P.) said in a telegram to Mr O'Connor he would raise the issue as a matter of urgency and seek a decision by the Senate in his favor. </PARA>
<PARA> The Acting Leader of the Democrats, Senator Mason, said his party also would call for urgent discussion of the matter and a decision by the Government in favor of Mr O'Connor. </PARA>
<PARA>The statements attributed to me are not only utterly untrue but cannot be linked in any way with any interview I have ever had with any journalist. The facts are that on 3 September I went to the Gaelic Club in Sydney, in which Mr O'Connor was undertaking his hunger strike. I went there at the request of a Catholic bishop, who had asked me to try to persuade Mr O'Connor to give up his strike. I made it plain to the bishop that I in no way supported Mr O'Connor's strike. I also made that plain to the H Block Committee representatives I found at the Gaelic Club. I stated that I was solely interested in Mr O'Connor's ending his trike and on that basis I was admitted to see him. </PARA>
<PARA> I held a lengthy discussion with Mr O'Connor in which I stated that I believed his hunger strike would be counter-productive and would provoke a negative reaction from Australians if it continued; that I was concerned that eight other constitutents of mine, including a woman, were said to be prepared to follow his lead, and that he owed it to himself and to those other people not to starve himself to death in such a cause. I added that in my opinion, he could be quite certain that the eventuality of his death would not and could not provoke the action that he had requested from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). </PARA>
<PARA> I later signed as an individual a petition seeking certain concessions at the Maze Prison, because of my belief-in which I persist-that refusal to make any such concessions was giving the Irish Republican Army a stick with which to beat the British Government. That petition in no way involved the Australian Democrats. I have never called for discussions of the matter within the party, and I wish to place on record my utter abhorrence of the policy of armed terrorism that is adopted by the IRA. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Mason raised the matter of Eamonn O'Connor and sought to clear himself regarding a Press statement. In doing so, he quoted a reference in the Press article to a telegram which allegedly I sent to Mr O'Connor. I sent no such telegram. I was very much involved in the concern which surrounded the fast this young man undertook in support of something in which he believed very strongly. I raised the matter in the Senate on a couple of occasions. Subsequently, I visited the Gaelic Club in Sydney on two occasions, on the second of which I convinced O'Connor to end his strike. With me on that occasion was Senator Primmer. Our purpose was, of course, to indicate to the young man that what he was doing in giving up his life was of very little use in the campaign in which he was engaged; that to give up his life would be a loss; and that he ought to apply himself more to continuing the struggle and leading it rather than engaging in an horrific wastage of human life. I do not retreat from that view. I support neither the violence of the Irish Republican Army nor that of those who oppose it. There is violence on both sides. It has to be accepted. As I have said in the Senate previously, it is necessary that the Australian Government accept its responsibility to intervene in some way, even if only by giving economic support to the people of Northern Ireland, in order to remove the causes of the conflict.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In convincing O'Connor that he should end the strike, I undertook to raise the matter, whenever it was necessary and possible, in the Senate. I also indicated to O'Connor that if he felt it necessary to come to the Parliament I would make available to him the means to speak to as many of my colleagues as possible. I also undertook to see the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and to make some arrangements for O'Connor to see the Prime Minister so that he could personally express his concern to him about what was happening in Northern Ireland. Subsequently I did see the Prime Minister on the matter, who indicated that he was pleased that O'Connor had ended his strike and that such an unnecessary sacrifice would not take place. But the Prime Minister put one condition on seeing O'Connor that I thought O'Connor would not accept. It was that he would sign a declaration that, having seen the Prime Minister, he would not again engage in a hunger strike. I have not raised this matter previously because the Prime Minister said that the matter was highly divisive in the Australian community-from the letters I received it proved to be so-and that he was afraid that it might lead to a demonstration which would result in violence within the Australian community, violence which he did not desire should take place. For that reason, I did not raise the matter before the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting took place in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> I take the opportunity now to indicate that O'Connor ended his strike because he believed that he would have the ear of parliamentarians to state his case. If he comes to this place I hope that, now the hunger strikes are over, he will not be shunned, pushed to one side and accused-as one honourable senator, without a proper understanding of the problem, has accused these people-of being a murderer and a supporter of violence. That situation of violence exists, but those people who are involved in that exercise of violence are acting for political reasons, as is the case in Cyprus, Israel, at present in the Middle East, and so on. Those people act for political reasons. No matter how misguided they are this misunderstanding must be understood. People such as O'Connor who have shunned violence ought to be given a chance to express their point of view. I cannot quite see why the Australian Democrats should suddenly pull away from what might be a controversial issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter which I raise concerns the arrests in Athens of nine people their charging and their gaoling for offences which were allegedly committed in Australia. It concerns the involvement of Australian Government representatives in their cases. It involves the misinformation and, what is more important, the lack of information by two Ministers, namely, the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and the former Minister for Administrative Services in another place, Mr John McLeay, when inquiries were made about these cases. I believe the case is important to Australians of Greek origin who, through no choice of their own, have dual nationality. The matter should concern all Australians because any Australian who is involved in what I consider to be an apparent miscarriage of justice should be the concern of us all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two years after the original arrests were made in Sydney, in April 1978 in what has become known as the social security conspiracy case, a Sydney newspaper, the Daily Telegraph, on 27 May 1980, reported that nine persons had been indicted in an Athens court under Greek law on charges of 'fraud against the Australian Government'. This was based on a United Press International report from Athens which said that sources expected the trial to take place before July. Since that time every effort of mine and others in this Parliament to try to find out what was happening, what led to the arrests and where the Australian Government fitted in with these charges has been met with surprise and, at times, expressions of ignorance, casualness and sometimes palpable lies from those who were responsible for answers. The Government has volunteered no information. Every fact that has been dragged out of anyone in this place has come as a result of repeated questions and almost painful extraction. </PARA>
<PARA> In the end the Opposition was forced to seek information from Greece. The Opposition had to approach sources in the Greek courts and the Greek judicial system to find out what has happened to people, some of whom are Australian citizens, who have been charged under Greek law on evidence derived from Australian sources for offences which occurred within Australia. When I asked the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, about when he had learnt that these charges had been pressed the answer I received four months later was: 'I don't remember'. He referred me to the newspaper report of 27 May 1980. Following further questions he quoted a cable from the Australian Embassy on 28 May 1980 which confirmed the arrests in Greece, but he did not do this until July 1981. In Parliament on 21 August 1980, when I asked Senator Durack about the Australian Government's involvement, he maintained that it was inappropriate for him to say anything at all until he had talked to the then Minister for Foreign Affairs. However, he did state:</PARA>
<PARA> We certainly have not taken any part in initiating it . . .--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the case-</PARA>
<PARA>the circumstances which led to their occurring are matters to which . . . I have given consideration. But we have not-in the sense that Senator Grimes intends-initiated them . . . or are taking part in them. </PARA>
<PARA>If he did talk to the Minister for Foreign Affairs he did not report back to the Parliament or to the Senate. On 26 August he said that he would follow up the suggestion that the Greek authorities had acted at the request of the Commonwealth Police. But it was not until I raised the matter again on 11 September that he read to me a prepared answer from the Assistant Commissioner, Operations, of the Australian Federal Police. I summarise the answer as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Detective Inspector Thomas went to Greece with a request for legal assistance addressed to the Greek authorities-signed on his first visit by the Deputy Crown Solicitor and on his second by the Attorney General . . . it was for assistance by the Greek Government in making inquiries in respect of the activities or knowledge of the nine arrested persons. The Greek police made inquiries and forwarded the papers to the prosecuting attorney for Greece, who in turn forwarded them to the Australian Ambassador to send on to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> At no time did the Chief Inspector or any other member of the Commonwealth Police ask the Greek authorities to take action against those persons then living in Greece whom it was believed had committed offences in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister added:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . as far as I am aware there was no further conduct by the Australian Federal Police in relation to these proceedings in Greece, to make the representations to the Greek authorities. I am not aware of the operations of the Australian Federal Police. That is not my responsibility. I will pass that question on to the Minister for Administrative Services . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He may have passed on the question but we received no answer from the Minister for Administrative Services. A week later, on 18 September, the then Minister, Mr John McLeay, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . whatever action was taken in Greece was taken on the initiative of the Greek Government and in no way was it taken on the initiative of the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I now wish to establish my case and suggest that the denials of the Government, which were treated at the time with rational scepticism by me, have ended up being less than plausible and have been treated by the Opposition and the Greek community in this country with some anger. Early in April 1978, at the time of the arrests in Australia, the newspapers reported, as they reported many things as a result of Commonwealth Police briefings, that plans had been made to extradite a further 300 people from Greece. One can remember that there was a suggestion at the time that there would be 1,000 people arrested in Australia. That did not come to pass. In fact, no people were extradited from Greece. Interestingly enough, none of the returning Greek pensioners, some of whom I spoke about last night, who had attended the accused doctors, have been arrested or charged in this country on their return. </PARA>
<PARA> Detective Chief Inspector Thomas, who is now a legal practitioner in Sydney, having been invalided out of the Commonwealth Police, assisted by Detective Inspector Wheatley, visited Greece in June-July 1978 and again in January-February 1979. The request for assistance which he bore from the Australian Government asked for the Greek Republic's assistance in the investigation 'of several incriminating actions which have taken place in Australia'. The document I have before me details as fact, not as allegations, that from 1971 six doctors had issued false medical certificates claiming that the persons mentioned in them were sick and unable to work. It specifies the nine people, giving a rundown of their alleged felonies as if they were proven facts, about whom the Commonwealth Police wanted information in Greece. The same nine people were later charged and indicted by the Greek police in April 1980. The request for assistance was, in fact, a request to the Greek Government to charge on behalf of the Australian Government people whom the Australian Government could not extradite. </PARA>
<PARA> The second document to which I shall refer is a report of an interview by the Greek Police-the first of the reports from this source which I wish to quote-of Chief Detective Inspector Thomas under oath on 24 July 1978 on the first of that Detective's visits to Greece and nine months before the Commonwealth outlined its case in the committal hearings in Sydney. Chief Detective Inspector Thomas stated that he was in Greece on behalf of the Australian Government to investigate, with the help of the Greek Police, a fraud against the Australian Government based on false and bogus medical evidence. He gave details of how the frauds were allegedly perpetrated and claimed that the fraud had cost the Australian Government $6.5m, excluding Medibank, in 1977-78-a figure which has never been substantiated. Four of the nine people arrested in Greece later are, in fact, named in this document. </PARA>
<PARA> The next reference is a court report of the court of the first instance of 13 February 1979. I point out that that was the second time that Chief Detective Inspector Thomas was in Athens and, again, the detective was under oath. This time he put as fact again sworn evidence about seven of the people subsequently arrested, with details of social services received, the alleged fraud each had committed and how each had committed that fraud. He said also that apart from those seven people there were another 100 or so people of Greek origin who succeeded in similar ways in getting sickness benefits and invalid pensions. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> These people are living in Greece and I will, at an appropriate time, provide you with a list of their names. </PARA>
<PARA>Presumably he was speaking of the court. I put it to the Senate that Detective Thomas was not giving useful background information to the police and the magistrates. He was giving the Commonwealth Police's version of what had occurred so that the Greek Government would take action, action which he could not take because there was no extradition treaty. The examining magistrate, on the basis of Chief Detective Inspector Thomas's evidence, pronounced that there was what in Greece is called a 'penal offence' and an 'accusation' against the nine people named by Thomas. The same nine people were subsequently arrested. The magistrate reported the crime and the accusation to the Council of Courts of Petty Sessions, a body composed of three judges which met on 1 April 1980 in the company of the District Attorney and the secretary of the Council. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the Council's report it was decided that fraud had occurred and that a large number of Greek migrants residing in Australia had conspired against the State and had, without having suffered any illness, succeeded in getting sickness benefits and invalid pensions through false doctors' certificates. Among the persons who conspired against the Australian state were the nine people involved, following the evidence of the witness Thomas Donald or, as we know him, Chief Detective Inspector Donald Thomas. The council's report went into considerable detail based on Detective Thomas's assertions and concluded that it was evident that all the defendants were conspirators and dangerous-the Greek terms used in Greek courts. The report states that there was enough evidence to support publicly the accusations and that these people were punishable by Greek law. The same actions which the court said were punishable by Australian law were the basis for the court's decision that the defendants should appear before the court of appeal and undergo trial. They were arrested. They were detained. They were, in Greek parlance 'gravely suspect of guilt and suspect of trying to escape'. They were to be taken into custody until a final judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the Council was released on 2 May 1980. I do not know when it was first reported in the Greek Press but the first report in the Australian Press was on 27 May 1980. The Attorney-General claimed on 10 March this year that he was unable to inform me of the exact dates when he learned about the charges and indictments of the nine people arrested. Quite frankly, I find it strange that there is no trace of a cable or a report on the files of his Department or the Department of Foreign Affairs, but I find many things about this affair strange. The same reply told me that the Crown Solicitor had initiated inquiries through diplomatic channels following the report of 27 May, but that certainly did not result in a well-informed Attorney-General and certainly not a well-informed Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Daily Telegraph report in May 1980 was printed when the Parliament was in recess. In the first week of the sitting resuming I asked either Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle or Senator Durack to tell the Parliament what was happening, what part the Australian Government was taking and what assistance was being given to the Greek Government. Senator Durack answered the question first and said that it would not be appropriate for him to make a statement and that he would ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the matter. He finally stated that the Government had taken no part in the proceedings. Three months after the news had been broken the Attorney-General, firstly, was reluctant to make any comment on the Australian-Greek citizens arrested-and for all I know some may still be in gaol-on charges related to the massive arrests in Australia. Secondly, he denied the Government's participation in the proceedings. We now have documents which show the role of the Government in initiating these proceedings and providing evidence for these proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> We must ask ourselves, and I believe we must ask the Attorney-General, just how ignorant he and his Department have been of the sworn evidence of Chief Detective Inspector Thomas which led directly to the arrests and the charging of these people. Certainly the denials to the Parliament that the Government was involved resulted in the Parliament being misled. Perhaps it was the Department that misled the Minister; perhaps it was another department such as the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Department of Administrative Services. Maybe the Minister was not as candid in his replies to parliamentary questions as I believe our system requires. As we now know, it was then Chief Detective Inspector Thomas who was responsible through the Commonwealth Police to the Minister for Administrative Services who gave direct evidence to the Greek Police the Greek magistrates and the Greek court. My colleague, the shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, put a series of questions without notice directly to the Minister for Administrative Services, which included. </PARA>
<PARA> Is the Minister aware that the action in Greece is alleged to have been taken at the instigation of the Australian Government and on information supplied by Inspector Don Thomas?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister at the time, Mr McLeay, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . whatever action was taken in Greece was taken on the initiative of the Greek Government and in no way was it taken on the initiative of the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The Attorney-General had earlier stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The firm advice from the Australian Federal Police was that no request was made to the Greek authorities to initiate any proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>I simply do not understand how a responsible Minister can learn that nine Australians of Greek origin had been arrested in Athens on charges corresponding to highly sensitive and well-publicised arrests in Sydney two years earlier and not ask questions of public servants in his own Department and of his colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Administrative Services. I do not understand why he did not wonder how Greek pensioners could be indicted without evidence supplied from Australia and, if they could not, from where, in what detail, from what files and by whose hand that evidence had come. We now know more than what Senator Durack or other Ministers have ever told us. Detective Inspector Thomas was the agent involved in passing across the evidence. We know that his sworn evidence was the evidence that incriminated the nine people who were arrested and, it appears, imprisoned. </PARA>
<PARA> Is the Senate to believe that then Chief Detective Inspector Thomas did not report to his superior officers and, through them, to his Minister, the Minister for Administrative Services at the time, that he had, while in Greece, given to investigating officers there and before the examining magistrate his version of the alleged crimes of those same nine people arrested and confined by the Greek Police? Are we to believe that the Commonwealth Government, having requested assistance from the Greek Government, did not follow up the consequences of that request which led through Thomas's evidence to the order by the Council of the Courts to take the nine people named in the request into custody as a social danger, as it is described in Greece? Having put the request, did the Government in fact show no more interest, that is, until the Opposition in this place and the Greek Press in this country started asking questions?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) claimed on 25 February 1981 that the Australian Federal Police had received no official advice from the Greek Government on this matter. What kind of service is that? We sent over a senior policeman with a stack of evidence on nine people, as a result of which those nine people were arrested. Was there really no feedback at official, or unofficial, level?</PARA>
<PARA> On the same day the Minister informed me that there had been no requests for assistance or evidence from the Australian Government in connection with the nine indicted people. We now know why. The Government and our agent, Detective Inspector Thomas, had supplied all that evidence freely and unasked before the arrests occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Information-I suggest even evasion-has had to be dragged out of Ministers in this Parliament. On 9 September 1980 Senator Durack said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am still not in a position to make a full and proper answer to that question of Senator Grimes. It is a matter of continuing concern and I trust that I will be able to make a statement in relation to it. </PARA>
<PARA>On 5 December 1980 he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Some information was obtained quite recently from the Greek Government. I do not have detailed information . . . Several pieces of information have been obtained . . . and they need to be put together in a full answer. </PARA>
<PARA>Three weeks ago I asked again and was told by Senator Durack:</PARA>
<PARA> I will have to refresh my mind as to the present situation. I have not a sufficiently up-to-date report on the cases. As I have said in the past, the only involvement of the Australian Government in these cases is the fact that we have made representations in relation to immunity and pardons that were given to some of the people charged. I will look into the matter and get an up-to-date answer for Senator Grimes. </PARA>
<PARA>Up until this date I have not received that answer. Nine Australian Greek citizens were arrested in Athens 18 months ago on information given three years ago on the say-so of an Australian police officer with or without-I believe with-the knowledge and concurrence of responsible Ministers. Yet these responsible Ministers are not sufficiently concerned to keep themselves informed. Their willingness to remain ignorant and to keep this Parliament ignorant on the matter is quite frankly stunning. </PARA>
<PARA> In another aspect of this affair the attitude of the Government and the authorities is, to say the least, casual. While the nine pensioners in Athens have remained on fraud charges, most of those involved in the same case who were on charges in this country have had those charges dropped. Of the pensioners charged in Sydney, 32 had all charges dropped in January 1979, at the time Detective Chief Inspector Thomas was giving his alleged facts to the magistrate in Athens. Another 32 had the conspiracy charges dropped by June 1979. Senator Chaney, then representing the Minister for Administrative Services, gave as the reason for the withdrawal of those charges 'the admissible evidence available in each case was insufficient to establish a prima facie case'. On 30 October 1980 the Government dropped conspiracy charges against the remaining 111 defendants who were not in court. It discharged 38 people completely and said it would lay substantive charges only against the other 73 people. This meant that the only people still charged with conspiracy were the original 20 still in court from March 1979, whose trial has dragged on for 350 sitting days at a cost of $7m. One defendant died of a heart attack during the commital hearings in Sydney. Those hearings are still going on after 2 1/2 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that half the defendants had charges completely dropped while the others who were not already in court had theirs commuted to minor charges I believe changed the whole situation in regard to the approach taken by the Commonwealth Government, a situation which must have relevance to the overseas charges. I asked Senator Durack whether the information that charges had been dropped against so many of the alleged original conspirators had been passed on to the Greek Government, what legal advice had been forwarded at the time on how those judgments were made and what kind of cases were dropped and which cases were continued. He replied, in his usual considered way:</PARA>
<PARA> I am not sure whether that information has yet been conveyed to the Greek authorities. I will inquire from my Department as to what occurred there. But I certainly agree that that is evidence which ought to be conveyed to them. However, I think from the information that has come from the Greek authorities, there has not been any particular urgency in conveying that information to them. </PARA>
<PARA>What kind of fair play is it to let off the people here and not be in any hurry to tell the Government in Greece, which had arrested and gaoled nine of that group on unsubstantiated assertions by Inspector Thomas in 1978 and early 1979 when the Government was still gung-ho about the whole affair and before the Government was seen to be so bogged down in the committal hearings of the first 21 defendants. A further answer from Senator Durack on 26 March said that on 5 March 1981 the Australian Embassy was advised that the matter had been referred back to the Public Prosecutor of the Court of Misdemeanours for further investigation. The solicitor for two of the defendants had estimated it would be another year before any trial date would be set. </PARA>
<PARA> So the trial which was to be in July 1980 is now to be postponed until 1982. I am aware that these matters are out of the Australian Government's hands but the consequences it has put in train by its request for assistance in July 1978 and the consequences of the sworn evidence, the assertions made by the Government's agent in 1978 and 1979, should be seriously considered by the Government. We really need to know how much the Greek Government was told of the reasons for having the charges dropped. As soon as the magistrate has pronounced on the evidence in the committal hearings that too should be passed to the Greek Government. </PARA>
<PARA> One other strange aspect of the arrested overseas pensioners is the situation of Miss Artopolou who was among the nine people arrested. Those who have followed the case may remember she was given a pardon in Australia by the Governor-General 'in regard to the nature of the evidence she was thought to be able to give in the case'. In spite of that pardon, she was indicted in Greece as a result of Detective Chief Inspector Thomas's statements. It may be remembered that she was brought from Greece to give evidence in the Sydney hearings in August 1979. After nine days of giving evidence she was withdrawn at the request of the Crown-although she was a Crown witness-the Assistant Crown Prosecutor having called her unco-operative and her evidence unreliable. Was there any discussion between the Australian and Greek Governments on the extent of that pardon and its relevance to the charges in Athens?</PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect concerns Mr H. F. Woltring of the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Sydney. Mr Woltring went to Greece in connection with the alleged socal security conspiracy cases for four days in February 1980, the month before the Council of the Courts met on 19 March 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> A further question to Senator Durack led to my being informed that he did not meet with officials of the Government concerned with the court case, but that he travelled to Athens in order to accompany a prosecution witness to Australia as that witness had set as a condition of his return that he be accompanied by an Australian officer. I, and I believe other honourable senators, should be puzzled by this. If the witness required an escort because he feared danger then an Australian Federal Police officer would have been far more appropriate. There can have been no reason for such a senior legal officer from the Attorney-General's Department being involved in escort duty. We have to take Senator Durack's word, coming from his own Department, that Mr Woltring did not meet anyone connected with the Athens cases, but I would like to know who he did meet and why a principal legal officer was chosen to bring back a prosecution witness. I would also like to know whether that witness was Mr Nakis, the Government's informant, and what is his situation now. It may be remembered that he too was granted immunity and a pardon in Australia. Was that pardon, unlike that of Miss Artopolou, extended to Athens?</PARA>
<PARA> However, these are minor questions compared with the important one of the involvement of the Australian Government in the Athens charges and why the Australian Government bothered to deny it at all. It has been a matter of great concern to the Greek community in Australia. On 17 June 1980 the Hellenic Herald commented:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we consider it our duty to underline that the action of the Greek authorities shows servility to the Australians who for months have been trying unsuccessfully to clear up this case and to pin-point the guilty . . . It is ridiculous and servile for Greek courts to try to appear more Australian than Australian courts. They should have waited for the verdict of the Australian courts before taking any legal action. </PARA>
<PARA>Another Greek newspaper, the Nea Poreia, on 15 July 1980 asked how it was possible for Australian citizens, living in Greece and receiving Australian pensions, to be tried in a Greek court. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if no explanation is given there will be an impression that there is 'collusion' between the Greek and Australian Governments to find an excuse for the Australian Government to stop all pensions in Greece. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe this is a serious matter. In Greece nine people have been charged with offences committed in Australia against Australian law. The basis for those charges is evidence sworn on at least two occasions, six months apart, by a detective inspector involved in the social security conspiracy case in this country. He stated to the Press in this country that more than 1,000 people would be charged in this case. We know that that was a gross exaggeration and that 300 people were to be charged and extradited from Greece; but that has happened to no one. We know that as a result of the efforts of the then Commonwealth Police Force, the Attorney-General's Department and the Crown Solicitor's Division, most of the people have had the charges against them dropped. We know that the chief participants in the case-Detective Thomas and Mr Lanigan, then of the Department of Social Security-are now comfortably retired from the Public Service and both in lucrative legal practises in Sydney. We know that the prosecutor in the case in Sydney, who has received over $400,000, was involved equally in a less than salubrious case, the Sankey case, in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We have quite clear evidence of Australian government involvement. I do not believe that Ministers could have been ignorant of that involvement at the time. Ministers have pleaded ignorance, evaded the questions, and left this Parliament in ignorance. I believe it is time we had a full and proper statement on this matter. If the Opposition can get this information from Greece, surely the Government can get it and clarify matters for the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly there is one matter on which I agree with Senator Grimes, and this is that the facts, insofar as we know them, do present a matter of serious concern. When Senator Grimes has asked me questions over the last year or more, I have indicated the concern I have had about some aspects of the matter. Unfortunately, a number of circumstances have made it difficult at any one time to provide a full statement to the Parliament in relation to the matter. Even now I do not have all the facts that I would like to have. If the Opposition has been able to obtain some more information-it appears that it has, and Senator Grimes has mentioned some-I will be very interested to study in the Hansard the further information he has provided because it will help to put all the pieces together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Difficulties have been encountered which have prevented me from giving a full statement. Questions have been asked of me by Senator Grimes from time to time, and I have endeavoured to provide answers. When he has asked me questions without notice, with months elapsing between them, and it has been very difficult to give answers there and then, I have subsequently, as far as possible, provided the answers. Questions have been put on notice and answers have been given to them. There is probably some value in the matter being raised this afternoon. It is true that there is no full statement which puts all the pieces together as far as they are known at the moment. In fact, Senator Grimes has put the thought in my mind that it may be proper to make a statement to the Parliament at some stage. At this stage I would like to try to get some more information. </PARA>
<PARA> The other difficulty I face in providing answers to Senator Grimes's questions is that a number of departments are involved. I, as Attorney-General, am involved only in relation to the witnesses we have called and who have been charged in Greece. As well, we have some other peripheral involvement, I think some of which Senator Grimes has mentioned. I have expressed, and I again express, some general concern that Australians who are Greek nationals living in Greece should be charged with alleged offences committed in Australia. However, regretfully that is not an unusual situation. We are aware of the dual nationality problem of a number of migrants to Australia. Honourable senators must be very familiar with this problem. In Continental law, one's nationality remains and apparently one can be charged as a national with offences committed in other countries against the laws of those countries. To that extent there is an assertion of power by those countries which we do not always make in Australian law. On the other hand, some Australian laws do not apply in those circumstances. I instance the law relating to whaling, which was passed by this Parliament not so very long ago. Dual nationality is certainly a problem, and I am not at all happy about the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps something more could be done in representations to the Greek Government in relation to these people. In that area there has certainly been a necessity to involve the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street). I, as Attorney-General, do not deal directly with the Greek Government. I have to put any representations to the Government through my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I have in fact done that in this case, as I have already explained. Furthermore, and perhaps more importantly, responsibility for Detective Inspector Thomas's activities in Greece comes under the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman), who is responsible for the Australian Federal Police, and on many occasions I have had to get information from the police about these activities. So there has been a combination of circumstances which I mention by way of explanation as to why the information that has been made available in relation to this case may have been given in bits and pieces over a period. I can see some basis for Senator Grimes's complaint that the information has not all been put together. As I said, I will look at the matter to see whether a more detailed statement, putting all the information together as best we can, should be made. </PARA>
<PARA> The other and final difficulty I have had in this case-I think my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs has also had this difficulty-is getting timely and detailed information from the Greek authorities. I became so frustrated with the situation that earlier this year I wrote to His Excellency Mr Stamatis, the Minister for Justice, because I felt that it was necessary to make some more immediate contact with the Greek authorities. Incidentally, I wrote to Mr Stamatis on 23 June this year but I have not had a reply. We are trying to get some information through the Australian Embassy in Athens in relation to the matter. The latest information we received through the Embassy was at the end of August this year. That is the latest information we have been able to get. </PARA>

If he has other information which he has not been able to convey in the time available to him I would also be very happy to receive it because I think it could be of assistance in putting the whole story together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The latest information that I have been able to get through the Australian Embassy in Athens is to the effect that the Ministry of Justice hopes to be able to provide an answer in the near future-some fairly vague period is mentioned-to the letter that I wrote in June. The Australian Embassy comments that an election will be held in Greece on 18 October and that perhaps people are waiting until after the election is held before they provide any further information. It may be that more direct contact has to be made with the Greek authorities than has been made so far. All I can do is convey to the Senate the information that I have been able to obtain from time to time. I have done my best to provide that information to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not appreciate suggestions that I have been less than frank with the Senate, much less that I have been engaged in misleading the Senate. I readily confess that there has been a lack of adequate information in relation to this matter and I have felt the same frustration throughout this business. The latest information about the situation was conveyed in an answer to Senator Grimes by me on 26 March 1981. I think I should read the answer to that question because it really is the latest information. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All right, Senator Grimes, I acknowledge that you have been able presumably to get some later information. I told the honourable senator that I would be very happy if he gave it to me. I will read to the Senate the relevant parts of that question on notice which appeared in the Hansard of 26 March 1981. It stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In November 1980 I was advised that appeals against the Order of Committal were being examined by the Public Prosecutor of the Court of Appeals who would, in due course, submit his recommendations to the Council of Magistrates of the Court of Appeals. I was informed that a date for the hearing of the charges would await the outcome of any appeals. </PARA>
<PARA> On 5 March 1981 the Embassy advised that the recommendation of the Public Prosecutor was accepted by the Council of Magistrates and that the matter had been referred back to the Public Prosecutor of the Court of Misdemeanours for further investigation. The solicitor for two of the defendants has estimated that it will be at least another year before any trial date is set. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not to be necessarily assumed from the information given in that answer that a trial is going to take place at any particular date or, I would suggest, even at all. The immediate and primary concern, apart from the general concern of Australian citizens being charged in Greece with offences that, if committed at all, were committed in Australia against Australian law, which I have had in my capacity as Attorney-General is in relation to three people who were brought out to Australia to give evidence in the committal proceedings in Australia and to whom I gave immunities and in one case a pardon for particular reasons I have already discussed at length in the Senate. These three people, who are witnesses in Australia and who were given immunity from any offences that may have been committed in Australia, are three of the nine people who have been charged. This matter has given me really serious concern. It has been the subject of the representations I have made to the Ministry of Justice both through the Department of Foreign Affairs and, as I said, in one case earlier this year, in a letter which I wrote to the Minister himself. It is in respect of that matter that I am most concerned to obtain a response and endeavour to do all I can to stop the trial going on in relation to those three people. As I have said, they have been given an immunity from prosecution for any offence they may have committed in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the information we have is that the matter has gone back for further consideration by the Public Prosecutor and we are awaiting the outcome of that. We are advised that it may be some little time yet, possibly after the elections, before we will get any further response to those representations. I do not know that I can say anything more in relation to the matter of public importance submitted by Senator Grimes. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Grimes may recall that his first question on this subject was directed to the then Minister for Social Security, not me. I intervened in the matter because I had already become aware of this matter, I think, a few weeks before the honourable senator asked me a question in September of last year. At that time I had already written to my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs in regard to the problem about three of the nine people who had been given an immunity by me. The honourable senator then raised the question about whether the Government had initiated these proceedings. I have always understood that to mean the prosecution itself. Certainly, the official Government understanding of this matter is that when Mr Thomas had to go to Greece to obtain, or try to obtain, evidence for use in the Australian courts he carried with him a request for legal assistance and that is set out in my answer of 11 September 1980. I think the facts as we understood them to be, and still understand them to be, are set out in that answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Certainly in Greek law an Australian police officer cannot go to Greece and make his investigations as he would in Australia. He has to go through the Greek legal channels and in fact it is the Greek authorities who do the interviewing. Mr Thomas had to provide these people with the information that he had to assist in the obtaining of evidence for use in Australia. That is the position as we understand it. As I said, as far as we are concerned he went there for the purpose of gaining evidence for use in Australia. He certainly did not have any authority to seek to initiate prosecution of people in Greece. We may be able to obtain more information about that point. The honourable senator says that he has further evidence that indicates that Mr Thomas went further than that. I am certainly most concerned to hear of that. I would like to obtain further information if there is any indication that he went further than that. If he did, then of course that provides very strong grounds for the Australian Government to take direct steps in relation to all of these people, not just the three to whom we have given the immunity. I have taken a very clear note indeed of what Senator Grimes has said about that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think I can take the matter any further than that this afternoon. I will certainly study what further information Senator Grimes has provided the Senate in his speech, a speech which of course had been carefully prepared for him. I might say that I had notice only this morning that he intended to raise this matter. That has not given me much time to prepare an answer in a matter which involves so much detail and so many different departments. To that extent I am at some disadvantage in dealing with this matter this afternoon. That is why I say I will study the other information which the honourable senator has given us the benefit of in his address this afternoon and which will be printed in Hansard. If the honourable senator has any other information which he feels will be of assistance to me or to the Australian Government in trying to ascertain any further details about this matter I will be grateful to receive it. As I have said all along, I am concerned about this matter. I have a particular and serious concern about the situation of the three people in Greece to whom I have given an immunity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to Senator Georges for calling honourable senators into the chamber for what I believe is an item of national importance. I will continue the comments I made yesterday in relation to education. Last night before the adjournment I had gone through a number of items that were of concern in the funding of universities within Australia and had sought to detail, with reference to the University of Queensland, how a variety of departments were affected in their research capacity. I wish today to mention briefly one more area which I believe is one of the most important areas being affected by the cuts in funds. The Department of Microbiology at the University of Queensland has, or has had, a world wide reputation for its research and knowledge in relation to microbialmetabolism. While this may seem to be an esoteric subject to many people in Australia, I think that if people took the time and trouble to find out something more about the incredibly important areas of research being conducted within our universities the silly types of editorial in today's Australian Financial Review would not be written.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to the program which has been conducted over the last 13 years by members of the department who are looking at the area of oxygen in microbialmetabolisms. The leader of that research team has gained a world wide reputation in that time. In recent years he has been the recipient of one invitation after another from those countries which see this as the growth industry. He is on the executive of international biotechnological organisations and is the consultant for this work with the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation. I point out again that this type of work is an example of the excellent work that is being done by our universities, work which unfortunately is virtually unknown in this country because it goes unreported. In pursuing biotechnology the Department of Microbiology established in 1980, in co-operation with the Department of Chemical Engineering, a post-graduate course. The number of students it has been able to attract is impressive because this field is seen overseas as the growth industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In support of that statement let me point out that in Japan, which at least as an example in the world of a country which has never been sluggard in moving into new industries, microbial industries are currently generating over 5 per cent of total taxable income. The fact that a country like Japan, which always is in the forefront of countries entering new industries, is able to do that at least should make us pause. Those people who know the area of biotechnology will know that this is the area into which we will be going after the computer industry. In other words, it is so vitally important that it will have more far reaching effects on Australia's civilisation, our lives and our economy than the computer industry. Most of us are aware of the types of effects of the computer. The claims that I make are not idle claims. They are claims which are backed up by the enormous amount of work which is currently being generated in countries such as Switzerland, Canada, West Germany and the United States. There was the rather absurd editorial in the Australian Financial Review which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> However, it is of interest that neither the economists . . . are being much consulted in the present noisy political campaign against the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether that was written by a frustrated academic or someone who did not make the grade but obviously this person has very little knowledge of the economies of the type of research which is currently being done in this country. I suggest that before he writes another editorial on this subject he might take himself off-I am sure it will be at the invitation of the vice-chancellors of the major universities-and at least have a tour of the major departments of the universities in this country. He should look at the type of work they are doing before he sets about denigrating people who are at the forefront of vitally important areas in this country. They are just not at the forefront of these areas as I will illustrate by reading from a letter which was written to me by a person who is conducting microbiology research at the University of Queensland. Amongst other things the letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of fees for overseas students and for second degrees in Australia will-and indications are visible-definitely kill this post-graduate training course. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, in respect of an industry of the future we have decided to cut it off in its prime. If that is not economic madness, if that is not getting into the nitty-gritty of the economy, I do not know what is. But much more importantly the writer of the letter goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Sir, with no research money from outside the University, no technician or laboratory attendant or research assistance to help me in my research work,--</PARA>
<PARA>It should be remembered that this is the person who is recognised as the world's authority in this area of research, and we do have them in Australia--</PARA>
<PARA>Postgraduate courses are doomed, our worldwide research reputation is reduced to mainly undergraduate teaching. The present research is carried out by the few postgraduate students. With the diminishing numbers of postgraduate awards, I can even see that this effort will be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to make a point which I would like to emphasise. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Is it a wonder that we will look elsewhere? So far, I always turned down lucrative overseas offers, because I do not want to leave this country and wanted to help in the education and research of Australians. I am not certain that I will be able to maintain this attitude and also wonder as to how many of my colleagues think along the same lines. </PARA>
<PARA>That person is not being disloyal to Australia. He has information and knowledge which is not Australia's preserve; it is knowledge which is needed by the world. People are now saying to this academic who has worked hard and long in his field and who is in demand throughout the rest of the world: 'Well, why do you sit in a place like that where you cannot get money, where you cannot get research funds, where you cannot get support? How can you justify staying at such a university when the knowledge that you have is so vital to the rest of the world?' That is the type of proposition that is being put to our best brains in Australia because the universities in this country are disintegrating. While the Government places great store on the necessity for overseas investment in Australia it does not seem to have the faith or the wisdom to invest in our own future by investing in our own citizens and their education. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to the Government and to the person who wrote that editorial in the Australian Financial Review that the people we do not train today, we buy tomorrow; that the technology we do not generate in this country today, we buy tomorrow. The Government knows that we were the leaders in solar research in the world. We now do not even rate a mention. There are so many other areas in which we have led the world and then sold out our own citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> The universities, contrary to the comments made in the Australian Financial Review, do work hard and they make do with very little. They provide this country with a massive backbone of expertise. They produce our technologists, our business managers, our doctors, our dentists, our scientists, our researchers and they do that on very little by world standards. The denigration of these institutions by expecting them to get by on less and less every year is a national disgrace. Unfortunately, the types of problems that will show up will not show up by the next election. We are not talking about an election issue. We are talking about the future of this country. The problems will show up in 15 or 20 years when none of us here now will be fighting elections. Our legacy for future generations will be rundown, second rate, hack universities and colleges of advanced education and we will be buying in experts from overseas. We will be importing the knowledge in areas which we had been world leaders in getting under way. </PARA>
<PARA> I am talking about plain economics. I am not talking about any of the other things that I believe in-the Government certainly does not-that is, the fact that every Australian needs and deserves an adequate and good education and that we should develop the abilities that our people have. I am not talking about that at the moment. I am talking about plain economics. It makes good economic sense to invest in our own people. I only urge the Government before it introduces the States Grants (Tertiary Assistance) Bill of which we have had warning today, to see whether from the Budget surplus that is projected it cannot find a measly $35,000 to support a research proposal which has world-wide effects. That amount would not even have provided for the partitions in the journalists' room at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. That is the state to which we are reduced. The editorialist in the Australian Financial Review wondered why we got the types of comments we got from vice chancellors yesterday. Can any responsible vice chancellor presiding over a university disintegrating for lack of that measly, paltry sum not make a claim publicly to the rest of Australia that we must rally behind our tertiary institutions and support them? He would not be doing his job if he did not do that. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that shows the state of tertiary institutions in Australia. I make that plea before the Government brings in the Bill. From reading the variety of comments made by the Government I think I make that plea in vain, but I still think it needs to be made. What we are arguing-I know a lot of other people in the country are also-is not that we need massive injections of funds for us to leap ahead of everybody else. All we are asking for is an injection of funds to keep us where we are. We are way behind. The Government is intent on saying: 'We are pulling out the funds so you can drop further and further behind'. That shows the sorry state of tertiary education at the university level in Australia. Yet today in Question Time we heard Government members lauding an editorial, such as the one I mentioned, which denigrates academics, vice chancellors and the enormous amount of work done under incredibly difficult conditions in our universities. </PARA>
<PARA> I for one, and on the part of the Australian Democrats totally reject the accusations raised in the type of editorial. I believe that when Australians look for information in 15 or 20 years time they will look back on this Government and say: 'That is where the rot set in. That is where the rot really started and that is why we have second rate tertiary establishments in this country not able to provide even the technicians for our own developments'. In conclusion, I do not see how this Government, which has talked so much about how we should help countries not as developed as Australia, can expect us to continue such an effort if indeed we are to starve ourselves of the essential ingredients. To my mind the essential ingredients are not so much the amounts of goods we are able to generate and manufacture in this country; I think the essential goods are the knowledge, the skill, the dexterity and dedication of our people. I would much prefer we invested in those than in mines or the types of investments that seem so much to the heart of this Government. Indeed, the people of this country are our major resource. If we do not fund the education of our own people we will be a sorry country in years to come. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a previous first reading of a money Bill I discussed a trip I had had to the north of Western Australia and made some points in relation to the Aboriginal communities that I visited there. I expressed my concern at that time that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Peter Baume, had been in the area where a confrontation between white pastoralists and the Aboriginals had taken place and that he had chosen not to go to see the community involved. I want to take the opportunity given by this first reading of a money Bill to expand a little on that situation and a number of other matters that occurred whilst I was on that trip.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I made mention in my speech of 22 September of the rip-off of the public purse by the white pastoralists in the north of Western Australia when I said that there were complaints from the Aborignal people that the white pastoralists were employing them as station hands and stock hands. They were not in receipt of payment from the pastoralists but were in receipt of unemployment benefit. The information that I have to date indicates that practice is much more widespread than I was first led to believe or than I first suspected. At the time of my first speech on this matter I asked that there should be at least an inquiry by the Department of Social Security or the Department of Aboriginal Affairs into just how much of a racket this exercise is and how much it is costing the Australian taxpayer. It is certainly providing cheap labour for the white pastoralists. It may be said to be providing employment for some of the Aborigines in isolated areas where they would not be likely to gain other employment. I do not think that is the point at issue; the point at issue is that if people are employed to do some work they are entitled to be paid a proper wage by their employer for the work they do. </PARA>
<PARA> Following my visit to Halls Creek and my discussion with the Nicholson Downs people I went to Turkey Creek to speak to the Warmun people. After I had been in contact with the chairman of the Warmun community, Mr Bob Nyalcus, he very kindly made his council available to meet with me and to discuss matters of serious concern to them, matters that perhaps honourable senators may consider to be minor in our everyday lifestyle but which are major matters when it comes to people-whether they be black or white-who live in the isolation of the north of Western Australia. I assure those honourable senators who have not been there that it can be an extremely isolated, desolate and lonely place. In the main the Aboriginal communities are of course living in the extended family situation. Perhaps they do not suffer the pangs of isolation of some of the white people who live there. During my visit I spoke with Queenie McKenzie, who was most upset. I was with her community at the end of June. On 9 July the West Australian published a report of what has been happening to Queenie McKenzie. I shall quote from the article because it shows just how people in the bureaucracy can gang up and make people very angry. The article is headed 'Red tape angers Aborigines' and is written by Paul McGeough. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Queenie McKenzie's 2 1/2-year battle against bureaucracy has made her an angry woman. </PARA>
<PARA> For 13 years she has lived on the east bank of Turkey Creek near the town of the same name but has been unable to leave her humpy for new Federal Goverment-funded accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> The obstacle is that the land she wants is part of a recreation reserve vested in the Halls Creek shire. Federal Aboriginal housing funds can be used only on land vested in Aboriginal associations or the Aboriginal Land Trust. </PARA>
<PARA> She has travelled to Perth to push her case and has escorted Federal and State Ministers on tours of the site. All have said they will help expedite the claim. </PARA>
<PARA> The WA Ombudsman has also been involved but there has been no conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> Funds have been earmarked for members of her family and the Mung Mung family to be housed on the eastern bank but have had to be used elsewhere in the Warmun community because of the ownership problem . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Warmun community's file on the bid for the extra land, and for another area they wish to acquire to accommodate their expanding community, is a litany of 'under consideration' letters. </PARA>
<PARA> Speaking from Turkey Creek yesterday, Mrs McKenzie said she wanted to have proper accommodation before the next wet season. </PARA>
<PARA> 'I have goats and chickens and ducks here on the east bank,' she said. 'If I go over the other side to get a house I will have nothing left because of the dogs'. </PARA>
<PARA>In actual fact, she put it to me in these words: 'I do not want to spend the rest of my life in a humpy. I want to live in a home. I want to sleep in a bed. I want proper accommodation that will house me in a proper lifestyle through the wet and through the dry'. It turns out that the reason that the shire will not allow her to have this piece of land is that it is used on two days of each year by a gymkhana club. I would have thought that that situation could have been eased because of the amount of property that surrounds that area, which I understand at the moment is being leased for agistment to one of the white stock owners who apparently had no trouble obtaining a leasehold. I am sure that the proper people would not have any difficulty obtaining a small portion of the land to allow them to have Queenie McKenzie put her home there. But for 13 years she has been waiting to get a home. It would appear, given the speed with which our bureaucracy works, that she may be waiting another 13 years before she gets it. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . last financial year two houses were earmarked for the east bank but had not been built. </PARA>
<PARA> The community would get six houses this financial year. The McKenzies would get one if the ownership question was cleared up. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . In a letter to the Kimberley MLA, Mr Ernie Bridge . . . last month, the community chairman, Mr Bob Nyalcas, said it appeared that the Minister for Lands, Mr Wordsworth, was allowing a neighbouring station to use as a bullock paddock the land sought by the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter said that the Minister had made no allowance for the community's request. </PARA>
<PARA> The Aborigines argue that they have been using the east bank of the creek before it was included in the recreational reserve used by the Turkey Creek Gymkhana Club for two days a year. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night Mr Wordsworth agreed that the matter had dragged on for too long. </PARA>
<PARA> However, he said it had been found that the club expanded beyond the boundaries it was allowed to use. </PARA>
<PARA>The club is obviously allowed to expand beyond the boundaries that it is permitted to use, but the Aboriginal community is not allowed to do so. However, Mr Wordsworth went on to say that in discussions with the shire council it had been agreed that this matter would be investigated and it was hoped that an exchange of land could be made with the gymkhana club to allow the community to have its site; that the community had run into problems because the land was under title; and that the situation of newcomers, such as the roadhouse further down, was different because they were seeking vacant Crown land. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of the roadhouse is a contentious one as far as the Aboriginal community is concerned. It is very close to the Warmun community's housing site. The members of the community are concerned because obviously the roadhouse supplies alcohol to the workers in the Argyle Downs area, who are now coming down in great numbers to this locality. They are concerned that, having moved their community into an area where they can determine whether or not they will allow alcohol, that determination is endangered because of the close proximity of the roadhouse. That is one of the additional problems I found. </PARA>
<PARA> I decided, having some three months prior to my visit notified the mission station at Kalumburu that I would be visiting their area, that this would be an ideal opportunity for me to undertake that trip. I must admit to experiencing an enormous amount of trouble, as a member of Parliament, in seeing people that one is supposed to represent. I notified Father Sanz that it was my intention to visit. I also notified the chairman of the Kalumburu community, Mr John Maraltadj, by letter some three months prior to my visit. Some 10 days prior I also sent a telegram to Father Sanz and one to Mr John Maraltadj. I sent them at a time of day when I knew they would be within the radio schedule for that afternoon. On arriving home fairly late, at 5.30 p.m. or a quarter to six, I found that a telegram had just been phoned through to the effect that my visit would not be welcome at that time because plans were changing. It was signed 'John Maraltadj, Chairman'. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought that was a little strange as in my past dealings with the community it had always made me feel that any visit I made to Kalumburu would be quite welcome. It was interesting to note that I received from the mission neither an acknowledgement of my letter or of my telegram. During conversations with the Kimberley Land Council in Derby I mentioned the fact that I intended to go there the following week and would like to think that I had the permission of the community. I was informed that the President of the Kimberley Land Council had spent the previous week with Mr John Maraltadj and that John had not mentioned receiving a telegram from me. I found that rather strange in view of the fact that it was at a time when there was some controversy about Kalumburu, its administration, and the paternalistic approach that continued to be adopted by the mission. I was aware that plans referred to in the response to my telegram were under way because of my contact with the Kimberley Land Council. I had been informed some ten days before of the actual day of the proposed movement by the Kalumburu people from the mission. I could have informed the mission of the date but I did not because I did not think that it was my place to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I was more than disturbed to find that I had received a telegram, supposedly from the chairman, John Maraltadj and then been informed by the Chairman of the Kimberley Land Council that to the best of his knowledge my telegram had not been received. </PARA>
<PARA> Recognising that the mission mans the radio schedule, one can only assume that someone is tampering with the Queen's mail, in that my telegram to John Maraltadj was intercepted and was responded to by mission staff. That disturbs me more than a little because it is an indication that the communities are not being advised of what is happening elsewhere and that decisions which may be detrimental to them are made. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in company with a Victorian member of the House of Representatives and his wife I decided to continue my plan to got to Kalumburu. I was then told that there was a NOTAM on the Kalumburu strip. I believe that is the technical expression and that it stands for 'Notice To Airmen'. This obviously meant that the Kalumburu strip, at the determination of the mission, was out of bounds to everybody. The Kimberley Land Council had informed me that that was going to be the case but I had said that as I had given prior notice of my visit I did not foresee any problem and it was still my intention to visit Kalumburu. I was told that the airstrip had been blocked so that private charter aircraft could not make contact with the community without the mission station first giving permission. Apparently a private charter firm from, I believe, Kununurra had taken out people to the mission station and the missionaries, having decided that they were not to meet with the community, had closed the strip. </PARA>
<PARA> Having been told of the NOTAM on the Kalumburu airstrip, I endeavoured to get in touch with Bishop Jobst in Broome. He was not available so I contacted New Norcia and spoke to the priest in charge. I was told that my visit would be welcome and every facility would be made available to both myself and the member of the House of Representatives to visit Kalumburu. On arriving at the airport the next morning I was informed by the Department of Transport officers that there was no way in which my pilot was going to be given permission to land at Kalumburu. First, the schedule did not open until 10 or 10.30 a.m., so they could not get a message through to the station to ask whether in fact I was going to be welcome. I then informed them that if necessary I would put through a call to New Norcia to confirm that I had been given permission by Father Bruce to go. </PARA>
<PARA> Eventually we were allowed to take off. I know that I am a little naive, and it was something that I did not pick up until later on, but I was not at all concerned when we landed to find a large number of petrol drums on the side of the airstrip. Being naive, I assumed that they were there for the purpose of refuelling aircraft. I was told when I re- turned to Kununurra later that night that these were the drums that had been placed on the strip to make sure that there was no outside contact with the Aboriginal community at Kalumburu. I must confess that all facilities were made available to Mr and Mrs Milton and myself while we were at the mission. We were informed that we could go anywhere and talk to anybody we liked. </PARA>
<PARA> The interesting thing was that neither Father Sanz nor Mr John Maraltadj was there, but I did speak to a large number of the community, all of whom were extremely surprised to find that I had sent a letter and a telegram to John telling him of my intention to come, because he had not discussed it with them. It is most remarkable in an Aboriginal community when matters are not discussed by the chairman with either his councillors or, as a general rule, all of the community. I would not think that if in fact that telegram or letter had been received by John Maraltadj he would have failed to discuss it with some of the people there. His mother informed me that he had not told her that he had received a recent telegram from me. So I have no reason to believe that he did receive it. I have to contend that my telegram was intercepted by the mission staff, who answered it on his behalf, which is more than a little paternalistic on their part. The mission staff are obviously adopting a 'holier than thou' attitude and saying 'I will determine who you will talk to and who you will not'. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a lot of discussion in the Western Australian newspapers about the situation which exists on Kalumburu. One matter which has been discussed is the midday handout of what is supposed to be a hot meal. The meal is ladled out through a grill-that is the only way in which one could describe it. It is brought out from the Mission buildings in a large cauldron before being ladled out into billy cans. The meal appears to be a mixture of rice and water with something that could even be carrot. There is very little of it. The meal looked like slush to me and I would not have offered it to anybody to eat. The interesting thing was that while I was around one side of the Mission watching that midday handout Mr Milton was on the other side of the Mission. When we met on the plane later he said: 'They cannot really complain about the type of meal with which they are provided at midday. I was impressed with those beautiful steaks on the barbecue'. Of course, the beautiful steaks on the barbecue were for the mission staff and certainly not for the black people at the mission. They had been given their portion-that billy can of rice. I forgot to mention the eggs which were on top. If they were not hard boiled they would not be in an edible state by the time the people got them back to their humpies or houses. </PARA>
<PARA> The word 'humpy', in most people's minds, conjures up a canvas tent of some sort, but that is not necessarily what I would regard as a humpy. I would regard a humpy as a broken down building which is inhabited by people and which is not very well looked after either inside or outside. That is exactly what exists in certain sections on that mission station at Kalumburu. For instance, the elderly people live in the most incredible circumstances. The mission gardens are a picture. I suppose one could say that the area outside the houses which appear to be provided to the younger Aboriginals, because they are healthy and are able to work, is in reasonably good condition. The homes in which the elderly people live could only be described as humpies. They are in a disgraceful condition. The people did not look well. Certainly they did not look as if they were living on a mission station and being cared for. That is part of the problem at Kalumburu. The paternalistic attitude which is being adopted by the mission staff is such that the Aboriginals have not been able to develop as people. </PARA>
<PARA> The people moved from Kalumburu to the adjoining station. It is interesting to note that when I asked Father Umberto whether all the people had returned he said: 'Yes, all except two. One was a woman and she wanted to bring her de facto husband here but we could not allow that'. Who is to determine who is going to live with whom? Who on this earth has the right to say to another human being: 'You will not associate with such a person because I say so'? Who has that right? Certainly, the mission staff do not. If that is the custom and if it is accepted by the balance of the community then that is something which is accepted by that society and should be permitted-if permission is required, which I doubt. That is the extremely dangerous and volatile situation at the moment. It has been eased to a large extent by the fact that Father Sanz has now been moved from Kalumburu. It is interesting to note also that only two weeks ago in the National Times there was a letter from Bishop Jobst of Broome lauding the virtues of Father Sanz and describing how the Aborigines loved him. That may have been-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was cut off in my prime, in full flight, in mid-sentence, however one likes to describe it, by the Acting Deputy President. I have warned him that as an Acting Deputy President the opportunity will arise for me to take the same action against him, I am sure. If it does not I will manufacture it. I was speaking about a letter from Bishop Jobst which appeared in the National Times two weeks ago and which said how much the Aborigines of Kalumburu loved Father Sanz. I raised the question of whether that love and affection that perhaps was there some years ago in actual fact is still there with the awakening of the Aboriginal people. That paternalistic approach is not what will fulfil their lives. We have many white people who interfere in Aboriginal affairs. It is because of that interference that the Aboriginal people are unable to fulfil themselves completely. I am not suggesting for one moment that we should provide them with large sums of money and then say that they are on their own and that they can do all things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In a moment I want to return to discussing the situation I found at Ringers Soak, but first I will deal with the situation at Kalumburu. I have already made mention of the fact that my planned visit to Kalumburu was impeded to some extent by the interference by the mission staff and, possibly, the administrators in the collection of mail which was addressed to the chairman of the Kalumburu community. He had obviously not been advised that I would be there and consequently he was not there when I arrived; I add that neither was Father Sanz. I am feeling a little happier about the situation at Kalumburu now that I have discovered that Father Sanz has left the mission and gone to New Norcia. I hope that the new administrator will recognise the problems associated with Aboriginal development and will extend to the Aboriginals the pastoral care and the normal human concern that those people require at this time. This is a very difficult period in the lives of Aboriginals in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to touch on the situation at Ringers Soak where the people from Gordon Downs have been taken. In my previous speech I made mention of some of the things which concerned me and which had not been done within 12 months of those people moving from Gordon Downs to Ringers Soak. I made mention of the fact that a well had been left without a top covering it so that any young child could fall into it. What concerned me also-this matter was raised on my behalf by another colleague at the Estimates committees-was the fact that there is no provision, apparently, in the estimates for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs for immediate attention to be given to people when they find themselves in distress, as happened to the Nicholson Downs people. When they left their station they were on their own. In response to a question about that matter the Minister said that the situation was being monitored. I am saying that monitoring the situation is not quite good enough when an entire community of some 35 or 40 people are camped on the outskirts of a town with only fresh water being provided to them and with one canvas fly between all of them when there are overnight temperatures of 4 degrees. In those circumstances the Minister cannot say that his Department is only monitoring the situation. That is not quite good enough. There has to be some mechanism by which immediate assistance can be provided to those people. </PARA>

Let me make this point: At Ringers Soak I found a pathetic situation in that the leader of the group was concerned that his people had available to them fresh vegetables. He had developed a small area as a market garden. Inside an area no larger than 2 feet square were something like 200 carrot seeds which were starting to sprout. No one had bothered to give those people advice on how they should tend those carrots. That is just one example. They had melons, cabbages and everything else. Nothing had been planted in the right way because no one was there to give them advice on how to start a market garden. No one cared about the provision of fresh vegetables for the entire community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My time is limited. In the four minutes left to me I want to speak for just a moment about the report in last week's Age on the hospital at Warburton. I understand that the administrator of that hospital is leaving. All I can say is that the whole Aboriginal community at Warburton must be thankful that he is leaving. I have not read the newspaper report. I have simply been told about it. I will be checking it as soon as I have finished making my speech in this place. It would appear that the hospital services for the Aboriginal community have been so run down as to be almost entirely non-existent. At the door, which is barred and bolted, there is a screen window to prevent anybody from getting in and taking advantage of any medical services that might be available to them. Hanging inside that door is a rubber cosh. One has to question what services the hospital is supposed to be providing. The hospital is obviously not there to provide the care and medical attention to the Aboriginal community at Warburton which it should be providing. That is cause for great concern. </PARA>
<PARA> All of the things I mentioned in my speech on 22 September and which I have mentioned tonight are matters of grave concern. They are of concern to the black people of Australia. They are of concern to the white people of Australia. They are of concern to the caring people of Australia. I believe that we have seen enough paternalism, particularly since 1967. I draw on that date because that was the date of the referendum in which the entire Australian community determined that Aborigines had a proper place as proper citizens of this country. Having accepted that principle, surely to goodness it is now time to demonstrate that we are really a caring, concerned community, that we have really a caring, concerned government and that we will do our utmost to make sure that any Aboriginal program is managed by Aboriginals for Aboriginals and that its success will depend on Aboriginals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bills before the Senate are non-controversial and I feel that they are supported by both sides of the chamber. Therefore, I take this opportunity to bring to the notice of the Senate the disastrous situation in the export apple industry in my State. This past season has been a calamity for the industry. Prices in Europe have been extremely low. This is because our main competitors have had bumper crops. The European market is flooded with fruit. This is nothing new. The Tasmanian apple and pear growers in the past have faced similar situations. Over the last 10 years the industry has retracted as far as it possibly can as a direct result of European Economic Community policy. It is only just now viable. The problem of fluctuating prices is one faced not only by apple growers. Indeed, those living on the land are so used to prices going up and down and shortages and gluts that they seem to face this problem with tremendous fortitude. The Federal Government recognises this situation and, indeed, allows primary producers to equalise their tax burden to cope with the good and bad seasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, this year things are different in our Tasmanian industry. The Tasmanian Apple and Pear Marketing Authority, which deals with the export market, is now seeking a $2.8m repayment of the advances made to growers. This is the total debt facing the apple growers after all payments have been made for the 1981 season. I would like to underline the fact that the Federal Government has indeed paid more this season under its underwriting scheme than on any previous occasion. Yet the apple growers in my State start the new season with this tremendous debt hanging over their heads. It means the whole of the export industry is in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA> On the face of it, the Federal underwriting scheme is a very just scheme. It allows the underwriting figure to be reached by averaging export prices for the last four years. This year that price was $5.60 a carton. However, with the inclusion of this tremendously low season in the average for the four years, the estimated underwriting price for 1982 will be $5-a loss of 60c a carton. This reduction will mean that many growers who previously exported their full crop must think over the situation and consider local markets. The implications of Tasmanian fruit that was previously exported going on to the local markets would be understood by every senator who comes from a State where apple growers put their fruit on the local market. It would be disastrous for them but it may at least enable our apple growers to survive. </PARA>
<PARA> The present cost of growing apples in Tasmania is $3.50 a carton. That is 30c a carton less than Western Australia can manage. As I have said, our industry is a most efficient and productive one. The cost for packing and cool storage is $3 a carton. If we add to that figure inflation for 12 months of 10 per cent, the debt from the Tasmanian Apple and Pear Marketing Authority, increases in freight and wharfage, the additional running costs of TAMA and a host of other increases, we can see that the reduction in that underwriting price of 60c a carton will create insurmountable problems for next season. The growers just cannot go into the season with that enormous debt. If the apple growers were at fault through inefficiency, incompetence or lethargy I would be the first to say that industry should go. From the very first planting of an apple tree to the finished carton packed on the wharves-that is, while the apple growers in Tasmania have control over their own fruit-the industry is efficient and productive. The growers not only have kept up with the latest in new plant and cool stores but they also have invested more in this area in the past five years than in the previous 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA> So what are the problems? One is the revaluation of the Australian dollar in relation to overseas currencies and the other-the one that concerns me-lies with the fruit when it leaves the hands of the grower and is ready for shipment. I wish to give the Senate a few figures which compare Tasmanian wharfage costs with those of our main competitors. I refer firstly to the loading costs per carton. The costs are: Chile, 25c a carton; South Africa, 25c; New Zealand, our closest competitor, 32 1/2c; Brazil, 35c; Argentina, 45c and Tasmania, $1.16 a carton. That is for loading onto the ships. I also bring to the attention of honourable senators the matter of productivity-that is, the loading rate per gang hour. I refer to the same countries. Chile loads 1,185 cartons per gang hour; South Africa, 1,250 cartons; New Zealand, 1,100 cartons; Brazil, 1,000 cartons; Argentina 1,000 cartons; and Tasmania, 488 cartons per gang hour. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at those figures one wonders how the Tasmanian fruit growers were ever able to compete. We have to consider whether the Government has any responsibility for the fact that Australia has the most expensive wharfage in the world. Should an efficient and productive industry just go down the drain because we have allowed this situation to develop on our wharves? This is the question we have to answer. There is no way the Australian apple growers can continue to compete with those in other countries with this wharfage burden round their necks. When the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) rises to reply in this debate I would be grateful for his comments. I suggest that the Minister suggests to the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) in the other place that he should look at an amendment to the Export Underwriting Act enabling the lowest year of the previous four years to be disregarded when the minimum export return rate is struck. This may assist our industry. I have great confidence that the Minister in the other place will not allow our apple industry to go to the wall through no fault of its own; allow it to go to the wall because we in Australia have allowed our wharfage rates to be so much greater than in any other country. It is an efficient industry and must be able to survive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on a matter of public importance on 23 September Senator Rae refuted claims by Mr Anthony that Mr Webster, the former Chairman of the Australian Dairy Corporation, had falsely claimed on 13 October 1976 that the Australian Dairy Corporation had suspended sales of skim milk powder at below the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade minimum price. In refuting the statement of Mr Anthony, Senator Rae tabled documents supplied to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, of which he is Chairman, which proved that the Dairy Corporation had suspended sales at that time. Senator Rae then added:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . between 13 October and 15 November 1976 . . . Mr Webster negotiated a contract which involved a continuation of the breach of GATT until the end of June 1977. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Rae then asked what act occurred between those dates. He then suggested that it was an interview with the then Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Sinclair. I have since received information which confirms Senator Rae's conclusion. It shows not only that Mr Sinclair condoned breaches of GATT-he instigated them. In late 1976 the Australian Dairy Corporation had refused to issue an export certificate for skim milk powder which was to be sold at below the then GATT minimum price. A dairy products manufacturer who had been refused a certificate by the Dairy Corporation-probably by Mr Webster himself-made representations to the Minister to see what Mr Sinclair could do to assist this manufacturer. Mr Sinclair contacted Mr Webster and put pressure on him to issue a certificate on the grounds that everyone else was breaching GATT anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> Having regard to all the circumstances of the time many people might argue that Mr Sinclair's action was, if not fully justifed, then at least pardonable. What is not pardonable in his parliamentary denials of the truth about his role in the GATT breaches. He has misled Parliament not once but many times. He refused to deney his role on oath before the Senate Standing Committee on the ground that he had denied it in Parliament. The sanctions of Parliament, Mr Sinclair claimed, were more severe than the sanctions of perjury. Let the first of those sanctions now be applied; let his resign. Under no other regime in Australia's history would a Minister with Mr Sinclair's record have been allowed to remain in Cabinet. Only a Prime Minister too cowardly to stand up to the National Country Party and require it to resile from its assorted villainies would allow this country to be run like a banana republic. I know the details of some of these incidents but must withhold names to protect individuals from victimisation by the National Country Party Mafia, which controls crucial departments in this Government. Given the audacity of Mr Sinclair in toughing it out and the cowardly abdication of responsibility of the Prime Minister (Mr Fraser), there seems little hope of satisfactorily resolving this issue unless the parliamentary Liberal Party cries 'Enough' or unless the Senate inquiry into the Dairy Corporation is re-opened. I suggest that the Senate should consider that action. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN APPLE AND PEARCORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL(No. 2) 1981</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to increase the number of grower members on the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation from four to six. </PARA>
<PARA> This change has been requested by the Australian Apple and Pear Growers' Association which represents apple and pear growers on a national basis, and which nominates candidates for appointment to the Corporation as grower representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Association believes that an increase in the number of grower representatives will enable the Corporation to more fully reflect the interests of different apple and pear growing regions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accepted this view. In effect the current grower membership is sufficient only to represent major exporting areas. The growing importance of the domestic market means that we must provide the scope for fuller representation on the Corporation of those growers supplying that market. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficult export situation being faced by the industry, highlights the importance of the Corporation's domestic market promotion function and the need for a membership which will enable this function to be performed as well as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill and the changes proposed in the associated Levy Bill and Export Charge Bill are designed to increase the Corporation's capacity to carry out this task. </PARA>
<PARA> An opportunity has also been taken in the Bill to bring those sections of the Act relating to the dismissal of members and disclosure of interest into line with standard provisions in other similar legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Also the number of members who constitute a quorum has been increased from seven to eight because of the increase in total membership of the Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators. </PARA>
<PARA>APPLE AND PEAR LEVY AMENDMENT BILL 1981</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill increases the maximum rates of levy to enable the industry, should it so wish, to support greater activity by the Corporation in domestic promotion and other programs. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not change the operative rates of levy which are set by regulation. Actual charges at present are: Juicing fruit-50 cents per tonne; processing fruit-$1.00 per tonne; in any other case-5 cents per box. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Levy Act provides that fruit which is not packed in boxes but to which the box rate of levy is applicable is to be converted to a box equivalent on the basis that a box equals 18 kilograms of apples or 20 kilograms of pears. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also amends this basis so that, consistent with the weight equivalents used for similar purposes in other apple and pear legislation, a box equals 18 kilograms of either kind of fruit. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments have the support of the Australian Apple and Pear Growers' Association. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators. </PARA>
<PARA>APPLE AND PEAR EXPORT CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 1981</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill increases the maximum rate of export charge per box of fruit to bring it into line with the maximum rates provided in the associated Apple and Pear Levy Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill does not change the operative rate of charge, which is set by regulation and presently stands at five cents per box. </PARA>
<PARA> Two other amendments have been made. The weight factor used to convert fruit not packed in boxes to a box equivalent has been modified on the same lines as for the Levy Act. The Bill also amends the section dealing with the regulation-making power of the Governor-General to bring its expression into line with other legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments have the support of the Australian Apple and Pear Growers' Association. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to two of the three Bills before the Senate-the Apple and Pear Levy Amendment Bill 1981 and the Apple and Pear Export Charge Amendment Bill 1981. One levies a charge on fruits sold on the domestic market either as fresh fruit or as processed fruit, and the other levies a charge on fruit exported for the common purpose of providing for promotion and other expenses of the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation. The Bill dealing with fruits sold on the domestic market increases the maximum rate of levy. It does not necessarily increase the operative rate of levy, which is determined by regulation. The actual charges authorised by the Bill are 50c a tonne for juicing fruit, for processing fruit $1 a tonne, and for other fruit 5c for an 18 kilogram box of apples or a 20 kilogram box of pears.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Apple and Pear Export Charge Amendment Bill increases the authorised maximum rate but the present rate will remain at 5c a box. There are also some minor changes to the weight factor and some other minor changes dealing with the regulation-making power under these Bills which are about to become Acts to bring them into line with other legislation. It is claimed, I believe correctly, that the Bills in question have the support of the Australian Apple and Pear Growers' Association, the members of which will, of course, be paying a levy. The Opposition does not oppose the Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not oppose the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No. 2), which gives effect to a taxation agreement between Australia and Denmark, similar to agreements previously negotiated with numerous other countries, including Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada and West Germany. The agreement in this case, as in the precedents, relates to the taxation of individuals and enterprises to prevent the double taxation of income earned in one country by a resident of another country. It also simplifies the obligations of the taxpayer so that the taxpayer knows in advance how earnings in one country will be treated in another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill contains provisions designed to prevent tax avoidance arising from price manipulation between branches of the same company or between related companies operating in different countries-what is commonly known as transfer pricing. It is worth noting, as my colleague Ralph Willis did in the House of Representatives when the Bill was debated there, that Mr Risstrom of the Australian Taxpayers Association, who has again been receiving a good deal of publicity in the last few days, about which I will probably be saying more later this evening, has estimated that the Melbourne branch alone of the Australian Taxation Office loses $2,000m each year from transfer pricing. If that is correct, the estimate for all of Australia must be well in excess of $3 billion and possibly as high as $4 billion. There are documented cases dealing with transfer pricing. In the celebrated Comalco Ltd case within the last 12 months the High Court of Australia, following the precedent established under the chief justiceship of Sir Garfield Barwick, came down on the side of the tax dodgers-in this case international corporate tax dodgers-and refused to levy the tax which would clearly have been due to the Australian subsidiary of the company had the actual price been appropriately disclosed. </PARA>
<PARA> Without doubt transfer pricing is a serious problem, comparable in magnitude to the problem of tax evasion, or taxation theft as it probably ought to be known, by Australian residents, and this Government has failed to take effective action in either case. However, we do not oppose the Bill because it is not primarily concerned with the question of transfer pricing but with the extension to Denmark of the so-called double taxation agreements, for which numerous precedents already exist. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take advantage of the first reading debate on this legislation to refer to statements and Press comment in numerous newspapers not only in Australia but also throughout the world relating to the tragedy that is known as East Timor. I was appalled this morning when listening to the Australian Broadcasting Commission program AM to hear a former Australian diplomat make certain statements in respect of Portuguese Timor. Sir Keith Shann, a former diplomat of some 35 years standing, made statements on that program which I believe need to be thoroughly rejected and repudiated certainly by my side of politics if not by the Parliament itself. Many of us in a bipartisan way have concerned ourselves with the problems of East Timor. We have had numerous debates in both the House of Representatives and the Senate on this issue. I am concerned about what I consider to be a disgraceful and despicable contribution to this problem by a diplomat of some 35 years standing, whose statements have been published in this morning's newspapers and broadcast during this morning's ABC program AM. Not only did the diplomat take the view that the Indonesian Government acted correctly and properly in invading and annexing a former colony that was established by Portugal some four centuries ago but also he went so far as to say that the Australian journalists who were murdered at Balibo in 1975 had asked for it and had got it. He made statements that they went into the area-</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sir Keith Shann. He said that they went into the area wearing Fretilin uniforms against instructions not to go there. Of course, this raises the very vexed question about the role of sections of the Foreign Affairs Department who have taken it upon themselves over a considerable period to speak on behalf of the Australian Government, the Australian Parliament and the Australian people. They do not have that authority and we ought to disassociate ourselves from their attempts to defend the indefensible attitude that was taken by the Indonesian Government about that territory which-in a state of flux it is true-was invaded by the Indonesian Army and which has been the subject of a protracted war since 1975. All that the people of Portuguese Timor wanted to do was establish their right of self-determination. This Government, this Parliament, the Australian Labor Party and the United Nations in overwhelming majority decisions have endorsed the right of people to self-determination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that there are many grey areas in respect of what happened in that region. Peter Hastings, the foreign editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, made a number of assertions and statements in this morning's edition of that paper, some of which I agree with and some of which I disagree with. I was privileged to go to Portuguese Timor in 1974 and 1975. On the latter occasion I went with two prominent members of the Liberal Party of Australia. We came back and spoke as one voice as a result of our experiences. I am sickened by the statement that has been made by Sir Keith Shann that the journalists who went into the area of Balibo acted in a way that deserved retribution. Firstly, I would say that Sir Keith Shann's information is incorrect. I met a number of journalists in August 1975 on the second occasion I visited that country. I cannot remember, of course, whether they were the same journalists who were subsequently killed at Balibo. But let me say that they were journalists who were doing the job that journalists are employed to do. They were there to investigate, to examine and to report the circumstances of the projected invasion, which invasion in fact occurred subsequently to the coup that took place in this country when Malcolm Fraser and his minions seized power as a result of the infamous conduct of our Governor-General of the day-I call him the cur that he is. The regrettable feature is that, in the absence of any factual information, a former diplomat who spent many years in Jakarta, the Philippines and Japan, should make a statement that our journalists were dressed in Fretelin uniforms. All I can say is that the Australian delegation of members from both sides of the Parliament and the journalists who were in East Timor in August of 1975 were dressed as the average Australian dresses in a tropical climate, that is, with the least amount of clothes but sufficient to be able to say they were dressed properly. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that any evidence is available whatsoever and to that extent I call Sir Keith Shann a liar when he suggests that the five journalists who were murdered at Balibo were dressed in Fretilin uniforms. Likewise I call him a liar when he says that they were warned not to go there. Who would have warned them not to go there? It is true that the Australian parliamentary delegation that went there, which included Senator Bonner, Mr Fry, Senator McIntosh and myself, were warned by the officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Darwin that there could be trouble in Dili and that there were rumours that the Indonesians would subsequently take some unilateral action in respect of Portuguese Timor. We were going, therefore, in the knowledge that there could be repercussions. </PARA>
<PARA> An Australian representative in Dili looked after us. He has subsequently been shown to have been employed as a member of either the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation or the Australian Security Intelligence Service, which is the branch which operates under the umbrella of the Department of Foreign Affairs. He took us in his plane to various parts of Portuguese Timor. He was not in a position to give us any advice, and I am certain that he gave no advice of the nature that Sir Keith Shann has suggested. Therefore, I say that the information that Sir Keith Shann gave in an address to the Australian-Asian Association of Victoria yesterday at its silver jubilee meeting, and repeated on AM this morning, is propaganda coming out of the Indonesian intelligence organisations. Sir Keith Shann, as indeed his successor, our Ambassador, Mr Critchley, have lived too long in Indonesia and have succumbed to the Indonesian point of view to the detriment of objectivity and to the detriment of Australia's basic position in respect of the rights of small nations. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had some posturing in recent times but I am prepared to give some credit to the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Malcolm Fraser, in relation to his activities in respect of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, his association with the Third World countries and his apparent conversion to the principles of a better distribution of wealth and resources throughout the world and particularly to the underdeveloped countries. I find it, therefore, something of a contradiction that, on the one hand, we have our Prime Minister properly acting as the host to this conference and pledging himself to the principles of self-determination, human rights, and all of those other important principles-some might say platitudes, but certainly principles about human relations and relations between governments and the rights of the people-and on the other hand we have a former diplomat of this country not only defending to the last degree the role that Indonesia has played in this issue of Portuguese Timor but also going so far as to suggest that the journalists involved were guilty of some malpractice or some improper conduct.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe the journalists represented all that is best and noble in their profession in seeking to get a story to the outside world. It will be remembered that at that time communication had been deliberately stopped in relation to what was happening in Timor, and steps had been taken by both the Indonesian Government and, regretfully, the Australian Government, to sever communications with a country that was struggling for the basic and simple fact of self-determination, the right to determine its own affairs-the very basic principles upon which governments ought to operate and which governments ought to support. Because of that, newspapers and television channels in Australia made a decision that journalists should go to Timor with a view to reporting the facts. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the Australian Government, and-I say this with regret-a Labor government, was being given information and advice from a section of the Department of Foreign Affairs which was slanted towards the Indonesian point of view. It was given on the basis that we could not afford to offend the powerful nation of Indonesia. So we were prepared to write off the rights of 600,000 people. We were prepared to dismiss the principles of self-determination, the principles of the rights of people to make a decision about their own future. These people had been enslaved by a tyrannical country and had been part of a colony since the sixteenth century. Their only crime was to express the desire to make a decision about their own future. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of this breakdown of communication-I remind honourable senators that there was a decision taken that broke the communication link between the people in Timor and the outside world-Channel 7, if my memory serves me correctly, and several newspapers in this country and one from overseas, the country escapes me for the moment, decided to send in journalists and a television crew for the purpose of recording for the outside world the events which were rumoured to have taken place. We saw the assassination of President Sadat a week or so ago and saw what television cameras were able to do. There were people there with initiative to report that particular public function which the President of Egypt was attending. They were able to record the actual attempt, the successful attempt as it turned out to be, to assassinate the President of that country. </PARA>
<PARA> All that the journalists in Timor were seeking to do was to tell the world the truth, to report the facts. Yet this man, Sir Keith Shann, says that our journalists were dressed in Fretilin uniforms and that they were in areas that they were not supposed to go to. I challenge Sir Keith Shann to come to the Senate, to come to the Australian Parliament, and tell us who made the decision that the journalists were not to go to Balibo. Where did he get that information that the journalists were dressed in Fretilin uniforms? People in their logical sense knowing that they were reporting a possible invasion, civil war or war situation would know that they would not dress themselves in the uniform of the supposed enemy. Does anyone seriously suggest that that is what responsible journalists and television crews would do?</PARA>
<PARA> Yet this man, Sir Keith Shann, has suggested that they got what they deserved because they had put on such a uniform. We have also read in the newspapers of reports circulating in Portugal to the effect that a government of the Left as well as a government in Australia, a government in New Zealand, a government in the United States and a government in Great Britain acquiesced in the invasion of Timor. I repudiate that suggestion. I reject it because I was involved, as I have said before, in intimate discussions with leaders of the Government that I supported at that time. Whilst it is true that there was an Indonesian lobby working within the confines of the Labor Government in that period-obviously if it was working within our Government it would have been working within the Liberal Party-it is totally untrue to say that on a radical side of politics there was any acquiescence in the Indonesian invasion of Portuguese Timor. </PARA>
<PARA> The circumstances were that the almost 50 year dictatorship in Portugal had been overthrown as a result of a revolt among the Portuguese people led by large sections of the Portuguese Army. Decolonisation was taking place in Africa and other Portuguese colonies. There was a great deal of confusion. There was a desire on the part of Portugal to share its responsibilities and the cost involved in maintaining its responsibilites in its former colonies. There was a desire to democratise the country and to shed the fascist past which was so much a part of Portugal itself. In Portugal there was not as much concern about what was happening in Timor as perhaps there would be in normal circumstances. Mozambique and other Portuguese colonies had won or were in the process of gaining their independence, so Portugal was not in a position to make a rational decision in respect of what was happening in Portuguese Timor. This was causing some concern to the Australian Government. In my discussions with Mr Whitlam and former Senator Willesee, they expressed their concern about the lack of concern of the Portuguese over what was going on in Timor. I think that was understandable, having regard to the conditions which existed at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is totally wrong therefore to suggest that in those circumstances Portugal acquiesced in the invasion and annexation of Timor by Indonesia. It had in fact at every meeting of the United Nations subsequent to that period voted against a formalisation of that annexation. It joined forces with the Third World countries and a majority view of the United Nations and opposed what Indonesia did in December 1975. The Australian Government, of course, committed as it was to a policy of non-interference in other countries, having made the decision a couple of years previously to withdraw Australian troops from Vietnam because we did not believe that we had the right to interfere in the internal affairs of another country, did not see fit, and correctly so, to send troops to protect the rights of the 600,000 indigenous people of East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA> In all of those circumstances there was a political vacuum. There was a movement for self-determination-a movement by a very small country to establish its own form of government and organise itself to stand on its own feet. But before it could do that the situation unfortunately was that the pro-Indonesian group, known as the UDT, had seized power in June 1975. Consequently the reaction was that the view of the independence group-the movement that was opposed to the Indonesian absorption, the movement for self-determination that was so evident to us when I was there in 1974 and again in 1975-became the majority view. </PARA>
<PARA> I can say that in August 1975 I had never felt freer when I walked in the streets of Dili and visited the towns and villages of Portuguese Timor. There were no policemen and there was no coercion. The people were running their own affairs. They were entitled to make their own decisions and they were functioning freely. Sure, they needed assistance, just as many countries in the Asian and Pacific region need assistance in their struggles for self-determination. The unhappy fact is that there were generals in the Indonesian Army who not only were unconcerned about human rights for their own citizens but who also were prepared to take advantage of political situations in their own country in order to establish in that country their own hegemony. They set about the processes of the invasion that took place early in December 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it ill becomes a diplomat to make statements, in the face of the overwhelming majority of world opinion, in the face of the overwhelming opinion of the Australian people and in the face of the overwhelming opinion of the Australian Parliament, that, Indonesia was justified in doing what it did. Petitions were circulated in both the House of Representatives and the Senate and were signed by members on both sides of the Parliament. My recollection is that the overwhelming majority of members, something like 90 members of the national Parliament, signed the petition to President Carter asking him to intercede in respect of the problems in Timor and to condemn the Indonesian position. Party boundaries were cut across in a unique and rather historic way. The Parliament, without formalising its position, took a view that what the Indonesians had done was regrettable, that it was to be condemned and that it was unacceptable to any freedom loving people. Yet this man has come out and not only defended the Indonesian position but also has defamed the journalists who were murdered in Balibo. It will be recalled that this Government, the national Parliament and the Australian Journalists Association have from time to time tried to get information from the Indonesian authorities about what did happen. We have been frustrated in every way by the Indonesian authorities. I find this man's remarks despicable, disgraceful and regrettable. </PARA>
<PARA> I know I speak on behalf of my party because when we discussed the question of Timor at my party's Federal Conference in Perth that Conference, with one dissentient, decided to condemn the Indonesian position, and that remains our view. We condemn without any equivocation the remarks made by Sir Keith Shann. Not only did Sir Keith Shann defame these journalists and defend the Indonesian position but also he went on the record to suggest that Radio Australia-our own broadcasting organisation-was guilty of infamous conduct, distortion, exaggeration and peddling of gossip and rumour because it dared to express a view contrary to that of the Suharto dictatorship that exists in Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA> This man who claims to represent our point of view-Australia's point of view-had the audacity to add to the remarks that he made about the journalists and Australia's position in respect of Timor and to condemn Radio Australia and the Australian Broadcasting Commission for their attempts to convey to the people of South East Asia, which includes Indonesia, some of the objective facts about the corruption, nepotism and other factors of social and political life in Indonesia that are completely repugnant and unacceptable to anybody who supports the principles of democracy. I finalise my remarks by saying that I am ashamed to be associated with the remarks made by Sir Keith Shann. I am sure that would be the overwhelming view of a great number of the people of our country. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bills be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>INCOME TAX LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1981</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will amend the income tax law in a number of respects. </PARA>
<PARA> It will give effect to proposals announced in detail by the Treasurer on 16 July 1980 to deal with the threat to company tax revenues posed by the growing practice of public company groups reorganising their affairs so as to eliminate company tax on some of their income. </PARA>
<PARA> The practice involves the transfer of profitable assets, particularly investment in property, to unit trusts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also implement two Budget announcements-one to change the basis on which friendly society dispensaries are taxed and the other to reduce the rate at which capital expenditures on the development of a mine or oil field may be written off for tax purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Some extension of the gift provisions of the income tax law is also to be made by the Bill and-finally-it will also provide the method for calculating provisional tax for the 1981-82 income year. </PARA>
<PARA>Public Unit Trusts</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The main concern of the Government in this respect is to prevent ad hoc erosion of the so-called classical system of company taxation through the use of unit trusts by public companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the broad thrust of the amendments is to remove the taxation advantage sought by companies from placing income producing property in the hands of unit trusts. </PARA>
<PARA> This is to be achieved basically by treating unit trusts evolving from the practice as if they were companies for tax purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Broadly, the taxable income of a public unit trust to which the amendments apply is to be subject to tax at the rate applicable to companies generally, now 46 per cent, and distributions to unit holders out of income and profits of such trusts are to be taxed in the same way as they would be if they were dividends paid to shareholders of a company. </PARA>
<PARA> These rules will apply to unit trusts formed as part of a reorganisation of a company or group of companies where, as part of the reorganisation, a business or other property of a company is transferred to the trust and shareholders in the company are given preference as regards taking up units in the Trust. </PARA>
<PARA> To confine the scope of the amendments closely to the kinds of practices referred to in the Treasurer's statements on the matter, the amendments will apply only if it is part of the reorganisation arrangement for the unit trust to be a ''public unit trust'' as defined in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In broad terms a ''Public unit trust'' is defined as one of the units in which are listed on a stock exchange, are held by 50 or more persons, or are available for investment by the public. For this purpose, a person and his or her relatives or nominees will be counted as one person. </PARA>
<PARA> In harmony with the broad objective of equating public unit trusts with public companies it is proposed by the Bill that, where the income of such a trust includes dividends from companies, a rebate of tax is to be allowed in the same way as would be the case for dividend income received by a company. </PARA>
<PARA> Unit trust distributions made by a public unit trust to a unit-holder that is a company will qualify for rebate on a comparable basis in the unitholder's hands. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of safeguarding measures are contained in the Bill to support the objectives of these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> The new basis for taxing public unit trusts and their unitholders will first apply in relation to the 1980-81 income year where the trust is established after 11 July 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of special problems presented for unit trusts established, in some cases, out of company reorganisations a number of years ago, the amendments will apply from the commencement of the 1983-84 income year for trusts established on or before 11 July 1980</PARA>
<PARA>Friendly Society Dispensaries</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As announced in the Budget Speech, the Government has decided to remove the present special basis of taxing the dispensaries. </PARA>
<PARA> In future they are to be taxed in the same way as other non-profit companies.</PARA>
<PARA> The effect of this decision as implemented by the Bill is that normal company tax rates will apply to the net income of dispensaries arising from investment income, from receipts from the Commonwealth for the supply of any pharmaceutical benefits and from charges paid by non-members for the supply of pharmaceutical goods and other products and services. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes will first apply to income derived by dispensaries in the 1982-83 income year. </PARA>
<PARA> This will allow the dispensaries time to adapt their accounting methods to the change. </PARA>
<PARA>Gifts</PARA>
<PARA> Amendments proposed by the Bill will further extend the existing gift provisions of the income tax law which confer deductions for gifts of the value of $2 or more to specified funds, authorities or institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> One extension will authorise deductions for gifts made after 30 June 1981 to the Victorian Arts Centre Trust. </PARA>
<PARA> The second will authorise deductions for gifts made during the current financial year to a public fund established for the purpose of observance of the International Year of Disabled Persons by a committee appointed by the Commonwealth, a State or the Northern Territory for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>Capital Expenditure on the Development of a Mine or Oil Field</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains the amendments necessary to give effect to the proposal announced in the Budget Speech to increase from six to ten years the maximum statutory life by reference to which deductions allowable for capital expenditure on the development of a mine or oil field are determined. </PARA>
<PARA> The new basis of deduction will apply generally to expenditure incurred after 18 August 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> However, where the expenditure is incurred after 18 August 1981 under a contract entered into on or before that day, or in respect of work carried out by the taxpayer which was commenced on or before that day, it will continue to be deductible by reference to a maximum statutory life of six years as at present. </PARA>
<PARA>Provisional Tax</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As I think is generally understood, provisional tax is that part of the pay-as-you-earn system designed to collect tax on income other than salary or wages within the year in which it is derived. </PARA>
<PARA> That being so it is only reasonable that the amount charged should closely approximate the amount of tax actually imposed for the year. </PARA>
<PARA> In this way, the provisional tax arrangements are able to achieve a desirable measure of consistency between the treatment of salary and wage earners and of persons who derive income from a business or from property. </PARA>
<PARA> In the absence of provisions to the contrary, provisional tax for 1981-82 would be calculated by applying 1980-81 rates of tax to 1980-81 taxable income and taking into account rebates at their 1980-81 levels. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, however, expected that incomes for 1981-82 will generally be higher than for 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> As against this, due to the application of half-indexation the effective rates of tax for 1981-82 are lower than for last year and, of course, dependant rebates for 1981-82 are greater than those for 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> In the circumstances, it is appropriate that a varied basis be applied in calculating provisional tax for 1981-82 where taxpayers do not exercise the right to have the tax calculated on the basis of their own estimates of taxable income for the year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that provisional tax for 1981-82 is to be calculated on the basis of taxable income for 1980-81 increased by 10 per cent and applying to this adjusted income the lower effective rates of tax applying for 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> Dependant rebates are to be allowed for in the calculations at the higher values set for 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> I add that the notional increase of 10 per cent for 1981-82 incomes over 1980-81 is less than the estimated average rise between the two years in taxable incomes of people subject to provisional tax. </PARA>
<PARA> This will provide a buffer against any excessive provisional tax. </PARA>
<PARA> And, of course, taxpayers who consider their taxable income for 1981-82 will increase by less than the notional 10 per cent have the option of 'self-assessing' and thus having the provisional tax for 1981-82 recalculated on the basis of their own estimates of taxable income for the year. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, a memorandum containing more detailed explanations of technical aspects of the Bill has been made available to honourable senators and, at this stage, I think there is no need for me to further address the matters covered by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>INCOME TAX (INDIVIDUALS) BILL 1981</PARA>
<PARA> This is an annual measure which formally imposes personal income tax for 1981-82 at the rates declared in the Income Tax (Rates) Act 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that, following an announcement on 29 April 1981, the Income Tax (Rates) Act 1976 was amended in the Autumn sittings to declare rates of tax payable by individuals and trustees generally for 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> These rates reflect the decision that there is to be half indexation of the personal tax rates scale for the 1981-82 income year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth recalling the effects of that earlier legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Application of the half indexation factor has meant that for 1981-82 the standard rate of 32 per cent will not apply until taxable income exceeds $4,195. </PARA>
<PARA> It was $4,041 last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The other steps in the scale have been correspondingly increased so that the 46 per cent rate will apply after $17,894 and not $17,239 as previously. </PARA>
<PARA> The maximum individual rate of 60 per cent will not apply until the taxable income exceeds $35,788. </PARA>
<PARA> It was $34,478 for 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> The resulting tax reductions benefit all individual taxpayers, and, together with associated increases in rebates for dependants, have been reflected in lower pay-as-you-earn deductions since 1 July last. </PARA>
<PARA> They will be reflected in provisional tax payable for 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>INCOME TAX (COMPANIES, CORPORATE UNIT TRUSTS AND SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 1981</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will formally impose income tax for 1981-82 on the 1980-81 incomes of companies and the income of superannuation funds of the current year. </PARA>
<PARA> The rates of tax are also declared by the Bill and are the same as for 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with measures contained in the Income Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1981, about which I have just spoken, the net income of some unit trusts is to be taxed at the public company rate of tax, 46 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Measures to impose this tax are also in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Provisions of the Bill otherwise follow the same lines as in other years and details of the various rates are set out in the explanatory memorandum that has been made available to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Three income tax Bills are being debated concurrently by the Senate. The Income Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1981 does a number of things. It expands the range of charities and neo-charities to which contributions are tax deductible, it provides for the collection of provisional tax, it reduces the depreciation rate on machinery purchased for the mining industry from a diminishing balance rate of 16 2/3 per cent to a diminishing balance rate of 10 per cent, and it eliminates a scheme devised for the invasion of company tax through the use of unit trusts. The Opposition will not oppose this Bill but I want to make a few comments about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, on the proposal to reduce depreciation rates for mining industry investment, while not objectionable in itself, the proposal highlights yet again the absurdity of this Government's business taxation policy. In the last 15 months we have seen no fewer than four changes to the rates of depreciation for business expenditure. In the Budget of 1980 there was a 20 per cent across-the-board increase in the depreciation rate for investment in machinery. In November, as a result of off the top of the head pork barrelling by the member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser), we had an increase in some rates of depreciation applicable to agricultural machinery. In May last year the 20 per cent increase across-the-board in general depreciation rates, as a result of the razor gang farce, was reduced to 18 per cent. That is what one would call fine tuning the taxation system-reducing a surcharge of 20 per cent to a surcharge of 18 per cent six months later! One could not fine tune the taxation system much more effectively than that!</PARA>
<PARA> Now in October we have yet another change-the fourth in 15 months-to the depreciation rates applicable to business capital investment. Some stability! We used to hear a great deal from the member for Wannon and others in the Liberal and National Country parties about the need for predictability and stability in the business environment. As in so many other fields, there is an enormous gulf between the rhetoric of this Government and the record. The fourth provision, which I mentioned, in this Bill is to eliminate the evasion of company tax through the use and misuse of unit trusts. We are of course supporting that provision as we support every provision designed to crack down on the social crime of tax avoidance. However, we criticise the provision because it does not go far enough. </PARA>
<PARA> This so-called crackdown was announced by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) on 16 July last year. But it does not become effective on those who were already in the racket at that time until July 1983. Some crackdown! That parasitic trinity of shonky accountants, shonky lawyers and tax bludgers who contrived this blatant artificial scheme to rob their fellow citizens have been given three years of grace to continue their theft. Then they must stop robbing the rest of the taxpayers. That is the crackdown provision provided in this Bill. I suppose it is entirely consistent with the attitude of the Government which runs roughly along the following lines: 'If you are caught with your fist in the till it is all right as long as you pay the money back, especially if you are a Minister'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Income Tax (Companies, Corporate Unit Trusts and Superannuation Funds) Bill 1981 imposes tax on companies, superannuation funds and some trust income for this financial year although the income actually taxed will be that received in the 1980-81 financial year, as is the custom with Bills of this nature dealing with company taxation. We will not oppose that Bill. The Income Tax (Individuals) Bill 1981 will be opposed by the Opposition. We will call a division on this Bill. This Bill concerns pay-as-you-earn taxation, tax on wage and salary earners and tax on the self-employed. It imposes the personal tax rates which have already been set in prior legislation in the Income Tax (Rates) Bill. We will oppose this third Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxation on wage and salary earners-both direct and indirect taxation-already at a record level in the last financial year, is to be increased as a result of this Bill by a massive 22 per cent. Average taxation paid by wage and salary earners in this financial year will rise, according to the Government's own estimates, by a massive 22 per cent-a 22 per cent increase on top of a pre-existing record level of taxation on wage and salary earners. That is not the end of it. The indirect taxation base is-if this Government gets its way-to be both widened and deepened by an extension and intensification of sales tax which in a full year will add another $892m to Government revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> We have two complaints about this Bill. The first concerns the macroeconomic aspect. It is becoming increasingly apparent that economic growth is stalled and has been since the last quarter of the previous financial year. Unemployment is rising, yet this stagnant economy is to be hit with massive tax increases. It is an economy which already has an unemployment rate that is almost 6 per cent and rising. This economy, with its stagnant level of output, is to be hit by a highly contractionary Budget, of which this taxation legislation is a central component, that is estimated to produce this year a domestic surplus of $1,500m. If that figure were adjusted to account for what one might roughly call a seven-year seasonal correction-because there is an extra pay day for Government employees and social welfare recipients this year-it would be in the vicinity of $1,900m. It is inconceivable that any other country since the 1930s, or at the worst the 1940s, would have imposed so contractionary a Budget upon an already stagnant economy with near record levels of unemployment. Pre-Keynesian primitivism is alive and well in the Australia of Malcolm Fraser. </PARA>
<PARA> The rationale for this highly contractionary Budget has two prongs: Firstly, that it is necessary to beat inflation; secondly, that it will reduce interest rates. The prerequisite for accepting that dogma is a remarkable capacity to abstract from reality. On the first point, that of inflation, it is necessary to ignore the Budget Papers, the Government's own estimate that the rate of inflation in this financial year will be 10.75 per cent. Even that is a misleading figure, because it represents the average increase this year over that for the previous year. The actual estimate of the increase in the consumer price index from June 1981 to June 1982 is not 10.75 per cent but 11.9 per cent, or almost 12 per cent. The comparable figure for the previous year was 8.8 per cent. The underlying arithmetical reason for the discrepancy between the average figure for the entire year and the figure for the end of this financial year, as compared to the end of last year, is that the rate of inflation will be increasing throughout this financial year. That is some way to beat inflation. On the Government's own admission, the inflation rate is up from 8.8 per cent to 11.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The interest myth is that high, record present interest rates are caused by the voracious borrowing demands of the public sector. The line followed is that if the deficit is eliminated the public sector borrowing requirement comes down and therefore interest rates come down with it. Acceptance of that argument again requires a remarkable facility to abstract from reality. The public sector borrowing requirement as a proportion of the gross domestic product, the total output of the economy, declined steadily from 5.6 per cent in 1977-78 to an estimated 3.4 per cent this year. While over those four years that public sector borrowing requirement has been falling at a very significant rate, interest rates have been steadily rising to their present record level. They are not likely to fall in the near future unless the present stagnation of the economy deteriorates into a catastrophic recession. The recent figures for the international account suggest that that is highly likely unless some other substantial offsetting action is taken. </PARA>
<PARA> The great Fraser myth, accepted I note with regret by some gullible journalists, is that the economy is in good shape-not perfect but in good shape. What is the reality? On the Government's own admission, inflation is rising substantially. On the Government's own Budget forecast, unemployment is at almost 6 per cent and will rise further. Interest rates are at record levels and are unlikely to fall. Economic growth is either stagnant or, conceivably, actually negative at this time. If all of the Government's forecasts are to be realised, it is interesting to compare the present condition of the economy with its condition at the end of 1975 when, according to Mr Fraser, it was in such a catastrophic condition that any political skulduggery he could devise-in conjunction with the drunken megalomaniac who was Governor-General and the tax-dodging corporate criminal who was Chief Justice-was justifiable because the economy had to be rescued from the catastrophic condition into which the then Labor Government had placed it. In 1975 inflation was 13 per cent and falling. At the end of this year, if the Government's own forecasts are realised, it will be 12 per cent and rising, so there has been little, if any, improvement there. Unemployment is now almost 6 per cent and rising. In 1975 it was 4.2 per cent and stable. The Government forecasts growth during this financial year to be around 3 per cent. It is now quite apparent that that target will not be met. At the end of 1975 it was above 4 per cent. The interest rates on medium term Government paper are now 13 per cent. In 1975 they were 10 per cent. On the basis of three of those four major indices of the health of the economy, the economy is in a significantly worse state today than it was in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> In most countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development the recession bottomed in 1974. In Australia, after three years of the Fraser Government, it bottomed in 1978. It might be necessary this time next year to amend that statement to bring it up to date. It might be necessary to say that the economy bottomed not in 1978 but in 1981-82. Australia is the only country of all the OECD countries that never lifted itself out of the recession of the 1970s. This Government is a government of failure. The failure of the Prime Minister as a macro-economic manager is seriously compounded by his moral financial infamy. The all-time record taxation over which the Prime Minister now presides has been imposed most severely on those who are least able to pay, and most cruelly of all on the single income families, for which this Prime Minister and this Government profess to have such a deep concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to two articles, published this week in the Sydney Morning Herald, which drew upon material supplied by Mr Eric Risstrom of the Australian Taxpayers Association, not the Labor Party. That association is one that I would expect would not be particularly favourably disposed to the Australian Labor Party. However, it has a certain professional integrity in regard to making completely objective assessments about the state of taxation, about reality. These articles draw on information supplied by Mr Risstrom. I will pick out some of the highlights. In the six years ending June 1982-if all of the Government's forecasts are correct-indirect taxation will have risen by 150 per cent. In the same period inflation will have risen by only 75 per cent. So we could say that indirect taxation will have doubled. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at income tax. A single income family with two dependent children, on average weekly earnings, the family about which this Government professes to be profoundly concerned, is paying anything up to 81 per cent more tax in real terms than it paid six years ago. For such a family, which the Government professes is the epitome of its social ideal, taxation has almost doubled in real terms on what it was 10 years ago. A single income family without children, on average weekly earnings, is paying $26 a week more tax than it would have, had the 1975 real levels of taxation still existed. It does not stop there. It is not just income tax. The average family with two children will be paying between $3.50 and $5 a week extra sales tax this year if the Government's sales tax legislation manages to get through the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as there being a very substantial increase in the aggregate level of taxation to all-time record levels which are about to be increased by this Bill, the burden of income tax and indirect taxes has been shifted regressively towards the lower income groups. This is partly because of changes in the income tax schedule, partly because of the high degree of tax avoidance, partly because of additional and increased sales taxes and partly because taxation in other areas, non-income tax, has been reduced. Australia is the only country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that does not apply a tax on capital or capital gains. Australia, under Malcolm Fraser, has regressed to a position in this respect to the right of where the British Liberal Party was in 1911. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I close I want to expose in advance a fraudulent gimmick which is now being concocted within this Government; that is, the gimmick of so-called tax cuts being introduced next year. At the likely rate of income increases-again, I use the rate forecast by the Government in its Budget Papers-owing to what Mr Fraser used to call the secret tax of inflation, income tax revenue will increase by $1,500m in real terms this year. That is not just an increase of $1,500m because dollars, under this Government, will be worth about 13 per cent less in a year's time than they are worth now. After adjusting for the inflation factor, income tax receipts, because of what the Prime Minister used to call the secret tax of inflation, will increase by $1,500m at expected rates of increase in incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister, as we know, finally has totally buried tax indexation. This major reform-or what was presented as a major reform in 1975-which was essential to end what the Prime Minister used to call the secret tax of inflation has now been formally and decently buried. The secret tax of inflation runs wild under this Prime Minister. Indexation-which was probably the most solemn of all of the 1975 pre-election promises-having been repudiated and permanently interred, any so-called tax cut of less than $1,500m will, in fact, be a tax increase. It is a difficult concept to grasp for people who are not accustomed to thinking about these things. To put it in its simplest form, I repeat that, because of what the Prime Minister used to call the secret tax of inflation, any so-called tax cuts amounting to less than $1,500m this year will, in fact, be a tax increase. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser Government is to be doubly condemned for its gross incompetence in being the only government in the OECD which, throughout the second half of the 1970s, failed to lift its economy from the recession of the mid-1970s, even though at the time it took over government growth was running at 4 per cent. Incidentally, that is a figure which was not equalled until the financial year which has just passed. The Government is to be condemned for its gross incompetence in the area which it nominated as being of prime concern. It should also be condemned for the culpable immorality of the way in which it has transferred this enormous and record burden of taxation onto those groups which are least able to bear the burden. The Government should be condemned for the epitome of its hypocrisy in having transferred that burden on to the single income family about which it professes to have a special concern. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to outline very briefly the Australian Democrats attitude to the Government's tax strategy. Whilst agreeing almost entirely with the comments of Senator Walsh, who outlined the Australian Labor Party's attitude to the Government's tax strategy, we do not propose to take any action that may delay the passage of the Government's tax Bills. We are taking this action primarily in the interests of practical politics. We believe that there are two areas in this current Budget which the Government should look at very carefully and about which any reasonable government should be capable of being prevailed upon to change its mind. I refer to our stand on the imposition of sales tax on the necessities of life and also to our foreshadowed action in requesting the Government to increase its grants to the States for housing. We believe that these two initiatives hold out some hope for action by the Government. However, to attempt to delay the Government's tax strategy is, we believe, asking for too much.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although we do not propose to take any action we criticise in the strongest possible terms what the Government is doing. We criticise in particular its action in relation to income tax. Australia already imposes one of the highest rates of income tax of any nation in the Western world. In spite of that there is to be an additional $3,300m collected in personal taxation under this Budget. Senator Walsh said that that represents a 22 per cent increase. I do not know where he got that figure from. Our arithmetic shows it to be a 19 per cent increase. Whatever it is, it is a massive increase-almost double the rate of inflation. It will have a devastating effect on the taxpayer. We have this massive increase in income tax but added to that we are to have, of course, the great increase in indirect taxes, including the increases in sales tax. These increases add up to $1,500m. So we have increases in income tax and indirect tax. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have the secret taxes in the form of the crude oil levy and the cost of driving a motor car, which is a necessity for most households. We have the cost of health insurance and, of course, we have the added costs of high interest rates. If one aggregates the costs of all of these tax increases and the hidden tax increases in the form of health insurance and the cost of driving a motor car, the cost of the Government's policies, the amount of money which will be taken out of the pocket of every taxpayer in the country this year will be in excess of $1,000. I repeat that it is in excess of $1,000 a year for every taxpayer. We agree with the Labor Party that this great increase in the tax burden at a time when all the indicators are that the economy is at least stagnant, if not in fact positively turning downwards, will have a very disastrous effect on the health of the economy generally. </PARA>
<PARA> We criticise not only the massive increases in the tax take this year but also the direction being taken in the spending of this greatly increased revenue. A sensible person would hope that the increased revenue would be directed to labour intensive areas such as home and road building. We find that this will not be the case. We hoped that there would have been some increase in allocations for education. The reverse is the case. Instead we find that the Government is buying expensive toys such as special overseas equipment for the Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal Australian Navy. At the same time it is proposing to curtail our capability for manufacturing our own defence requirements in such places as the Ordnance Factory at Bendigo and the Government Clothing Factory at Coburg. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, it is. I do not believe there is any Western economy-certainly not the economy of the United States of America-which has clamped down to the degree that this Budget is clamping down on the social necessities of life, taking those from the people and at the same time imposing massive increases in taxation. President Reagan with his supply-side of economics is at least clamping down on government expenditure. At the same time he is reducing taxation. But this Government is doing both. There is a two-way squeeze and it will inevitably-this is unavoidable-have disastrous consequences for the economy. We do not believe the Government should get away with it. We intend to do what we consider is in the realm of practical politics by standing firm in opposing the Government's sales tax legislation in relation to the necessities of life. We propose at the appropriate time to move that a request be sent to the House of Representatives asking that increased expenditure on housing be effected. That is at least a labour intensive area of the economy and one in which increased expenditure would materially assist unemployment. We criticise the Government's taxation policies. We will not support any move to delay them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank the Senate for the passage of the income tax Bills. I note from Senator Walsh's remarks on behalf of the Opposition that the Opposition does not intend to oppose two of the Bills and that it will call for a division on the Income Tax (Individuals) Bill. I do not wish to make many comments but I think that one or two of Senator Walsh's comments should receive some response. He referred to the change in the depreciation allowed for the mining industry. Perhaps it is appropriate to say that the circumstances of the mining industry have changed substantially since 1976 with the mining sector having entered a period of strong growth which is expected to continue for some time. For example, the Australian Statistician's survey of investment expectations points to an exceptionally strong growth in mining investment in 1981-82. The schedule of 'Major Manufacturing and Mining Investment Projects' recently published by the Department of Industry and Commerce adds further support to this view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It ought to be borne in mind that where there has been criticism, such as that expressed by Senator Walsh with regard to changes in tax legislation affecting business, perhaps everyone could share that concern. At the same time I think governments, when introducing taxation legislation or when compiling Budgets, need to look at concessional elements which apply to one industry or another or to industry in general. In response to conditions which exist at a particular time it is competent to make changes taking account of the changing economic circumstances and to cast a Budget accordingly. What might have been seen at one time as a special industry incentive for one purpose or another does not necessarily remain static year upon year without some review of that being necessary. In this Budget it was felt that it was appropriate to reduce the taxation assistance given to the mining area by extending the period of reference in which capital development expenses could be written off to a 10-year period. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter which deserves just a brief response is the comment made with regard to unit trusts. I note that the Opposition did not oppose the proposal but criticised it by suggesting that we allowed a delay, a period of grace, for unit trusts which were established on or before 11 July before this new tax legislation would have effect. Some of the unit trusts which will be affected by the proposed legislation were established several years before the Government's announcement. Therefore, many of the present unit holders would not have been a party to the original arrangement to reorganise a company into a unit trust. In the circumstances the Government considered that it would have been unfair to penalise such unit holders in a way that would have caused an immediate reduction in the value of their units when they had acquired their units in the open market along with unit holders in the numerous other public unit trusts which will not be affected by the proposed legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Other comments with regard to unit trusts were made in the other place on behalf of the Opposition and the Government has noted what was said in this regard. I have noted that there will be a division on the Income Tax (Individuals) Bill. I have noted the comments of the Australian Democrats with regard to their approach to this legislation. I am surprised to hear their continued comments with regard to the sales tax Bills but perhaps we can leave those matters for another day. I commend the Bills to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition I shall move the amendment which has been circulated in my name. The purpose of the amendment to the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Amendment Bill is to reduce the invalidity, retirement and widows' pensions paid under the Act if a person's rate is based on an acting rank held prior to death, invalidity or retirement. As such it is an important piece of legislation and it deserves careful scrutiny, particularly if we compare the proposals in it with the superannuation provisions covering persons in acting classifications in other Commonwealth Government retirement benefit schemes, notably the Commonwealth Public Service superannuation schemes. It is clearly inequitable, we believe, to penalise defence service personnel for serving in an acting rank when, on the other hand, Commonwealth public servants are rewarded for acting in similar circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) in another place did not choose to deal with these issues when he made a bland ministerial statement on 14 May this year in which he foreshadowed the introduction of this Bill to amend the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act of 1973 to correct what he described as 'an unintended effect of this legislation which was revealed in a recent Federal Court decision'. He said that the amendment would restore the operation of the scheme to the basis intended since its inception in October 1972, namely, that a person's contributions and entitlements are based on rates of salary for substantive rank and not for acting rank. The Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act would be amended with effect from 14 May, the date of the statement, to restore what the Minister described as the intended policy and to revert the pensions of those who were currently entitled to higher benefits to the levels applicable to their substantive ranks on retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Minister's second reading speech in another place on 27 August he stated that for years contributions and benefits were calculated by reference to the salary rate of the substantive rank held by the member, with the higher duties salary, which is a common situation in the armed forces, being disregarded because of what he described as the transitory nature of the acting and temporary rank arrangements. In May 1980 the Federal Court of Australia decided that the intended link between rank in Australia and annual rates of pay regulations was not properly established. This meant that acting and temporary rank rates of pay in the armed services should be taken into account for both contributions and benefit purposes for all Services after the scheme started on 1 October 1972. A relatively small number of beneficiaries-about 550-are entitled to higher retirement benefits as a result of this decision of the Federal Court. The Minister stated at the time that the Bill would restore to the scheme the original intent that a member's contributions and retirement benefits should be calculated on the basis of the annual rate of pay applicable only to the substantive rank and not to the acting rank. Under this Bill pensioners or beneficiaries entitled to additional pension benefits will be paid in full, including any available commutation amounts, from the date of retirement. From May 1981 their pensions will be adjusted by reverting to what they would have been if calculated according to substantive rank held on retirement and taking into account any additional lump sums received. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems fairly reasonable for the Government to want to amend this complicated piece of legislation and the Opposition certainly believes that it should be tidied up. However, I think we must look at the real reason for the Government's anxiety to correct this legislation. The Minister referred briefly to the need 'to correct an unintended effect of the 1973 DFRDB legislation which was revealed in a recent Federal Court decision'. This is not the first time, and I am certain it will not be the last, that a decision of the Federal Court has resulted in hurried efforts to correct the sins of omission of previous legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Minister did not choose to enlighten honourable members in another place about the details of that recent Federal Court decision, I will touch briefly on it myself. The case is known in the Services simply as the Duncan case. Commander Peter Duncan had been granted the rank of captain from 8 November 1977 until 16 July 1979, when he was compulsorily retired. In other words, he was acting in the rank of captain from November 1977 to July 1979. During that time he was paid salary and allowances at the annual rates appropriate to the rank of captain and he received incremental increases appropriate to that rank. On 27 April 1978 he wrote to the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority contending that this contribution should have been made in amounts appropriate to a captain's pay rates and he was liable to have a larger sum deducted from his pay. On 8 May 1978 the DFRDB Authority refused to let him make larger contributions on the grounds that, although he was an acting captain, he was liable to make payments appropriate only to his substantive rank of commander. The contention was that rank in the DFRDB Act of 1973 referred to substantive rank. </PARA>
<PARA> On 18 May 1978 Captain Duncan requested the Authority to reconsider his request. On 9 May 1979 the Authority advised Captain Duncan that legal advice confirmed the earlier view that, firstly, the acting rank should be ignored for the purpose of determining the annual rate of pay; secondly the scale of contributions should be based on the substantive rank only; and thirdly, the retirement benefits payable under the Act should be based on the substantive rank. Captain Duncan then requested the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to review this decision, and on 20 August 1979 the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, in a majority decision-one person dissenting-affirmed the decision of the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> He then appealed to the Federal Court against the Administrative Appeals Tribunal decision. On 27 May 1980 the Federal Court found that the legal liability of the applicant to contribute and his legal entitlement were not affected by the Authority's view. The Authority had no power judicially to decide these matters nor to determine them in any final sense. Yet the Authority's view was accepted by the Royal Australian Navy pay office and this was effective in preventing the deduction of a larger contribution from Captain Duncan's pay. Now that the applicant had retired, the administration of the DFRDB Act may make it desirable that some adjustment be made in respect of contributions and retirement pay conformably with the declaration made. </PARA>
<PARA> The Court ordered that it be declared that the amount of the anual rate of pay of the applicant on the days between 8 November 1977 and 16 July 1979 was the annual rate of salary payable to a captain who had completed the longer period of service specified for an officer holding that rank. </PARA>
<PARA> It further ordered that the matter be remitted to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to be heard and decided again and that the Tribunal be directed to make an order as to the receipt of additional amounts by way of contributions as appears to it to be appropriate consistent with the liability of the applicant as declared by the Court, and that it hear further submissions to assist it to determine what order was appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> It had taken 25 months for Captain Duncan to get that far. It took another 12 months for the Government to decide to act to take away the right he had established for himself and others under that legislation. I suggest that in view of that delay it is easy to understand the bitterness which led Captain Duncan to write to the Minister for Defence, Mr Killen, on 19 August this year, saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . how disillusioned I was to return from sea to be informed of the Department's determination to amend the DFRB Act. The statement made to me after the AAT hearing in 1979 by the DFRB representative, that no matter what appeals I may make and win, the Board would ultimately have the legislation changed, certainly seems to have been prophetic. </PARA>
<PARA>Captain Duncan's legitimate grievance reflects the concern evident in the recommendations of the Jess Committee report which led to the revamping of the DFRDB scheme in 1972. In September 1970 the Joint Select Committee on Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Legislation was set up in response to complaints from servicemen and ex-servicemen that the then DFRDB scheme was impractical, ridden with anomalies, and randomly disadvantaged retirees. The joint select committee was chaired by Mr J. D. Jess, C.B.E., M.P., and therefore became known as the Jess Committee. After an inquiry lasting over two years the committee found that the complaints were justified and recommended that sweeping changes be introduced to remedy the anomalies and injustices that it had documented in its report. </PARA>
<PARA> The report recommended that all defence force members on continuous full time duty for 12 months or more should be eligible and required to join the DFRB scheme, that all contributing members be required to contribute at a flat rate of 5.5 per cent of pay and that retired pay and invalid pay be expressed as a percentage of final pay and adjusted annually so that relativity with average weekly earnings was maintained. However, the leading recommendation of the Jess Committee that the existing DFRB Act be repealed and a new scheme introduced which should apply to both retirees and serving members was not then fully implemented. In the event, the old DFRB scheme with all its anomalies, inequities and injustices was retained for all personnel who retired before 1 October 1972. </PARA>
<PARA> The new scheme, the present DFRDB scheme, covers all who retired after 1 October 1972. It is clear that the Jess Committee intended to use the rate of pay as the determining factor. Sections 19 and 23 of the Act are equally clear in specifying that contributions and benefits will be based on actual rate of pay. The Minister's contention that this amending legislation will restore the operation of the scheme to the basis intended since its inception in October 1972 does not stand up. It does not stand up in the words of the legislation, as was clearly demonstrated by the Federal Court decision; it does not stand up to any reading of the Jess Committee's report. We only have to go back to the original pamphlet on the DFRDB scheme which was made available to those transferring to the new scheme on the eve of the 1972 election. One would be forgiven for thinking that the timing of the new scheme amounted to a last minute attempt to buy the servicemen's votes. </PARA>
<PARA> The pamphlet stated that the new scheme was based on recommendations of a joint select committee now known as the Jess Committee, to which I have referred. The pamphlet went on to state that contributions were payable at the rate of 5.5 per cent of the member's fortnightly rate of pay with effect from the first pay-day following 1 October 1972. There was no reference in the pamphlet to substantive rank. The reference before and in the pamphlet was constantly to the rate of pay received by the servicemen. The fornightly rate of pay for contribution purposes was the member's annual rate of pay multiplied by 14 and divided by 365. The annual rate of pay for contribution purposes was the maximum rate of pay for the member's rank-that is, where increments are provided, the maximum of the salary range for that rank-plus service allowance if payable. The pamphlet said specifically that a member whose annual rate of pay was reduced could elect to have the change in pay disregarded for the purposes of both contributions and benefits. Perhaps this was not what the Government intended servicemen to believe. Perhaps it was not what the Government intended them to believe was the general purpose of the new scheme. But it is certainly what they were told at the time-it is nonsense for the Minister to suggest that the amending legislation is being put up simply to restore the original intention. One can judge the original intention only by information which was given to servicemen at the time. One can judge it only as the Federal Court judged it-by the words in the legislation itself.</PARA>
<PARA> Certainly the new scheme, even as it was stated then, did not satisfy servicemen and did not satisfy DFRB pensioners at the time. After a lapse of some years and a renewal of the complaints on behalf of the original DFRB pensioners, the Fraser Government appointed Mr Duke Bonnett, a former member of parliament, to inquire into and report on the matter. Mr Bonnett reported in February 1978 that the complaints were justified and strongly recommended that a number of steps be taken to upgrade the benefits paid to the original DFRB pensioners, noting that 'some of these retired personnel fought in two, and even three wars in which our country was involved and that a review of those pension entitlements is no more than justice merited'. The Government took no action on the Bonnett report until, after repeated representations, the Minister for Defence announced in a brief statement in November 1979 that all the recommendations had been rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Regular Defence Forces Welfare Association pointed out in a carefully prepared paper presented to the first national conference of ex-service organisations in August this year, the attitude of the Fraser Ministry since that time has been universally hostile to all attempts to achieve some measure of justice for these older ex-servicemen and their widows. This legislation represents a similar hostility to those who qualified under the new DFRDB scheme. The same organisation rightly contends that the real reason for the proposed amendment to the Act currently under consideration by this House is that the Department of Defence has made a major error in its interpretation of the Act, as demonstrated by the Federal Court ruling, and now wants the Act amended to bring it into line with its erroneous interpretation. It not only wants to cover this error but also wants to avoid the administrative effort involved in setting the error right. It goes without saying that this course also attracts the present Government as it will save some money by reducing the pensions of the affected members and their widows. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not the case, however, that service conditions are so attractive, as has been asserted by members of the Government parties, in this economic climate. It is not the case that the Government can get away with this penny pinching approach to the welfare of those who are charged with the responsibility of defending this country. It is not only this area that creates problems for the Government and problems for ex-servicemen. The major areas of complaint dealt with by the Office of the Defence Force Ombudsman include administrative changes on pay, allowances and conditions of service and discharge decisions. Other decisions have been made which have affected ex-servicemen and servicemen in this way. At a time when expensive Army Reserve recruiting campaigns were conducted by the Government to the somewhat revolutionary tune of that well known composer of the 1812 Overture, the Government's razor gang abolished the Former Regular Services Members vocational Training Scheme. That scheme enabled retired servicemen to train for a job in civilian life, to make up in part for their relatively short careers unless they were destined for senior office. Many officers, faced with retirement on inadequate pensions in their middle age, have taken advantage of the scheme to help them into either industry or their own business undertaking. Now that scheme has gone. For those still serving, inadequate pay increases of 2.95 per cent granted on top of 4 per cent in July 1980 have led to complaints particularly from lower ranks. I believe that every member of this place has received letters about this matter. One could be forgiven for believing that this Government, which purports to be so keen on defence matters, would be trying to make current service conditions, training, housing and retirement benefits as attractive as possible. This legislation, of couse, demonstrates that this is not so. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir William Keys, the President of the Returned Services League, was quoted in the Canberra Times of 4 September 1980 as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe any fair-minded adjudicator would go for certain preferment in the serviceman's basic rates of pay. They have to be available for duty all day, every day and are subject to incredible family turbulence caused by frequent moves. They often have to engage in dangerous work and training and they have to be available to place their lives at risk should the nation ask them to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think anyone can argue with that statement. I do not think anyone can argue that their rates of pay and their rates of retirement benefits should not be at least the equal of those in the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> It is significant that the Returned Services League and the Regular Defence Forces Welfare Association have recently agreed to form a conditions of service committee to study the current problems and provide advice to the Government in this area, advice that has been ignored in the past and I suppose will be ignored in the future. They consider that a source of independent advice free from the constrictions of the bureaucracy should be of valuable aid to the Government in avoiding the blunders and thoughtlessness which I believe are presented in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation affects not only servicemen but also defence force widows, especially those under the DFRDB scheme. The majority of defence widows living on pensions obtained under the Defence Forces Retirement Benefit Act 1948-1973, the old DFRB, receive an income below the current level of the poverty line. During their husband's service in the defence forces a significant portion of the family income was a mandatory contribution to the DFRB fund. The present situation is widely regarded within the defence community as evidence of the Government's neglect and disinterest in the welfare of Service families. These widows need an increase in their pension to provide some measure of justice. </PARA>
<PARA> Annual consumer price index adjustments to the pension of the widows of servicemen retired under the DFRDB scheme are not at the full rate of the declared CPI percentage. The present practice of eroding these widows' pensions by granting them only part of the CPI rate is a mean and, I suggest, petty measure which actually saves very little money but gives great offence to Service families who view it as a Government confidence trick against the widows and the orphans of ex-sevicement. The discrimination against defence widows who married prior to 10 November 1977 should be ended. All widows whose pensions were terminated because of remarriage before this date should in fact have their pensions restored as a matter of right. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to taking up these matters at the national conference of ex-service organisations, the Regular Defence Forces Welfare Association recommended other changes. It has recommended that the membership of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority should be enlarged to include a defence widow as a member of the Authority, a reasonable request, I suggest. It considers the present structure of the Authority as much too restrictive in a body dealing with the administration of some thousands of widows and orphans, and I suggest that it has a point. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly the DFRDB legislation needs adjustment. But it is a common situation in the defence forces of this country, and particularly in the Army, that people move on to acting rank rather than substantive rank, and they move on to that rank for considerable periods because this is the way in which our defence forces are run. It was clearly the intention of the Jess Committee and of the pamphlets which were issued to members of the defence forces that contributions to the DFRDB scheme and benefits from the DFRDB scheme should have been based on actual salaries. The Federal Court of Australia agreed with this and took the view that this was clearly the intention of the legislation as it was stated. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that there is obviously a need to reconsider this legislation. We believe that obviously some people will be detrimentally affected by it. It is for this reason that I think we all should have a close look at this legislation. It is for this reason that I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out all words after ''That'', insert ''the Senate calls for the deferment of consideration of the Bill until the Government has prepared and presented additional amendments to provide for the establishment of the right of Service personnel who serve temporarily in a higher capacity than their substantive rank, to elect to contribute at the rate applicable to the temporary higher grade and to qualify for benefits as if the temporary higher rank were the substantive rank.''</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that if this Bill were deferred and if the Government looked at the recommendations of the Jess Committee and looked carefully at the situation and compared the position of those in the defence forces with those in the Public Service generally, the Government would arrive at the same conclusion as the Jess Committee's recommendations and the original legislation's intention. Such benefits should be contributed to and paid for at the actual salary rank. This would result in not only the elective provision that we call for in the legislation but also a reversion to what was clearly the intention of the original committee and the original legislation. It is for this reason that I have moved the amendment on behalf of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are interested obviously in anything which provides an adequate career service opportunity for people in the defence forces. It is essential, I think, that we should provide that opportunity. I think that has not been sufficiently provided in the past and the organisation of our defence forces has suffered. People who go into the defence forces and who want to see their way through a lifetime career ought to be given every opportunity to do so. For this reason we are a little concerned about the proposed amendment of the Australian Labor Party. We have considerable sympathy for it and for the anomalous cases that have been described by Senator Grimes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of our problems is that we have had very little time to consider this Labor Party amendment. If the Labor Party had agreed to let us know something about it a little earlier perhaps we would have been able to give it more mature consideration. But as it stands now and on our observation of it at this time, there are a number of problems. There is a problem, for instance, about what would happen if a person were allowed to go up for a considerable period to a rate applicable to the temporary higher grade he was on and then had to revert to the previous grade. Would he then have contributions refunded to him or would he remain in a position where he was better off than the person who was on that substantive rank and had never been advanced further? That is a question which I think I would like the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) to deal with when he sums up on this matter. I take it that some thought has been given to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Our fundamental objection is that we cannot legislate to justify anomalies. Basically this amendment says that there is an anomalous situation, for one reason or another, a degree of instability, perhaps, in our defence forces, which ought not to be the case in peace time in a country which has a regularly planned Defence Force. In that case it should be possible for a person going through the various areas of promotion to expect substantive promotion progressively and to pay superannuation at that rate. Perhaps that cannot be achieved for a variety of reasons, and I do not think any sort of band-aiding or patchworking around it will be very good in improving that basic situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Plainly a short term temporary promotion will not warrant a request to pay superannuation payments at the higher rate. There is no reason why a person who is promoted for only a short period to a higher rank-and it is usually known that it will be a short period-should pay those higher payments. There is no reason at all why we should even expect that to be the case. The man who might expect it to be the case would be the man going into the temporary higher position for a considerable period. Our position is that if the Labor Party wishes to sanctify and justify that kind of situation in the defence forces, it is also then saying to us that it wants a continuation in the defence forces of a situation where everything is such a mess all the time that it is not known whether people can be promoted to those ranks, and I remind honourable senators that I am speaking of promotions for a lengthy period. </PARA>
<PARA> Here again I think it is most unfair to the officers or people of any rank who are occupying these positions. If they are to occupy a position for a considerable period, certainly a sufficient period to make them think it will be worth their while to pay higher contributions, they ought to have some reason to believe that at some stage the position will become a substantive rank. We do not see any reason why that should not happen. We suggest to the Labor Party that if it wants to legislate here it should look at that sort of situation and try to encourage that system to apply in our defence forces. If we do that, we will create a situation in which people going into the defence forces will not do as they are doing now. They will go into an acting rank with no real certainty of whether they will hold that position. They know that they have a regular stepladder of promotion which I think they have every reasonable right to expect. For that reason we do not believe that it is worth while delaying this Bill and we are opposed to the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, I have been quite silent for some time. Just because I have spoken a couple of times today does not mean you can cut me off, Mr Minister. I am drawn into this debate by the foolishness of the Acting Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Mason). I have not heard so much rubbish in all of my life as I heard from Senator Mason. I take it that those members of the defence forces who have listened to him would agree with me that it is necessary for the Democrats to have a look at the amendment and perhaps even seek an adjournment of the debate so that its members can take a more intelligent position on it. In the short time that I have had to peruse it I have come to the conclusion that what is good enough for parliamentarians in this place is good enough for members of the defence forces. Under our superannuation scheme, if a parliamentarian moves to an executive position and he is paid at the higher rate he contributes at the higher rate. There is a formula by which superannuation is paid according to the earnings that he received during the period of his service.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V4">Senator GEORGES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a parallel situation. Senator Mason is talking about substantive ranks. Any position which a member takes in this place can be quite temporary. A member could be a Whip for a year or five years and then he could revert to his former position. A member could be a Minister for a period and then lose that position if there were a change in government. But when it comes to payment of superannuation, the payment is based on the amount that a person has earned. There is a formula by which the superannuation can be calculated to the benefit of the person concerned. It seems to be quite odd that the Australian Democrats do not accept the amendment which would provide justice for these people in the defence forces. There is no real problem about the calculation. It is quite simple. When a person moves to a higher rank in a temporary capacity his contribution is based on his earnings in that position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This happens on many occasions in the armed forces because of transfers and overseas assignments which may render it necessary for someone to move up to a temporary position. Although that may not be an appropriate illustration we have heard of the situation in which it was necessary for a person to take a temporary rank for a period of some 18 months. That is not unusual in the Army and of necessity it does happen. During that time he will earn a higher salary and he should be entitled to pay the higher superannuation contribution. Even though at a subsequent time he may go back to a lower rate of earnings, having contributed to the superannuation fund at a higher rate for a period his entitlement at the end of his period of service should be based on his earnings. I cannot understand why Senator Mason cannot see the simple justice of the proposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If he does not, he ought to. If there happens to be an anomoly in one area that is not an argument against the proposition which has been put in this debate. If public servants are not entitled to make higher contributions when they are doing work at a higher level and therefore get a higher entitlement the Democrats ought to be presenting a case in support of what is being proposed for the armed Services. That is my view and I think there is justice in the proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot for the life of me understand why there has been the amount of opposition that has been described in the case of the person named Duncan. It seems to me that the bureaucrats have dug their toes in, as is often the case. I have seen this evidenced in hearings before the Public Accounts Committee. Bureaucrats for some reason or other become terribly stubborn about a position and seek to use the Parliament to justify the position they have taken. This is exactly what is happening in this instance. It happened to the man named Duncan. That is a clear example that those in charge of the administration of the fund for the armed Services have refused to do justice to the people concerned and, in spite of the investigations and findings of various committees, they have refused to accept those findings and have sought by legislation to have their own way. This is what has happened in this instance. I suggest to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) that the amendment which now of course has little chance of being agreed to because the Democrats have taken such a--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak on the second reading of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Amendment Bill to raise a particular matter, if I am permitted, which is of concern to the defence forces of Australia and of great concern to all of the members of the defence forces of Australia, that is, the practice of the bureaucrats to withhold moneys owing to discharged members of the forces. In some cases DFRB payments, payments in lieu of accrued leave and payments of various sorts are withheld for considerable periods to the great embarrassment of those who have given service to this country and who have sought and obtained their discharge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) that the crux of this matter is whether in fact the Commonwealth should be entitled to behave like a private debtor by holding money back in case any is owing in return. What occurs is that these payments, in many cases amounting to hundreds of dollars and in other cases some thousands of dollars, are withheld against the possibility that some debt had been incurred by the member who has been discharged and against the possibility that, for example, stores for which a member has been responsible have not been returned. However, the crux of the matter is whether, in fact, the Commonwealth ought to be entitled to act like a private debtor. In principle, I regard this action on the part of a public authority as improper. The Commonwealth appears to be able to get away with it because legal action to enforce entitlements takes longer than it takes for payment to be made in the normal course of events. Quite frankly the Minister may point to the Defence Act. Section 12 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Any person who has been a member of the Defence Force may after having ceased to be a member recover from the Commonwealth by suit in any court of competent jurisdiction any moneys which under his engagement or by any agreement with the Commonwealth are due to him. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that power really is thwarted by the fact that the length of time it would take for the serviceman to avail himself of that provision in the Act would exceed, in most cases, the length of time that the money is withheld. If pay is withheld to ensure recovery of money other than that authorised by statute or regulation then it is being held for an illegal purpose. The Air Force Regulations and the Air Force Act are quite specific in regard to this. I quote section 136 of the Air Force Act, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The pay of an officer or airman of the regular air force shall be paid without any deduction other than the deductions authorised by this or any other Act or by any Air Force Regulation for the time being. </PARA>
<PARA>That is one example. There are similar provisions in Acts relating to other arms of the Services. Air Force Regulation 529A provides:</PARA>
<PARA> Except as provided by these Regulations, or any other regulations under the Act or under the Act and any other Act or Acts, salary, allowances, gratitudes and rewards payable to a member of the Air Force in respect of his service shall be absolutely inalienable prior to their actual receipt by the member, whether by way of or in consequence of an assignment or charge, or an agreement to assign or charge, or otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact what actually is occurring now by dint of a decision by some bureaucrats is that the pay is withheld as a matter of course, and that is being done illegally. It is being withheld for an illegal purpose. The fact that it is being withheld in anticipation of a liability, the identity of which is not yet known, only adds to the dubiousness of the practice. However, adequate remedies are not available. If money had been withheld to acquit a debt an ex-serviceman could sue for that pay after ceasing to be a member. In fact, as I mentioned before, he could sue in reference to the Act. He would succeed and the Commonwealth would have no defence. Its position would depend on its ability to counter-claim for its alleged debt. But as I mentioned before, the rights of the serviceman under the Act are thwarted by reason of the fact that the time that legal action would take would exceed the ultimate pay-up time determined by the bureaucrats. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Services are saying in effect is: 'You might owe us some money. Whether you do or not we have not as yet determined. Therefore, we will withhold a sum against that contingency. We will not sue you to recover any subsequently discovered alleged debt, we will simply deduct it from the money we withhold. If you do not agree you must sue us'. That is the principle of might is right. It does not go down at all well with the servicemen of Australia. As I mentioned, there is no legislative authority for Defence to withhold money from servicemen's pay. An argument advanced is that the protection given by legislative authority to the servicemen ceases to apply to discharged members. Of course, that argument is absurd because its corollary is that if a serviceman has incurred a debt then that debt too ceases on the discharge of the member. In fact, that sort of argument by the bureaucrats would fall to the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> The bureaucrats hold that withholding is lawful; at least I presume they do. I have not heard them state that. That is based on a completely incorrect interpretation of some recent legal advice which I will not table before the Parliament. If the Minister wants he can have the information given to the Department by the Acting Assistant Crown Solicitor. The advice itself is subject to review because of conflict with the opinion of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). On this occasion I agree with the Attorney-General's opinion. The action has been taken simply to avoid the inconvenience and expense of proving debts in courts of law and recovering any proven debt in accordance with the law. Those most affected are those who have either served long enough to accumulate furlough entitlements or who have been unable-usually through pressure of work-to exhaust their recreation leave entitlements before discharge. In fact, the system is unjust and an abuse of bureaucratic power. I apologise for grasping this opportunity to speak but I hope that this practice, having been exposed, will now cease. I intend to keep my eye on it. The servicemen of this country are entitled to the protection of the law. They are entitled to the protection of this parliament. The action that has been taken by the bureaucrats does in fact affect more seriously those who have served this country for many years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a proposed amendment to the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme which in itself is a relatively new scheme introduced some years ago to replace a former scheme which had a number of deficiencies. The problem that this Bill addresses arose out of an interpretation by the Federal Court of a provision of the scheme dealing with the effect of acting rank on entitlement to pension benefits. The new scheme was not understood to provide any special additional benefits for those on acting rank; retirement benefits being determined by reference to substantive rank. However, interpretation by the court of the particular provision was to the contrary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill is designed to restore what was understood by the Government-I understand also by the Services-to be the nature of the scheme. The amendment is not one dreamed up and put forward by bureaucrats-the word being used in the somewhat pejorative sense in the debate here-but it is an amendment supported by the Services as well; Service chiefs have supported it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has moved an amendment which would extend a rather extraordinary benefit to those temporarily holding higher ranks. Such persons, having served in a temporary position, would qualify for a permanent benefit. Having listened to Senator Mason and Senator Georges speak to the Opposition's amendment, I must say that Senator Mason understands it far better than does Senator Georges. Indeed, he pointed out very effectively the difficulties that the Opposition's amendment would create. Whether or not the Opposition intended that those difficulties would be created, or that what Senator Georges has been advocating would happen, is something that Australian Labor Party senators may work out for themselves. It is not for me, the Government, the Australian Democrats, or any other senator to work out what the Opposition intended. The fact is that what Senator Georges understood the amendment to do is not borne out by what the amendment says. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only would the passage of the amendment create anomalies; it would also cause untold, incalculable increases in the costs of the scheme. It is typical of the Opposition to propose amendments without any regard whatever to the burden on taxpayers. We saw, when the Australian Labor Party attempted to govern, the mess to which it brought the country. The attitude that the Opposition has adopted today shows clearly that it has no understanding whatever of the burdens that such a course would impose on the taxpayers of this country. The Government does not accept the amendment. Indeed, Senator Mason has very effectively given reasons why it should not be accepted. I need not add to or repeat them. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine has raised another matter altogether. Obviously, it is one of importance. Unfortunately, I had not been appraised of it and cannot respond to it now. However, I am concerned that certain action taken in this area might not be in accordance with legal rights. I will certainly have the matter investigated and provide Senator Harradine with an answer as soon as I can. I hope that the Senate will give the measure a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Companies and Securities Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill is an omnibus Bill which makes amendments to the various Acts which have been passed in the implementation of the National Companies and Securities Co-operative Scheme-a Scheme which has been so widely trumpeted by the Government and its various apologists as the greatest innovation in company law ever to occur in Australia. I suppose to some extent that is accurate. But that it is accurate is a measure of the minimal achievement we have regrettably so far made in this particular area. The Scheme in question, of course, involves the National Companies and Securities Commission Act and the four constituent codes associated with it-the takeovers code, the Securities Industry Act 1980, the interpretation code embodied in the Incorporations and Securities Interpretation and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1980 and the companies code embodied in the Companies Act 1981.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the companies code before the States introduce their own respective companies application of laws Bills, the State Bills being the only ones now required to be passed in order to implement the entire scheme of legislation. In this respect we note however with some dismay the recent announcement by the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities at its meeting on 25 September that the introduction of the uniform companies legislation has been deferred yet again and will now not be operative until 1 July 1982, if indeed even then. The speed with which these deferment decisions are made, by contrast with any other kind of decisions, is indicated by the fact that it was only as recently as 10 September that the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) in his second reading speech was still saying that the latest operative date for the introduction of the code was 1 January 1982. But now it is July 1982 and on past experience it could well be stretched yet again. </PARA>
<PARA> We deplore all those delays and we deplore the further delays that are embodied in this decision because, quite apart from anything else, they are symptomatic of the whole cumbersome, clumsy character of this national exercise in so-called co-operative federalism. The reason for the delay-to have 'a three-month general examination' of the legislation and to allow public comment on it-simply does not stand up to any kind of close scrutiny. The Ministers were also quoted as having agreed at their Council meeting that the deferral arose 'because no States had put the Bill to their respective parliaments'. Those quotations are from a report in the Australian Financial Review of 28 September. If the only reason for the deferment of the code is that no State has yet got around to implementing the legislation, what kind of charade is it that we are witnessing? To what extent will there be co-operation in this so-called co-operative enterprise if the constituent units engaged in that co-operative enterprise cannot even be relied upon to co-operate sufficiently to pass their own enabling legislation to get the legislation up? Our question, which we have to go on asking on these occasions, is: How much longer can this charade go on? What was the real reason for the deferment? I will be fascinated to get some better and further details from the Minister in his reply. </PARA>
<PARA> If the reason for the deferment was in fact to secure more public scrutiny or to enable more consultation with the public, that simply defies credibility, since the Companies Act 1981 was only finally enacted after a very lengthy period of such public consultation-in fact, after two separate exposure drafts being promulgated. While we, of course, regard the process of public consultation as being highly desirable in itself, before any major legislation of this kind is enacted, we have to make the point that much of that process so far has been unsatisfactory insofar as it has allowed a disproportionate weight to certain sectional interests, particularly organisations of directors and accountants. So much is visible from the results of the public scrutiny and the reform that has been implemented as a result of it so far. </PARA>
<PARA> I am afraid that we cannot believe that any further substantial movement in the improvement and the quality of this legislation will be gained by more public exposure at this stage. To be realistic, the few expert company lawyers and the few energetic company secretaries who will ever get on top of this legislation-not to mention the even fewer parliamentarians who have the faintest idea of what it is about; I only very barely place myself in that category and I doubt whether anyone else would approach this enormous legislation with very much more confidence than that-will gain anything more by the extension of the process at this stage and will simply experience a greater frustration at having to relearn it all and redeal with it all when the legislation comes into operation in July 1982. What is more, as the Minister said in his second reading speech, members of the Ministerial Council have already agreed among themselves that during 1982 there will be no substantive amendments to the initial legislation. Any further process of public consultation, exposure for comment or reanalysis of the legislation will not matter a tinker's damn when it comes to the actual initial text of the legislation in the form in which, it is hoped, it will get off the ground.</PARA>
<PARA> We were told by the Minister, again in his second reading speech, that there is some prospect that the process of implementing substantive reform in this area will commence in 1982, with the prospect of legislation to amend the companies code being implemented in 1983. To the extent that that is so, comment at this stage would clearly be inappropriate and irrelevant to that exercise and even more so to the immediate task in front of us, which is to get this companies code off the ground. I suggest that what we are confronting here is simply another classic demonstration of administrative political inertia. It is the kind of inertia which has characterised all the decision makers. I exempt only the handful of them who have been associated with this enterprise from its outset. It is exactly the kind of inertia that we can expect and go on expecting so long as we insist on operating our national companies and securities legislation in the Heath Robinson fashion that is involved in this co-operative scheme rather than having single national legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> If the real reason for the deferral yet again does not have anything to do with further public comment and consultation or improvement of the legislation, as seems certainly the case, and if the real reason is simply the failure of the States, for one reason or another-I will come to some of those in a moment, particularly as far as Queensland is concerned-to pass the enabling legislation, that demonstrates once again in a nutshell, as I have already suggested, that this kind of co-operative exercise is the slowest way of getting even minimal law reform in an area that has been crying out for it for decades. The whole process simply bogs down in the complex and laborious grinding legislative machinery which is characterised-or perhaps caricatured-as co-operative federalism. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments in the Bill are very lengthy but none of them amount to very much at all so far as substantive effect is concerned. It is for that reason that, although we take the opportunity of the introduction of this Bill to make a number of points about the progress of the so-called co-operative scheme, we do not seek in any way either to amend or to object to the text of the Bill that is now before us. We do take the occasion, however, to remind the Senate that we have been pressing not only for the kind of things that are embodied in the second reading amendment, to which I will refer in a moment, but also for a series of substantive reforms in the subject matter of company law. We identified what at least 16 of those major reforms were in a second reading amendment moved to one of the earlier parts of this legislative package on 28 May 1981. I believe those matters deserve repetition at this stage but, in order to avoid trespassing unduly on the patience of the Senate at this late hour, I seek leave to incorporate the text of that proposed set of amendments in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The big question that has to be now confronted, of course, is just what the future of this co-operative scheme is going to be. As I have foreshadowed, we take the opportunity that is provided by this legislation to put down on the record once again, hopefully with some prospect this time of its actual passage through this chamber, a second reading amendment which states in short and succinct compass what we regard as the basic deficiences of the co-operative scheme and what we think ought to be done about implementing it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me indicate what the second reading amendment is. The first matter of concern that we express our indignation about is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government's abdication of its responsibility to make national laws for companies and securities pursuant to the Commonwealth's own constitutional powers, and in accordance with the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange in 1974 (the Rae Report);</PARA>
<PARA>Here I simply interpolate that certainly the Opposition has never wanted to give absolutely carte blanche endorsement to everything in that Rae committee report of 1974, but we certainly support, and always have supported, its basic thrust as far as the need for national legislation is concerned, that is, legislation pursuant to the Commonwealth's constitutional powers under section 51(xx) in relation to corporations, together with a miscellany of other supporting powers in the areas of banking, insurance, communications and interstate trade. We have always argued-I will not repeat the argument because we have made it at greater length on earlier occasions-that were there the will to implement national companies and securities legislation, there is a constitutional way to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the text of the amendment that is proposed to the Senate tonight. The second matter of concern is this:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the lack of effective accountability of the National Companies and Securities Commission to either the Government or Parliament of the Commonwealth, or to any other single elected Government or Parliament . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The point being made there, which I will pick up again later in my response to this Bill, is that, where a commission such as the National Companies and Securities Commission is accountable or responsible to a number of different governments, the reality is that such a system means accountability to no one. That was amply demonstrated in this year's Budget with its one-line appropriation with no details being given. That can create real problems, not only for the democratic process but also for the organisation itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter is the Parliament of the Commonwealth has not been given an opportunity to effectively scrutinise Bills introduced under the Co-operative Companies and Securities Scheme and will not be able effectively to determine company and securities law in the future under this scheme;</PARA>
<PARA>There are a number of points we want to make about that, not least being the failure of this Parliament to be given any opportunity to scrutinise in advance the kinds of amendments that are proposed for consideration by the Ministerial Council. Before they go to that Ministerial Council, decisions are made which become faits accompli and which it is impossible for this Parliament or any other to do anything about. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment, in a further separate paragraph, paragraph (2), states that the Senate calls upon the Government in the event of the breakdown for any reason of the scheme, of which the Bill is a part, immediately to proceed to the introduction of Commonwealth legislation for the national regulation of companies and the securities industry. </PARA>
<PARA>We will support, as we have indicated on previous occasions, the setting up of this scheme, cumbersome and impossible as it is in so many ways. But we make clear our view yet again that, if that scheme breaks down, as we believe it inevitably will-I will give chapter and verse for that dire foreboding later in this speech as far as Queensland in particular is concerned-we believe the Senate ought to express its view that the Commonwealth immediately then assume its national constitutional responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (4) reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Calls upon the Government to expedite the establishment of an Accounting Standards Review Board . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is perhaps one of the most important single elements in the original proposed package which has so far been omitted from anybody's attention but which is crying out for legislative implementation, or at least administrative implementation. Finally, paragraph (5) calls upon the Government immediately to pursue a fundamental reform of company law and, as the first stage in such reform, to institute the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee without delay. </PARA>
<PARA>Once again, in that respect, the experience of the history of the non-establishment of that Companies and Securities Law Review Committee has been an absolute shambles. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the Senate for that demonstration of confidence in the merits and fascination of my speech making. If the Government thinks that it can, by this performance tonight of negativing the adjournment motion, somehow advance the cause that it so obviously and crudely is promoting of creating a situation in which the Senate can, in fact, get up within the next three weeks, it is fooling absolutely nobody. Let it now start adjusting itself to the proposition that we will be sitting here for weeks and weeks yet, and every day that we are sitting here we will be causing the embarrassment to the Government that it so obviously is anxious to avoid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will now return to the subject matter before us tonight, which is the future of the co-operative companies and securities legislation. The basic point which needs to be made, and which is articulated in the second reading amendment which I have just been summarising, is that this scheme is simply not built on sure foundations. Clause 51 of the formal agreement establishing the scheme provides that any party to it may withdraw at any time on a year's notice being given. We have recently seen signs of strain in the operation of this scheme, particularly in the State of Queensland. Let me mention two illustrations in particular of what I have in mind. The first is the situation that arose in the context of the proposed takeover of Rothwells Outfitting Ltd by Walter Reid and Co. Ltd. In the Australian Financial Review of 26 August this year it was reported that the Queensland Attorney-General, Mr Doumany, had protested to the National Companies and Securities Commission about its having overridden a decision of the Queensland Corporate Affairs Office in this respect. The newspaper report of the telex of Mr Doumany stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . this is a co-operative scheme and that unless the commission is prepared to co-operate in the scheme I must express grave doubts about Queensland's continued willingness to co-operate in the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>The kind of scarcely veiled threat involved in that telex and the whole matter associated with it highlights the kind of tension which a co-operative scheme of this kind inevitably generates. It purports to give the States a role in legislating and administering but in order to work effectively and uniformly the States are in fact progressively frozen out. They have to be if it is to work in that way. The experience of this scheme already shows the need for a single line of responsibility; a single parliament which can effectively scrutinise the legislation, instead of none having that capacity; a single Minister who is responsible to that parliament instead of, as at the moment, no single Minister with that responsibility; and a single regulatory body which does not have to depend on co-operation from State corporate affairs commissions and in the process have to avoid treading on toes but which can control its State agencies and can operate speedily through them. </PARA>
<PARA> As I will come to again in just a moment, the Opposition applauds the performance of the National Companies and Securities Commission to date for the speed and the decisiveness of its action as well as for its admirably clear promulgation of policy and of guidelines for the exercise of discretion. Only if the NCSC can be freed from the kind of shackles that seem inevitably likely to be its lot as this co-operative scheme, both in its legislative and administrative sides, grinds on can we be confident that we will be able to be quite so laudatory in our reaction to it in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter concerning Queensland that needs to be drawn to our attention tonight is another statement of Mr Doumany, the Queensland Attorney-General, which is reported in the Age of 26 September 1981 in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Mr Sam Doumany has been working hard to quell Queensland Liberal Party fears that the uniform code would leave Queensland companies vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA>Those fears seem to relate to the relative ease of takeovers under Queensland and Commonwealth legislation. Of course the uniform takeovers legislation is now in force. Whatever the precise reason may be for these particular fears there was a suggestion that the uniform companies code would be delayed in Queensland and Western Australia. If that sort of thing is going to happen, it raises again all the old spectres of disuniformity which bedevilled the so-called uniform companies and securities industry Acts which used to be in operation, which were inaugurated in the early 1960s. The only proper way of dealing with this sort of situation to ensure that there will not be that sort of disuniformity in the future is for there to be a single Commonwealth legislation governing the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a couple of other aspects of the second reading amendment that deserve particular attention. One of them is the question of accountability, and the lack of accountability of the NCSC the way the situation is structured at the moment. I make it clear, as I have already, that in making these points about lack of accountability of the NCSC I am not making any points about lack of confidence in the capacity of the NCSC to do its job properly and effectively. Nor are we saying anything at all about the extent to which the independence of a body such as the NCSC ought to be prejudiced by being subject to overriding ministerial directions. The point we are wanting to make about accountability is a much more straightforward one than that. Before I go on to that I want to make the point, because I think it is important for this kind of confidence and respect for the NCSC to be a guiding theme in our deliberations whatever other criticism we might make of the way the situation has been going, that the reaction of the business community to the operation of the NCSC has so far been very favourable. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an attitude that is shared by the Opposition. We take the view that the Commission has intervened speedily and effectively in several takeovers where the market had not been informed and it has used its powers under the security industry legislation to suspend trading and declare conduct unacceptable under the takeovers legislation. We simply hope that the challenge to which the NCSC is now being subjected in the Northern Mining Corporation N.L. v. Endeavour Resources Ltd case presently before the courts will not in fact prove to limit the kinds of powers which it has been exercising so far. But in order for it to go on exercising those powers effectively, not the least of its needs will be more staff, and not only staff but also very highly qualified staff. In that respect I draw attention to what was said by Mr Tony Greenwood of the Commission, again reported in the Age of 26 September, who said that the funding problem would inhibit the NCSC's watchdog role unless there were some very substantial increases in this respect. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Greenwood said that there was 'little doubt that in 1978 there was the expectation that the commission would be actively engaged in national investigation work'. </PARA>
<PARA>Then he is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> But, unless there are significant changes to funding and staff in the next year or so, then that is not the way the commission is going to develop. </PARA>
<PARA>That is very cautious and very diplomatic language, but the message is very loud and very clear. This is the context in which I make the point and use it to characterise the point about the lack of accountability in the sense of direct lines of responsibility between the NCSC and this Parliament, or indeed any other, because so long as we have a situation of joint responsibility for the affairs of the NCSC and joint accountability coming back from the body to various governments and not just one, we will have a situation of continued buck-passing by the governments in question with no single government being prepared to bite the bullet on the funding and other decisions that have to be made to ensure the successful operation of a body like this. In this respect I think the point is graphically made when one looks at the Budget appropriation for the NCSC this year. The 1981-82 Budget, just as its 1980-81 predecessor, contains simply a one-line appropriation for the NCSC. This year it is $1.3m. There was not made available to the Parliament any detailed breakup of this amount nor was any detail offered to the Estimates Committee in the initial stage of its deliberations when the budgetary appropriations were being scrutinised and some attempt was being made to find out what was going on in the NCSC such as: What its staffing was like; what its funding was like, how its funds were allocated between particular functions, and what the needs of the organisation were if it were to operate on a cost effective basis for the future. Even worse than that, it was explained to the Committee-this is recorded in the Hansard of 21 September this year at page 354-as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Commonwealth Government is reluctant at this stage to put forward to you details of the expenditure because at this time the Ministerial Council has not yet approved the NCSC estimates. </PARA>
<PARA>We were confronting then a situation in which the Commonwealth Parliament was to be expected to approve an appropriation for $1.3m without any knowledge of the manner in which that appropriation was likely to be spent. Without belabouring the point any further than that because it is a point that will be made quite strongly in the report of Estimates Committee A to the Senate when it is introduced tomorrow, let me simply state that that is a classic example of exactly the phenomenon we are talking about in that paragraph in the amendment which refers to the lack of accountability of the NCSC to any government or any parliament in the nation. That is an inherent problem that arises when we try to stitch together an important reform through a co-operative, clumsy exercise of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I make specific mention of is paragraph 4 of the second reading amendment in which we call upon the Government immediately to pursue a fundamental reform of company law, and as the first stage in such reform to institute the companies and securities law review committee without delay. This has been an absolutely extraordinary saga so far as this proposed ongoing law reform body in the company law area is concerned. Clause 21 (2) of the formal agreement of December 1978 contained clear commitments by the Ministers participating in that agreement to establish a companies and securities law review committee to do various things which are set out in that paragraph-to carry out research into and essentially to advise on law reform in relation to the legislation and regulations associated with it. That there is a huge law reform task to be conducted in this area as distinct from just a codification of the existing law is made evident by the list of necessary reforms, or some of them, which I incorporated in Hansard earlier this evening. I formally move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) expresses its concern-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) at the Government's abdication of its responsibility to make national laws for companies and securities pursuant to the Commonwealth's own constitutional powers, and in accordance with the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange in 1974 (the Rae Report);</PARA>
<PARA> (b) at the lack of effective accountability of the National Companies and Securities Commission to either the Government or Parliament of the Commonwealth, or to any other single elected Government or Parliament; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) that the Parliament of the Commonwealth is not given an opportunity to effectively scrutinise Bills introduced under the Cooperative Companies and Securities Scheme and will not be able effectively to determine company and securities law in the future under this scheme;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) calls upon the Government in the event of the breakdown for any reason of the scheme, of which this Bill is a part, immediately to proceed to the introduction of Commonwealth legislation for the national regulation of companies and the securities industry;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) calls upon the Government to expedite the establishment of an Accounting Standards Review Board; and</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support the amendment moved by the Opposition. We do so because it will not delay the passage of this legislation. There is no doubt that the companies and securities legislation is long overdue and has been seriously delayed. It was promised by 1 January this year, and we are now well into the year and still it has not passed through the Parliament. I believe the Senate is to be commended for sitting into the late hours of the evening in an effort to pass the Companies and Securities Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1981.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8R7">Senator SIDDONS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, we are concerned about some of the points that Senator Evans raised. Certainly the co-operative approach that has been adopted by the Government creates very serious problems. We would much prefer national regulation of companies, as was recommended by the Rae Committee of Inquiry into Securities and Exchange. Of course, the States objected to that approach, and objected very strongly, so perhaps the Government cannot be blamed for trying this co-operative approach. The amendment that has been moved very clearly calls upon the Government, in the event of a breakdown of the scheme for any reason, to proceed immediately to the introduction of Commonwealth legislation for the national regulation of companies. We are very pleased that there is a prospect of this amendment being passed and that that attitude will be incorporated in the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to refer to only one other aspect of the amendment. The Opposition in paragraph (1) (b) states:</PARA>
<PARA> expresses its concern-at the lack of effective accountability of the National Companies and Securities Commission to either the Government or the Parliament . . . or to any other single elected . . . Parliament</PARA>
<PARA>It is our view that the National Companies and Securities Commission should be very much a free-standing body along the lines of the Australian Taxation Office. It should not have any direct interference from governments. We believe that the proper way in which to regulate the Commission would be through the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is decided that the Commission should have less discretionary power, the proper course of action would be for the Government to introduce legislation restricting that discretionary power. We do see that, in one very important area, certainly too great a discretionary power is given to the Commissioner. I refer in particular to the area of the acquisition of companies. The law states that the Commission has to decide whether conduct in that area is acceptable. Surely clearer guidelines for the Commission to operate under should be laid down. We are saying, in effect, that there has to be less discretionary power. The discretionary power of the Commission is already too great. </PARA>
<PARA> Having clarified that point, I believe it is not necessary to go over the six or seven aspects of the proposed amendment. We support the proposed amendment, particularly its last two paragraphs. The second last paragraph of the proposed amendment 'calls upon the Government to expedite the establishment of an Accounting Standards Review Board'. That is long overdue. The last paragraph of the amendment 'calls upon the Government immediately to pursue a fundamental reform of company law and, as the first stage in such reform, to institute the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee without delay'. We cannot emphasise those two vital points too strongly. Mr Deputy President, we support the proposed amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will commence and perhaps finish my remarks by addressing myself particularly to the amendment moved by the Opposition, for which the Australian Democrats have indicated their support here tonight. There are a number of matters which honourable senators should consider before a final vote is taken on this matter. Firstly, I think I should outline the very clear definition of the philosophy of the Government in its approach to this matter. Without labouring that point too much, I think it is clear from what was said in previous debates that have occurred in this place over the last couple of years that the Government's philosophical approach is one of co-operative federalism, to work within the powers of the States and the frameworks of the States which have already been created in order to institute an effective system of control over companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Just one example of the kind of point I am trying to make is the very point which Senator Evans made in addressing his remarks to section (1) (b) of his proposed amendment, regarding the 'lack of effective accountability of the National Companies and Securities Commission'. It relates to that Commission's powers, its staffing and its ability to do the job. The point I make is that, through the very system which we are creating in our co-operative approach to the matter, we will in fact be able to utilise the powers, the staff and the facilities of the corporate affairs commissions in the various States. Of course, that aspect was incorporated in the legislation enabling the creation of the National Companies and Securities Commission. Section 46 of the National Companies and Securities Commission Act provides for that. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a substantial aspect in terms of the powers and abilities of the Commission to get on with its job and to make sure it is effective in regulating companies throughout Australia. Honourable senators should bear in mind that those State commissions have a vast body of experience, ability and information concerning the operation of companies which has been accumulated over a long period. Consequently, I think the point which Senator Evans sought to make falls to the ground when one considers the very considerable powers that lie within the scope of the National Companies and Securities Commission in determining those issues. That clearly demonstrates the importance and the power of the Government's approach. It demonstrates that in fact the single-minded approach which the Opposition is proposing and which the Democrats are supporting really is the wrong approach to adopt in this kind of legislation. In fact, we have vast bodies of information, power and staffing at our disposal within the State organisations and they ought to be used for the benefit of the people of Australia in the proper way. The Federal Government is supporting this federal approach, this co-operative approach, in such a way as to maximise its opportunities to control companies. It is my belief and the Government's belief that the approach which as been outlined by the Opposition would in fact lead to a weakening of the powers of the Commonwealth. I hear no comments from Opposition senators so I take it that my points are hitting home. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important to recognise that the National Companies and Securities Commission will be responsible to the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities. We know that the lines of communication are somewhat longer than what one might expect. Nevertheless the Ministers who sit on that Council are directly responsible to their Cabinets and parliaments in respect of the operation of the Commission. Of course, reports by that body will be tabled in both Houses of this Parliament and in the State parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA> In paragraph 1(c) of the amendment the Opposition makes the point that the Parliament of the Commonwealth is not given an opportunity effectively to scrutinise Bills introduced under the co-operative companies and securities scheme. We, of course, have to consider what has gone before. We have seen the very effective community consultation that has occurred in the last few years in this regard over the various pieces of legislation that have come before this Parliament. There has been full co-operation at all levels between the States and the Commonwealth and with the general community. In addition to that, there has been a very high degree of consultation between the Government with its back bench through its own committees and with the Opposition through its various committees. I understand that the same courtesies would have been extended to the Australian Democrats had that party wished to seek full briefings in respect of this legislation. I think that those matters are of great importance. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that the whole scheme has taken a considerable number of years to get into operation. In fact it has taken some five years. We are now at a stage where the scheme is almost in place. Is Senator Evans suggesting seriously that we should discard all those years of effort in trying to--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Evans" NAMEID="VD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am not saying that.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly the honourable senator's earlier comments gave us that kind of indication. That attitude is one that the Government would not support. The Opposition's amendment also calls upon the Government, firstly, to expedite the establishment of an accounting standards review board and, secondly, to pursue a fundamental reform of company law and establish a company and securities law review committee. Might I say that both of those matters are presently before the Ministerial Council.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;See what your Minister said on--</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that this is the situation. These matters are likely to be discussed again at the next meeting of the Ministerial Council before the end of the year. In relation to the wider matter concerning reforms, I understand that the Ministerial Council will in fact be considering and exposing draft legislation in that respect for consultation with the committee in the second half of 1982.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to the final point which I suppose is the major point that Senator Evans sought to make during his speech-that is, the delays and deferment that have occurred over the last year or two and in particular the deferment which is now occurring whereby the legislation will not come into force on 1 January 1982 but rather 1 July 1982. Naturally enough, I think it is of fundamental importance at this time that we give the scheme every chance for success. In fact, the States will need to ensure that their clients-that is, the companies in those States which are signatories to the agreement-are represented on the Ministerial Council, have access to the legislation, are made aware of its provisions, and have every opportunity to make themselves fully aware of the conditions and provisions of the law so that this proposal gets off to an effective start. After five years of effort to get this legislation into place, to rush it through at the last minute, to cause ill feeling in the community and perhaps some misunderstandings which might denegrate that law in the minds of the public generally seems to me to be the wrong approach. Rather, we should take our time to ensure that the States are properly in place with the proper amount of consultation and a full understanding by the community. For those reasons, the Government rejects the amendments moved by the Opposition and wishes the legislation a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me take just two minutes of the time of the Committee to make one point about this complex and lengthy Bill which deals with a variety of issues. This is an ample demonstration of the need, particularly if it were to deal with more substantive matters than this one does, for an ongoing companies and securities law review committee of the kind that I was referring to at the end of my remarks at the second reading stage when I was so rudely interrupted by the bell. In that respect let me add one thing so far as the Government's attitude to this sort of thing is concerned. I think an absolutely extraordinary statement was made the other day by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Moore, when this very question of the honouring of the obligation to establish such a review committee was raised. In the House of Representatives on 23 September 1981 he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As for a continuing law review committee, I could think of nothing worse than to have a group of people sitting continually to think up new ways to amend the Companies Act and associated matters. If one sits down and creates a job for someone that person is bound to think up something . . . It is incomprehensible to me, a simple country lad, to understand why we need such things. </PARA>
<PARA>For that kind of remark to be made by a responsible Minister, reacting to the agreement of this Government with every other government in the nation-the Maroochydore agreement-to establish such a committee, is to demonstrate not just the attitude of a simple country lad but something much worse. Indeed, it is a blot on the reputation of simple country lads for anyone to make a statement of that kind. No lad from the country or anywhere else could be so simple, unsophisticated and obtuse as to make that statement when the system of companies and securities legislation is in the condition that it is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall be as brief as I can. I raise a subject that, according to the newspapers today, the Australian Medical Association thinks unsuitable for public debate.

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>CHALLENGE TO WOMB REMOVALS</PARA>
<PARA>By Sue Cook</PARA>
<PARA>At least half the medically insured women in Australia can now expect to have their wombs removed surgically-but at what price?</PARA>
<PARA> The Doctors Reform Society says a great many such operations are unnecessay, precipitate more physical and emotional problems than they solve and waste millions of dollars of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> The society claims some predatory members of the medical profession are benefiting from the minimum of $280 they charge for perfoming a hysterectomy and which takes most gynaecologists only 30 to 40 minutes to perform. </PARA>
<PARA> New statistics from the NSW Health Commission show more than 80 per cent of all hysterectomies in Australia are performed on privately insured patients, according to Dr Brian Learoyd, a former NSW president of the Doctors' Reform Society and chairman of a seminar on unnessary surgery held at the University of Sydney last week. </PARA>
<PARA> He says Australian women are experiencing a rate of hysterectomy on a par with American women, but had the operation twice as often as British women and four times as often as Swedish women. </PARA>
<PARA> A leading obstetrician and gynaecologist, Professor Derek Llewellyn-Jones, said it was unlikely there were great differences in the physiology and hormonal patterns between Australian women and British or Swedish women. </PARA>
<PARA> He said hysterectomy had become fashionable among Australian surgeons, perhaps because of the system of medical payments. There was no financial incentive for doctors to explore the alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the Australian Medical Association and the General Practitioners' Society in Australia deny the claims by the Doctors' Reform Society of 'overwhelming' evidence of unnecessary surgery. </PARA>
<PARA> The NSW spokesman for the General Practitioners' Society in Australia, Dr Hal Soper, said the claim was ridiculous and hysterectomy was, above all, the operation of comfort and liberation for troubled women. </PARA>
<PARA> He said all surgery was initiated by the patients' complaints. The general practitioner then comfirmed whether surgery was necessary by investigation and surgical opinion. In doubtful cases further opinion was sought. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Soper said the society wanted an urgent public debate on unnecessary surgery with the Doctors Reform Society. </PARA>
<PARA> The AMA has told the Doctors Reform Society it does not think the subject is suitable for public debate but obviously it is concerned by the continuing allegations. The association announced last week two surgical audits to look into the claims. One of these is being conducted by the Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists into hysterectomies. </PARA>
<PARA> A detailed examination of 100 cases in each of 20 hospitals will take place in each State in both public and private hospitals. The Doctors' Reform Society said the most alarming revelation of the new N.S.W. statistics was the ''gross and continuing'' disparity between the numbers of hysterectomies being performed on private patients and public patients. </PARA>
<PARA>High Rate</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The audit will study cases where the womb was removed for reasons other than cancer. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Learoyd said the AMA was intent only on ''re-discovering the wheel or motherhood''. He said the N.S.W. Health Commission statistics confirmed the continuing high rate of hysterectomies performed in at least N.S.W. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures showed privately insured patients were almost three times more likely to have a hysterectomy or a curettage-the scraping of the womb for a pathological diagnosis. </PARA>
<PARA> ''The money is continually getting in the way of proper clinical and ethical consideration of the patient's best interests,'' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> ''Women are being frightened and pressured into hysterectomy.''</PARA>
<PARA> More than 50 per cent of women in N.S.W. with medical insurance would have a hysterectomy at a current annual cost of $20 million. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Learoyd said there had been an ''alarming'' increase of 50 per cent in diagnostic curettage rates between 1978 and 1979-now more than twice the U.S. rate and four times the British rate. </PARA>
<PARA> ''We think these figures are disturbing, alarming and convincing,'' said Dr Learoyd. </PARA>
<PARA> ''What responsible professional medical bodies should be doing now is clamoring for some redemptive action.''</PARA>
<PARA> He said many studies showed surgical rates could be reduced by as much as 50 per cent if a second opinion were sought. Every major Australian teaching hospital should have second opinion clinics where the patient could go free-of-charge. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Learoyd said he was horrified by the recent Federal Government decision to increase the surgical bed day subsidy for private hospitals. This would be an incentive to many to perform unnecessary operations. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Llewellyn-Jones, associate professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at Sydney University, said he was not advocating that hysterectomies should only be performed where there was a malignancy. </PARA>
<PARA> ''What I am concerned about is the woman who sees her doctor on Monday and is told she must have a hysterectomy on Thursday,'' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> ''She is being pressured into having an operation without the time for reflection.''</PARA>
<PARA> He said there was a tendency among the medical profession to take short cuts and fall back on old training which told them if the organ was removed the symptoms would disappear. </PARA>
<PARA> Curettages used to be performed 15 years ago to cure bleeding disorders, but Professor Llewellyn-Jones said he could see no cause now for anything but a diagnostic curettage. </PARA>
<PARA> A diagnostic curettage is done either to determine the nature of the endometrium, the lining of the womb, so appropriate treatment can be clearly defined; to exclude the presence of endometrial malignancy; or, on a lesser scale, to establish whether ovulation has occurred in some infertile women. </PARA>
<PARA> When a hysterectomy is performed the ovaries may also be removed. If this is done to a woman whose ovaries were functioning she will experience marked menopausal symptoms. Professor Llewellyn-Jones said although these symptoms could be treated with artificial hormones, where the ovaries could be left they should be. </PARA>
<PARA>Questions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Apart from malignant disease of the uterus, hysterectomies were done when the woman had fibroids-non-malignant muscle tumors which distort the shape of the uterus. Professor Llewellyn-Jones said that was a tendency for gynaecologists because of their training to say to the woman she was better off having her uterus removed. But he believes women should be offered a choice and be involved in making the decision. </PARA>
<PARA> He said hysterectomy for birth control was not very common in Australia, but doctors in the US suggested women who were going to have their tubes tied as a permanent method of birth control should have a hysterectomy instead to prevent later complications. </PARA>
<PARA> He said the major reason for the different hysterectomy rates between Australia and Sweden and Britain was the number of hysterectomies being performed on women with menstrual disorders. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of questions had to be answered to explain the different rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Beverley Raphael, professor of psychiatry at the University of Newcastle, conducted a study in which 194 women were interviewed immediately after having a hysterectomy. They were followed up after 13 months and a smaller group were seen again four years later. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Hysterectomy is an extremely risky procedure for certain women because it appears to precipitate psychiatric problems in them,' said Professor Raphael. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Doctors recommending women for hysterectomy must recognise this risk of impairment in their patients and counsel them very carefully prior to any final decision to proceed with hysterectomy.'</PARA>
<PARA> In some studies 20 per cent of women who had had a hysterectomy complained of significant health impairment and depression afterwards. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Raphael's study found that, of the women seeking to have a hysterectomy, 36 per cent were already having psychiatric treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> She said if gynaecologists became more adept at recognising existing psychiatric problems in their patients the rate of hysterectomies could be reduced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate that this is a matter of public debate. I also indicate that I do not wish to debate in any detail the morality or the medical pros and cons of the operation in question. I raise the matter because the Doctors Reform Society has raised an issue in relation to the performance of what it has called unnecessary surgical procedures and a point it wishes to make in relation to private hospitals. The point I make is simply that it is an issue worthy of debate by our medical fraternity and by society. I ask the Doctors Reform Society and others to pick some other example.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is extraordinary that on all the times this issue has been raised-it has been raised a number of times in the last two years to my positive knowledge-this is always the example given. It is raising a fear in me, as I am sure it is in many other women, that we are about to move back into the dark ages in relation to surgery on women. I would feel a lot happier about the debate if a less emotive type of surgery was the point at issue. I remember well the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hayden, being interviewed on television some time ago on the allegations he had made about unnecessary surgery and the effect it was having on medical payouts by the Commonwealth Government. When asked by the interviewer what type of procedure he was referring to, Mr Hayden specified only hysterectomies. Undoubtedly, Mr Hayden had been given some advice-one would expect some well-informed advice-on the subject and that was why he nominated it. I am sure it did not come to him alone; somebody had suggested to him that this was a surgical procedure which may be being performed unnecessarily. However, it is indicative that it is the only surgical procedure that Mr Hayden raised on that occasion. It is indicative that in this article about operations that may well be unnecessary it is the only surgical procedure that is referred to. It is indicative that in referring to a conference on unnecessary surgical procedures where certain of the statements reported in this article were made this is the only surgical procedure reported in the newspaper. It is not unreasonable therefore to conclude that that was the only surgical procedure raised. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not so long ago that it was believed-I cannot vouch for its truth but it was certainly the belief of a number of people in the medical profession and a number of the members of the community in Queensland-that there was an attitude on the part of public hospitals there that the performance of a hysterectomy on a woman under the age of 40, that is under what is accepted as child bearing age, would not be performed unless there was reason to believe that there might be a malignancy of the uterus. In other words for any reasons other than potential death by virtue of malignancy, public hospital space would not be available. That was a blanket attitude, as I understand it. It is not surprising, therefore, that a large proportion of these operations are carried out in private hospitals. There are other reasons that this could happen as well. It could well relate to the general financial situation of the women who will take something that is elective surgery but elective in the sense that it is not a question of life or death. </PARA>
<PARA> I am disturbed by the use of the term 'unnecessary' because nobody tries to define what is 'necessary' or 'unnecessary'. It certainly is not defined in this article. I hope the Doctors Reform Society, the Australian Medical Association, the General Practitioners Society and anyone else who joins this debate will be very careful about their definition of it. Recently the Commonwealth Government abolished medical benefits for certain plastic surgery procedures on the grounds that it was unnecessary surgery. I do not know on what advice it did it. I can only assume it was on internal advice and on the basis of personal prejudice of certain individuals. Following that decision the Government had to modify the ruling it had made and had to acknowledge that there were forms of plastic in the category specified which were deemed necessary. So we have to be very careful with this term 'necessary'. </PARA>
<PARA> I would just say also that if we are going to start talking about necessary surgical procedures we really do need a very careful definition and one that will apply to surgical procedures for ingrown toenails, the removal of the appendix, the removal of tonsils and adenoids and whole range of other areas where surgical procedures do not strictly have to be performed when one talks about life or death and in that sense are elective. But elective is not the same thing as unnecessary. I mention plastic surgery because I believe there was quite a lot of prejudice brought to bear in the decision on that issue and I certainly believe that the public reaction and Press reaction when dealing with it was based on personal prejudices which run something along the lines that people who have plastic surgery are vain and vain people do not deserve to have any sort of assistance with their surgery. Of course, doctors claimed-it was recognised subsequently by the Government-that it was not just a matter of personal vanity and concern with personal attractiveness that led to that sort of surgery; but it was prejudice. The thing that women fear, from people just harping on this one type of operation when talking about unnecessary surgery, is that basic prejudices are being operated on. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not very long ago that there was a basic community prejudice about hysterectomies and that was a prejudice that had a very profound effect on a number of women who had the operation. It is relevant to mention that matter because some reference was made to the psychiatric effect of the operation on women who have it performed on them. It was not very long ago that women who had hysterectomies kept very quiet about them because they feared what people would think about them if they knew they had had that sort of operation. They feared they would be believed to be unfeminine, that they would be unattractive to men and that they were somehow unnatural women because they had had that sort of operation. That is an absolute nonsense, of course. It is the same sort of nonsense that has led men, through a sense of machismo for some time, to believe that if they are not fertile then they would be believed to be not virile-a big difference. It was a matter of shame for many women because of community attitudes, or what they perceived to be community attitudes, that they would not allow it to be admitted that they had had this operation. Given those very deeply ingrained fears it is not surprising that there were strong psychiatric reactions. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot analyse in any detail the sort of psychiatric things that are referred to here. As I said, I do not want to go into a lot of analysis on that operation. I just say that, given that sort of psychiatric reaction, it is very dangerous, for instance, for the Doctors Reform Society or anyone else to be singling out to try to prove a matter of general principle about whether there is too much surgery which is not necessary being performed by doctors in private hospitals, or, for that matter, in public hospitals. I just beseech the Doctors Reform Society that if they want to take this issue up seriously, for the sake of the peace of mind of many women, to please seek another example. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to take the time of the Senate. I have instructed the Whip that I will take 10 minutes. I think I will be less. Senator Martin has covered most of the things that I wish to say on the subject except that I want to draw the attention of the Senate to the heading of this entire article which states, 'The operations that may well be unnecessary' and then in large capitals states, 'Challenge to womb removals'. The very first paragraph says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At least half the medically insured women in Australia can now expect to have their wombs removed surgically-but at what price?</PARA>
<PARA>I have to question whether the Doctors Reform Society actually knows how many women are medically insured in Australia. If it does would it have made such a stupid statement? Senator Martin has already spoken about the profound effect on women of articles of this nature and the effect that a general discussion around this whole subject has on women who have had the operation. I simply point out that it has also a profound effect on women who need the operation. Because of this type of article they then decide that they will not go on and so their health in actual fact suffers because of it. Some outrageous statements are made in the whole article that need some response. For instance, it is suggested that there is no financial incentive for doctors to explore alternatives to the removal of the womb, that doctors are more concerned with reaping the financial benefits of the $280 minimum than looking at the alternatives. I think that is such a crazy statement as not to be worth while responding to. The Australian Medical Association and the General Practitioners Society deny the claim of overwhelming evidence of unnecessary surgery. I have to raise the question: Who says that it is unnecessary? Who determines that the pains, the cramps and the excessive bleeding suffered by a woman tell her that it is unnecessary for her to have the operation. Her doctor can only go on the evidence that is provided to him by the patient. Does he say: 'Look, put up with this. It doesn't matter. It is an unnecessary operation and you don't want to have it.' Surgery is, in the main, initiated by patient's complaints and the manner in which they are described to the doctor. The article suggests that women are sheep who go along to their GP who says: 'My dear, you need a hysterectomy' and the woman immediately says: 'Of course, I do'. It is suggested in the article that a woman will go along to see her doctor on Monday and have a hysterectomy on Thursday. I dispute that. I do not know of any woman who would go along to a doctor on a Monday and who, without thought or consultation, would go into a hospital to have major surgery on the Thursday to have part of her internal workings removed purely and simply because a doctor has told her to. Surely if a doctor says: 'You need this type of operation' one of the first things she would ask him is: 'What is the alternative? How much is it going to cost? How much time am I going to have off from work?'. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that with the greater portion of women in Australia already in the work force it is extremely difficult for them, particularly if they come from low income families, to say: 'I am going to take three months off work to allow me to have this totally unnecessary operation'. But they will find that in time, if they are convinced by their own ill health, that it is a necessary operation. I have not yet met a woman who has had a hysterectomy who has said that it was unnecessary. Women do not want to go through half of their lives feeling unwell. If they are working wives or working mothers they have to be fit to cope with the pressures applied to them in their normal day to day living. They need to feel well and it is their determination whether they need the operation; not the determination of the Doctors Reform Society, the Australian Medical Association or the General Practitioners Society. The woman herself, on medical advice that she receives and from the symptoms that she indicates she has, determines whether she will have such an operation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two members of my family have had hysterectomies, one as an emergency for torsion of fibroids and one for cancer. Both of them have no doubt that they were benefited by the operation. I am sure honourable senators who have contributed to the debate tonight would agree that it would be quite wrong to allow a situation to develop in the community in which people denegrated the effect of this or any other surgical procedure. Sexism in writing or reporting is not only real but it also can be made even more real to some beholders, particularly if they have a sensitivity about these things. It is not made easier by some attitudes which have persisted in society for a long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Hysterectomy comes from the root 'hyst' which refers to uterus. There is a disease called hysteria which, by definition, in the nineteenth century was alleged to be a disease that only women could suffer. At one stage the treatment was the removal of the uterus. Times do change and attitudes do soften. I think honourable senators are correct to say they do not want stereotyped views and they do not want sexist views advanced on a whole range of matters. What is at issue in public at present is the whole question of the high technology imperative as it applies to therapeutics. That is not only surgery but also pathology, consultations and diagnostic procedures-all the things which involve value judgments and where a decision to intervene has significant effects for a consumer. It may have significant effects for a provider of services as well. In a funny way this applies in other kinds of service areas; it applies in terms of legal services. A decision to intervene or not to intervene, to act or not to act, has significant effects. One could just as much want an examination of legal services, accountancy services or motor car repairs-in each of those areas where there is a value judgment whether to do or not to do some procedural matter which has significance for a consumer. The inquiry proposed by the Australian Medical Association in fact will examine some of the factors and some of the facts in society to provide a basis on which professionals can understand better the basis on which they make a number of professional, often value, judgments, I think as honourable senators have pointed out. </PARA>

I need to be convinced that the incentive to intervene in medicine, surgery or diagnostics is lesser or greater in public or private hospitals, one than the other. Unlike other senators, I, of course, suffer from the disability that I worked for 20 years in a public hospital and in consulting practice. I am aware of the technological imperative as it exists. It is a fairy story to say that one part of the area is non-interventionist and one is interventionist. It is just not right. I will be interested to see the figures when they emerge. This is why I value the kind of survey that has been proposed. My impression, from having worked in public hospitals, is that intervention is the order of the day. As a consulting doctor in one of the public hospitals, the greatest difficulty I ever had was to convince the staff who reported to me that they should do nothing; that they should be prepared to keep their itchy fingers off a patient and neither investigate nor treat but just wait. It was the one thing they could not do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I reiterate my support for the idea of evaluation-in fact, in this case, self-evaluation. You, Mr Acting Deputy President, have had an interest through the Senate committee on which you served in the question of evaluation in health and welfare services. The fact that it is being done as a self-evaluation exercise by one of the learned professions is something which I think reflects well upon the profession. If it can in a non-sexist way, without stereotyping its patients, without selecting just one operation, come to some of the answers then I think society will be well served. I agree with the main thrust of what my colleagues have suggested tonight and just hope that this will not be a stereotyping exercise but that the positive results which I am emphasising can be achieved. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Carrick</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Trade and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I assume the honourable senator is referring to the Consulting Services Feasibility Study Fund (CSFSF) and on that basis provide the following answers to his questions:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The guidelines for the CSFSF are a set of published criteria which I have approved for the use of an interdepartmental committee which advises me on use of that Fund. They are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>GUIDELINES FOR EXAMINING PROPOSALS FOR USE OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES FEASIBILITY STUDY FUND</PARA>
<PARA>Purpose</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The purpose of the Fund is to assist the development of the export of services provided by Australian consultants. It is designed to assist Australian consultants in the preparatory stage of development projects in developing countries by the provision of funds for pre-feasibility or feasibility studies which can be used for an application for the funding from other sources for the further stages of the project. It is expected that the involvement of an Australian consultant at the early stages of the formulation of a development project will enable that consultant to gain exposure, knowledge and a track record in a developing country. It could also produce opportunities for obtaining follow-on work for Australian consultants as well as for Australian contractors and suppliers.</PARA>
<PARA> The Fund is not regarded as an extension of the Australian aid program but as a trade promotional scheme to assist Australian consultants to develop their activities overseas. Authority for financing a study under the Fund is given by the Minister for Trade and Resources upon the recommendation of an interdepartmental committee which assesses proposals after taking into account the relevant aspects of the guidelines, including the flow-on benefits that may be generated, and the funds available.</PARA>
<PARA>Definitions</PARA>
<PARA> 2. A consultant is a person or entity which provides consultancy services on the basis of a fee for service. There should not normally be any other commercial relationship between the consultant and the entity for whom the services are performed. A person or entity carrying out an investigation or study relating to a future investment by that person or entity to obtain an economic benefit would not normally be regarded as a consultant for the purpose of the Fund.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. An Australian consultant is a consultant which carries on business in Australia. Carrying on business in Australia means having a headquarters organisation and associated facilities in Australia, not merely a registered office or accommodation address. If the firm is a partnership the majority of the partners must be residents of Australia. If the firm is organised as a company Australian residents should have effective control of the company and generally its ownership should be Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The term resident or resident of Australia means:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) A person other than a company whose domicile is in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) A company which is incorporated in Australia or which, not being incorporated in Australia, carries on business in Australia and has either its central management control in Australia or its voting power controlled by shareholders who are residents of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. A developing country is a country, territory or province eligible for Developing Country Tariff Preferences as set out in the schedule of developing countries eligible under the Australian Customs Working Tariff.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. A feasibility study means a preliminary survey and/or investigation to determine the technical feasibility and/or economic viability of a project including where appropriate rough estimates of capital outlay and costs of production and an indication of methods to be used in implementing the project. Such a study should provide sufficient information to be used as the basis for an application for funds from an appropriate financing agency.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. A pre-feasibility study is an initial survey undertaken to determine whether a project appears likely to be viable and would warrant the carrying out of further studies.</PARA>
<PARA> 8. Design development or detailed project design or the preparation of specifications for a project are not considered to be pre-feasibility or feasibility studies.</PARA>
<PARA> 9. A development project is a project which is included in or related to the recipient country's development program or activity. Generally a study should be made for the Government of the recipient country, for example, for a ministry, government department, statutory authority or an organisation in which the recipient Government has a substantial interest, or for an intergovernmental lending agency.</PARA>
<PARA>Finance for the project</PARA>
<PARA> 10. Studies financed from the Fund are to relate to development projects to be financed from:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Intergovernmental lending agencies of which Australia is a member for example Asian Development Bank, World Bank and the UN Development Program. Where this is not the case the sources should be identified and acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Australia, including funds available through EFIC's export finance facility and the bilateral aid program.</PARA>
<PARA> 11. Where the source of funds is from within the country itself or from other countries, an assurance should be provided that Australian organisations would not be precluded from bidding for further work because of conditions attached to the supply of the funds.</PARA>
<PARA>Finance for the study</PARA>
<PARA> 12. A contribution to the total cost of the study should come from the consultant and from the entity requiring the study in the developing country concerned. For the purpose of assessing a possible contribution from the Fund all services to be provided by the consultant shall be offered at cost. In assessing the adequacy of the contribution from the consultant the IDC will take into consideration the costs already incurred by the consultant, the costs which are necessary for successful completion of the study, the possible costs of follow-up of the recommendations made and the level of direct flow-on benefits if any to the consultants which are likely to occur within a reasonable time of completion of the study. The contribution from the developing country should generally be in the form of the supply without charge of local assistance to the consultant, e.g. access to local information, counterpart staff, local transport, field assistance, office accommodation and similar facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>Role of the trade commissioner</PARA>
<PARA> 13. The project should be reported upon favourably by the appropriate Australian Trade representative in the country concerned after taking such steps as are necessary to enable him to make a recommendation on the request for a study. These steps would include consultation with the appropriate government departments and planning bodies in the country concerned including the entity for which the study is to be made. Liaison should also be maintained through the appropriate mission with the Development Assistance Representative (or his equivalent) to ensure the earliest possible separation of studies to be carried out under the Fund from those which will be handled under bilateral aid.</PARA>
<PARA> 14. In particular, advice from the Trade Commissioner or other Australian representative will be sought regarding the status of the proposed project in the country's development program, the likely source of funds for execution of further stages of the project and any other information which might assist the IDC in its deliberations.</PARA>
<PARA>Initiation of a study</PARA>
<PARA> 15. Studies for consideration for financing from the Fund may originate:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) from individual Australian consultants or a consortium of consultants;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) from the Department of Trade and Resources.</PARA>
<PARA>Procedure</PARA>
<PARA> 16. Proposals for funding will be initially examined by the Department of Trade and Resources to determine that they are in fact proposals for the conduct for pre-feasibility studies or feasibility studies by Australian consultants for development projects as defined in these guidelines. To assist the Department in coming to a decision with regard to eligibility for funding, consultants should provide the information set out in the attachment. The Department should also obtain a report from the Trade Commissioner as envisaged in paragraphs 13-14 including an indication as to whether the proposal has the support of the recipient Government.</PARA>
<PARA> 17. Before deciding whether to recommend the funding under the CSFSF of a study the Department of Trade and Resources should take the necessary steps to be satisfied that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the project is one which is included in or related to the particular country's development activity. Where the project involves a significant financial contribution from the Fund the recipient government should certify that the study is of high priority in their development program.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the consultant's proposal contains sufficient information to enable the IDC to consider the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the body for whom the study has to be made is likely to obtain the necessary funds for the project should the study indicate that it is viable and feasible.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) if it considers it to be necessary, the lending body concerned does not lay down any special conditions inconsistent with the purposes of the CSFSF.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) there will be an appropriate contribution for the study from the consultant and where appropriate from the Government or entity in the recipient country.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) the consultant has appropriate experience and is able to substantiate its capacity and ability to carry out studies in the field of expertise in which advice is required.</PARA>
<PARA> (g) the consultant has actively demonstrated its interest in undertaking overseas commissions.</PARA>
<PARA> (h) the consultant would be acceptable to the government of the country in which the study is to be undertaken and to the international lending authorities which could be involved in financing further phases of the project.</PARA>
<PARA> In order to satisfy itself regarding the above the Department of Trade and Resources may contact the appropriate authorities and lending institutions to clarify or substantiate any aspects of the consultants proposal that it considers may be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> 18. Should the Department of Trade and Resources consider that there is a prima facie case that the project is eligible it will submit it to the Interdepartmental Committee which will examine it and if appropriate make a recommendation to the Minister for Trade and Resources.</PARA>
<PARA> 19. In particular cases the IDC may take into account other special factors or considerations that may be applicable and that have not been specified in the guidelines. It will also bear in mind factors such as the relevance of the study to Australia's trade and other relationships with the recipient country, the availability of funds and any other studies that have been made or are under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> 20. Notwithstanding paragraphs 17, 18 and 19 compliance with these guidelines does not imply an obligation on the part of the Government in relation to any proposed study submitted for consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> 21. For studies initiated other than by a consultant or consortium of consultants, the Department of Trade and Resources will prepare a list of suitable invitees in consultation as appropriate with a technical department. This list will be considered by the Interdepartmental Committee along with the Department's recommendation in relation to the study. If the decision is taken to proceed, the Department of Trade and Resources assisted by the technical department will be responsible for selecting an appropriate firm and submitting a recommendation to the Minister for Trade and Resources regarding acceptance of the study.</PARA>
<PARA> 22. When a proposal for a study has been approved, the Department of Trade and Resources will enter into a contract with the consultant specifying the terms and conditions for the study. Generally the contract will provide for progress payments and a final payment on completion of the study. Where a clear case can be made for establishment costs, an initial payment may also be made. The contract will contain a clause indemnifying the Commonwealth against any actions which may be brought about by default or negligence of the contractor. The contract will also include the following conditions concerning the consultant:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) He shall not purport to represent the Commonwealth in any connection with the conduct of the study, nor act on behalf of, nor bind the Commonwealth in any respect.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The consultant shall not use any of the documents produced for the study, nor publish any material obtained from or as a result of the study, without the approval in writing from the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The property and copyright in all documents and other data arising from the study will be vested in the Commonwealth up to the stage at which documents are forwarded to the beneficiary client in the overseas country.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) The property and copyright in all documents arising from the study will become the property of the Government of the beneficiary client once the documents have been forwarded to that country.</PARA>
<PARA> 23. The Department of Trade and Resources will normally request an appropriate technical department to certify satisfactory progress of the work and that the study has been carried out to completion in accordance with the provisions of the contract.</PARA>
<PARA> 24. The contract will specify how and by whom the study report is forwarded to the beneficiary client. Normally this will be either that the final report will be delivered to the Department of Trade and Resources who will forward it to the beneficiary client, or that the Department of Trade and Resources, on the advice of its technical adviser Department, will certify that the final report is satisfactory and request the consultant to forward the report in the consultant's own name.</PARA>

<PARA> Between May 1929 and February 1936 inclusive, the Australian Loan Council adopted a number of resolutions concerning borrowings by semi-government and local authorities. These resolutions were first brought together in consolidated form in May 1936 and thereafter became known as the Gentlemen's Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> The text of the 1936 Agreement was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) All loans issued by authorities constituted under the laws of the Commonwealth or a State (in cases where the authorities propose to raise in any one year #100,000 or more) shall be subject to the authority of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth or the Treasurer of the State concerned (as the case may be) as to the amount, terms, and time and place of issue.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Each Treasurer shall, in respect of each financial year, submit to the Loan Council the programme of borrowing of semi-governmental authorities under his control which propose to raise in that year #100,000 or more, and such borrowings shall be considered in conjunction with the loan programme of the government concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Such loan programmes of the semi-governmental authorities shall cover the total proposed borrowing for a complete financial year, and any approvals granted by the Loan Council for those borrowings shall, if not availed of, lapse at the close of the financial year concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) The amount, terms and time and place of issue of each semi-governmental loan in cases where semi-governmental authority proposes to borrow in any one year #100,000 or more, shall be fixed by the Treasurer concerned, in consultation with the Chairman of the Loan Council who shall consult the members of the Loan Council before giving his decision.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) All proposed overseas loans, of whatever amount, by semi-governmental authorities, shall be submitted by the Treasurer concerned to the Chairman of the Loan Council, who shall, in the first place, consult the High Commissioner in London, and then submit the proposal to the members of the Loan Council for decision. In the event of the Loan Council giving approval for definite negotiations to be entered into for such a loan, the negotiations shall be conducted through the Chairman of the Loan Council and the High Commissioner and the terms of the loan and the brokers through whom it is to be issued shall be subject to the approval of the Loan Council.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) Brokerage at a rate not exceeding 5/-d per cent, and underwriting commisson at a rate not exceeding 7/6d per cent, may be allowed in respect of semi-governmental borrowings. Where higher rates are contemplated, the matter is to be referred to the Loan Council.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) In its first report, the National Consultative Council on Social Welfare, which is an important source of advice on matters related to my portfolio, made many recommendations. The Government shares Council's concern on many of the issues covered by these recommendations, as evidenced by our continuing programs and recent initiatives in these areas.</PARA>
<PARA> The Council's major recommendations were that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) family allowances and other payments to pensioners and beneficiaries for children be indexed,</PARA>
<PARA> (b) there be a greater differential in payments of family allowance for the fourth child,</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the sole parent rebate be increased from $417 to $597, that is the same as the dependent spouse rebate, at least in the case of sole parents having dependent children aged 0-6,</PARA>
<PARA> (d) at least $5 million per year be made available under the Homeless Persons Assistance Program for the next three years, and that the present staff salaries formula and the meal and accommodation subsidies within the Program be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has taken several initiatives in the areas covered by these recommendations:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) and (b) In the 1981-82 Budget the Government decided to increase from January 1982 the rates of family allowance for third and subsequent children by 50 per cent. In the 1980-81 Budget the Government also increased additional pension/benefit for children from $7.50 to $10.00 a week, and mothers/guardians allowance from $4 to $6 a week (from $6 to $8 a week where there is a child under 6 or an invalid child).</PARA>
<PARA> (c) In the 1981-82 Budget the Government increased the sole parent rebate from $559 to $580 a year.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) In September of 1980 the Government announced it would be allocating $10 million to a three year capital program for homeless persons, with special provision for homeless youth. $1 million in capital grants was approved in 1980-81 to immediately improve facilities and services. The balance of $9 million is being allocated to capital projects in a three year program which commenced this financial year. The Government has also reimbursed voluntary agencies $2.24 million for capital projects carried out with their own funds before the introduction of this program. A total of $6.3 million has been provided for the Homeless Persons Assistance Program this financial year. A related Government initiative in the 1981-82 Budget was the provision of $2 million this financial year for a crisis accommodation program for families.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of meals and accommodation subsidies within the Homeless Persons Assistance Program, the Government increased the food and accommodation subsidy from 75 cents to $1.20 from 1 July 1980. The meal subsidy was also increased from 25 cents to 40 cents at that time.</PARA>
<PARA> The Council also made a number of other suggestions and observations relating to social welfare issues in its first report. The Government has taken initiatives in several of these areas too; for example, in its provision of funds for emergency relief since 1979-80 and by its introduction this financial year of a pilot program involving the appointment of ten paid agents with the aim of providing a better service to social security clients in remote areas.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Some time ago there was speculation that Unites States foreign aid would be severely curtailed in the 1982 financial year as a consequence of the budgetary cuts announced by the Reagan Administration. However, a cutback of the order of $56 billion as cited in the press report to which the honourable senator's question refers would not be possible, as the total amount of United States overseas development assistance was about $6.2 billion in the 1981 United States financial year.</PARA>
<PARA> On 17 September, the United States House of Representatives Appropriations Committee approved a foreign aid appropriations bill providing for $US7.59 billion for foreign aid in the 1982 financial year (October-September). This represents an increase of $US1.25 billion over the level which Congress finally authorised in the previous financial year. The recommended appropriation for foreign aid will be debated by Congress in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) As noted in the Minister for Foreign Affairs' response to Senate question no. 455 of 10 March, when the question of possible cuts in United States aid first arose, Australia, along with a number of donor and recipient countries, made representations to the United States authorities, urging that the negotiated contributions to multilateral development banks, such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, be maintained. The United States authorities subsequently sought congressional authorisation for the amounts required, and this approval has now been given.</PARA>
<PARA> Uncertainties in the timing of United States contributions had given rise to concern about the commitment authority of the World Bank's concessional lending arm-the International Development Association (IDA)-and to ensure continuity in the IDA's activities Australia, along with most other donor countries, participated in a bridging arrangement on behalf of IDA by making an advance contribution of $67.8m in the form of an advance promissory note.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The conditions of eligibility are laid down in Section 124 of the Social Services Act. Under these provisions 'the Director-General may, in his discretion, grant a special benefit under this Division to a person-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) who is not in receipt of a pension under Part III or IV, a benefit under Part IVAAA, an allowance under Part VIIA or a service pension under the Repatriation Act 1920-73;</PARA>

<PARA> (c) with respect to whom the Director-General is satisfied that, by reason of age, physical or mental disability or domestic circumstances or for any other reason, that person is unable to earn a sufficient livelihood for himself and his dependants (if any)'.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Social Services Act does not specify an income test in relation to the payment of special benefits. However, Section 125 of the Act provides that 'The rate of a special benefit payable to any person shall be such rate as the Director-General, in his discretion, from time to time determines, but not exceeding the rate of the unemployment benefit or the sickness benefit which could be paid to that person if he were qualified to receive it'.</PARA>
<PARA> In considering whether the discretion should be exercised to grant a special benefit, regard is had to the financial circumstances of the claimant. In cases where the claimant is caring for a person with an independent income, or where his entry to Australia was subject to a maintenance guarantee under the Migration Regulations, regard may also be had to the financial circumstances of the person cared for or the person who gave the guarantee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Acting Minister for Health I provide the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I am aware of a statement to this effect made by the New South Wales Minister for Health, in which he estimated that a 6 per cent drop in smoking in Australia would result in health cost savings (overall, not only to the Federal Government) of between $125 to $150 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government has already indicated its commitment to a national initiative in health promotion.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1979-80 it allocated $500,000 to a pilot campaign known as 'Help Yourself', which involved media and local support, aimed at raising general community awareness of health issues, including smoking. The pilot campaign-which covered a number of lifestyle risk factors-using television, radio and print, was trialled in 1980 in Adelaide, Canberra and Goulburn, and was most successful and well received in those communities.</PARA>
<PARA> This financial year a further amount of $500,000 has been allocated to enable the examination of alternative approaches in health promotion. A number of different settings, including the home, the workplace and local community, will be examined and work conducted with a variety of professional groups and State and local authorities. Smoking will be included in the program as being one of the risks to good health.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There are three teams, each consisting of two members.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) One team operates amongst Aboriginal communities in Western Australia and another in South Australia (including the southern region of the Northern Territory). These teams have been in the field since July 1979. The third team, covering the northern regions of the Northern Territory, began operations in January 1981.</PARA>

<PARA> (b) 1978-79-$76,300; 1979-1980-$120,400; 1980-81-$184,500.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Aboriginal Electoral Education Program has been developed with the full consultation of the governments of Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory. All three governments agreed to the proposal for a Commonwealth Program to provide electoral education on both Commonwealth and State/Territory electoral procedures.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) No restrictions have been placed on the activities of the Aboriginal Electoral Education Team in the States and Territory in which we are operating.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The Aboriginal Electoral Education Program is not an enrolment campaign. The team members cannot enrol Aboriginals, although they may witness enrolment claims, including Western Australian State enrolment claims. In any event, it would not be possible to estimate the precise number of Aboriginals who chose to enrol as a result of the electoral activities of a team as distinct from those who happened to seek enrolment while a team was in their area.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) No. It was agreed with Northern Territory authorities that the teams would only provide joint Commonwealth/Territory electoral education (including some explanation of the different Commonwealth/Territory enrolment requirements).</PARA>
<PARA> (9) The Government has a commitment to amend the Commonwelth Electoral Act to change voluntary to compulsory enrolment for Aboriginals. This commitment was made after consultation with the Council for Aboriginal Development.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) The Australian Electoral Office monitors the program and the activities of the teams.</PARA>
<PARA> At the time of the June 1980 election for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, a special electoral education campaign was conducted by the Australian Electoral Office in collaboration with Northern Territory electoral and education authorities. Some of the education material which is used by the teams was also used in this campaign. An evaluation of the effectiveness of this material (an illustrated explanatory booklet, You Can Have Your Say, and an instructor's guide to the booklet; sets of voting papers including how-to-vote cards and ballot papers for realistic 'mock' elections; an information pamphlet entitled Parliament-Enrolment-Voting; and a film, also called You Can Have Your Say) was made by the North Australian Research Unit of the Australian National University which prepared a general report on Aboriginal electoral education and the effectiveness of mobile polling for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly election. The report 'Electoral Education and Mobile Polling' (ISBN909569 57 3) is available in the Parliamentary Library.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) (a) Any amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act are a matter of Government policy.</PARA>

<PARA> (1), (2) and (3) I am informed that the Aboriginal Development Commission has allocated $62,000 to the Pipalyatjara community for housing in 1981-82. A house for the community adviser was included in the draft program, after consultation with the community, but the community will decide how the grant should be used, in consultation with the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> The type and standard of housing at Pipalyatjara is also for the community to decide. This community initially chose a relatively simple design in order to provide more units with available funds. The question whether more funds can be made available to Pipalyatjara is for the Aboriginal Development Commission to consider.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) My Department has allocated $140,000 for the upgrading of essential services at Pipalyatjara this financial year in response to concern expressed by the community about the adequacy of water and power supplies. The work will be handled by the South Australian Public Buildings Department. It is planned that $30,000 will be used to upgrade the community's electrical supply and $110,000 to upgrade water supply and reticulation.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recipients of sheltered employment allowances (SEA) like other social security pensioners may receive $20 a week (single pensioners) and $34.50 (pensioner couple) of non-pension income without affecting the amount of SEA payable. Above these 'free areas', the allowance (or pension) is reduced by 50 cents for each dollar of non-pension income. Non-pension income includes earnings from sheltered employment. This means that at current rates of pension, single and married recipients of income-tested pensions (and SEA) continue to receive some pension (or SEA) until non-pension income reaches $153.30 a week and $256.70 a week respectively.</PARA>
<PARA> Increasing the 'free areas' for SEA recipients would inevitably bring pressures for similar increases in the 'free areas' for age, invalid and sole parent pensioners. Increases to the levels suggested would be very costly. For example, doubling the 'free areas' at current rates of pension would cost some $140m in a full year. Given the continuing need for expenditure restraint, the priority of such a measure must be viewed against other priorities in the system. The estimated full year cost of continuing the twice yearly indexation of pensions for example in respect of the November 1981 and May 1982 increases alone is some $715m.</PARA>
<PARA> SEA recipients already enjoy two other advantages over other pensioners. SEA (like invalid pension) is not subject to personal income tax, and recipients are paid a tax free, income-test-free Incentive Allowance of $5 a week. As announced in the last Budget, the latter payment is to be increased to $8 a week from February 1982.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs has advised that there is no shortage now, nor has there been over the past decade, of young people willing to enter apprenticeship. The healthy growth in intakes into trade linked pre-apprenticeship and pre-vocational training programs in recent years supports this conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has advised that while opportunities exist for the enlistment of skilled tradesmen including those qualified in the metal and engineering industries, very few seek to join the Navy, Army or Royal Australian Air Force. He further advised that the needs of the Services are met mostly from apprenticeship and in-Service trade training schemes. Experience over recent years has indicated increasing difficulty in attracting sufficient applicants of the required calibre to fill vacancies in these schemes, particularly for electronic-based trades.</PARA>

<PARA> Since that answer was prepared, has there been an increase in the Commonwealth car fleet in Canberra, which I understand at present will be used for standby duty? I understand that when the big cars are not used smaller cars will substitute. If so, what is the number of new cars that are now standing in the garage or at grass which will be used at times when the big cars are not available or not needed?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> There has been no increase in the number of vehicles in service in the Commonwealth car fleet since April 1981. However, in the past few weeks, 43 new Ford Fairmont sedans have been received as replacements for vehicles which have reached the end of the appropriate service life as pool vehicles. Of these, nineteen have been put into service as at 5 June 1981 while 24 are awaiting the supply of new two-way radios prior to being introduced into service.</PARA>
<PARA> Upon changeover, disposal action is usually initiated for the replaced vehicles. However, the Fairmont sedans currently being withdrawn from normal use are to be retained until October 1981 to meet a special demand for vehicles by the Australian Federal Police for the Canberra weekend retreat associated with the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth car-with-driver fleet includes Ford LTD sedans used for the ministerial and VIP car fleet. The remainder of the fleet consists of Ford Fairmont sedans which are slightly smaller, in terms of the current Ford models, than the Ford LTD sedans.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 June 1981 (Hansard, page 2796), Senator Lewis asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Transport, a question without notice concerning Australian ship monopoly in the Australian coastal trades.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> There are several factors contributing to the freight rate charge for transporting steel between Port Kembla and Fremantle or Japan and Fremantle. The freight rate would be influenced by inter alia, the type of vessel employed, the size of cargo and availability of backloading and the financial, social and national environment in which it operates.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that a significant proportion of the cost of transporting an item by coastal shipping arises from stevedoring charges, which are land based and not directly shipping industry generated. In the case of steel shipped from Port Kembla to Fremantle stevedoring costs would be the same whatever the nationality of the vessel.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not accurate to say that the coasting trade is a monopoly enforced by Government action. Any vessel meeting certain safety and licensing requirements may trade on the Australian coast. In essence the licensing provisions of the Navigation Act require that vessels trading on the coast must meet Australian manning, accommodation and wage standards.</PARA>
<PARA> At present there are no restrictions on the import of new vessels for coastal operations or alternatively potential owners can order vessels up to about 10,000 gross construction tonnes from Australian shipbuilding yards where, of course, bounty is available for local ship construction.</PARA>
<PARA> The protection afforded Australian coastal shipping is no different from the protection of coastal trades, or cabotage, practised by many other countries. Given that coastal shipping is as much a part of domestic transport as is road, rail or air transport I do not see that the requirement to meet Australian manning, accommodation and wage standards constitutes a level of protection that warrants an inquiry into the industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 19 August 1981 (Hansard, page 50) Senator Bjelke-Petersen asked a question without notice concerning standardisation of telephone installation and rental fees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided me with the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of the problems facing applicants for telephone service in country areas the Australian Telecommunications Commission has reviewed the question of rural lines regularly and the rural lines policy has been significantly liberalised in recent years. Since 1975, the free line entitlement for these subscribers has been doubled from 8 kilometres to 16 kilometres and the rate of contribution for lines extending beyond the free line limit has been held at $160 per half kilometre even though the cost has risen to about twice that amount. Furthermore, if they so desire, applicants may spread payment of the contribution over a period of three years, with interest charged at the short term Telecom Loan rate. To assist further applicants who require long lines, a special rental of $500 per annum has been adopted as an alternative to a capital contribution and no service connection fee is paid.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom does not expect individual country subscribers to pay the full cost of their lines; for example, the total capital investment, on average, for a service 20 kilometres from an exchange is of the order of $15,000. However, Telcom believes that, where such a large investment is involved, the subscribers concerned should bear a reasonable share of that investment. This is particularly so when capital is in short supply and when viewed in the light of the fact that earnings from telephone services in country areas are generally insufficient to recoup costs of providing and maintaining them, so that there is a significant level of cross-subsidisation of country services by urban users of Telecom facilities.</PARA>
<PARA> Concerning a standard connection fee and yearly rental throughout Australia beyond the 16 kilometre point, Telecom considers that it would be inequitable for urban subscribers to bear a greater proportion of rural costs. The country lines program is continually under review but, having regard to the existing level of cross-subsidisation of country services and the current and future planned levels of capital expenditure in country areas, Telecom indicated that it is not in a position at this stage to liberalise further the conditions under which country services are provided.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> All appointments to the Metric Conversion Board expired on 30 June 1981, and the Board was wound up at that date. During the parliamentary recess the Government decided that import controls on non-metric measuring devices would be repealed. As Australia's metric conversion program is now largely complete, the Government considered that the controls were no longer necessary. In conjunction with these import controls, local manufacturers of measuring devices, on a voluntary basis, restricted the availability of non-metric devices to applications where a continuing need existed. This voluntary arrangement was terminated with the announcement of the intended repeal of the import controls.</PARA>

<PARA> Is the Minister aware of the fact that, for a variety of reasons, it is impossible to purchase any food ultimately in an unwrapped form? Is the Minister therefore aware that, in his Budget, by placing a sales tax on wrapping the Government is effectively increasing the cost of all foodstuffs, whether staple items or luxuries? If the Minister is aware of the effect, will he explain why the Government chose to put this de facto tax on food? If he was not aware of it, will he undertake to discuss with the Treasurer the removal of the forecast sales tax placed on wrapping and hence effectively on foodstuffs?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decision to place a sales tax at 2.5 per cent on wrapping and packaging materials as from 1 January 1982 was taken as part of its policy to broaden the sales tax base to provide a better mix of direct and indirect taxes. The Government is conscious that by taking this step there could be an indirect tax effect on some foodstuffs. However, any effect will be minimal because the tax will apply only to wrapping materials used at the retail level. Manufacturers and wholesalers of foodstuffs will still obtain their packaging materials free of tax. Foodstuffs sold over the counter by retailers in the form in which they were packaged by manufacturers or wholesalers will not bear any tax on that packaging. Also, certain wrapping materials such as wrapping used by butchers and delicatessens to wrap up meat will continue to be exempt. The kinds of wrapping materials that will become taxable include wrapping papers, bags and carry-bags supplied by retailers as a service to their customers or for shop security reasons.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 August 1981 (Hansard, page 319) Senator Teague asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, a question without notice concerning arts funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment has provided me with the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Visual Arts Board of the Australia Council has advised me that it is factually correct to assert that that Board favours artists working in contemporary styles. The Board believes, as I am further advised, that it is in this sphere that new artistic forces will emerge. Moreover, artists working in experimental or unfamiliar ways are less liable to obtain assistance from other sources and their work may be less easy to sell.</PARA>
<PARA> I am also informed that through its support for the Australian Gallery Directors Council, the Visual Arts Board gives significant assistance to the more traditional styles of art, including the mounting of exhibitions of historical art. In 1980 the Australian Gallery Directors Council's exhibitions programs attracted an audience of 1.9 million people. These exhibitions included Pompeii AD 79; France: The Revolutionary Decades; 19th and 20th Century Masters from the Baron Von Thyssen Collection and the Old Master Drawings from the Albertina Collection.</PARA>
<PARA> I am informed by the Australian National Gallery that its acquisitions policy was approved by the Government in 1977, and was published in the Australian National Gallery Annual Report, 1976-77. The approved policy covers Australian Art; the Arts of Asia and South East Asia; Primitive Art; European Art before 1850; and Art of the Modern Period (from 1850); Prints, Drawings and Illustrated Books; Sculpture; Decorative Art; Photography and Film.</PARA>
<PARA> I am further informed by the Australian National Gallery that within these areas of acquisitions there are no inherent biases. The only considerations that apply are that the works of art should be of the highest aesthetic standard and bear relationship to other works in the area.</PARA>
<PARA> The aim is to establish a National Gallery with collections which will complement and extend those of other Australian galleries and provide the Australian community with visual art experience of the highest order. It is intended that the Gallery will be a source of national pride and stand among the leading art museums of the world.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 August 1981 (Hansard, page 314) Senator Hill asked me, as the Minister representing the Treasurer, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the Minister representing the Treasurer aware that yachts are presently being constructed for a new South Australian tourist venture, namely, that of skippered yacht charter in South Australian waters. Is the Minister also aware that to date construction of yachts in such circumstances has not attracted sales tax. Will the Minister confirm that this is regarded as one of the sales tax anomalies referred to in the Budget which are to be corrected. If so, will the Minister indicate whether the Government gave consideration to the effect the imposition of a 17 1/2 per cent sales tax would have upon this new South Australian industry. If not, will she indicate whether the Government would be prepared to do so and to consider an exemption if it finds the viability of establishment of this industry to be threatened by the imposition?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> During the deliberations which preceded the recent Budget, when proposals to remove a number of anomalies and inconsistencies in the sales tax law were being considered, the Government was mindful of the effect that the proposed changes would have on the various sections of the community, including industry.</PARA>
<PARA> The anomaly recognised by the Government was that, where a yacht was acquired by a person to hire it out with crew for pleasure, sport or recreation, it was exempt from sales tax. On the other hand, a yacht acquired for use for the same purposes without crew was subject to sales tax. There is no logical reason for such a distinction and the Government has moved to treat all such yachts equally.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government would, of course, be concerned if the viability of any industry was threatened by the elimination of this particular anomaly. It must be questioned, however, whether sales tax concessions conferring competitive advantages are an appropriate means of assisting any sector of industry to maintain a profitable operation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 27 August 1981 (Hansard page 384) Senator Coleman asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is the Minister aware of the directive issued by the Minister she represents that the film On Sacred Ground is not to be distributed through Australian overseas posts? The Minister apparently feels-and I quote his statement-'that considerable harm could be done to Australia's image' if the film is distributed overseas. I make the point, very briefly, that the film was viewed by a fairly large audience in Parliament House last night and was extremely well received. It is a documentary on factual lifestyles of Aboriginal people in Western Australia and was produced to promote interracial understanding. In view of the interest already shown-I understand that requests have been received at three of our embassies already-will the Minister review the directive given and allow this very worthwhile, well-produced and well-documented film to be distributed in the usual manner through the Australian embassies?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Officers of my Department were among an audience that was invited to preview the film late last year. They subsequently were advised that the Australian Film Commission (AFC) did not intend to distribute the film to our overseas missions because it was not regarded by the AFC as being suitable for showing overseas and because the film was expensive ($900 a print plus freight costs). Officers of my Department saw no reason to request the AFC to vary its decision.</PARA>
<PARA>The AFC also advised that it intended sending video tapes of the film to its representatives in London and Los Angeles, and to outlets in Tokyo and Manila, with a view to selling the film to television stations. This was a commercial decision aimed at recovering some of the costs of making the film.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department was concerned that while the AFC had decided not to distribute the film to overseas posts, it was at the same time proposing to offer it for sale to overseas television stations where there would be no control over the use of the film. They were also concerned that overseas audiences, unlike Australian audiences, would lack knowledge of the divided responsibility for Aboriginal affairs that is a consequence of the Australian federal system and which is necessary to understand the issues involved at Noonkanbah. This is not made clear in the film.</PARA>
<PARA> A further concern was that overseas distribution of a film made by a Commonwealth instrumentality which included criticism of the Western Australian Government's policies could prejudice the domestic consultations between Commonwealth and State authorities on land rights and mining issues. Since advancement of Aboriginal interests requires co-operation between the Commonwealth and State authorities, it would be contrary to the best interests of the Aboriginals if the Commonwealth Government were seen by a State government to be acquiescing in the overseas showing of such a film.</PARA>
<PARA> Foreign policy considerations clearly dictate that the Australian Government should not do anything that would inhibit the realisation of the advances in Aboriginal rights to which it is committed, nor do anything that could negate the advances already made. Equally, any criticism that the film generated overseas would in all probability be directed at Australia without any acknowledgement of the Commonwealth Government's policy and achievements in Aboriginal affairs.</PARA>
<PARA> The above considerations led me to conclude that selling On Sacred Ground to overseas television stations would be contrary to Australia's foreign policy interests and put at risk the implementation of the Commonwealth Government's policies for the advancement of Aboriginals. I accordingly wrote to the Minister for Home Affairs suggesting that he might wish to consider further the Australian Film Commission's proposal.</PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, the AFC decided not to sell the film to overseas television stations and Film Australia decided that in the light of developments since the film was made, it required further editing to bring it up to date. They are also proposing to reduce the length of the film from its current 58 minutes to approximately 40 minutes to fit in with school teaching periods which they see as an important use. The AFC will be looking at the edited film when completed to decide their attitude to overseas distribution of the film.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department will continue to work with the AFC and Film Australia so as to ensure that Film Australia's contributions to Australia's overseas information activities are as effective as possible. Film Australia has a difficult task since it is charged with the dual role of telling the world about Australia and Australians about themselves. It is not always possible to accomplish both objectives in the one film and films intended principally for Australian audiences may not necessarily be suitable for overseas audiences.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided me with the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom has followed the consistent practice of requiring all of its major telecommunications products to be made by Australian industry. In 1977, when introducing a new system of local exchange switching equipment using stored program controlled techniques, an Australian content of 80 per cent was stipulated. As a consequence of its dedication to local sourcing, 90 per cent of all telecommunications supplies are obtained from Australian industry sources.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> also asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, without notice, on 17 September 1981 (Hansard, page 823):</PARA>
<PARA> Is the Minister aware that the now confirmed abandonment by the Government of its proposed defence (call-out) Bill has left a dangerous vacuum in the law governing military intervention in civil emergencies in that if troops are called out in reliance solely on the Commonwealth's general executive power under section 61 of the Constitution, as happened after the Hilton bombing at the 1978 Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting, there are simply no rules in existence governing the duration of the Army presence, the powers of individual soldiers and the lines of authority as between the civil and military authorities? Is the Minister further aware that Mr Justice Hope found in one of the unreleased parts of his royal commmission report on national security that the present situation was seriously inadequate in a number of respects, drew attention to this vacuum and, in fact, recommended urgent remedial legislation to clarify the situation for everyone concerned and for the community generally? How can the Government justify its inertia on this matter? Is it because it wants to have open-ended and unlimited military powers available to it in the event of some real or imagined security crisis errupting at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA>
<PARA> Since 1978 the Government has put considerable effort into measures designed to counter potential terrorist threats to Australia and its interests. Revision of the legislative provisions governing Defence Force aid to the civil power is an important part of this program and is receiving close attention. It is, however, a complex exercise and, as Mr Justice Hope pointed out in his protective security review, there are important principles and safeguards which must be incorporated in the new legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> The development of legislative proposals will take some time and it is not the Government's intention to attempt to introduce new legislation before the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. Proper consideration by Parliament is necessary and close consultation with the State and Northern Territory governments will also be required.</PARA>
<PARA> I should emphasise that, contrary to recent media speculation, the new legislation will not be seeking to create any new authority for the use of the Defence Force in aid of civilian security. Mr Justice Hope, and Sir Victor Windeyer in the opinion which he gave to the protective security review, confirmed that the authority already exists for calling out the Defence Force in aid of civilian security. The procedures for doing so are understood by the Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory Governments. In accordance with the recommendation of the protective security review, the new legislation is being developed to tighten, clarify and update the existing provisions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 September 1981 (Hansard, page 555) Senator Primmer asked me the following question, without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry in the Senate:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry: Is it a fact that the suspension of export operations of all independent boning rooms in Victoria will lead to the stand down of up to 2,500 employees? Is the Minister aware that such a stand down will involve a loss in wages for these workers of $900 to $1,000 each? In view of the fact that these employees are the innocent victims of the incompetence and procrastination of the present Minister and his predecessor, will the Minister ensure that any loss of wages will be fully and promptly compensated for by the Government?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I suspended the registration of these establishments subsequent to a further finding of horse meat in product shipped from Establishment No. 622, Jason Meats Pty Ltd of the Melbourne suburb of Abbotsford. This action was necessary to assure meat importing countries that the situation in Victoria-where the problem seemed to be centred-was under control. It was necessary to demonstrate that action was adequate to ensure substitution was no longer possible.</PARA>
<PARA> The way was open, by compliance with the new controls, for resumption of export activities with minimum delay. In fact 28 of the establishments affected have already done so and had their suspension notices removed.</PARA>
<PARA> The security and control conditions which applied initially to the Victorian independent boning rooms were rapidly imposed on all other independent boning rooms through Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The management of the suspended establishments in the majority of cases were quick to respond to the new requirements, and consequently the effect on employment would have been minimal. Without the prompt and firm action taken by the Government, it is certain that a far more serious reaction against Australian meat exports generally would have resulted. This would in turn have had extremely serious repercussions for the meat industry and on employment throughout Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 10 September 1981 (Hansard, page 637) Senator Townley asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Transport, a question without notice concerning the synchronisation of traffic lights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> A considerable amount of research has already been undertaken in Australia concerning the co-ordination of traffic lights. A highly sophisticated traffic light co-ordination system covering much of the Sydney metropolitan area is in operation known as the Sydney Co-ordinated Adaptive Traffic system (SCAT). Smaller schemes operate in Melbourne and other centres. There is ample evidence that appropriate co-ordination of traffic lights can reduce delays, vehicle emissions, fuel consumption and accidents. Such systems are highly cost-effective.</PARA>
<PARA> Because co-ordination of traffic lights along major traffic routes has to take into account the effect upon cross-traffic at the various signalised intersections, the devising of co-ordination systems appropriate to particular situations is already a significant area of research in Australia and overseas. The appropriate form of co-ordination in Melbourne, for instance, where there tends to be a regular pattern of major cross routes may be different from that appropriate in Sydney where there tends to be more of a radial pattern with a few major ring routes.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that the vast majority of Australian traffic light installations, although not co-ordinated, do respond to traffic demand by means of inductive loops buried just below the road surface. Much of the dissatisfaction expressed by motorists at signal delays arises from poor maintenance and inappropriate settings rather than inadequate equipment or lack of co-ordination.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Transport is familiar with developments in this field in the United States. In this context it should also be noted that most traffic signal installations in the United States operate on a fixed-time basis, often on a grid of streets, and co-ordination, although fairly straightforward, may result in long delays for cross-traffic.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided me with the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Since early 1980 the Government had been pressing for State road authorities to use the tender and contract system for construction works on national roads. The Government decided when framing the 1981 Act that it had given adequate warning and so a long transition period was not justified.</PARA>
<PARA> The Roads Grants Act 1981 requires that tenders be invited and dealt with in accordance with approved procedures for all construction works on national roads commencing after 31 August 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> In making the decision requiring the calling of tenders the Commonwealth recognised that there could be some displacement or redeployment of day labour employees as road construction works on national roads were taken up by private contractors. The Government therefore decided that the tender procedures should allow the State road authority and local government authorities to bid for the work.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government realised that state and local government's local knowledge and long experience in road works should place them in a very competitive position to win projects under the tender system. This has been confirmed in one instance already where a State road authority, in competition with private contractors, bid for and won a million dollar job.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided the following additional information:</PARA>
<PARA> The scheme's schedule is currently being revised to take account of movements in interstate sea freight rates to and from Tasmania and also mainland interstate land freight rates that have occurred since the schedule was last revised. In order that the schedule can be calculated accurately, the Minister for Transport directed that freight rates which applied on 1 May 1981 would be used.</PARA>
<PARA> As the revision of TFES schedule is a complex time consuming task, adjustments are not made each time there is an increase in either shipping freight rates or mainland interstate road/rail freight rates. Accordingly freight rate increases that have been implemented since 1 May 1981 will not be taken into consideration in the current recalculation.</PARA>
<PARA> Given that the purpose of TFES is to remove the transport cost disadvantage suffered by Tasmanians because of their almost total reliance on shipping for interstate cargo movements, the recent increase in ANL's freight rates would not necessarily warrant further increases in the TFES schedule.

<PARA> The Minister for Science and Technology advises as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Computing and, more generally, information technology, is assuming increasing importance in industry, commerce, government and the community. The Government recognises this and believes that the successful application of these and other new technologies is crucial to Australia's continued industrial development.</PARA>
<PARA> A major influence on the successful establishment of new, technology-based firms of the type referred to in the Australian is the existence of a favourable economic climate. For this reason, the Government considers that its policies, which are designed to maintain a climate of economic growth and improved opportunities for business, are a prerequisite for the creation and growth of firms in these industries.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Government has assisted in promoting community awareness of the benefits and opportunities offered by the information technologies referred to in the honourable Senator's question.</PARA>
<PARA> A significant indication of the Government's concern in this area is its sponsorship, through the Department of Science and Technology in conjunction with the Australian Computer Society, of Information Technology Week, which was held during August. Information Technology Week introduced many people all over Australia to new information technologies. It focused public attention on the important role which integrated information systems can play in maintaining the viability and international competitiveness of our industries.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is also conscious of the importance of microelectronics to nearly all sectors of Australian industry. For this reason, a condition of the offer made to the National Semiconductor Corporation to establish a wafer fabrication plant in Canberra is that the Corporation should assist the adoption of microelectronic technology by Australian industry, through the establishment of applications centres.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has already developed a microelectronics industrial capacity which includes the manufacture of computor hardware. Moreover, there is growing evidence that some local manufacturers are able to compete in overseas markets and in the expanding domestic market. In the field of computer software, where local involvement in systems development and applications has been more extensive, Australian firms have shown considerable innovative potential.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government expects to receive shortly a report from the Australian Science and Technology Council on the microelectronics industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, in keeping with the Government's announcement of November 1976, the question of assistance to the computer industry will be referred to the Industries Assistance Commission by early 1982 to provide time for a review of assistance well in advance of the expiration of the ADP Bounty Act in 1984.</PARA>
<PARA> On the technical level, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Reseach Organisation has established a group to develop the design of very large scale integrated circuits. The purpose of this research is to develop integrated circuits which exploit more fully the potential for miniaturisation of electronic components. If successful, the results will be of considerable assistance to Australian industry in gaining a share of the burgeoning range of applications for microelectronic technologies.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator asked specifically that a board be set up to administer grants to Australian computer companies to increase their research and development capabilities. Computor manufacturing companies are already eligible to receive grants under the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act. Of the $23m provided under the Australian Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act in 1979-80 for project grants, nearly $1m was allocated directly for industrial research and development in the fields of computing and microelectronics. A further $1.9m was spent in these fields under the public interest provision of the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act and through Industry Productivity Improvement Programs administered by the Department of Science and Technology.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Townley also suggested that computer software companies be made eligible to apply for grants under this Act. The purpose of the Act is to promote development and improve efficiency by encouraging industrial research and development in the manufacturing, mining and construction industries. Computer software companies are therefore not eligible for direct grant support. However, where computer software research and development relates directly to the development of new products or new or improved processes employed in manufacturing, mining or on-site construction operations, such activities are eligible to receive project grant assistance. In other cases, grant recipients may contract their computer software research and development projects to those computer software companies which have been accredited as approved research organisations under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not wish to extend eligibility for grant support under the Act to the computer software industry generally, as this would dilute the effectiveness of the scheme. It would also represent the provision of assistance to an industry which is already highly innovative in the absence of significant government support.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment has provided me with the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Territory Chief Minister, Mr Everingham, has directed Northern Territory police to make further enquiries into the circumstances surrounding the death of Azaria Chamberlain at Ayers Rock.</PARA>
<PARA> The Chief Minister has indicated that additional information has come to light which was not available at the time of the inquest and so was not available to the coroner.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Everingham has stated the new information resulted from research and investigations carried out by Professor J. M. Cameron, Professor of Forensic Medicine at the London Hospital Medical College.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that as a consequence of receiving this information, Mr Everingham conferred with the Territory's Solicitor-General and the Police Commissioner and reviewed the whole matter with them and sought independent advice from leading counsel.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Everingham, in a Press statement issued on 19 September 1981, stated: 'I am duty bound to direct police to make further inquiries. I deeply regret this, particularly as re-opening the case may cause distress. However, I have no alternative but to act conscientiously in the discharge of my duties as Attorney-General'.</PARA>
<PARA> If requested, the Commonwealth would assist the Northern Territory in its enquiries.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 17 September 1981 (Hansard, page 816) Senator Lewis asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Communications, a question without notice relating to an industrial dispute in the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (Australia).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The industrial dispute between OTC(A) and the Professional Radio and Electronics Institute of Australia (PREIA) was resolved on 18 September 1981 following an agreement between the parties.</PARA>
<PARA> The PREIA had imposed selective bans on operations. These were: a complete ban on traffic tape changes and fault repair in both telex exchanges; a total ban on all fault repair; maintenance and restoration of equipment at Moree Satellite Earth Station; and a ban on all negotiations, discussions, preparation and implementation of services concerned with the forth-coming Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as I am aware, there was no conspiracy of silence on the part of the Australian Press in reporting on the dispute.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 17 September 1981,(Hansard, page 819) Senator Ryan asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the Minister representing the Minister for Communications aware that a private investment consultant, Mr Bruce Bond, is a regular guest on the Australian Broadcasting Commission talk-back radio program Brian Minards Morning in Canberra? Is he also aware that on a recent occasion this consultant gave advice to callers on ways of avoiding tax on income from their investments? Does the Minister consider it appropriate for the ABC to provide opportunities for those in private business to advertise their services in this way? What action will he take to ensure that the ABC is not used as a vehicle for tax avoidance advice?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bruce Bond provides two programs a week for ABC Radio on Station 2CN Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA> His approach to ways in which payment of income tax may be minimised are entirely within the law and are not tax avoidance schemes. Mr Bond is not a private consultant and he has informed listeners to the ABC on many occasions that he does not take private clients. His services are available to the media and it is in this context that the ABC uses his expertise, as do other broadcasting organisations and publishers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 23 September 1981 (Hansard, page 886) Senator Button asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is it true, as reported, that an Australian diplomat is at present in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, on a two-week visit approved by the Afghanistan Government? Was the visit carried out secretly to avoid disclosure that the diplomat had applied for a visa from a government not recognised by Australia? On a similar matter, I ask: Is it a fact that Soviet trade missions have regularly visited Australia in the last few months without obstruction but that members of cultural and scientific delegations have been denied visas as a result of the Soviet incursion into Afghanistan?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> It is correct that Soviet trade visitors have come to Australia since the invasion of Afghanistan. They continue to do so, as do other Soviet visitors, such as tourists and people coming for private reasons, whose entry is not prevented by the measures the Government introduced following the Soviet invasion.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's measures were calculated very carefully in terms of reasonable costs to the Australian community and impact upon the Soviet authorities. There seemed no point, for example, in cutting off valuable trade when most of the commodities Australia sells the Soviet Union are readily available from other suppliers who were not prepared to discontinue their sales. Thus, since Afghanistan, commercial exchanges with the Soviet Union have continued, as indeed have diplomatic contacts.</PARA>
<PARA> In other ways, however, Australia's trade and economic relations with the Soviet Union have been affected by the Government's post-Afghanistan policy. For example, there are no exchanges of visits by Ministers and very senior officials of the Commonwealth and Soviet Governments; Australian trade promotion activities in the Soviet Union have ceased; and activities of the Bilateral Mixed Commission on Trade and Economic Co-operation remain suspended.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's post-Afghanistan policy towards the Soviet Union continues to disallow a range of bilateral cooperation, including cultural, scientific, sporting and trade union exchanges, and co-operation in such fields as fisheries and civil aviation. I regret to say that so far the Soviet Union has given the Government no cause to reconsider that policy.</PARA>
