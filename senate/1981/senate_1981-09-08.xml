<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, it is with particular regret that I inform the Senate of the death on 2 September of the Honourable Dame Enid Muriel Lyons, a former member of the House of Representatives for the division of Darwin, former Vice-President of the Executive Council and widow of a former Prime Minister, the Right Honourable J. A. Lyons. I wish to make a few remarks. I was privileged, as many of us were, to know Dame Enid Lyons-on my part for some 35 years, indeed, the whole of the post-war years. She was a remarkable woman and a remarkable Australian as you, Mr President, would acknowledge. Not only was she the distinguished wife of a distinguished Prime Minister but also in her own way, in her own talents, in her own qualities, she achieved a quality of excellence that was acknowledged. She was a devoted wife and mother. She was a mother of some 11 children-a large family. She was a schoolteacher, I think, married to a schoolteacher. She entered Parliament and became a Minister and Vice-President of the Executive Council. I think she was the first woman member of the House of Representatives and the first woman member of Federal Cabinet-positions of great distinction. She was created a Dame of the Order of Australia in the Australia Day Honours List in 1980 for her public and parliamentary service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think all who knew her would say that the outstanding thing was the quality of the woman herself. She had a warmth of charm and affection that all who associated with her knew and were the better for. She transmitted a love and affection that made her a very distinctive person. Amongst her acquaintances and friends she was talented and an articulate speaker. She was a very distinctive writer and author, and all in all one of our great Australians. She lived a full life. I think she was in the fullness of some 84 years of her life when she died. Therefore, whilst regretting her passing one acknowledges the great contribution she made to this country. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death on 2 September of the Honourable Dame Enid Muriel Lyons, a member of the House of Representatives for the division of Darwin from 1943 to 1951, Vice-President of the Executive Council from 1949 to 1951, and widow of the former Prime Minister the Right Honourable J. A. Lyons, places on record its appreciation of her long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to her family in their bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the motion which has been moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Carrick. I would like to associate the Opposition with the remarks that the honourable senator has made about the late Dame Enid Lyons. I believe that it is true to say that her many qualities and talents have been amply described in the obituaries and other tributes that have appeared in the Press and elsewhere. Perhaps I could just dwell on one or two points. Firstly, there is no doubt, from her record, that she was a highly talented person in her own right. I did not have the advantage of knowing her, as did Senator Carrick.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, the fact that she was the first woman member of the House of Representatives and the first woman member of a Federal Cabinet is of historic importance. Nowadays as we look around this Senate and, since the last election, when we look in one section of the House of Representatives, we see that she was a pioneering figure in that sense. It is to be hoped that the example of her success will be emulated by many women members of the House of Representatives and the Senate, that the rapidity with which women are newly elected to membership of both chambers will increase and that in that process the pioneering example of Dame Enid Lyons will be remembered. I have pleasure in commending the motion moved by Senator Carrick. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support the motion and add their condolences to the family of the late Dame Enid Lyons. We note especially the significance of her career as the first woman member of the House of Representatives and, indeed, as the first woman Minister in this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I met Dame Enid Lyons when she was a commissioner of the Australian Broadcasting Commission from 1951 to 1962. Effectively, as some honourable senators will remember, that could be called the Boyer era, during which the ABC expanded significantly its operations outside this country. As a small part of that process, I was able to observe the enormous impact of that move by the ABC upon our neighbours in Asia. It had a large and permanent influence on our relationships with a number of South East Asian countries, not the least Indonesia, Malaysia in its formative stages, and Singapore. Perhaps most important of all, that influence was a grass roots influence. The situation arose that the largest audience of the Australian Broadcasting Commission was in Indonesia. I believe that that still remains the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I know from my own experience that, as a commissioner, Dame Enid Lyons was an active supporter of that wider role for the ABC. I take the opportunity to draw attention to that later, but by no means least, part of her career. </PARA>

She was a fine speaker and a well-known and loved family woman. Indeed, she contributed a great deal to this Parliament and provided an example which is being followed more and more as the years go by. I merely reiterate and commend the remarks of previous speakers to this motion of condolence and extend the sympathy of my own party also to the relatives and friends of the late Dame Enid Lyons.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to associate myself with the condolences that have been expressed by the other speakers to this motion. Not only was Dame Enid Lyons a mother and stateswoman but also she was a talented and very readable author. Her books, including her collected newspaper columns, give immense enjoyment to people of a variety of ages and tastes, particularly those who are ill. I speak personally and with gratitude of the enjoyment that her books gave to one person.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the things about Dame Enid Lyons was that she was a lady-a lady of compassion and humour. One of the most moving tributes was to see yesterday the people of Devonport, in their thousands, lining the streets while the cortege proceeded to the cemetery. I should like to associate myself with the remarks that have preceded mine. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to be associated with the motion of condolence. I simply wish to speak of Dame Enid as a lady of great charm whom I really met only once though of course there were many brief encounters in the course of those community affairs with which she was associated right up until her death. But that one real occasion of meeting was a favoured one because it was in her own home. When I first arrived in Devonport in July 1978 as a fledgling senator, Dame Enid invited me to dinner in the company of her grandson, Peter Lyons. I remember going with some trepidation, knowing her reputation as a lady of great physical and spiritual toughness, but I need not have feared. Her hospitality was indeed very gracious; her reminiscing was fascinating. It was not reminiscing which dwelt in the past; it simply took pleasure in the past. She was indeed very alive to the present and it is this quality of being truly alive, vivacious in the real sense of the word, that I think remains with me as one reflects on Dame Enid's life. Her language sparkled in the same way as her eyes and indeed her whole manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For those of my generation and younger who did not know Dame Enid in her political heyday that sort of memory of the heart I think is in some complementary way a tribute alongside the great public tributes which properly are paid to her public life. It is a privilege to be associated with this condolence motion. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IE4">Senator ARCHER</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Tasmania)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is difficult to pay an adequate tribute to a great person, and Dame Enid Lyons was certainly a great person. I first met Dame Enid Lyons in the mid-1940s. Over a period I met every member of her family in a very wide variety of contexts. My impressions of her life are probably different from other people's but to me it was all the more remarkable because it was so largely two separate lives, one after the other and each one being so much more than normal people would ever expect to have. During the 1920s and 1930s Dame Enid Lyons played a very strong part in providing the stability and backing for her husband's political achievements, in both the State and Federal spheres, which culminated with his election as Prime Minister. All the while there was the family, and a very large family at that. It was expected that following her husband's sudden death Dame Enid would have slipped from the limelight to become simply the widow of a former Prime Minister. It was as holder of the seat of Darwin that Dame Enid blossomed into what I would call her second state and with the benefit of 30 years of ingrained politics she immediately demonstrated the prowess that she had.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dame Enid was a great and true feminist. There was never a time, however, that she bragged about being a woman, nor did she apologise for it. She was the full person in every respect. In her first speech in Federal Parliament she said that any woman entering the public arena must justify herself not as a woman but as a person. The state of her health produced her retirement from Parliament at a relatively young age which enabled her to carry on her most influential community achievements for a further 30 years. I think I will always remember her for three major items: Firstly, her christian beliefs and practices that were the great motivation of her life; secondly, that warmth and openness that visitors always received at the front door of 'Home Hill'; and, thirdly, the magnificence of her oratory and the use of the language. </PARA>
<PARA> I will always remember two of her addresses as the best addresses I have ever heard. One was delivered at a Tasmanian Rostrum club meeting. The Honourable Les Bury had accepted an invitation to attend the meeting and at 4.30 he sent a telegram to say he was unable to attend. The meeting was in Devonport. A quick conference determined that an approach should be made to Dame Enid. When I arrived at her home she had finished her evening meal and was preparing for an early night. Within an hour she was at the conference and she delivered absolutely the most perfect 40-minute address I have ever heard, one that any other speaker would have required days and days to put together. </PARA>
<PARA> The second occasion was the last time when I heard her deliver an address and it occurred about two years ago. It also was magnificent. After it was over she said to me: 'I think that will be my last speech. You know, I can't remember things now and for the first time in my life I have had to carry with me a piece of paper with notes on it in case I forget'. Needless to say, she did not forget and she did not use the piece of paper. She had an enormously keen wit, a wit that was not flippant, a very deep and meaningful wit. She was a great woman and a great person. History may record her as the greatest Tasmanian woman, or possibly even the greatest Tasmanian. Whatever status she is given, it will not matter; Australia should be thankful for the life and contribution of this very great person. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join in the motion of condolence to the many relatives of Dame Enid Lyons. I think each of the qualities that have been expressed here today-every quality that Dame Enid had-is a quality that every woman would aspire towards. She was a loving wife and a loving mother. She was gentle and oh so very feminine. She was caring not only for her family but for all those around her. She was of tremendous support to her husband during his difficult days-and there were many difficult days. She was of great support to him throughout his period as Prime Minister. As has been said by many honourable senators, she was a wonderful speaker. She could reduce her audience to tears, be they men or women, and indeed she did so on many occasions. Anyone who reads her books will know only too well that she was quite capable of speaking in that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Three weeks before her death, she played the organ in the church in which she was buried. This was her custom. Indeed, about two months ago she and I were guests at an annual dinner of the Soroptomists Club in Devonport. As usual, she was very charming, very vivacious, and she was surrounded by people. The fact that she told me on that evening that she had willed the house, in the memory of her husband, to the people of Devonport really described how much she loved her city in Tasmania. It is with sincere sympathy that I offer my condolences to her very large family. </PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. That the decision by the Federal Government to introduce fees at the Repatriation General Hospital, Greenslopes, was made without prior consultation with medical staff at that hospital and implemented at short notice.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. That fee introduction will place the hospital in the untenable position of having to compete with the State's free hospital system.</PARA>

In addition to those aspects of the question, will the Minister confirm that the report by the McKinsey organisation in relation to Telecom's borrowing capacity has been in the hands of the Government for well over a year?

I can say that I am familiar with reports, particularly those which have tended to issue since the decision to terminate CYSS was announced in the Budget, which suggest in the way that the honourable senator has suggested that some of the CYSS groups at least are performing something of a social welfare role as against a role of preparing people for employment or giving them some assistance while they are awaiting employment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Aspect House some time ago received approval for a pilot project under the family support scheme. That approval, I think, applied until a couple of years ago. The project actually got under way relatively recently; I think within the last four or five months. I speak from memory when I say that the original approval was given for funds to the order of $60,000 for a full year. However, the scheme as subsequently got under way was rather more financially ambitious than that. My advice from the State Minister concerned, Mr Lohrey, is that the full amount of the original funds and, indeed, the additional funds were expended within the first four or five months of operation. This matter came as a surprise to Mr Lohrey as it did to me. In any event, Mr Lohrey and I have been in fairly frequent communication over the last week about this project. It was my anticipation that a joint Press release would be issued in Tasmania today by us, but I am not sure whether that release has been issued.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not wish to pre-empt Mr Lohrey in this matter, but I can say to the Senate that the Commonwealth and the State are jointly undertaking an examination of this project rather earlier than an evaluation would normally proceed, namely, after a relatively few months of operation. The future funding of that scheme will depend upon the evaluation which has been made. A problem concerned the organisers of Aspect House in that they had received some $15,000 more than the funding approval. However, that matter has been regularised by the joint action of Mr Lohrey and me. We hope that the evaluation can proceed over the period for which funding remains and that a sensible decision can be made subsequently. The problem is always there when governments fund organisations. I have had experience of that in the portfolios of Aboriginal Affairs and Social Security. This is a frequent experience for my friend and colleague, Senator Peter Baume. When funds are made available and there is fairly substantial overspending there are real problems in dealing with the matter within the allowances made in a Budget. Mr Lohrey and I share the problem, and in a spirit of amity, comity and good will we are trying to sort it out.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have figures with me which would show which countries may impose a tax on periodicals, newspapers or books. I could refer to the fact that in many countries a value added tax is imposed on many commodities which, I assume, would include those mentioned. As to breaking a long-standing tradition, it is a fact that in this Budget a tax is imposed on a number of items that had previously not been subjected to tax. As to giving any guarantees about any future government and any action it might take to increase taxes of any kind, I think it would be understood that any future government would make its own decisions on the broad range of income-producing Bills that it would wish to introduce. The fact that this Government has introduced a tax on one measure or another would in no way pre-empt what a future government may decide to do. I do not see great relevance in looking at what guarantees we could give with regard to any future government on any matter where a future government may choose to impose taxes as it sees fit.

Is it also a fact that the payments to the States in 1981-82 are limited to an increase of 9 per cent whereas the Commonwealth outlays this year for its own purposes have been set at 15 per cent?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I think that the facts as stated are broadly correct, although perhaps I ought to say that the increase in funds for payments to the States this year is estimated to be 8 per cent and not 9 per cent as mentioned by Senator Crichton-Browne. The comparisons perhaps depend very much on the period chosen and the terms that we would include when making those comparisons. I think we ought to acknowledge that there was a very generous growth of payments to the States between 1972 and 1975. It ought also to be said that the economic strategy followed by the Government in the 1981-82 Budget required measures to cut back the relative size of the public sector to make room for the expansion and the needs of the private sector in this country. The room for expenditure restraint varied between different functional areas of the Budget. About 30 per cent of the Budget relates to social security and welfare matters and it is very difficult to achieve savings or cutbacks which were not achieved in this area. Health grants to the States and so on had a different application in this year. I suppose that one could make comparisons between Commonwealth Government expenditure on its own account and expenditure for the States. However, I simply say that the strategy in this Budget was to cut back expenditure in the public sector and wherever this was possible without serious disruption to programs it was done in the way in which the Budget Papers show. I have no further explanation to offer with regard to the changes in the comparisons between the Commonwealth and the States except to say that if the States wish to increase their own expenditure on their own account their revenue raising would be in their own hands.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last part of Senator Elstob's question really provides the essential answer to the remainder of his question. The fact of the matter is that sovereignty over land in the six States rests with each of the State governments, so that the determination of whether a purchase of land is made by an Australian citizen or a foreigner is a matter entirely and essentially for the State government concerned. That is quite clear. As to the initial rhetoric, the fact is that it was this Government which set up the Foreign Investment Review Board and it was this Government which established that there should be at least 50 per cent Australian equity in these resources areas. We have insisted on that. It is extremely difficult to trace money that comes into this country because it can pass through a primary purpose into a secondary or tertiary purpose and fulfil its primary responsibilities on the way. Therefore, basically the matter must rest essentially with the States. The State governments are responsible governments duly elected by the people. They have always had land as their responsibility.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The particular vegetation referred to, which is spelt as 'jojoba' and I understand is pronounced 'hohoba', has been the subject of study by this Government. In fact, the Government is supporting research on the jojoba bean through the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, which is undertaking, with State Departments of Agriculture, laboratory studies as well as field trials in all mainland States. I will certainly bring that part of the honourable senator's question to the attention of the Minister for Science and Technology. As to the use of the material as an oil substitute, my understanding is that the liquid wax from the bean has a promising future as a substitute for sperm whale oil in a wide range of specialised applications. My understanding is that there is already a strong demand for the wax from the wild plant in the United States of America for use in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. In sulphurised form it may find application as a transmission oil but I expect for the moment it will be too costly for use as a lubricating oil. However, it is not, as I understand it, considered at the moment to be a potential alternative liquid fuel but rather a lubricant. Plantations are a matter for the Minister for Primary Industry. I will bring the question to his attention. My understanding is that a large number of cultivation trials are in progress in Australia but no plantations have reached commercial production.</PARA></TALK.START>

In view of the above average rainfall over much of Australia this year and the consequent superabundance of grass cover now to be expected and which would appear to make this fire season one to be remembered, can the Minister say whether arrangements are in hand to acquire the services of a number of Neptune or other specialist water bombers as discussed at the end of last year's fire season?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My recollection is that at this stage of the bushfire season last year Senator Archer expressed a practical view on the matter. Whilst the control of bushfires, including the acquisition of equipment to fight them, is a State responsibility the matter of water bombing has been considered by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth seeks to assist in a number of ways and it responded to discussions about water bombing last year by arranging to provide a Royal Australian Air Force Hercules-not a Neptune-on a shared cost basis to test what is called a modular air-borne fire fighting unit during this coming fire fighting season. This follows an approach by the Victorian Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is proposed that the fire fighting unit be tested in the Hercules aircraft during the Victorian bushfire season. I understand this unit works by laying down a chemical firebreak, not just a water one in the path of advancing bushfires by a mixture of water and fire retardant chemicals. The personnel from the RAAF, the Forests Commission of Victoria and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation attended a training course in Idaho in May of this year. A great deal of work is being done on this matter. I have a fair deal of information on the matter arising out of last year's inquiries.

Before the Minister took responsibility for the passage of those Bills through the Senate, was she aware that the Bills had been drafted in a form entirely different from any other form in which similar Bills have come before the Senate in the past 50 years; in other words, that on this sole occasion machinery provisions, along with provisions imposing taxation, had been included in the one Bill? What was the purpose of that unique step?

They are money Bills. They are part of the Budget that is before the Parliament at present. Anyone who tried to prove otherwise, I think, would be indulging in semantics.

I put it to the Minister that, if she were to read the last Press release by the Honourable Neil Brown, No. 98/81, she would see that its whole thrust is that all the casualties on the cessation of CYSS are to be counselled on alternative training. Are we to assume that the alternative training will apply to the whole of the 55,000 participants in CYSS programs?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has decided in this Budget not to continue funding CYSS projects beyond 31 October of this year. It ought to be said that circumstances have changed since the Scheme was introduced in 1976. Many new programs have been initiated and the resources devoted to the young, especially the young unemployed, have been increased. This year it is expected that about 210,000 young people will be assisted by the Government's range of manpower and training programs. Nearly 90,000 young people will be assisted this year under the Special Youth Employment Training Program. There have been increased subsidies under that program to assist these young people unemployed for eight months or more in the last 12 months. An increase in the range and level of educational opportunities under the Commonwealth's School to Work Transition Program for young people has also been dealt with this year. A transition allowance will be available to ensure that young employed people do not lack the incentive to undertake technical and further education courses. Strengthening of the counselling services through the Commonwealth Employment Service and support under the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training Scheme for the training of 95,000 apprentices are other matters that ought to be borne in mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I think was said by my colleague Senator Chaney earlier today, the position of the people who would not be able to be assisted under alternative programs will be the subject of a report to the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs.

Until we are aware of the outcome of that investigation, and on the understanding that we have made an arrangement to donate the assets held by the CYSS projects to approved local organisations and that other matters will be the subject of a report to the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, I am unable to say whether a large number of people will not be able to be assisted by a number of the programs I have mentioned and by other programs which exist.

Senator McLaren would have to acknowledge that, as I know he is already fully aware of this problem.

The question which appears to require answering is whether the imposition of a sales tax will have a downward effect in South Australia greater than in any other State. Senator Foreman is apparently addressing himself to some special treatment for South Australia. In that event, it has to be recognised that what this Government's policies are seeking to do are to stimulate housing across the broad front by ensuring that there are downward pressures on interest rates brought about as a result of this particular Budget. This Budget is designed to keep the downward pressure on interest rates and not to inflate them. We all acknowledge that housing is one of the areas which is most sensitive to interest rates. We are concerned, of course, at the present time for the welfare of persons who have to pay higher interest rates on housing, it is hoped in the shorter run. To answer Senator Foreman's point directly, the Government will not be reconsidering its decision in regard to sales tax.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think it ought to be pointed out that that is only one item of the cost of the goods concerned. I have no further comment to make on the matter except to say, as was said in the question, that there is an imposition of tax on these goods. One might well argue that it should not be imposed on packaging or some other elements. Freight is simply one part of the cost of the goods concerned. For a very long period it has been an item of the cost of the goods that is subjected to sales tax. There has been no change to that policy in this Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The case to which Senator Coleman refers, of alleged discrimination in an hotel in, I think, Mullewa in Western Australia, has been proceeding through the Western Australian courts. I understand that an appeal has been lodged against the decision of the judge of the Supreme Court who dismissed the case alleging that there had been a breach of the Liquor Act in the conduct of the publican. There is now an appeal to the Full Court of the Western Australian Supreme Court against that judgment of, I think, Mr Justice Wallace. So, I do not propose to say anything more in relation to that matter. Certainly the Racial Discrimination Act has provisions which, on the face of them, seem to apply to the situation. I am not fully aware of all the facts and, of course, I do not want to make any judgment. Obviously the Racial Discrimination Act appears to have some application. That Act is administered by the Commissioner for Community Relations who, I understand, has already had some complaint about the matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 August 1981 Senator McIntosh asked me whether I had received an approach from the Western Australian State Minister for Health proposing that the Hollywood Repatriation General Hospital be relocated to an area in the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital and also that the Sunset Hospital for aged persons be relocated in the Hollywood Hospital. He also asked whether this was why Hollywood Hospital had been allowed to run down in many areas. I undertook to check on the matters which Senator McIntosh raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I deal first with the allegation that Hollywood Hospital had been allowed to run down. There is absolutely no truth in such an allegation as can be witnessed by the expenditure undertaken at the hospital in recent years. I assure the honourable senator that no patient will ever be admitted to a repatriation hospital unless there is a complete assurance that the high quality of care which has come to be expected of repatriation hospitals is available.</PARA>
<PARA> Since this question was asked, I have received a letter from the Western Australia Minister for Health which covers, in fairly specific terms, a proposal about the long term development of the Hollywood and Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre sites. I have asked my Department to consider this proposal and to advise me as soon as possible. It includes a suggestion for relocation of Hollywood's acute medical services to the Sir Charles Gairdner block. Consideration of a matter of such scope will obviously take some time and I do not wish to pre-empt the consideration or to anticipate the substance of any future inter-governmental or ministerial considerations on the matter. Obviously were there to be any significant change affecting any repatriation general hospital, there is an obligation on the Government to discuss such matters with the appropriate veterans' organisations. I can quite clearly state that the Minister's proposal does not mention the Sunset Hospital. I am, therefore, in no position to comment on it other than to state that it will not be a factor in the consideration of the Minister's proposal by my Department.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During Question Time, Senator Ryan asked a question concerning the Wreck Bay community and I promised to get some information for her. I begin by pointing out, as Senator Ryan would be well aware, that the Aborigines at Wreck Bay cannot be compared with those in the Northern Territory in terms of, say, the requirements of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. If such Act applied to Wreck Bay, it is very likely that the Aboriginal Land Commissioner would not grant land to Aborigines on the basis of traditional ownership and association. Therefore, some other mechanism is necessary to meet their needs. Further, the land tenure system in the Australian Capital Territory is different, being a system of leasehold tenure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, I can advise the honourable senator that what I said to her during Question Time is correct. Negotiations have been going on over a long period and the Aborigines at Wreck Bay have been offered their land on conditions which are as close as can be obtained in the Australian Capital Territory, where there is no freehold, to what they would get if they were in the Northern Territory. They have been offered perpetual leases of the land. This is the highest land interest now granted in the Australian Capital Territory. They have been promised that they would have the same rights in relation to any proposed mineral exploration and development as they would have under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. They have also been offered all of the land which they sought. I understand that, although this offer has been available for 12 months, the community has not yet signified its intention regarding the offer. If the honourable senator can bring her good offices to bear to encourage the community to look further at the offer, I would be grateful. I would like to see this matter resolved as much as she would.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today as a result of an article which appeared in the Sunday Press on 6 September in a double page spread at pages 4 and 5 under the heading 'Dads Kidnap Squad! Senator hits out' and next to which is a photograph of myself-not a particularly good photograph, I might add. In a block at the corner of this article, and presumably to lead into the article, it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> An organisation, funded by prominent citizens, is helping divorced fathers abduct their children and flee Australia, complete with changed identities for a new life overseas, according to a Western Australian Senator. </PARA>
<PARA> And she's planning to demand Government action when Parliament resumes this week. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate may recall that, some four and a half years ago, I raised in this chamber the matter of an organisation called the Fathers' Organisation for Revolutionary Custody Entitlement, or FORCE. At that time, I asked a question in which I said that information that I had led me to believe that charter flights were using isolated airstrips in the north of Western Australia to smuggle out both parents and children who had been the subject of custodial orders through the Family Court of Australia. I expressed my concern that these children would be virtually forced by their parents' action to be now resident in a strange environment where their lifestyles could be totally different. If the children went without their passports, I asked what action would they be able to take at a later time to return to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> That was the first and last time that I heard of FORCE until I was contacted during the week by a reporter from the Sunday Press. He informed me that the group was operating in a bigger and better organised way than ever. I now find that in this article I am quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> But she was told this week that the group was still operating in all states 'bigger and better organised than ever'. </PARA>
<PARA>To which I have replied:</PARA>
<PARA>'If this is true, action must be taken immediately to stop those involved,' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>At this point I say that the person who advised me that it is operating in a bigger and better way was the reporter. I have not heard of this organisation since 1977. Leading into the story the newspaper, which is not a particularly good one-presumably it is really on the bones if it thinks that it will sell papers by raising something that is four and half years old-states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate will be asked this week to investigate a clandestine organisation which claims to have 'smuggled' hundreds of fugitive fathers and their children out of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I am quite happy to ask the Senate to investigate the matter. I was quite happy to ask it to investigate it four years ago. But if no new evidence has come forward I wonder whether there is any point in my asking for an investigation into an organisation about which I know very little. At the time I was being interviewed by telephone in Perth, from Melbourne, I was told that a number of serious allegations were made, including the fact that a boat had been picked up outside the three-mile limit. The boat contained a number of parents and their children who were on their way to goodness knows where. My immediate response was: What three-mile limit? The old limit was 12 miles and the new limit is 200 miles. So what the heck if there is a group of people outside a three-mile limit? What three-mile limit were they talking about? Allegations were made, only by the journalist, that there had been a connection between the FORCE organisation and the death of a Family Court judge. I have no way of knowing whether that is fact or fiction. I really do not care to discuss it and I do not intend to discuss it here any further. But I am concerned that I am being quoted in such a way, after raising the matter four years ago when I could not get a great deal of interest from the Press. </PARA>
<PARA> The story was repeated yesterday in the Sydney Morning Herald on page 3, which once again states that I am going to ask the Senate to investigate this same clandestine organisation. There are also some quotations in this article that lead me to some confusion. I am quoted as having said that I:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . first became aware of the activities of FORCE in 1977, but after raising the matter in Parliament had been told by the Federal Government that police investigations could not uncover sufficient evidence to lay charges. </PARA>
<PARA>I am a little concerned because later on in the story another person says:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The airlifts out of the country are not as frequent as they used to be.'</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> 'There have only been three or four in the past four months.'</PARA>
<PARA> 'This is because Federal authorities have privately told us that they would not go out of their way to prosecute us and there would be no great manhunts.'</PARA>
<PARA>That causes me a great deal of concern because it would appear that, if this story is correct, there have been three or four airlifts of children out of the country in the past three or four months. It also concerns me because some Federal authority is quoted as having made statements too. That may not in fact be true. I ask whether the veracity of the journalist who wrote this article has been questioned. I will question it now. As I said, the organisation must be really trying to sell its newspapers by sensationalism. Perhaps if it was being more practical it would have written something similar to what was contained in the Australian's leader this morning. It talks about the changes to the Family Law Act which are necessary to prevent this type of organisation operating and fostering in a society such as Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-This statement is to advise the Senate in detail of the measures undertaken by the Government, following the confirmed finding on 13 August 1981 of horse meat in a shipment of Australian boneless beef to the United States of America. This discovery, coupled with the finding in Melbourne on 21 August of kangaroo meat in cartons marked for export as boneless beef, is an extremely grave matter. The Government is determined to have all the facts of this case brought to light, to stamp out this kind of activity, to prosecute those involved, and to ensure that all possible measures are taken to prevent such activity from happening again. The tragedy of this case is the immense damage it has caused to the reputation of our meat industry, both here and overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are currently investigating a situation where meat bearing the markings of two of Australia's 400 licensed export establishments has been found to have been adulterated. Both establishments are based in Melbourne. Their total exports to the United States so far this year have amounted to 632 tonnes, or 0.39 per cent of total Australian shipments to the United States over the same period, amounting to 161,000 tonnes. The Australian Bureau of Animal Health is carrying out spot checks and species tests on export boneless beef in store in every State in Australia. So far, not one of these has shown any evidence of substitution. Of 742 tests taken up to 9 a.m. this morning, every single one has proved positive for beef. Without in any way trying to play down the gravity of the situation, the facts at present indicate that the great bulk of Australia's meat export industry is carrying out its trade honestly and fairly. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the first known case of horse or kangaroo meat having been substituted for beef. While there have been a number of broad allegations made over past years, to the knowledge of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) not one of these has related specifically to the substitution of horse or kangaroo meat. Clearly, existing requirements and regulations governing the export meat trade have to be tightened up, and existing penalties for fraudulent activities in the trade substantially increased. We have been faced with a potentially devastating situation which has major ramifications for our $3.5 billion meat industry, and consequently for the national economy. Not only must this case be cleared up, and the offenders satisfactorily dealt with, but also the stigma hanging over the Australian meat industry must be removed once and for all. The Minister is determined that it will be. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been a lot of emotive statements and claims over the past two weeks including that the Government has moved too slowly on this matter. The facts do not support such claims. The Government has acted promptly, properly, decisively, and in co-operation with the United States. On 11 August 1981, the Australian Bureau of Animal Health received its first advice from the United States Department of Agriculture that horse meat was suspected in a carton of boneless beef, in San Diego, bearing the markings of Australian Meat Export Establishment 140C, Profreeze, Richmond, Melbourne. On 12 August, the movement of all export meat from Profreeze was terminated. Seven other boning rooms in the same complex were also placed under strict surveillance with thorough checks being made on their product before release for export. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States Department of Agriculture advised us on 13 August 1981 that laboratory tests on the 140C meat in San Diego proved positive for horse meat. Immediately we received that advice, Establishment 140C was deregistered, meaning that it can no longer export meat to anywhere in the world, and the Australian Federal Police were asked to investigate. These measures were announced publicly on that day. Immediately steps were also taken to tighten security: For example, 1,809 cartons of meat in Victoria bearing 140C markings, with a trade value of around $100,000, were seized and impounded for testing; spot checks were introduced in all States; extra meat inspector surveillance was provided at independent boning rooms and cold stores; shiploading security was increased; and checking of health certificates and all documentation was intensified. </PARA>
<PARA> Further measures were then developed within days. A new system was devised for security seals to be placed on cartons which will cost an estimated $1m in 1981-82. The first delivery of these seals is expected today and they will progressively be put into use forthwith. An urgent review of relevant laws and the penalties which can apply was instigated, involving senior officers of the Department of Primary Industry, the Attorney-General's Department, and the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. Police investigations were intensified and at present there are 15 Australian Federal police, four Victorian police and one officer from the Trade Practices Commission involved. These numbers will be increased as the Commissioner requests. A special task force was set up within the Bureau of Animal Health to co-ordinate a nation-wide sampling and species testing program. The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore), on 20 August, asked the Trade Practices Commission to investigate claims of false description in the trading of meat. Kangaroo serum was sent to the United States Department of Agriculture to assist it in its testing program. </PARA>
<PARA> On 1 September the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation suspended the export licence of Samsons Meat Co. (Victoria) Pty Ltd, and is continuing investigations into other companies. On 4 September 1981 the United States Department of Agriculture advised that horse meat had been confirmed in a consignment of meat from Establishment 622-Jason Meats Pty Ltd, Abbotsford, Melbourne. That establishment was immediately deregistered and the Australian Federal Police advised. All cartons labelled 622 are being seized and tested. So far, 2,533 cartons have been impounded. Because of this latest development, the Minister viewed it as essential to take special action in regard to Victoria. The Minister therefore took the decision that day to suspend the export operations of 27 independent boning rooms in Victoria. Yesterday, to strengthen further the controls, the Minister extended this suspension to include independent boning rooms in Victoria that are associated with an abattoir complex. This involves six boning rooms. The suspension became effective from midnight last night and will remain in force until the boning rooms can demonstrate adequate security measures and a satisfactory species testing program. Those who can meet the new requirements will be reinstated immediately, and will then be able to look forward to again being acceptable exporters to the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been questions raised as to why this action did not also include those boning rooms which are registered with the registered number of an abattoir. There are 15 boning rooms in Victoria in this situation. The reason is simply that these boning rooms are part and parcel of a fully integrated operation which is under constant supervision. The overall operation is one in which the live animal is brought in, slaughtered, processed, packed, frozen, stored and subsequently loaded out on the one establishment. In other words, the integrated establishments already have a much higher degree of security. The new procedures are being applied nationally from today, and any registered establishment found not meeting them will have its operations suspended. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to legislative measures that the Government is taking forthwith. Under existing provisions, the maximum penalties for fraudulent activity or breaches in our export meat trade are totally inadequate. We will be introducing legislation into Parliament this week to bring these penalties to a realistic level. Maximum penalties under the Customs Act and the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act for illegal export are to be lifted from the present $1,000 to $100,000 or five years' imprisonment, or both, on indictment under each Act. Also both Acts will provide for a maximum penalty of $5,000 or one year's imprisonment, or both, on summary conviction. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be a separate, new Bill-the Meat Export (Penalties) Act. This will also provide for maximum penalties of $100,000 or five years' imprisonment, or both, on indictment, for offences relating to the misuse of inspection stamps, alteration or interference with descriptions and tags, and making false or misleading statements. Similarly, it will provide for a maximum penalty of $5,000 or one year's imprisonment, or both, on summary conviction. Offences of this nature are currently covered by the Exports (Meat) Regulations, which provide for a maximum penalty of only $100. The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Act will be amended to enable the penalty provisions for breach of export licence conditions to be increased from $2,000 to a maximum of $100,000 or 5 years' imprisonment, or both, on indictment, and for a maximum of $5,000 or one year's imprisonment, or both, on summary conviction. Further legislation will be introduced at a later date to enable the Corporation to suspend an export licence immediately where prima facie evidence exists that a condition of the licence has been breached. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures might sound somewhat extreme, but in the opinion of the Minister and the Government, they are realistic penalties that should be imposed on anyone involved in racketeering of this nature, and in placing at risk our entire export meat trade. Such penalties also will clearly demonstrate to our trading partners that we will not tolerate fraudulent practices in this industry. The Government gave close consideration to making these legislative changes retrospective, but for reasons of legal precedence, has now decided against this. The higher penalties will apply from the date of royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the legislative changes, the Government is implementing strict new controls: Export meat will be stored in specially secured and approved cold stores, under new inventory control measures; owners of registered export establishments will be responsible for all activities conducted on their premises; meat transport vehicles and containers will be sealed, to add to the security of the packed product during transport from a boning room to an approved secure cold store or shipside. </PARA>
<PARA> We are examining the possibility of requiring registered export meat packers also to be licenced exporters. This would mean that packers would be responsible and accountable for their product from the time they physically pack it to the time it is loaded on ship for export. Another measure under consideration by the Bureau of Animal Health is whether the requirement of a standard one-piece meat carton will be cost effective and will further enhance security, by making re-lidding impossible. All of these measures have been set in train since 11 August, when we were first notified of possible horse meat substitution. Since that time, the Minister has had constant discussion with representatives in the livestock and meat industry. The Minister has been inundated with representations and suggestions. His concern has been to ensure that those responsible for this racket are brought to justice-to that end the Australian Federal Police are investigating-and also to ensure that the appropriate measures are instigated to prevent as far as possible such a situation occurring again. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Nixon held a lengthy meeting with meat industry representatives in Melbourne last Thursday, and convened a special meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council on Friday, at which all State Ministers of agriculture were present. The Minister wanted to ensure that the initiatives being taken by the Government were considered to be appropriate and were taken after full consultation. At both his meeting with industry representatives and the Australian Agricultural Council there was general agreement on the initiatives he had taken and which he was proposing to take. The special meeting with State Ministers for agriculture was particularly relevant, because to a large degree the problem arose from and extended to areas outside the Commonwealth Government's jurisdiction, notably, State controls over knackeries and the movement of pet meat. Clearly there is an urgent and equal necessity for the States and Northern Territory to strengthen their controls in this area. This was impressed upon Ministers at the Agricultural Council meeting. It was agreed that all States and the Northern Territory immediately examine policies and practices for controlling knackeries, denaturing pet meat, and identifying game meat for human consumption. The matter will be taken further at a special meeting of the Standing Committee on Agriculture, to be held in Melbourne on 18 September. Since the problem is clearly a national one, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) yesterday telexed all Premiers and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory seeking their full support for an urgent examination of these areas so that rapid progress can be made at the meeting on 18 September. On this point, the Minister is pleased to say, that he has already been advised that Victoria will co-operate completely in any way possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Nixon also makes specific mention of the fact that, from the outset, we have had daily contact and close co-operation with the United States. When the United States Special Trade Representative, Ambassador Brock, and Mr Nixon discussed this issue on 17 August in Canberra, he expressed satisfaction with the way in which the Australian Government was handling the situation. At no time have we received any complaints from the United States Administration as to the way in which we are dealing with this issue. In fact, its appreciation is on record. Following the Government's action last Friday in regard to the Victorian independent boning rooms, the United States Department of Agriculture announced the next day the immediate release on to the American market of all Australian meat except that from Victoria. About 24,000 tonnes of meat, valued at $40m has been released. We are continuing to negotiate for the earliest possible release of some 6,000 tonnes of Victorian meat still being held. The decision by the United States Department of Agriculture confirms two most significant points: One, the confidence of the United States Administration in the Australian meat export industry; and two, the success of close co-operation and consultation between our respective governments and veterinary authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> A senior veterinary officer from the Bureau of Animal Health has been in Washington since 1 September discussing new proposals and other technical matters with his veterinary counterparts in the United States Department of Agriculture. The USDA has also sent an officer to Australia for discussions with officials. Honourable senators will be aware that on 26 August Mr Nixon issued a statement confirming new procedures adopted by the United States to prevent any attempt at substitution of meat for the United States market. Among those procedures is a requirement for the Bureau of Animal Health to set up an approved procedure for species testing in Australia before export meat receives its final certification. </PARA>
<PARA> To this end the Minister and his Department are currently discussing with the USDA a detailed species testing program whereby registered premises will be divided into three risk categories with the appropriate sampling for each category as follows: One, where product is produced under a full time inspection supervision system from slaughter through to final containerisation in the one establishment with only one operator, samples be taken from 10 cartons a week on a random basis. Two, where product is produced under full time inspection supervision, but where there are leased boning rooms on the establishment, samples from 10 cartons a week of each operator's product be taken on a random basis. Three, where a product has been transferred from either an abattoir or a boning room and stored elsewhere prior to containerisation, samples from 10 cartons from each container, or from each consignment of 600 cartons, be taken. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has received an interim report from the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police stating that police investigations into this case are proceeding satisfactorily. Honourable senators will no doubt be aware that one man has just been arrested and charged with 21 offences. I do not propose to canvass any details of the investigations, because it is imperative that inquiries are not jeopardised. The investigations will continue to be followed through to their conclusion as a matter of top priority. In the meantime the Government feels it is now in a position to consider whether a broader inquiry is necessary. This is based on the fact that we now have the interim police report coupled with the weekend decision of the USDA to release the majority of impounded Australian meat on to the United States market. I want to reiterate that the Government has at no time ruled out the possibility of a broader inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> Having therefore considered the position and having regard to the seriousness of the allegations that have been raised, particularly allegations that people in official positions have been involved in malpractice, the Government has decided to set up a royal commission into certain aspects of the meat industry including allegations of malpractice in relation to the export of meat and to meat preparation in the State of Victoria. The Acting Prime Minister will be announcing the terms of reference when the commission is established. Victoria has agreed to take part in the royal commission. The Acting Prime Minister has sent a telex to all State Premiers and to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory inviting them to do likewise. In addition to all the measures I have detailed, the Government has decided to engage an independent consultant to conduct a comprehensive review on the effectiveness of the revised system for the documentary and physical control of export meat. The consultant is to report as soon as possible and to recommend any additional measures he feels are necessary to ensure that the revised system fully achieves the objective of ensuring to the utmost that only meat legally certified for export is in fact exported. This is, if honourable senators like, a double check, to be carried out independently, to ensure that no loophole is left for illegal exports. The question could be asked why such parallel inquiries are to proceed. The reasons are that, whilst the Government has decided on a royal commission in relation to allegations of malpractice, which could be somewhat lengthy, there is, in the interests of restoring the international credibility of our meat industry, a much more urgent and immediate need for the procedural aspects to be reviewed as promptly as possible by an independent consultant. The Minister hopes, subject to negotiations with the consultant to be appointed, to have his report within two months. </PARA>
<PARA> Serious allegations have been made and it is the Government's determination that they be fully and completely answered. Australia's meat industry has been severely tarnished and it is imperative that its international reputation be cleared. The Minister believes the establishment of a royal commission is the only means by which we will achieve such an aim to the satisfaction of everyone in the community. The measures I have detailed are broad ranging and decisive initiatives for the Australian meat industry. Such stringent measures have to be imposed on the honest majority, because of the fraudulent actions of a small minority. I seek leave to move a motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;People who took a close interest in the razor gang's decision pertaining to the Australian Wool Corporation received a convincing demonstration of the incompetence of the present Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon). In two other areas-the affairs of the Australian Dairy Corporation in Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd and now the meat export scandal, or slaughtergate scandal-we must add to the incompetence typically displayed by the Minister for Primary Industry what is at best a charge of culpable negligence. The Minister's behaviour in the Australian Dairy Corporation and meat export affairs has been similar. It has been characterised by prevarication and obfuscation. He has even used the same wording in both cases: 'It would be inappropriate for me to take any action at this time'. But in this last case-the slaughtergate affair-the consequences of his incompetence and of his culpable negligence are far more serious. They threaten, if not the survival, then certainly the prosperity of an export industry which returns income in excess of $1 billion a year. For many years-for decades-a guarantee by the Australian Department of Primary Industry as to the quality of an export commodity was accepted right around the world as just that-an ironclad guarantee of quality. Never before has it been called into question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All that has now been swept away. In place of a national uniform and unquestioned system of quality control and export guarantees we have-no wonder under the circumstances-various State governments attempting to extricate their States from the confusion and damage which have flowed from the inadequacy of the Minister for Primary Industry. The Premier of New South Wales said just a couple of days ago:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government of New South Wales is not going to see our beef export industry go down the drain. If it is necessary to save the industry and to save the reputation of the industry in New South Wales we are prepared to go it alone. If it means that we have to promote and market our beef under our own label we are prepared to do that too. We will co-operate with the industry in New South Wales to the hilt and back it to the hilt. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the position into which responsible State Premiers have been forced by the failure of the Federal Minister for Primary Industry. It is well known-it is a common topic of conversation on the Sydney Stock Exchange-that people are running round with handfuls of Press clippings on the subject from the United States of America. It is highly damaging publicity which must have grave long term consequences for this major exporting industry. </PARA>
<PARA> This incident, celebrated although it has become, was not unprecedented. Several warnings had been received. Allegedly as far back as 1975 there were police investigations of malpractice in meat exporting establishments. Early in 1978 Senator Primmer made quite specific allegations in the Senate which received the brush-off from the then Minister for Primary industry, the present Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair), Mr Nixon's predecessor. In 1979 the Western Australian exporting firm of W. Pope and Co. was charged with falsely labelling export meat and was convicted in February 1980. The Pope racket, which was disturbingly similar in many respects to that which has been exposed in Melbourne in the last few weeks, involved changing labels in a storage room after the Commonwealth inspectors had departed. Diced mutton was put in cartons labelled as diced beef. I said at the time that we were indeed fortunate that the price of mutton was lower than the price of pork because had a firm such as Pope's chosen to put pork instead of mutton in a carton labelled beef, we could have written off the entire Middle East market. The Minister on page 7 of his statement stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Under existing provisions, the maximum penalties for fraudulent activity or breaches in our export meat trade are totally inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA>That is correct. However, it begs the question. They were just as inadequate 18 months ago when W. Pope and Co. was convicted of an equally reprehensible offence. Why did not the Minister take some action at that stage? Why did he not order a proper investigation of the information-not just allegations-given to the Senate more than three years ago by Senator Primmer? Why is the Commonwealth Police Commissioner put in a situation in which he has to admit publicly that the Australian Federal Police have been less than diligent in pursuing these inquiries? The ultimate reponsibility for all of that negligence rests with the Minister for Primary industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Eric Robinson also was sacked. They were all sacked because they were not in the National Country Party. This Prime Minister is a National Country Party toady. That is why Mr Nixon survives in the portfolio and why his predecessor survived in the portfolio for two years longer than he should have, only to be subsequently reinstated to another portfolio-of which he is also making a mess. The statement today, which purported to answer, among other things, the very serious allegations published in the Bulletin of a fortnight ago, was no answer at all. It was not an answer to, nor did it deal in any way with, the information that Senator Primmer gave to the Senate more than three years ago. For example, the Bulletin of 8 September 1981 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bulletin was told by a number of sources that again the police were discouraged from pursuing their investigations by senior civil servants and politicians in Canberra who, ironically, feared the impact the disclosures might have on Australia's meat export trade. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister's statement fails completely to come to grips with that or any other very serious allegation in that article and other articles. Behind the aggressive facade of the Minister lurks a very mediocre politician who has maladministered every portfolio that he has ever held. The Minister's defence, the one given by proxy, for his negligence is, as was stated in the article in the Bulletin, an alleged concern that unfavourable publicity would damage Australia's export trade. He could hardly have received more unfavourable publicity for a major export than has been received in respect of this export in the last few weeks if he had deliberately designed a formula for so doing. If that is his defence he is, by his own standards, a failure at best; or, at worst, he is party to a cover-up in this instance as he was with respect to the Asia Dairy Industries affair. His defence, when given not by proxy but in person, consisted of an attempt to shove all of the blame sideways onto the Australian Federal Police and the Minister responsible for the Australian Federal Police. In an interview on Nationwide on 3 September 1981 Peter Couchman asked Mr Nixon:</PARA>
<PARA> But why was there no investigation? . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Nixon replied:</PARA>
<PARA> Well ask the police, don't ask me. I mean, I don't make judgments on investigations, that's not a matter for me. </PARA>
<PARA> The defence invoked on the Minister's behalf by others is that he was afraid of unfavourable publicity for a major export industry. His defence, put forward personally, is to try to shift the blame sideways. In the same Nationwide interview of 3 September he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . all these references have gone to the police, and the only one that I know of that has been successfully prosecuted was in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite frankly, I do not know anything about the one in Tasmania but I do know that the firm of Pope was prosecuted successfully and fined a paltry $100 in Perth in early 1980. The Minister either is attempting to mislead the public and trivialise the matter in making the statement he made on Nationwide or, I suppose with characteristic negligence and incompetence, is unaware of the successful prosecution that was launched in Perth. In any previous Australian government a Minister in the position that Mr Nixon has been in over the last couple of weeks would have resigned but since a new nadir of ministerial responsibility has been established under the present Prime Minister that course of action is no longer taken. Ministerial responsibility scarcely exists. The final bill for all of this ministerial and prime ministerial negligence and incompetence will be picked up by the thousands of innocent producers of export meat and the processors of export meat-the people who work in the abattoirs-and the honest operators ultimately will regretfully be forced to pick up the cost of this ministerial negligence and irresponsibility. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on the ministerial statement regarding the meat substitution that has concerned all Australians, including this Government, producers and exporters, since 11 August this year, some 26 days ago. I do not propose to talk at length about the comments of the previous speaker, Senator Walsh, because basically they did not revolve around the matters that are dealt with in the statement now before the Senate and which are of great concern to all Australians but in typical form were a personal attack on the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon). That seems to be Senator Walsh's habit and method and if he regards it as a privilege, it is his privilege so to do, but it does very little if anything to solve the problems that confront this Government, the Opposition and the Australian producers and exporters across the board. There has been revealed for the first time an action which is highly and absolutely detrimental to the meat trade within and without Australia. I make the point that to this stage no real and effective problem has been raised by the Government or by the Opposition concerning the standards of Australian primary industry products as they compete in world markets. The Opposition, of course, is the watchdog, we are told, in this circumstance. No problem has been raised by those who are directly concerned, that is, the industry organisations themselves. It has been established that some 0.39 per cent of the meat that has been exported to the United States of America during this year has been adulterated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to understate for one moment the seriousness of the situation. But I certainly want to state and clearly identify the fact that the Government through the Minister himself has accepted the extreme responsibility that lies with the Government and the whole of the industry in re-establishing the sort of confidence that the consuming world has in the products of Australian primary industry and particularly in this case the meat industry. Governments are aware, and this Government is aware, of the seriousness of corruption in the handling of any part of the beef export industry. It is important at this time to establish and to make clear that appropriate and severe action has been taken, and it has been taken, I believe, with considerable speed and responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Governments, producers and exporters have been, through their organisations, aware of the need for strict export controls throughout the history of Australia's contribution to the world meat trade, but today we are confronted with the fact that abuse of export standards has been clearly identified. The purpose of this statement and this debate is to bring clearly before the Australian people the sort of action that the Government is taking in the face of these serious circumstances. Australia's reputation in the world as a researcher and a breeder in the fields of grain, livestock, meat production and fibre production is, I dare say, second to none. Its reputation needs to be quickly re-established. The determination of this Government, as is clearly identifiable in the story in this statement, is to re-establish our reputation which is absolutely essential to so many areas of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a need to intensify greatly the urgency and the comprehensive nature of the handling of the present crisis because markets are built, among many other things, on confidence. We have been confronted in recent years with the loss of very significant markets such as the United Kingdom and the European Economic Community which has meant that Australia has had to re-establish markets in other parts of the world for about 37 per cent of her export trade. We have been able to do that very successfully. One of the main reasons for this success has been the measure of confidence that the consumers of primary products in particular have in Australian produce. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not need to go through the history of this matter but I think it is necessary to realise there has been a quick and logical approach to the problem confronting our great meat industry. Since 11 August horse meat and kangaroo meat adulteration in beef exports to the United States of America has been identified. Even though, as I said earlier, at this stage it relates to only 0.39 per cent of the 161,000 tons that have been exported ever since that time there has been the closest co-operation with the United States authorities-that is essential-in eradicating the possibility of that sort of thing ever again occurring. It is on a realisation that such a possibility has been eradicated that the industry will most quickly be rebuilt. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear and easy to establish that the great mass of industrialists involved in the Australian beef industry-indeed, in any section of primary industry-are honest, effective and efficient operators. It is because there has been a deviation from that sort of honesty that we as a government have found it necessary to impose very quickly the sorts of restrictions, the sorts of penalties and the new provisions concerning meat inspection that will make it, one would hope and expect, virtually impossible for anybody to get around the provisions relating to the establishment of quality in the Australian product. As I mentioned a moment ago, the United States Department of Agriculture has been in very close contact with the Minister. Largely through that contact all but some 14,000 tons of the meat which is impounded in the United States will be released in the immediate future. Indeed, had it not been possible to obtain the release of that massive amount of meat on to the American market there could well have been still further delays in the establishment of the sort of investigation which finally will reveal those who are guilty of actions which I am sure no Australian would condone, now or at any time. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention very briefly some of the penalties that it has been found necessary to impose as a result of the malpractices detected in the meat export trade at this time. The maximum penalties imposed under the Customs Act and the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act for illegal export have been raised from $1,000 to $100,000, or five years imprisonment, or both. A new Meat Export (Penalties) Act will impose a penalty of $100,000, or five years imprisonment, or both. Currently offences of the nature that we are discussing are covered by the Meat Export Control Regulations, which provide for a maximum penalty of only $100, clearly not much more than a gesture. Yet that penalty has applied throughout the reign of various governments and in the full knowledge of relevant organisations. One wonders how that can be so. Apparently those sorts of penalties have imposed sufficient restraint and have been a sufficient deterrent to this time. Clearly, it has been found necessary to increase greatly the penalty. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act is to be amended to enable the penalty for breach of export licence conditions to be increased from $2,000 to a maximum of $100,000, or five years imprisonment, or both. At a later date, further legislation will be introduced to enable the Corporation to suspend an export licence immediately upon finding that prima facie evidence of a breach of export licence conditions exists. I could continue outlining provisions which clearly have been established in haste but which have been established properly to overcome the failure of present deterrents. I do not intend to read from further sections of the statement. I think it is sufficient to say that the exposure of malpractice in the beef export industry-namely, the substitution of kangaroo and horse meat for Australian beef-is something with which Australians, across the board, are thoroughly disgusted. It is something which Australians have required the Minister, the Government and, indeed, all appropriate organisations to rectify with great haste and in co-operation with our customer, the United States, which has been so directly involved and which in fact has brought this matter, as it were, to a head. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there can be no doubt that in well under a month the Minister has made every responsible move possible to establish a water-tight situation. In the final resort, he has decided to establish a royal commission, which must investigate to the absolute, fullest extent, the possibilities of a recurrence of the sort of malpractice that has occurred. The Minister has determined further to appoint an independent consultant to report on the matter, it is hoped, within two months. I believe that the speed with which that sort of report will avail the Government and the industry of information is essential. Whilst a royal commission permits an in-depth investigation to be undertaken, confidence must be regained and conditions must be established to enable this great industry to re-establish its position in the minds of its consumers and its customers around the world, particularly the United States of America. We have witnessed the development of a problem under, I suppose, a legislative and checking system which has been well known to governments, Federal and State, of all political persuasions, and indeed to industry organisations. In spite of all that, the malpractice has arisen and has been exposed. Every responsible measure possible has been adopted by the Minister and the Government to overcome the problem and to re-establish the sort of confidence that the industry and the rest of the community must have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly gives me no great pleasure to stand here this afternoon and recall events of three and a half years ago. I hope that no one in this chamber will think that in any way I am saying 'I told you so', because it is not my intent to adopt that line. However, it is rather interesting to recall now what I said in the adjournment debate on 7 March 1978. I repeat what I said then:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At times I have felt that the matters I intend to raise should not be brought before the Parliament. Indeed, in the short term a certain amount of damage to our meat export industries may be the result of a public discussion of the matters I wish to canvass at this point of time. However, if the situation as it now exists continues, I firmly believe that long term damage will be done to a major rural export industry. Therefore, the short term disadvantages have to be weighed against the long term advantages of cleaning up a gross mess in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I state here and now that the evidence given to me at that stage, irrefutable evidence from an impeccable source, in no way indicated that the substitution of buffalo, kangaroo or horse meat for beef and/or mutton was taking place. The evidence given to me at that time indicated merely that meats that had not passed before a Commonwealth inspector, meats that had not been branded for export, were being substituted for beef and were being placed in boxes marked for export. Further allegations were made about misuse of the export stamp. Since I raised that matter in 1978 it has become patently obvious that the malpractice has developed and has spread on a far wider scale in Victoria than was perceived three years ago. It is interesting to go back to some of the questions that I asked. At page 405 of the Hansard of 7 March 1978, I stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister to disclose whether the following six companies were among those named in the Commonwealth Police report. </PARA>
<PARA>I do wish to take time to go back over the names of those companies. They are contained in Hansard at that page. In effect, there was no reply from the then Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Sinclair, to that question. I said:</PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister: Does the Government intend to initiate further investigations into this matter?</PARA>
<PARA>Again, there was no reply. I asked further:</PARA>
<PARA> Does the Minister intend to start prosecutions on this matter?</PARA>
<PARA>Again, there was no reply. The following day, in answer to a Dorothy Dix question posed in the other place by the honourable member for Mallee, Mr Fisher, the then Minister for Primary Industry produced a copy of a letter from the Commonwealth Police, signed by Acting Chief Superintendent R. H. Gillespie, the officer in charge of the District of Victoria, which in part stated that investigations had been carried out but inquiries were continuing. The letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Enquiries are continuing and when further information comes to hand you will be advised accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA>When I looked back on this I saw that that letter was dated 16 November 1977, some four months before I raised the allegations. It is highly likely that the letter from which the Minister quoted had nothing whatsoever to do with the allegations that I raised four months later. Perhaps I was somewhat remiss in that I did not follow up these matters, but I firmly believe, having given the information I did, that it was then up to the then Minister, his staff, his departmental officials or someone from the Commonwealth Police to contact me and find out what information I could give and perhaps inquire as to the source of my information. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think, as Senator McClelland just mentioned, that it was a responsibility of the Department of Primary Industry to follow up that matter. Another disturbing feature of this matter, on looking back, is that it was the tendency of the then Minister, Mr Sinclair, to speak down to me as if I were some sort of a nincompoop. I might be a nincompoop, but it is obvious that in this case I had the facts. I had the bull by the proverbials-by the horns. In relation to the report from the Commonwealth Police from which the Minister quoted, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the report from the Commonwealth Police specified that inquiries made and surveillance of suspect vehicles had failed to provide sufficient evidence for prosecution and that inquiries were continuing. No further report has been made to my Department by the Commonwealth Police. It would seem that there is no basis now for Senator Primmer's allegations. However, if he has any facts that he wishes to disclose in confidence to either the Commonwealth Police or the Department, of course they would be prepared to follow those allegations further. </PARA>
<PARA>At the latter end of the Minister's reply came a little gem. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Primmer has any other evidence-indeed, if he has any evidence-to justify his complaints, I suggest that he submit it to either my Department or the Commonwealth Police. That might be a more equitable way of settling wild assertions in a fair and just manner. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister's words have come back to haunt him. It is interesting to follow the line of attack by Ministers in this area of Australian industry. On 18 May 1976, relative to the meat industry, I posed the following question:</PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry: In view of the sudden price rise for chopper cattle at auction in Victoria following the small mass slaughter operation in the Goulburn Valley-</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will recall that at that time the backside was out of the meat industry and farmers throughout the length and breadth of the land were being invited, and subsequently did, to take their cattle to slaughter-</PARA>
<PARA>will the Minister ask the Minister for Primary Industry to conduct a royal commission into all aspects of the Australian meat industry?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cotton, in reply, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> No, I will not, but I shall direct the honourable senator's question to the Minister and ask him whether he has anything that he might add which might help the honourable senator's knowledge of the subject. </PARA>
<PARA>The words of the honourable gentleman-whatever he is now-surely have come back to haunt him. At the time of that speech we were not far away from the Estimates committee hearings. As I said earlier, I made certain statements or allegations-call them what you like-relative to the misuse of the Commonwealth stamp. My colleague Senator Walsh raised at the hearing of Estimates Committee D on 5 May 1978 certain questions relative to the application of the Commonwealth export stamp to carcasses and/or export boxes of meat. Senator Walsh said:</PARA>
<PARA> What security provisions apply for a stamped carcass that is going to be boned out? If the carcass is stamped and subsequently boned out, what guarantee is there that the boned-out carcass which is finally bundled up in a box is the same carcass as the one which was intially stamped as being fit for export?</PARA>
<PARA>An officer of the Department, Mr Hart, replied:</PARA>
<PARA> I think it is done by keeping the stamps under control. The stamps are only applied to meat under the direct supervision of an inspector after the meat has been passed as fit for human consumption. The numbers of stamps are known; they are kept under lock and key overnight by the inspection service and reissued the next morning. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a rather strange statement. It is just as well that Mr Hart used the words 'I think' because that is not what has been happening to the export stamps. It is interesting to follow up the report of the Committee of Inquiry to Examine Commonwealth and State Meat Inspection Systems 1980-the Kelly report, as it subsequently became known. Mr Kelly's Committee pointed the finger at many areas of malpractice, or perceived mispractice, in the meat industry. In relation to the question of the export stamp the report had this to say at page 41:</PARA>
<PARA> We were also told that, in many if not all cases, the 'Australia Approved' stamp was provided by works management, and if a new stamp was required, the inspectors obtained it from management. </PARA>
<PARA>The recommendation of the Committee is summed up in four words:</PARA>
<PARA> This practice should cease. </PARA>
<PARA>It is obvious that the Minister and his Department have known since that report came out in January 1980-over 18 months ago-of that report's recommendation and again nothing has been done. Let us look at what has been going on lately. I refer to an interview which took place on the program Nationwide on 3 September 1981. Peter Couchman, the anchorman of that program, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> David Ransom today talked to Doug Hawkins, who's the Victorian President of the Institute of Health Surveyors. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hawkins said:</PARA>
<PARA> The relevant authorities have known for the past two years that horsemeat has been used or-in the human food chain on the way to manufacturers, not necessarily as the result of the actions of the Institute. We have been involved with authorities in the matters and we have knowledge that they have been aware as we have been aware. </PARA>
<PARA>David Ransom then asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Which authorities and exactly what have they known?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hawkins replied:</PARA>
<PARA> Oh the Department of Agriculture have known-that's the Victorian Department of Agriculture and the Health Commission of Victoria. Officers of those departments have known. </PARA>
<PARA>David Ransom posed the question:</PARA>
<PARA> Exactly what action was taken?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hawkins replied:</PARA>
<PARA> Well the shame of it is they haven't been able to do anything about it, because as the law stands in Victoria nothing can be done. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the result of a protracted debate between certain groups of public servants in Victoria, one of whom succeeded in having the Health Act amended in 1978. I will not go further into that. The Nationwide transcript continues:</PARA>
<PARA> David Ransom: Just how widespread has the substitution of horse and kangaroo meat for beef been in this State?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hawkins: Well that's just a matter of conjunction, to be quite honest. We've had several instances of it, we've recently found that perhaps manufacturers have even been canvassing knackeries for the supply of horse and kangaroo meat-mainly horsemeat from knackeries-for use in manufactured goods. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not news in Victoria, either. Ministers have known about that because the Melbourne Age of Wednesday, 6 February carried the headline, 'Police act on meat racket'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The State Government has ordered an urgent police inquiry into the sale of meat which it suspects could be diseased. </PARA>
<PARA> Police have been told that some of the meat, from dead, sick or injured animals, is being sold as small goods in Victorian supermarkets. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry, which was ordered late last year, was kept secret because of fears that it would disrupt meat sales and exports. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a great description of what was going on. The then Minister for Agriculture in Victoria was the honourable member for Warrnambool, the Honourable Ian Smith. Like his Federal counterparts in Canberra, Mr Smith got a little uptight when the Age exposed the story. He did something similar to what Mr Sinclair and the now Sir Robert Cotton did to me a couple of years earlier. In the Melbourne Age of 7 February 1980, it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Smith said yesterday's article in 'The Age' would affect Victorian meat sales. </PARA>
<PARA> 'What makes me cross with your article is that you may have done tens of millions of dollars worth of damage, apart from the rescue operations we have tried to do today, because our export abattoirs today, of course, will come under closer surveillance by countries wanting to import our meat,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA>So, instead of copping it, getting on to his Department and getting legislation through the Parliament to amend the Act and to clean up the racket, Mr Smith goes on record and blames the newspaper that ran the article exposing the malpractice. As I said before, that is very typical of his Federal counterparts in this place; it is exactly the same sort of thing that they have been doing for years. In today's Australian under the heading, 'Man offered car, $4,000. ''Threats and bribes'' used to hush up meat scandal', we read, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> In Perth, Mr Watson-Bates, of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union, said he could remember three occasions on which he had complained of meat substitution but had been told to keep quiet about it. </PARA>
<PARA> He said: 'They (Department of Primary Industry officials) always told me to tone it down because they didn't want unfavourable publicity. </PARA>
<PARA> 'I can understand why they did not want to make these things public, but what I cannot understand is why they never changed the penalties, or tightened security.'</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Watson-Bates said, as far as he knew, there was now no substitution in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> 'But substitution has been going on for at least five years, and the Department knew about it,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA>Statements similar to these made by Mr Watson-Bates have been repeated throughout the length and breadth of the industry. People high up in the trade have been claiming for years that meat substitution has been going on. Regrettably, for reasons best known to themselves, they have not been prepared to name people, times and dates. The meat substitution racket has been common knowledge right throughout the industry. Meat industry barons and departmental people at all levels have known of it. Departmental officers have made reports but nothing has happened. For reasons best known to the people involved, somewhere the system has clagged up. The allegations and the stories have been swept under the carpet. Frankly, I am convinced that the finger should point right at the top of the tree. I make no bones about that whatsoever. It was interesting to read the article by Alan Reid, Sam Lipski and Peter Samuel in the last edition of the Bulletin. That article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Police were given to understand-some individuals then in the force may have been told bluntly-that it should 'go quietly' on inquiries dealing with irregular practices in the meat trade. The Commonwealth feared that publicity, inevitable if prosecutions were launched, might gravely damage Australia's valuable United States export market. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Police, who succeeded the Commonwealth Police, were apparently subjected later to the same discouragement and frustration . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Despite almost monthly reminder letters to the Commonwealth authorities, it was 18 months before they got permission to proceed with the prosecution, which was successful. </PARA>
<PARA>That relates to evidence which the authorities had found and which ultimately led to that prosecution. The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Against this background, it is easy to understand why later informants about irregular practices in the meat export trade were puzzled by the lack of investigative zeal of the police. </PARA>
<PARA>It is also interesting to note that amongst the people who gave evidence to the Commonwealth Police was a Mr Maurice Williams, the Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly for Doncaster in Melbourne. He gave that information to the police in November 1979. Nothing seems to have happened as a result of that. All along the line there has been cover up, cover up and more cover up. In latter day endeavours to do something about the problem, the Minister for Primary Industry has forced the closure of boning rooms in Victoria. It seems as though the innocent are being made to pay for the guilty. The Minister has, in effect, stood the law on its head. He has said: 'Thou shalt be guilty until thou prove thyself innocent'. As I said, the good go down with the bad. Frankly, one of the big problems of the meat industry in Victoria has been the expansion of boning rooms. They have sprung up hither, thither and yon and I guess they are one of the great banes of the lives of inspectors and others who try to keep a watch on the situation. There is no doubt that the bulk of those boning rooms are clean and are doing the job they set out to do without breaking the law. Of course, until the guilty ones are found everybody is under suspicion. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to say too much more at this juncture. The bulk of what I said in 1978 has proved to be true. It is a tragedy that the Government has taken so long to act. In regard to ministerial reponsibility, it is a shame that two Ministers have neglected to take action. It is a shame that the Commonwealth Police may not have been as diligent as they could have been. However, as I said earlier, I heartily concur with what the Reid article in the Bulletin has to say. I believe the finger can be pointed right up at the top of the tree. Actions have been taken to head off, to procrastinate and to sweep under the carpet allegations that have been made. They are more than allegations, they are facts of life. We note now that the Minister proposes to establish a royal commission. I called for a royal commission in 1978. After thinking about this over the last week or two I am somewhat concerned as to whether that is the right way to go about it. Royal commissions tend to drag on and in some ways they can be told what to find out. I hope for the sake of the future of the meat industry in Australia that the people who draw up the terms of reference for any royal commission that might be conducted are not the people who have been hiding the facts about the problems in the meat industry over the last five years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The Australian Democrats welcome at last a statement from the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) in relation to this major industry, certainly a major export industry in my State. Unfortunately, the statement starts out as more a justification than an elucidation of what happened in the actual context of Australia and the meat industry. A great deal of the statement initially directs itself to looking at increased penalties. The Minister obviously feels the necessity for making at least some show in relation to this matter and suggests that heavier penalties equate with tough action on the part of the Government. The unfortunate part about that, of course, if we are looking only at penalties and at increasing them is that they are much more concerned with the cure than with the prevention of the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problem with the meat export industry is not that we can catch the culprits-although we do not seem to have been able to do that very well-or not that we can then take them through the courts and penalise them. Rather, the problem with the industry is that we are in danger of losing important export markets in the United States. The problem does not lie with the culprits at home but much more with the perception of our industry abroad. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's statement then moves on to what else the Government will do, it having increased the penalties. Its next move is to set up a royal commission. In his statement the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Government has decided to set up a royal commission into certain aspects of the meat industry . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Which aspects we are not told-</PARA>
<PARA>including allegations of malpractice in relation to the export of meat and to meat preparation in the State of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>We are then told that the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) will announce the terms of reference later. It is to be hoped that those terms of reference are not the ones which one might be able to infer from the Minister's statement. It is to be hoped that the royal commission will not limit itself to looking at the allegations of malpractice in the meat industry and will not limit itself to the State of Victoria. If either of those things occurs in the terms of reference, then those terms of reference and the royal commission will be a waste of time and will not re-establish our bona fides in the United States meat market. Presumably the Minister-certainly, statements from Senator Scott would seem to indicate this-suggests that the Government has felt that some problems exist in relation to this matter and has decided to move on to yet another step, that is, to engage an independent consultant 'to conduct a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of the revised system for the documentary and physical control of export meat.'</PARA>
<PARA> In 1972, a select committee of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly which looked into the meat industry brought down a report. In 1973 there was a committee of inquiry into joint arrangements for meat inspection in New South Wales. In 1975, the Administrative Review Committee-the Bland report-as part of its brief also looked at the meat inspection process. Also in 1975 there was the working party of State and Commonwealth officers which investigated the feasibility of the integration of meat inspection services in Victoria. In 1977 there was the Western Australian Royal Commission into the Meat Industry. Also in 1977 there was the Booz, Allen, Hamilton report into United States meat inspection arrangements. In 1978 there was the Prices Justification Tribunal report into beef marketing and processing. In 1979 we had an investigation into disease track back methods in cattle. The report of the Australian Bureau of Animal Health, also looked into much the same type of area. In 1980 we had the report of the committee of inquiry to examine Commonwealth and State meat inspection systems. Now in 1981, in the ninth consecutive year of reports, we are told that the Government proposes to have an independent consultant look again into the meat industry. The meat industry does not need any more reports. We have enough reports to export, if we are really interested in that. What we need is some action. We have had nine years of reports, and now we are to have a royal commission and another independent consultant. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer the Senate to the actual report to which I want to make reference. It is the report of the Committee of Inquiry to Examine Commonwealth and State Meat Inspection Systems. This report was brought down in the Senate on 28 February last year. It was still listed on the Notice Paper on 18 September. So much for the interest of the Government in looking into this particular aspect of the meat industry. But let us not be cynical about it. Surely, when that report was brought down, it was not brought down merely to silence yet again the stirrings in the Senate, particularly on the part of Senator Primmer and others, that something ought to be done about this matter. Let us not say that that was the reason for having yet another inquiry. The committee of inquiry was asked to investigate and report to the Minister for Primary Industry on the following matters:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The merits and demerits of the meat inspection system as presently operated by State and Federal bodies;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) whether the present system of meat inspection and administration should be retained and, if so, with or without modification;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) an alternative system if the present meat inspection administration system should not be retained;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the recommended organisational structure and control of an alternative system . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Those people duly went away and did their homework, and they presented a report. The report was tabled in the Senate on 28 February and has sat-in fact, I managed to get a copy of the report covered in dust-where it was laid down ever since. Are we again to see a royal commission and an independent consultant bring forward yet more paper and yet more reports with no action? On the last nine years' worth of reports, I think the conclusion that must be drawn is that we are to have yet more paper but no action. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the Minister's statement leaves aside one crucial element, that is, that the obvious place to start looking into this matter is in the Commonwealth meat inspection service. The fact that substitution took place at all would suggest that there is something wrong with the meat inspection service. We are not talking about intangibles. We are talking about very tangible elements-boxes and boxes and warehouses full of meat. Meat is not the type of thing which can be spirited away and changed around fairly rapidly. If, in fact, it has been changed around, and of course anybody who knows anything about the industry knows-the Minister knew, the reports for nine years have told us so, and this report tells us so again-that the lids from boxes of meat with an 'Australian approved' stamp on them can be removed and simply changed across to another box which has kangaroo meat or another substitute in it. We have known that for nine years, yet there has been no action. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister says in his statement that this matter has been brought to his attention only in recent times. It has not been brought to his attention in recent times. If we want to be factual about the matter, it was brought to his attention on 28 February last year in the report which was tabled in the Senate. How can the Minister then put down a statement which says that this matter has only just come to his attention? If the reports to this chamber are to mean anything, surely they are to mean that the Minister who called for the report actually reads the report. If they do not mean that, why are we being told yet again that we are to have an independent consultant and a royal commission?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting I was referring to the two issues in the statement brought forward by the Minister about which the Australian Democrats are concerned. The first relates to the royal commission and the other to the independent consultant. We certainly hope, given the nine years in which reports have been presented, that this time the Government will take note of the independent consultant. We hope it will also read the report of the committee of inquiry to examine Commonwealth and State meat inspection systems. I believe that report contains the answer to the problems that have arisen and to the dual meat inspection process which has been instrumental in causing at least some of the criminal practices which have occurred in Australia to date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I reiterate that we support quite strongly the appointment of a royal commission, but we hope that the royal commission's terms of reference will be sufficiently broad and all-encompassing so that rather than looking just at Victoria it will look at every State and take note of the problems in every State. We hope the report of the royal commission will concur with the recent report so that some time before the end of this year the Government will bring forward the proposal which is contained in that report, and that is the setting up of a single meat inspection system-the Australian Meat Inspection Service. This will amalgamate the Commonwealth and State inspection systems in such a way as to overcome all those demarcation disputes which have so bedevilled the inquiries and the various inspection services to date. We commend the Government for at last acceding to what I believe are the interests of the meat industry and the people of Australia and setting up a royal commission to inquire into what must be one of the most regrettable incidents in that industry and which, on the face of it if the Government had accepted its own reports, could have been avoided and certainly should have been avoided.

I have been through the Standing Orders of the Senate and I have found no precedent by which I could raise a point of order. I think the circumstances in which this Bill has been introduced are so unprecedented that no Standing Orders committee could ever have imagined that it would become essential to cover such circumstances in a House of Parliament of this type.

I refer to sand mining on Moreton Island. We believe the proper course of action of the Australian Labor Party ought to be to proceed with its amendments in this matter. The Australian Labor Party having brought forward a Bill which is virtually identical to Senator Macklin's Bill with just a few minor changes and which virtually takes the ideas in Senator Macklin's Bill and brings them up again, is conducting one of the most blatant pieces of thuggery and political thieving I have ever struck. It is a compliment to us that the Australian Labor Party is so devoid of ideas that it has to regurgitate Democrat ideas. That is what it amounts to.

<PARA> (a) the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has found that the Ordinance does unduly trespass on the rights and liberties of citizens;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the Minister for the Capital Territory has given an undertaking that the Ordinance will be replaced before Anzac Day 1982; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the Ordinance is selective in its operation, having effect only in relation to Anzac Day marches. </PARA>
<PARA>This is not the first time that I have spoken in this chamber in criticism of the Ordinance I am now seeking to disallow. When the ordinance was first formulated, introduced and implemented, there was an adjournment debate in this place during which my colleague Senator Evans and I spelt out our objections to the whole procedure and our objections to the Ordinance itself. I do not propose to traverse the same ground. But since our first criticisms of this piece of delegated legislation, everything that has happened in connection with it has confirmed my view and the view of the Australian Labor Party that this Ordinance ought never to have been drafted, ought never to have been introduced in the way it was and ought now to be disallowed by this Senate on the grounds that it is unacceptable in terms of the criteria of delegated legislation. It serves no useful purpose and its endorsement by this Senate would be, I believe, a dereliction of duty on the part of this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make clear that this is not the time at which I or, I hope, any other senator will canvass the merits of the various arguments that were put concerning the Ordinance. In other words, the Ordinance which was introduced to prevent a certain group of citizens from participating in the Anzac Day march ought to be considered by the Senate this evening as a piece of legislation. I do not propose here to put the case of the Returned Services League for wanting the Ordinance. I do not believe that is relevant. I do not expect to put the case of the organisation known as Wimmin Against Rape, which was prevented by the Ordinance from participating in the Anzac Day march. Those matters are not at issue. The point of view of Wimmin Against Rape is not at issue and the point of view of the RSL is not at issue. What is at issue is whether this piece of legislation was properly drawn up, whether it was drawn up in accordance with the criteria of delegated legislation, whether it would serve any useful purpose and whether it deserves endorsement by this chamber. I think anyone who is familiar with the Ordinance and events that have occurred subsequently would have to agree with that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate should not endorse this legislation. The Senate should disallow it because it is bad legislation. It is bad in its objectives, it is bad in its effect on the community, its method of preparation was bad, its implementation has been bad and its contents are bad. Let me explain what I mean. The Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Hodgman, had two major objectives when he introduced this legislation. The first objective was to deny the civil liberties of a certain group of citizens; that is, he wished to bring about a special legislative denial of the rights of a group of women who wished to join the Anzac Day march in order to commemorate those women who were victims of rape in war. I think that the objective of denying the rights of people to participate in the Anzac Day ceremony in the way they wished to do is a bad objective. </PARA>
<PARA> But there was another objective which I think was even worse than the first one, and that was to express in legislative form the deeply felt, virulent prejudices of the Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Hodgman, against the whole feminist movement. If that sounds like an exaggerated claim to honourable senators I would ask them to recall the remarks made by the Minister on the radio program AM. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased that the Minister is paying attention to my remarks. The prejudice and the viciousness of Mr Hodgman's attack on the women's movement-indeed, on any women who do not happen to meet his peculiarly narrow and repressive view of what women ought to do-is expressed in this piece of legislation. For that reason, too, I believe that the Senate should disallow it. I do not think that the Senate is here to endorse or to ratify legislation that merely expresses the private prejudices of a Minister against a certain group in the community. I will be very interested to hear what Senator Missen has to say about that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other objectionable aspect of the legislation is that it singled out as a special case a particular public event in the Australian Capital Territory. Our objection to that kind of legislative process was spelt out very competently by my colleague Senator Evans on the occasion I previously referred to. There was never any need to have special legislation to maintain law and order during the Anzac Day march. As Senator Evans pointed out at great length, there is a whole plethora of law and order legislation in this Territory which has been extremely successful in maintaining order at public occasions, such as Anzac Day and the many rallies, marches and public events that occur and have occurred in this Territory for many years, certainly in the period that I have represented it. So the legislation was never necessary. It is a very bad principle to introduce a law to cover a specific event. </PARA>
<PARA> I have outlined the objectives of the legislation with which I take issue. However, there are other objectionable aspects of the Ordinance. One is the way it was prepared. It appeared overnight. There was no proper consultation. The Minister did not consult with members of the locally elected House of Assembly to see what were their views on it. The Minister did not consult with the Federal representatives of the Australian Capital Territory. For example, he did not consult with my colleague from the Australian Capital Territory, Senator Margaret Reid, who at that time I believe, was senator-elect for the Australian Capital Territory. There was no consultation at all. The legislation was simply dreamt up by the Minister as an hysterical response to his views that women were seeking to commemorate Anzac Day in a certain way. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been pointed out in this chamber, the legislation introduced a serious criminal offence with serious criminal penalties for citizens of the Australian Capital Territory by an Executive order. There was no examination of it by an elected body. No opportunity was given for the legislation to be examined by the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee. The proper process of legislating in respect of criminal offences for citizens of my Territory was totally ignored and circumvented. This was absolutely unacceptable. It was really the content of the legislation itself, of course, which was so objectionable. As has been said in this place before, it is broad and vague and imposes impossible tasks on the police who have to implement it. The legislation could be interpreted in any number of ways, thus allowing the opportunity for all kinds of anomalous and unjust treatment of citizens to arise, as I believe has happened. There was never any need for the legislation. The way it was drawn up was objectionable, its objectives are objectionable and its contents are objectionable. </PARA>
<PARA> I must point out at this stage that criticism of the nature and content of this Ordinance certainly has not been restricted to this chamber. I would like to place on record a report that appeared in the Canberra Times of the first trial in the magistrates court of one of my constituents who was charged under this Ordinance. The report in the Canberra Times of 6 August this year states:</PARA>
<PARA> The first prosecution completed against a person arrested during a protest by Women Against Rape at the Anzac Day ceremony ended yesterday with the defendant, Miss Lyn Lenox, acquitted on all three charges. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Dobson, SM, in Canberra Petty Sessions, said he did not have to rule whether the official ceremony had been authorised properly by the RSL, or whether the preconditions had existed for police to order the women not to march; he found, on the evidence, that the prosecution had proved neither a failure to disobey a direction nor that the woman was at the time of her arrest engaging in conduct likely to give offence to persons taking part in the official parade. </PARA>
<PARA> He dismissed also an alternative charge pressed by the prosecution-that Miss Lenox had attempted to disobey a police direction. </PARA>
<PARA> In handing down his decision, Mr Dobson was critical of the framing of the amendments to the Traffic Ordinance made shortly before Anzac Day. </PARA>
<PARA> His sympathy in the case went to the police, he said. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators might recall that I made exactly the same point in an earlier speech. I said that the police were given an impossible task to perform. Mr Dobson confirmed this. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Every time someone wanted to push a wheel-barrow in Canberra, be it uranium protestors, Aborigines, university students or the Women Against Rape, it was the police who had to bear the burden. </PARA>
<PARA> They were not helped by legislation such as he had to consider in this case. If the legislature had wanted to prevent activities such as the women wished to engaged in, it could have done so. He was not the legislature and had to enforce the Ordinance as it was. </PARA>
<PARA> He awarded costs totalling $600 to Miss Lenox. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> In dismissing the alternative charge, Mr Dobson commented the charge might have been sustainable had police asked Miss Lenox what she was intending to do in brushing past them. For all he knew, she might have been going home. </PARA>
<PARA>The magistrate's view of the Ordinance is very clear. It was unfair on the police, it was unable to be implemented and no prosecution in that case could be made. In a second case, a person who was arrested under the Ordinance was given a six months' good behaviour bond by a different magistrate. The magistrate said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . If I was a schoolteacher I'd probably keep you in after school. </PARA>
<PARA>That indicates the degree of seriousness he attached to his consideration of the so-called offence. It is very clear that from the point of view of the magistrates the legislation is insupportable and not the sort of thing the Senate ought to be endorsing. At this stage I repeat my disappointment that the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances did not itself recommend the disallowance. As honourable senators will recall the Senate Standing Committee was critical of the Ordinance and found that it unduly trespassed on personal liberties. </PARA>

I do not believe that the Minister has fulfilled his undertaking to as expeditiously as possible bring in a draft for a new ordinance which would take account of the criticisms of the Committee and of other criticisms. Quite clearly the undertaking has not been fulfilled. We are in a situation where we have a ludicrous Ordinance which most people now agree should never have been introduced.

I believe the whole episode damaged the reputation of the Returned Services League in this Territory. I am sorry for this. I think the RSL is a useful organisation. Certainly in conducting the Anzac Day ceremonies it is undertaking a function which people in the community wish it to do. The Ordinance has caused nothing but trouble. It has been criticised on legal and political grounds. It ought not to stay on the statute books. I remind honourable senators that it was, in effect, only introduced in respect of last Anzac Day.

I find it very hard to understand how the honourable senator could defend this piece of legislation in the light of subsequent remarks by magistrates. I want to speak particularly in my concluding remarks as a Senator for the Australian Capital Territory. We have no self-governing body in the Australian Capital Territory to make laws for the public order and peace and for the well-being of the community. Legislation is made in the Federal Parliament or it is made by the Minister for the Capital Territory acting with executive powers. I think we must take very seriously our role of legislating specifically for the citizens of the Australian Capital Territory. I ask honourable senators to consider whether this Ordinance is in the interests of the Australian Capital Territory; whether it is the sort of legislation that we as a Senate want the people in the Australian Capital Territory to have; and whether we are prepared to defend it. Because if we allow the legislation to go through we ought to be able to defend it. I ask honourable senators to consider their role as legislators specifically as it applies to the Australian Capital Territory. It is widely known of course that the Australian Labor Party believes there ought to be a self-governing body in the Australian Capital Territory. I believe the Australian Democrats endorse our views in this respect. At this stage there is no such body. This Senate has the power to make good laws for the peace and order of the Territory and to disallow bad laws. It is very clear we have this power. It is clear this is not a good law and it is not defensible in any way. It ought to be disallowed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating a motion by Senator Ryan to the effect that the Australian Capital Territory Traffic (Amendment) Ordinance 1981 be disallowed. Firstly, I will deal with one matter raised by Senator Ryan, namely, her claim that the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances found the Ordinance contrary to its principles. How could that be? This bipartisan Committee examined the Ordinance at great length. That included a consideration of a large number of submissions from many people. Also a number of Committee members were interviewed by certain women who had a vital interest in this Ordinance. After lengthy examination the Committee unanimously decided not to move for its disallowance. For Senator Ryan to come in here and say that the Committee found the regulation was contrary to its principles is to mislead the Senate. She referred to some criticism of the Ordinance by members of the Committee. Of course, the Committee considers ordinances in a way which leads members to find criticisms. That is different from finding that the ordinance is contrary to the Committee's principles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Ryan referred to the fact that the Committee obtained from the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman)-at the Committee's request-an undertaking to introduce a code relating to processions in the Australian Capital Territory. This will be introduced before next Anzac Day 1982. On that point I refer Senator Ryan to a statement by Senator Cavanagh on 14 May 1981, page 2047 of Hansard in a debate on the Committee's report. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is of the opinion that there should not be a special law for Anzac Day if there is not one for, say, a Labour Day procession. Why should there be particular laws for particular occasions?</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is a criticism of the Ordinance but not a criticism that suggests that the Ordinance is contrary to the principles of the Committee. Many people, particularly those from other countries, seem to be at a loss as to why Australia commemorates one of the worst military adventures in its history. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently I spoke to a veteran about his opinion of Anzac Day and its meaning. In effect, although he acknowledged that Anzac Day has different meanings for different people, depending on their individual experiences, he told me that he thought its real significance was that it did not commemorate victory, the cessation of war, the glorification of war, the mass extermination of populations, the gruesome and barbaric attacks on civilian populations, particularly women and children, or any of the other frailties of human nature or horrors of war. The Anzac dawn service, with its special remembrance of fallen comrades, the march and the reunions reflected for him only one aspect of war, personal involvement. I believe that if that simple proposition were put to most returned servicemen, they would agree that it was central to their commemoration of Anzac Day. </PARA>
<PARA> I could recite the history of Gallipoli and the reasons for the commemoration of Anzac Day but I say simply that the survivors of Anzac fought to preserve human rights, freedom of thought, freedom of conscience and freedom of religion-sample issues for which, as Australians, they saw it as their duty to fight. Those survivors are entitled, in their way, to remember Anzac Day as best they may. They have certain rights, just as do people who wish to dissent. I have not the slightest doubt that those who commemorate Anzac Day in this way would be among the first to defend the right of people to engage in dissent, provided they did not infringe upon the liberties or rights of others. They might not express it in the words of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In fact, they would be more likely to talk about championing underdogs. Nevertheless, they would argue forcibly in defence of the rights for which they fought. </PARA>
<PARA> However, those who commemorate Anzac Day also have their rights. One is the right to decide whom they will invite to participate in the commemoration. In the past they have chosen to invite widows and children of returned servicemen to wear their husband's or father's medals and join them in the march. In some areas they have chosen to invite selected youth groups to join them. The form of service and march varies from State to State and from town to town. These people are exercising their rights. </PARA>
<PARA> The very core of Anzac Day is personal involvement by returned servicemen and women. Gate-crashing an Anzac Day march may be one way of gaining publicity for a particular issue, but it infringes upon the rights of those who have earned the right to march, and thus is a breach of the universal Declaration of Human Rights. One result of World War II, and an event which followed the signing of the Atlantic Charter, was the development and declaration of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which recognises, that in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the ideal of free human beings enjoying civil and political freedom and freedom from fear and want, can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his civil and political rights as well as his economic, social and cultural rights. In particular, I refer to article 18 of the Covenant, which I might paraphrase as:</PARA>
<PARA> Freedom to manifest ones . . . beliefs may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect . . . the fundamental rights and freedoms of others. </PARA>
<PARA>Article 19 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is qualified by a further provision, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The exercise of the rights-</PARA>
<PARA>The reference is to the rights of freedom of expression and so on-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . may therefore be subject to certain restrictions . . . as . . . are necessary:</PARA>
<PARA> For respect of the rights . . . of others;</PARA>
<PARA> For the protection of national security or of public order . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Since 1942, the Returned Services League has conducted a traditional Anzac Day march in the Australian Capital Territory. Until 1979 that march comprised war veterans and others who formed in the streets and then marched in a parade to the War Memorial to take part in a traditional Anzac Day ceremony. In 1979 a group of women calling themselves Women Against Rape pre-empted the Anzac Day march and ceremony and laid a wreath on the Stone of Remembrance in memory of women raped in war. </PARA>
<PARA> On Anzac Day 1980, a group of women from the same organisation attempted to join the marching veterans, and upon refusing to desist in their attempts were arrested by the Commonwealth Police, who feared a disturbance. They were charged and found guilty before the Court of Petty Sessions but an appeal to the Supreme Court was successful and the convictions were dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA> In April 1981, evidence was received by the President of the RSL that a large number of women would again attempt to join the Anzac Day march, with a view to disrupting it. The Australian Federal Police indicated that in light of this information they wanted powers which would enable them to act quickly in the event of the parade's being subject to disruption. It was decided to amend the Traffic Ordinance. What eventuated was the Ordinance that we are now discussing. New Section 23A created an offence of disturbing or disrupting an Anzac Day parade or an observance or ceremony conducted at or near the Australian War Memorial. </PARA>
<PARA> Here, then, we have clearly a conflict of rights. We know that the result of that Ordinance was the arrest of a number of women from the Women Against Rape organisation. I have no hesitation in saying to the Senate that I have considerable sympathy for the aims of Women Against Rape, but their rights to demonstrate must be balanced against the rights of our returned servicemen and servicewomen to commemorate their personal involvement in Anzac Day with dignity and without disruption. Those who want to exercise their rights to publicise a particular aspect of war or anything else that is not appropriate to Anzac Day and the personal involvement that is central to that day should do so elsewhere. We owe that debt to all who served, and in particular to those who fell in battle and to the widows and children they left behind. I shall be voting to uphold the Ordinance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be supporting the disallowance of the Australian Capital Territory Traffic (Amendment) Ordinance, basically on the ground that we do not believe that, on balance, it is just. We have given consideration to the points that have been put by the Government and believe that certainly they contain substance. What we have here is an example of the unfortunate situation that often arises when people with genuinely held beliefs, beliefs which are considered respectable within the community, come into conflict. I do not intend to go over the issues that arose on Anzac Day in the Australian Capital Territory. I do not believe that they are necessarily pertinent to the issue before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that laws must not only be just but also must be seen to be just. In the circumstances, it is fairly obvious that we have here a specialised law for the commemoration or celebration of a particular day by a particular group of people. An ordinance of this type is not provided for other such days. Therefore, we believe that if such a ordinance is to be brought forward, extremely weighty evidence must be presented as to why such a special exemption should be made. We do not believe that such arguments have been advanced. </PARA>
<PARA> Already there are public order provisions regarding marches and demonstrations. These are adequate in other circumstances and presumably would be adequate in this circumstance. If not, the Government ought to have brought forward a general amendment rather than a specific one, to govern problems involving marches and demonstrations on all occasions, not simply Anzac Day. However, it seems that the Government felt that those public order provisions were adequate at times other than Anzac Day. It did not say why there should be some strengthening of the law to have effect on Anzac Day. One can only assume therefore that the reason for movement on this Ordinance was the failure of prosecutions in relation to events on the preceding Anzac Day when demonstrations of a kind took place. However, if that was the reason the Government brought forward this Ordinance it has failed to achieve its objective. It failed because the prosections which were launched under this Ordinance were not successful and, as Senator Ryan has already pointed out, the Ordinance was criticised by the magistrate who dealt with the prosecutions. In fact, he seemed to be asking in as polite a way as possible: 'What could the Minister have been thinking about when he introduced such a silly ordinance'. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Ordinance was introduced by the Minister, if we may give him the benefit of the doubt, under some considerable pressure by the Returned Services League which was concerned about the good order and management of Anzac Day proceedings, and I believe that is a reasonable type of stance for the RSL to take. However, I do not believe the Government's response to that stance was reasonable. I believe further discussions with the various groups which were involved would have ascertained, as we now know with hindsight, that the women were content to march silently and orderly and that they wished merely to lay wreaths to commemorate what they saw as one aspect of war. We know that now, and we also know that the hullabaloo that went on at the time was a fabrication of various people's excited imagination. </PARA>
<PARA> If there had been further discussion I believe the Ordinance would not have been necessary, the RSL would have been satisfied in its own mind that its march would not be disrupted and the members of Women Against Rape would have been able to march on that day and to make, I believe, a dignified demonstration of their beliefs. I believe in that case public order would have been maintained and the various points that people were attempting to make on that day could have been made in harmony. As it was I think the Government introduced into this sacred day in Australia a highly discordant political note and I believe it is there that the problem really lies. I do not believe anybody enjoyed any part of the episode whatsoever. I think we all regret the episode that occurred. We now know-I think everybody is in agreement with this-that the disruption would not have occurred if there had been further discussions between the parties involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats would like to make two other points about why we oppose this Ordinance; one is of a more general nature and the other of a specific nature. We are extremely concerned about all ordinances governing the Australian Capital Territory. We believe far more consultation should take place with the members of the House of Assembly on all ordinances affecting the Australian Capital Territory. After all, in a democratic society it is the responsibility of those people who are elected to have points of view on matters affecting the people who have elected them. The legislation governing the establishment of the House of Assembly specifically makes the point that the members would be the main democratic reference point for the Minister for the Capital Territory. We believe on this highly sensitive issue the members of the House of Assembly, as the democratically elected representatives of the people of the Australian Capital Territory, ought to have been consulted. The members of the House of Assembly above all are the people who could be presumed to be able to speak for the people of the Australian Capital Territory and not for one particular group in the Australian Capital Territory. I believe time and again ordinances have been brought forward by the Minister without reference to the House of Assembly which have been discovered in fact to run against the views and wishes of the people of the Australian Capital Territory. I am speaking of a democratic principle. I do not worry about whether the House of Assembly in the Australian Capital Territory has a majority of Labor members, Liberals or Democrats. The democratic principle remains the same. The members of the House of Assembly are the people who have been elected by the people of the Australian Capital Territory and those members deserve the democratic consideration of consultation. I believe if they had been consulted in this instance we would not have had this Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> The specific point I wish to make is that the Government itself in various statements does not seem to have any major argument against the removal of this Ordinance and indeed it has suggested it will be bringing forward a new general ordinance before Anzac Day next year. If that is so there is no reason why the Senate ought to allow an ordinance which is going to be changed and with which it does not agree. The Government itself does not agree with this Ordinance. It wishes to change it. This would seem to be an appropriate time for the Senate to express under the regulations governing ordinances that it is of the view that this Ordinance ought not to remain on the books as it has failed in its purpose. It has introduced a discordant note into what is a very important event for all Australians. I believe, in areas such as this, minority viewpoints must not be crushed by the majority. It is a very delicate matter as to how we balance the problems of minority and majority viewpoints. </PARA>
<PARA> As this Ordinance relates to Anzac Day I make this final point. I do not believe there is anybody in this chamber who would doubt that the people who fought and died for Australia, the people who are commemorated on that day, must have questioned when they were in battle or when they were called upon to die whether it was worth while making such a sacrifice. I am sure that they did wonder whether the society they were dying for was worth the effort. I am sure they must have done that. If that was so I believe they placed an additional obligation on us as legislators to make sure that no law goes forward which in any way can be said to make this society a worse place. I believe this regulation does make it a worse place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party is to be commended for bringing this matter forward. I believe the Government itself has already suggested it wishes to dispense with such an ordinance. The Australian Democrats agree with both views and believe the Senate ought to support the disallowance of this regulation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, because I have spoken on three occasions already on this subject which relates to the disallowance of the Traffic (Amendment) Ordinance-on 28 April, 14 May and on 5 June-and also because of the way in which Senator Ryan and Senator Macklin have dealt with the issue tonight I certainly do not propose to go over the whole of the grounds again. If I speak not only with more brevity on this occasion but also with less passion than in the past it is not because I feel any less warmly on this subject but rather because of the obviously debilitated condition of my voice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The basic points, however, that I think need to be made, in some cases recapitulated, which are relevant both to the merits of this Ordinance and to the separate question of what we should now do with the Ordinance are these: In the first place, the Traffic (Amendment) Ordinance of 1981 was promulgated in circumstances which can only be described as those of great and undignified haste on 23 April, just two days before last Anzac Day. The Ordinance, having been thus promulgated, was announced by an unholy trinity of Ministers-Messrs Durack, Newman and Hodgman-that day, without there having been any consultation with the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly as had been consistently recommended, most recently in the 64th report by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and without of course there having been any opportunity for the Ordinance to be subject to the consideration and ultimately disallowance procedures of the chamber. The promulgation of this Ordinance was based, it seems, on the anticipated offensive disturbance of the last Anzac Day procession by some monstrous regiment of boiler-suited Marxist lesbians and, moreover, on the legal belief, which was quite unfounded, that the existing law was not adequate to deal with this awful anticipated situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The legal assumption that the existing law was inadequate to deal with any such disturbance was quite unfounded; so, too, proved to be the factual assumption. It proved to be quite unfounded in practice because the demonstration, such as it was, was peaceful and dignified. It was not calculated to offend and was not likely to offend the sensibilities of anyone except the most choleric, chauvinist, narrow-minded Returned Services League blimp. The facts, such as they were and such as they worked themselves out on Anzac Day, did not stop the Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Hodgman, shooting off his mouth, as Senator Ryan has said, in defence of both the terms of the Ordinance and the 64 arrests that were made under it. He did so on the following Monday, 27 April, in the Canberra Times and on the Australian Broadcasting Commission radio program AM. The Minister did so in a manner which seems to me to have been inaccurate and offensive and which would probably have constituted a contempt of court, calculated to prejudice unfairly the proceedings then pending against the persons arrested and charged. I have raised this matter with the Attorney-General and asked him what, if any, action he proposes to take in relation to Mr Hodgman's performance in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point to come to is the terms of the Ordinance, which are and remain manifestly objectionable. They are provisions which manifestly trespass unduly on the rights and liberties of the subject within the terms of the criteria supposed to be applied by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. They are equally obvious terms which offend even the most relaxed interpretation of the application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which, in emasculated form, Australia is now a party. It is sheer casuistry for Senator Lewis to claim, as he did tonight, that the Regulations and Ordinances Committee made no explicit findings, when it reported to the Senate, that there had been a breach of that Committee's guidelines. The whole thrust of the report, such as it was, which was brought forward to the Senate was that there was no need, in the view of the Committee, to deal with the Ordinance because it would be dealt with anyway. It was to be subsumed in some larger ordinance dealing more appropriately, in some better way, with all processions and demonstrations that take place in the Australian Capital Territory and not singling out the Anzac Day one. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Missen is trying to intrude into this debate, interestingly, only from the comfort of his seat. I have no doubt that his conscience is afflicting him to such an extent that we will not hear from him tonight. Are Senator Missen and those members of the Committee who joined him in this report really claiming that the only thing wrong with the Anzac Day Ordinance is that its terms do not extend to every other kind of procession and demonstration that is held in the Australian Capital Territory? Is that what is wrong with it-that it is really a pretty good Ordinance but it is not far-reaching enough? Of course that is not what he is saying. He is shaking his head because he knows as well as I do that it is a rotten Ordinance in the form in which it is presently drafted; it is over broad, it is vague and it does intrude on the rights and liberties of individual subjects. Senator Missen made it clear implicitly, if not explicitly, in what he had to say on 14 May. Senator Tate made it clear. Senator Cavanagh, whom Senator Lewis quoted very selectively indeed, made it quite clear when he said on page 2047 of Hansard-the page Senator Lewis quoted but further down-the following:</PARA>
<PARA> We have looked at the Ordinance to see whether it complies with out regulations. The question has arisen as to whether the Ordinance is in breach of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I consider that it is. It is our responsibility to point that out, and we are doing so. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cavanagh, not speaking just for himself but speaking obviously on behalf of the Committee, encaptured in a sentence what was clearly the substance of the Committee's reaction. Both he and Senator Tate quite explicitly suggested that it would be inappropriate for the prosecutions to proceed under the circumstances and made explicit recommendations to this effect. Senator Lewis very carefully hedged his remarks and said nothing which could be construed as criticism of the Ordinance, no doubt because with the attitude of Senator Lewis, which we all know about, he undoubtedly manifestly approved of all its terms. Be that as it may, it is clear to my mind-it emerges from the correspondence and what was said in the Parliament-that the Committee made the only finding it could make; that is, even if not expressing it in formal terms, that this was an unsatisfactory Ordinance-it would not have jurisidiction to report at all were this not so-because, on the face of it, it did offend against the terms of the Committee's jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> The reasons for such a reaction, which has been a very widespread one and which does seem to have been acknowledged by the Minister himself, are not hard to find when one looks at the terms of the Ordinance itself. I do not want to repeat the lengthy evaluation of the language of the Ordinance which I gave on a previous occasion. I just want to say one or two things about the most striking aspects of that language. It goes way beyond existing public order law and any existing reasonable regulation of public order law in its prohibition of peaceful expressions of political or moral opinion. I say that it goes beyond any reasonable regulation of these things by virtue of a number of provisions but no one more obviously than that provision in the Ordinance which multiplies subjective discretion upon subjective discretion and penalises behaviour which is in fact at several removes from anything that could be described as behaviour which is offensive to any reasonable objective person concerned, as we all undoubtedly are, to maintain the dignity of occasions such as Anzac Day. </PARA>
<PARA> It is possible under this Ordinance, as the language stands at the moment, to be convicted and fined for an offence if one ignores the direction of a police officer made in circumstances in which a police officer gives a direction believing that it is likely that the person in question will in turn be likely to engage in conduct which in turn is likely to cause offence to some person participating in the parade. So there are three degrees of mere likelihood that have to be satisfied, but this offence can still bite under those circumstances. Of course, the kind of offence that has to be likely to be caused is an offence calculated on a purely subjective scale. There is no objective measure of what a reasonably robust citizen might think offensive. It is enough for these provisions of the Ordinance to bite that any person participating in that Anzac Day parade would in fact be offended even by a quiet and dignified laying of a wreath on a war memorial in remembrance, on that solemn occasion, of those women who have suffered, across the centuries and through the generations of warfare, from the ravages of war. If anyone is chauvinist or insensitive enough to be offended by that kind of thing, it is enough to get the offence running. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ordinance is bad enough on its own specific terms in this respect but it becomes even worse when one contemplates the extension in the range of that Ordinance which follows from the operation of the inchoate offences which are available elsewhere under Australian Capital Territory law. I am talking about the general law which makes it possible for someone to be charged and convicted of the offence of attempting to commit an offence which is illegal somewhere else. The police in the Australian Capital Territory have experienced some difficulties in persuading magistrates that persons ought to be convicted under this Ordinance. They have had some difficulty in establishing evidence. They have now taken to charging people with attempting to breach the Australian Capital Territory Ordinance. We now have a situation where people are being brought before the courts, are being charged and, it seems, are being convicted for the offence of attempting to join a demonstration in defiance of a police direction which is, in turn, based on the policeman's subjective assessment of the likelihood of that particular person offending, subjectively, someone else. It is monstrous for people to be subjected to conviction, with all the obloquy that goes with a conviction recorded against them, particularly when it is a conviction for disrupting-which is the way people interpret it-something as solemn, as crucial and as central to the Australian consciousness as Anzac Day. It is outrageous. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do, for the reasons I will now make clear. The recommendations that the Committee brought back into this chamber must rank among the most timid, gutless and disappointing set of recommendations, set of reactions, that the honourable senator opposite or anyone else on that Committee has ever had the temerity to bring forward. Having noticed that whatever the fate of this Ordinance, persons still technically could be prosecuted under it because the disallowance whenever it occurred would not operate retrospectively, having noticed that the Minister had given his undertaking to get the public law ultimately into shape with a subsequent enactment of a general ordinance and having further noticed that this undertaking was to bring forward such a general ordinance before Anzac Day 1982, giving no further occasion then for the operation of the present Ordinance, the Committee decided to settle for that, as sufficient to discharge its particular obligation. It reported that it would take no further action. In doing so, of course, it did nothing that would embarrass the present Minister, Mr Hodgman. A more worthy case for embarrassment, as I have indicated, I cannot think of. Nonetheless, the Committee gutlessly, timidly, took that particular line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee report contained no recommendation even that the Executive exercise its undoubted powers, its undoubted discretions, to withdraw those prosecutions already launched. As I have indicated, two Labor members of the Committee clearly indicated in this chamber their view that that should happen. The Committee allowed by its report, by its recommendations, to remain on the books with all the credibility that that entails as to the quality of that Ordinance, an ordinance which was manifestly over-broad, manifestly insensitive and manifestly offensive to all the criteria with which the Committee had to deal. I find that an intolerable situation and I hope that the Senate finds likewise. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to go quite simply and quickly through the remaining points I want to make. No doubt those of us who favour this disallowance will be asked what use there is in disallowing an ordinance at this stage since we cannot, technically speaking, remove the basis for the present prosecutions because the law will always remain as it was at the time that the arrests were made. Nonetheless, I support the disallowance of this Ordinance and I hope that the Senate will, too, for the reasons I will now give. First, the disallowance will amount to a clear and unequivocal statement to the Executive that the legislature regards this Ordinance as being indefensible and unjustified. The action of the Senate in doing this tonight should encourage the Executive, as nothing else seems to have, to direct the withdrawal of those particular prosecutions. Secondly, the disallowance will amount to a clear indication to the courts by this Parliament, in the unhappy event that matters do still come before the courts, that it does not believe that this Ordinance ever should have become law. It will amount to an indication to the courts as to the attitude of the most representative assembly in this nation, that this is an unhappy, unattractive law that should not remain on the books. As such, that cannot influence whether or not the courts will in fact find themselves obliged to record a conviction in this case but undoubtedly it will have some impact on the penalty under those particular circumstances which the courts will be minded to apply. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, disallowance of the Ordinance tonight will be a clear demonstration to the Australian community that this Parliament does in fact care about civil liberties, that it does in fact care about protecting the right of peaceful political expression. The absence of a willingness to disallow this Ordinance can be construed only as a profound indifference to the worth that that right should enjoy in the pantheon of Australian values. That is an unhappy state of affairs. Maybe the final point will appeal even to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), who is home in his sick bed. Many people are following rather closely Australia's domestic attitude to human rights. The disallowance of this particular Ordinance will be a demonstration internationally-that is not unimportant in the context of forthcoming international events in this country-that we are not prepared to tolerate manifest infringements of individual liberty and manifest interferences with freedom of expression by vague and over-broad statutory language of this kind. For all those reasons I support the disallowance motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an interesting, if historical debate tonight. It is historical because in fact the Senate is dealing with something which was finally determined by this chamber some months ago. Unfortunately, Senator Evans was not satisfied with the results of the decision then and he wants to fight it again. At that time he was not satisfied with the unanimous recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. At that time he tried to silence his colleague Senator Tate. He was very angry at the opinions which were expressed and the decisions made by Senator Cavanagh, the Deputy Chairman of the Committee who was a Labor member of long standing and who was held in great respect in that Committee. Senator Evans disagreed with the view of Senator Cavanagh and Senator Tate that there should not be a motion for disallowance of this Ordinance. He was very angry at that time. At least he retains his anger to this day. He has contributed one thing of considerable interest tonight. He said that the Senate is the most representative assembly in the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>

I happen to think that it is rather sloppily worded and I do not like it. I am not only looking forward to its being removed from the statute books but also proud of the fact that the Committee of which I am a member has managed to reach agreement with the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) whereby not only will the Ordinance be removed from the statute books but also it will be replaced by something which is much more valuable; namely, an ordinance which sets out in general the rights of the citizen.</PARA></TALK.START>

In my opinion, this is an Ordinance which of course contains some defects. I do not like the way in which it came about. I do not like the way in which it points to Anzac Day alone as a particular instance. In fact, it was with this in mind that the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances negotiated with the Minister and reached the agreement which I think is an excellent one. It is conveyed in the letter which he sent to the Committee and I think it has been read in part to the Senate. He confirms his opinion that it is desirable that there should be a code covering the law relating to parades, processions and assemblies generally in the Australian Capital Territory. This is something which we have not had in the Australian Capital Territory. It is something which I think is highly desirable for the Territory and something which will stand also, I think, as a guide. I hope it might be one which will be followed by some of the states which in recent years have proved to be conspicuously reluctant to give proper consideration to the rights of assembly in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister points out in support of his proposal that attention was drawn to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ratified by Australia on 13 August 1980, article 21 of which expressly refers to the recognition of the right of peaceful assembly. The Minister went on to say in the letter to Senator Lewis, the Chairman of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee:</PARA>
<PARA> I am more than happy to give your Committee an undertaking that it is my intention to give instructions for the preparation of a general Ordinance in effect, setting out a code covering the law relating to parades, processions and assemblies, generally, in the Australian Capital Territory. This will be done as expeditiously as possible, and I further indicate that it is my intention to refer the proposed Ordinance to the House of Assembly and also to your Committee. </PARA>

I do not intend to speak at any length on this regulation. I spoke about it on 14 May 1981, and I stand by what I said then.

On the basis of that arrangement, the Committee decided that it was not appropriate to proceed to seek disallowance of an ordinance, but rather--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What the honourable senator does not know is that in the last four months there have been prosecutions. These cases have been proceeding and some still have not been completed. It is not desirable for any Minister or any member of Parliament-even the honourable senator-to try to influence the course which prosecutions will take. It is important and it is very desirable that those prosecutions should be completed and out of the way before this matter comes before the Parliament as an ordinance which will be, I hope, a desirable one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One would almost think that the Opposition did not want to see this ordinance. I remind the Opposition of an article which was written not very long ago, in April 1981, by Mr Robin Handley. It is entitled 'Assembly Laws and Civil Rights Covenant' and appeared in the Legal Service Bulletin. Let me remind the Senate first that article 21 of the Covenant states:</PARA>
<PARA> The right of peaceful assembly shall be recognised. No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those imposed in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. </PARA>
<PARA>This article was written, of course, before this ordinance came about, and I think it is indicative of what is a sensible attitude towards this situation. Mr Handley states:</PARA>
<PARA> Given its obligations under the International Covenant discussed above, the Federal Government should now initiate a reform of the law of assembly in the ACT, so that the right of assembly expressed in Article 21 is given legal recognition, and an effective remedy for violation of that right is provided in accordance with article 2, para. 3. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Time is short. Article 40 requires that, within one year of the Covenant taking effect, Australia should submit a report on the measures adopted which give effect to the rights recognised by the Covenant, and on progress made in the enjoyment of those rights. </PARA>
<PARA>We will, I think, be in a position to do that. We will have done it in the area where we have jurisdiction-in the Australian Capital Territory. We will have achieved that when this ordinance comes into effect, an ordinance which covers the general rights; an ordinance which does not encompass any longer rights in regard to Anzac Day alone, but one which I think will be fair and just to the people of this community. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that there is a certain amount of small-mindedness on the part of Opposition senators tonight who do not want to see this as a development which is coming. They have, of course, criticised the terms of the original ordinance. Indeed, I think it lacked wisdom. But the Minister has complied with the request of a committee of the Senate to produce a general ordinance which will cover this whole situation. This is in fact the reality and the desirable result which is coming through this exercise. It will do no good to the Senate or to the people of this country to disallow an ordinance which, of course, can have no effect because the undertaking is to have this general ordinance in operation before next Anzac Day. It is only a sort of remnant desire by members, particularly of the Australian Labor Party in the Senate, to try to gain some kudos from disallowing an ordinance which can have no effect in the future.

I also met the ladies who marched. They came to see me, as they saw Senator Lewis. I was impressed by them. I think their actions were misunderstood by a number of people. I do believe that what we will get is an excellent ordinance which will comply with our undertakings under the Covenant and which will give to this country a beacon from the Australian Capital Territory. Senator Ryan represents the Australian Capital Territory. She should be pleased that the Australian Capital Territory may lead the way in Australia in regard to the law of assembly. She should not endeavour to resuscitate an old wound. Rather she should look for the much better solution which the Minister will provide.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I briefly emphasise one or two points which have been so eloquently made by my colleague, Senator Missen who, of course, is one of the leading and genuine advocates of universal human rights in this Parliament and in this country. I think Senator Missen has put the position very well tonight in terms of a situation which will, by the undertaking by the Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Hodgman, be resolved in the next few months. I think one or two points have been totally overlooked by both Senator Ryan and Senator Evans in this regard. There seems to be a vast amount of cynicism on the Opposition benches in regard to the bona fides of the Government in ensuring that there is proper consultation on this legislation. Indeed, it has been well acknowledged by Senator Missen who, as I have said, is a leading advocate of human rights in this regard that the legislation is, in fact, in an advanced state of preparation. The undertaking proposed by Mr Hodgman in the earlier debates is well down the track. It is acknowledged too that when that legislation is finally prepared it will be available for discussion with representatives of the House of Assembly and with the various departments and other bodies which are concerned with this matter. They include the Attorney-General's Department and the police as well as the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances to which Senator Missen referred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Generally speaking, Senator Missen's point has been made very well.

I acknowledge my own concerns in this matter on behalf of the very many thousands of veterans who made their feelings known to me as Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I acknowledge the vast concern expressed to me via the Returned Services League and other ex-service organisations in that fortnight immediately preceding Anzac Day of this year. Whilst it is certainly some months before the 1982 Anzac Day it is clear that if proper consultation on this matter is to occur in the Australian Capital Teritory we should provide the maximum time. Consequently, there is plenty of time before the relevant date in which to achieve that. I can hope only that veterans' organisations along with others will properly express their views on the proposed legislation as it comes forward in due course. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bills being debated divide into three groups. One group, the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1 to 9) 1981, increase by 2 1/2 per cent the tax paid on goods already subject to sales tax. Those Bills became operative on 19 August. Another group, the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) 1981, levy a tax of 2 1/2 per cent on a wide range of goods previously exempt from tax. That legislation is due to become operative on 1 January 1982. The other Bill amends the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act and will impose either higher or new taxes on 29 items and lower taxes on five items. The Government claims that that Bill's purpose is to correct anomalies. The extra $142m tax levied by it is, according to the Government, quite incidental.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These Bills are inflationary, unjust and unnecessary. They are a flagrant breach of a multiplicity of Government pre-election and post-election promises not to move towards a broad-based consumption tax. The Australian Labor Party will vote against all of the Bills at the second reading stage, as we did in the House of Representatives. We sincerely hope that Senator Harradine and the Australian Democrats will join us in ensuring that the Bills are defeated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The mice are squealing. If that does not happen, several options will be considered by the Labor Party during the Committee stage with a view to mitigating the damage and injustice which these Bills will inflict. Some options in this respect have been suggested by Senator Harradine and by the Australian Democrats. At this stage we have a number of reservations and qualifications about Senator Harradine's ingenious proposal and about what we understand to be the Democrats' present position. But we will certainly give further close attention to all these matters before the Committee stage of the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 19 August, on the morning after these Bills were introduced, Bill Hayden announced that the Labor Party would oppose them. From the outset there has been no prevarication and no obfuscation by the ALP. There has been some woolly minded and ill-informed criticism of that decision, the epitomy of which is the ridiculous assertion by Senator Carrick, amongst others, that Labor is trying to reject Supply. There are several clear and qualitative distinctions between rejecting these Bills and rejecting Supply or Appropriation Bills. The most obvious is that Appropriation Bills spend money whereas these Bills seek to raise it. Rejecting Appropriation Bills prevents a government from paying pensions or wages to its employees. Rejecting the present Bills does not. Indeed, the only consequence of rejecting these Bills would be to reduce the Budget domestic surplus to around $1,000m from the estimated $1,500m. The Government does not even need the money which these Bills seek to raise. </PARA>
<PARA> On more than a dozen occasions in the last Parliament Labor opposed and voted against taxation measures in the Senate. The most significant Bills consistently opposed have been those which are now slugging Australian motorists for more than $3 billion a year. The first of these import parity oil pricing Bills was part of the 1978 Budget package. All subsequent Budgets have contained similar Bills and all were opposed by Labor. I note that even Senator Mason voted with Labor in an attempt to reject the brandy excise increase which was part of the 1978 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The distinction between a Budget tax measure and a non-Budget tax measure is specious. There is no qualitative difference between money from one source and money from another. I will expand on this point later. It is correct that no tax measures were actually rejected in the last Parliament. That, however, has not always been the case. A close analogy to the rejection of these Bills is not the blocking of the Appropriation Bills in 1975 but rejection of the Medibank levy in 1974. The Medibank analogy is not perfect. The Senate of 1974 rejected a component of the Medibank program on which Labor had just fought and won the double dissolution election. That action stopped the Labour Government from doing what it had explicitly stated for two years it would do. Rejecting these Bills, on the other hand, would stop the Fraser Government from doing what it has explicitly stated for two years it would not do; that is, move towards a broad-based consumption tax. At no stage has the Labor Party, or to my knowledge anyone else, suggested that rejecting the Medibank levy was tantamount to rejecting Supply. I have nothing but contempt for Liberal-National Country Party hypocrites who assert their permanent right to reject Appropriation Bills whenever they please and the Labor Party's permanent obligation never to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> If I may observe somewhat parenthetically, in discussions about Appropriation Bills it is usually assumed that a rejection of an Appropriation Bill would inevitably lead to a repeat of the events of 1975. I want to lodge one caveat to that. Because a drunken vice-regal megalomaniac, supported by a chief justice conspicuous for facilitating tax dodging and forging company documents-obliged the political right by sacking a Labor government in 1975, it does not necessarily mean that all Governors-General would do the same. In particular, I doubt whether the incumbent, who was once noted as a mealy-mouthed apologist for our intervention in Vietnam, would sack a conservative government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Jessop finds the words offensive, Mr Deputy President, I am quite willing to withdraw them. I doubt, however, whether the incumbent Governor-General would sack a conservative government under the same circumstances. What any future Governor-General might do in similar circumstances remains a matter for speculation. I move now to the Bills. The first point to be noted is that they repudiate a number of pre-election and post-election undertakings. They repudiate specifically in context the assurance that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) gave when he made a major statement in the House on 12 March. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Throughout its consideration of this issue, the Government remained firmly of the view that if a shift towards greater emphasis on indirect taxation were to occur, it should be accompanied by a noticeable reduction in personal income tax. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement was made in the context of a Government denial of any intent to move towards a broadly based consumption tax. The Government has welched not only on that undertaking, but also on the condition attached to any such possible move by the Treasurer at the time. This vary substantial increase in indirect tax revenue and this broadening of the indirect tax base are accompanied, not by a reduction in income tax, but by a massive 22 per cent increase in income tax paid by wage and salary earners and a slightly lower increase in income tax overall. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills are unnecessary. They are inflationary and they are unjust. It seems extraordinary that, at a time when the unemployment rate remains at 5.5 per cent and is, according to the Government's own forecasts, going to go higher this financial year, a government should budget for a domestic surplus in excess of $1.5 billion, a surplus to which these measures will contribute about one-third. Pre-Keynesian primitivism is on the rampage. That extraordinary decision is, of course, based on the Stone Age belief that a contractionary Budget-one which slows down or stops economic growth-will automatically reduce the inflation rate. In some mystical way that has not yet been explained, that belief is reconciled with a forecast in the same Budget Papers that in fact the inflation rate will rise. Indeed, the actual expectation of the Treasury is that it will rise by a good deal more than the 10.75 per cent forecast in the Budget. This is another manifestation of the extraordinary Fraser Government policy of beating inflation through putting up prices. The Budget Papers admit that, as a direct consequence of these Bills, the consumer price index will increase by 0.75 per cent. It ought to be noted that there is a significant degree of statistical trickery underlying that figure. The 0.75 per cent figure quoted is the average increase in prices for this financial year over the average level of prices in the last financial year which can be attributed to the sales tax measures. The more conventional way of measuring the effect of a particular component of inflation is to compare the figures for the June quarters-in this case June 1982 and June 1981. On that basis, these Bills will add 1.1 per cent to the consumer price index. I refer those who doubt that calculation to the fact that in a full year the measures are predicted to raise $892m in revenue and that total expenditure on items contained within the CPI regimen is approximately $80 billion. The former is 1.1 per cent of the latter. That the sales tax Bills are unjust, because like virtually all indirect taxes they have a regressive impact on the distribution of income, is so self-evident that it needs no further elaboration. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, there has been no prevarication by the Labor Party on this issue. The morning after the Budget the party leader announced that Labor would oppose these Bills. We have never wavered from that decision. The position of the Australian Democrats has been somewhat different. I think its dilemma is very largely a function of original mutually exclusive promises to 'keep the bastards honest' and yet not reject money Bills, which, if a government introduced any money or taxation Bill which breached a pre-election undertaking, obviously left its members in the position where they could not honour both undertakings. Senator Chipp sought to explain away the problem on the PM program of 19 August when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> And this proposal of the Labor Party, which unfortunately is knee jerk, I think it hasn't been considered, the implications of it, would take $811m away from consolidated revenue in the rest of the year. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate-I am not accusing Senator Chipp of having done this deliberately-that the correct figure in that context is $550m, not $811m. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Now, I would have thought, and I don't often agree with Mr Fraser, that a government in that situation would find itself it couldn't govern and would regard it virtually as having Supply blocked. </PARA>
<PARA>Two hours later Senator Haines introduced into the Senate a private member's Bill which sought to exempt from taxable income the first $1,000 of interest payments on deposits with building societies and savings banks. She was questioned eight days later on the estimated cost should this Bill be enacted. She was asked, firstly, whether she had an estimate of the cost; secondly, whether that estimate was compatible with another estimate putting the cost at $900m; and, thirdly, whether any measure which reduced government revenue to anything like that extent would constitute messing around with the Budget. She answered two of the three questions on the spot. Firstly, she said that she did not have any idea of what the cost would be; that it had not been costed. She also answered the last question, saying that it would not comprise messing around with the Budget because the Democrats would pursue this proposal through a legislative procedure outside the Budget Bills. I will say a bit more about that later. Later that day she presented to the Senate an estimate of the cost of her Bill, should it become law, of around $800m a year, which was roughly compatible with the $900m figure which had been obtained from another source. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I want to take up here is that it is utterly specious to assert that there is any qualitative difference between a Bill which reduces government revenue and which is associated with the Budget and a Bill which reduces government revenue and which is not associated with the Budget. There is absolutely no qualitative difference. The only relevant factor is the amount of money involved. This Budget contains estimates of revenue from sales taxes and from income taxes. In both cases certain assumptions are built into those estimates-the assumption that these Bills will be passed by the Senate and the assumption that no other amendments to the income tax legislation other than those proposed by the Government will be made. Rejecting the sales tax Bills-the position to which the Labor Party is committed-erodes the sales tax base and to some extent the sales tax rate. The Bill of Senator Haines would erode the income tax base. The cost to revenue of both is near identical and in every other way they should be regarded as identical. To say that there is a qualitative difference because one seeks to amend other legislation which was announced by the Budget and the other just seeks to amend long-standing provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act is utterly specious. </PARA>
<PARA> The strategy of the members of the Australian Democrats in pursuing what they now say to be their objective is equally confused. As I understand it, the members of the Australian Democrats have stated that they propose to tack on requests during the Committee stage of these Bills. They will request that the House of Representatives amend the Bills to delete some of the categories of goods which will be subject to tax if these Bills are passed. In the most extraordinary display of naivety-to take a charitable view-the Democrats have also stated that if the House of Representatives does not accept those requests it will not press its opposition in the Senate to the point of voting against the Bills. In other words, an open-ended invitation has been extended to the Government to treat with contempt the action the Democrats propose to take in the Senate. I observe again in passing that that is no way to keep the bastards honest. However, it may well be that that is not the Democrats' plan at all. In the Sydney Morning Herald of 28 August this matter appears to have been raised by Paul Kelly in an interview with Senator Mason who was then the Acting Leader of the Democrats. Kelly wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Mason said it was possible that 'further options' would be put to the Australian Democratic Senators that would involve outright rejection of some of the Government's sales tax extensions to basic items such as clothing, footwear and building materials. </PARA>
<PARA>What follows is in direct quotes. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> 'We remain interested in trying to put teeth into our objection to the unjust aspects of the sales tax rises,' Senator Mason said. </PARA>
<PARA> Asked if the party would consider rejection of some sales tax rises, Senator Mason said: 'I would regard this as an option and I would propose that we consider it.'</PARA>
<PARA>As far as I know there has been no statement, no claim, by the Australian Democrats that Kelly and the Sydney Morning Herald have misrepresented or misreported its position. This leaves the rest of us in the very confused position of not knowing whether to take seriously what Senator Mason has said on behalf of the Democrats on that occasion or whether to take seriously what has been said by several spokesmen for the Australian Democrats on other occasions. Perhaps Senator Mason will clarify this later in the debate on the second reading. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that the real problem the Australian Democrats face apart from the mutually exclusive promises they had originally given was that when Bill Hayden came out on the morning of 19 August with a very forthright statement that the Australian Labor Party would oppose these Bills, the members of the Australian Democrats did not know quite what to do. They had become accustomed for some time before that to having the limelight and they thought the way to regain the limelight was to adopt what they claim to believe is a high moral position. It is now very clear that if that was their strategy they miscalculated. </PARA>
<PARA> I will make a couple of other observations about the fiscal consequences of the Supply Bills and the conventional wisdom that they are an integral part of the 1983 election strategy of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Liberal Party. The conventional wisdom is that because of the additional revenue raised from these Bills and because they have greatly broadened the sales tax base relatively small percentage increases in sales tax will in the future yield much larger increases in revenue than has been the case in the past and that Mr Fraser is putting away a nest egg which will fund tax cuts in the 1983 Budget prior to the election. That is a reasonable paraphrase of the conventional wisdom. I have no doubt that there is some truth in that hypothesis. I will say a little more about that later. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that what is more important and what has not been said very often concerns what Mr Fraser used to call the secret tax of inflation and what economists call fiscal drag. That is the fact that with unchanged tax schedules and rising money incomes not only does the amount of taxation increase but also the proportion of income paid in tax increases. With money incomes increasing at their present rate that phenomenon which economists call fiscal drag and which the Prime Minister used to call the secret tax of inflation-I have not noticed him calling it that lately-increases real income tax by around $1.5 billion a year. This is not just the money increase in income tax but the real increase in income tax of around $1,500m a year. This is while money incomes continue to rise at present levels and the tax schedules and thresholds remain unindexed. By 1983 there will be a real-not just illusory-$3 billion surplus of potential revenue lying around that the Prime Minister will be able to very generously lop off personal income tax collections and call a tax cut. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the more gullible members of the community, and possibly of the Press, will accept it as being a tax cut. In fact if that should happen of course it will not be a tax cut but merely a reversion to the real level of taxation which applied in the financial year 1980-81. This will be marketed as a tax cut. Notwithstanding that enormous potential which the Prime Minister will have in 1983 to offer of what are, in fact, illusionary tax cuts resulting from fiscal drag-which he used to call the secret tax of inflation-I believe there is some truth in the hypothesis that the Prime Minister identified the substantial broadening of the sales tax base and increasing sales tax rates as something which will supplement and add to the potential to offer fraudulent tax cuts in 1983. The reason I say that is because the whole proposition bears the mark of yet another half-smart, half-shonkey political stunt which came straight off the top of the Prime Minister's head and is comparable to the film tax haven rort which will cost revenue 120 per cent of the cost of making every film that qualifies for the concession. There is also the water conservation and reticulation rort which will cost revenue up to 105 per cent of the money invested in that area and a number of other taxation rorts which include the fuel tank storage rort which the Prime Minister pulled out of the hat prior to the last election. </PARA>
<PARA> I suspect that these measures were inserted in the Budget very close to its presentation even within the last fortnight. As a result of that there is widespread confusion. The Treasurer glibly said in Perth 11 days ago that if anyone had a query about the application and administration of these new taxes he should ring the Australian Taxation Office. The plain fact is that the taxation officers in Perth and, as far as I know everywhere else, cannot answer those questions. They cannot answer those questions because the bureaucracy at its highest levels has not circulated explanatory memoranda to its branches. I am not blaming the bureaucracy for that. The Government has massively complicated the administration of sales tax evidently without making any more staff available to do it and certainly, without its briefing its own officers on how the changes are to be administered. In the Treasurer's Budget Speech he glibly said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to increase by 2 1/2 per cent each of the existing rates of sales tax, effective in relation to goods passing the taxing point after tonight. </PARA>
<PARA>Firms which have both wholesale and retail operations on the same premises are by no means unusual. I refer to firms which handle automotive parts and accessories-a number of building suppliers, for example. In their case, how will the taxing point, to use the Treasurer's phrase, be identified unless a stocktaking is conducted on Budget night or the day after the Budget is brought down? If a stocktaking is required, and I fail to see how anything other than a stocktaking can satisfactorily resolve the question, have any of these wholesaler-retailers operating out of common premises been advised that they will be required to take stock? If not, why not?</PARA>
<PARA> Traders in goods which previously were exempt from sales tax but which now are not exempt must register within 28 days under the provisions of the Sales Tax Assessment Act. Under section 13 of that Act, if they do not do so they will be subject to a mandatory fine of $200 for every day that they remain in breach of the Act. A retail butcher who cuts up a bullock's liver in a shop and then sells it as dog's meat apparently will be liable to pay a sales tax of 17 1/2 per cent on the dog's meat because, in the act of cutting up the liver, he has become a manufacturer of pet food. That is just a sample of the sort of anomaly for which the bureaucracy is ill-prepared because the Fraser Government continues to behave in an erratic and irresponsible way. These Bills are ill-prepared and the bureaucracy and the Government are ill-prepared to administer them. They are unnecessary. Moreover, they will damage the economy in its present state. They are undoubtedly very inflationary. They will have a significantly greater effect on inflation than the Government has formally admitted and they are unjust. For all of these reasons, I sincerely trust that the Australian Democrats, Senator Harradine and even-I say it without much hope-some Liberal or National Country Party members on the other side of the chamber will give these Bills the treatment they deserve and throw them out of the second reading stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating cognately the Sales Tax Amendment Bills. At the outset I observe that a sales tax is a tax on consumption. Unlike income tax it taxes that which is taken from production rather than from a worker's personal contribution to production. Therefore, it encourages saving by discouraging expenditure. Thus a sales tax is one means of encouraging investment and thereby increasing future consumption and rates of growth. The move towards a greater reliance on sales tax is part of the process of reducing tax avoidance and tax evasion. It is much more difficult to avoid paying a turnover tax than it is to get out of paying one's income tax.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The Government, earlier in the year, examined the taxation policy options for Australia. This was partly as a result of a desire to move away from Australia's heavy reliance on direct taxation and small reliance on indirect taxation. The latter is demonstrated clearly if we examine the comparisons by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development of the percentage of tax revenue raised in various countries by way of consumption taxes. I have before me the figures for 1979 in the form of a table which is derived from data in R. Mathews's article 'The Structure of Taxation' in John Wilkes's The Politics of Taxation and I seek leave to incorporate it in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. This comparison of indirect taxation derived by various countries is quite significant. To illustrate briefly, I point out that France derives 23.7 per cent of its tax revenue from consumption taxes and that Australia, at the bottom end of the scale, derives only 6.7 per cent from that source. The impetus for introducing a general indirect tax at this time is the prospect that the tax revenue currently provided by the oil levy will soon begin to diminish. The excise on oil and liquefied petroleum gas made up 8.3 per cent of tax revenue in 1979-80 and is expected to account for 9.9 per cent during 1980-81. As revenue from this source declines, other sources of revenue will have to be found. The alternatives facing the Government are to raise revenue either through a broadly based indirect tax, or by means of an even greater reliance on present sources of tax revenue, in particular personal and corporate income taxes.</PARA></TALK.START>

The income tax option is, less favoured by the Government for the reason that Senator Townley's interjection implies-firstly, its negative impact on incentives to produce and earn income and, secondly, the current level of income tax avoidance and evasion. If there is to be a greater reliance on indirect taxes, it will be necessary to find the tax that is best suited to Australia's political and economic framework. The main requirements for such a tax are that it should raise the required revenue, should be administratively simple and cheap, should keep the economic side effects to a minimum and should be politically acceptable. On the whole, sales tax fits this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to make it clear at the outset that I am not opposed to the principle of indirect taxation through sales tax, that in fact I believe it to be a legitimate avenue for governments to raise revenue. What I am opposed to, and concerned about, is the advice which has been provided to the Government on these latest sales tax increases. One obviously assumes that the Treasury, and perhaps the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and the Department of Industry and Commerce, have competence to examine a proposal, to weigh its pros and cons and then decide whether to recommend that the Government proceed with it. Such departments are supposedly staffed with highly trained experts in the industry policy field. On such assumptions governments take decisions and perform efficiently and smoothly, or so they should. However, it is an assumtion. At times examples arise in which the credibility of such advice is called into question when as a result of a policy option being adopted confusion and dislocation occur. I believe the confusion and dislocation caused by the announcement of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) of increased sales taxes is such an example. It appears to throw doubt upon the apparent research carried out by the departments concerned into the flow on effects of such increases. </PARA>
<PARA> One can easily point to another example of the same thing. We all remember vividly the drastic effects upon the economy and employment of the 25 per cent across-the-board tariff reduction which was introduced by the Whitlam Government. Once again one imagines that such a decision did not come about without departmental study of the consequences. Governments must ensure that the situations do not arise. It must be recognised that policies which have the potential to affect wide sections of the business community must be thoroughly detailed and researched to ensure that any changes resulting are carried out smoothly. It must be recognised that policies affecting wide sections of the business community cannot be formulated on generalised grounds. Recognition must be given to the differing effects upon different businesses and industries and the fact that certain sectors of the economy cannot respond to changes overnight. Industry in Australia is too complex for this to take place. In other words, policies must not be adopted indiscriminately. Discrimination must be the key word and should have been the key word in relation to the present sales tax increases. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Treasurer's announcement last month of the increases I-and I imagine this applies to many of my colleagues-have been inundated with letters and phone calls drawing my attention to areas in which problems have arisen. One of the first to approach me was a pharmaceutical wholesaler in Adelaide. He informed me of the situation which had arisen there whereby some retailers had stated that they would not process invoices that contained the increases until the legislation was passed. This left the wholesaler in a Catch 22 situation; either he charged the new price and was forced to wait a month or more for payment, thus jeopardising his cashflow, or did not add the new rates and on the advice he had at the time would be penalised by the Taxation Office. Further, this wholesaler related how, on his own initiative, he contacted the Taxation Office in Adelaide on Wednesday 19 August to seek information on what products were affected by the new rates. He was informed that such information was not available and it was not known when it would be available. Clearly, this indicates a lack of preparedness on the part of the Taxation Office which in itself caused much confusion to the business community. After taking this matter up with the Treasurer, the Treasurer provided me with a reply which I have shown to the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button). The Treasurer wrote this letter in response to the questions that faced the pharmaceutical wholesaler. I seek leave to have the letter incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA>Treasurer Parliament House Canberra 2600 26 August 1981 Senator D. S. Jessop</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra, ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Jessop I have looked into the matters raised with you by Mr . . ., a pharmaceutical wholesaler, of Goodwood, South Australia, concerning the sales tax increases which I announced in the Budget Speech. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first place I feel that I must emphasise that the sales tax legislation has been, in much the same basic format as it is in today, in operation for more than 50 years. Traditionally, since its introduction in 1930 changes in rates of sales tax have been effected by amending Bills which, when they are passed by Parliament and receive the Royal Assent, operate on and after the day following their introduction into the House of Representatives. Increases in rates of sales tax have never operated retrospectively. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been done deliberately so that market forces operate as normally as possible both before and after an announcement concerning increases and decreases in rates of sales tax. You will appreciate that there would be little chance of market forces operating normally if taxpayers were forewarned of pending increases or decreases in rates of sales tax. You will also appreciate that any forewarning of pending rate changes would undoubtedly adversely affect the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to draw your attention to the changes in rates of sales tax which have occurred since 1961. It was announced in the 1961 Budget Speech on 15 August 1961 that the then existing sales tax rates would be reduced from 8 1/3% to 2 1/2% in respect of a range of household goods and from 40% to 30% in respect of motor vehicles of the non-commercial type. The new rates operated on and after 16 August 1961. The relevant Bills received the Royal Assent on 27 October 1961. </PARA>
<PARA> On 6 February 1962 Bills were introduced which effectively reduced the rates of sales tax on non-commercial motor vehicles from 30 to 22 1/2% and on commercial vehicles from 16 2/3% to 12 1/2%. The new rates operated from 7 February 1962. The Bills received the Royal Assent on 23 March 1962. </PARA>
<PARA> For the 1964 Budget Speech on 11 August 1964 it was announced that the rates of sales tax on non-commercial motor vehicles would be increased from 22 1/2% to 25%. The new rate operated on and after 12 August 1964. The relevant Bills received the Royal Assent on 5 November 1964. </PARA>
<PARA> On 13 August 1968, the then Treasurer announced in his Budget Speech that the general rate of sales (then 12 1/2%) was to be increased to 15%. The general rate of sales tax applied then, as it does now, to a very wide range of goods, including sporting equipment, commercial motor vehicles, toys, novelties, etc. The new rate operated on and after 14 August 1968. The relevant Bills received the Royal Assent on 21 November 1968. </PARA>
<PARA> Rate changes were also announced in the 1970 Budget Speech on 17 August 1970, operative on and after 18 August 1970, and in the 1978 Budget Speech on 15 August 1978, operative on and after 16 August 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned in the Budget Speech in relation to the amending sales tax legislation introduced into the House of Representatives on 18 August, the Government has decided that the existing sales tax rates should be increased by 2 1/2 percentage points, effective from 19 August 1981. In addition, the Government took the opportunity to rectify a number of anomalies and inconsistencies in the sales tax law, also effective from 19 August 1981. The application of the amendments from that date follows the traditional approach that I have instanced. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has, of course, decided to adopt a somewhat different approach in relation to the legislation which will widen the sales tax base by taxing at the rate of 2 1/2% a wide range of goods that are presently exempt, with effect from 1 January 1982. As you know, that range of goods includes clothing, building materials, hand tools, books, packaging materials and certain other goods. In this case we have a situation quite different to that of 'ordinary' changes in sales tax rates and classifications. Bearing in mind the width of the range of goods which will become taxable, the numbers of manufacturers and wholesalers concerned, the arrangements necessary to properly advise manufacturers and wholesalers of their likely sales tax liabilities and the administrative arrangements which the Commissioner of Taxation and taxpayers will need to make, the Government considered it necessary to announce its intentions beforehand. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to Mr . . . complaint about the service he received at the Taxation Office in Adelaide, the Commissioner of Taxation has advised me that one of his officers in Adelaide spoke to Mr . . . on Wednesday, 19 August 1981. He discussed the amendments to the sales tax legislation with Mr . . . . On 19 August 1981 the officer also forwarded to Mr . . . a set of notes, which the Commissioner had had prepared, setting out details of the proposed amendments to the sales tax legislation effective from 19 August 1981. A copy of those notes is enclosed. It goes without saying that these notes were made available to enquirers generally. </PARA>
<PARA> The officer who spoke to Mr . . . was not, of course, in a position to give him any detail of the 1 January 1982 changes, beyond what was said in the statement attached to your Budget Speech. </PARA>
<PARA> It perhaps remains only for me to comment on the practical difficulties that Mr . . . sees in giving effect to the Budget night changes. It will, I think, be apparent from what I have said above that such practical problems as do arise are not unique to the present changes. Taxpayers concerned have had to face them in the past, although the present situation in the Senate is perhaps an additional element. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that taxpayers generally are acting, in the usual way, on the basis that the projected changes will become law as planned, and are charging the increased amounts of sale tax. </PARA>
<PARA> You are right in directing attention to the difficulties that people such as Mr . . . feel they face. That, I think, gives point to my observations in the House this afternoon when I indicated that the Government trusts that all the sales tax legislation will have a speedy passage through the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely (JOHN HOWARD)</PARA>
<PARA> P.S. I should add that there is no question of Mr . . . being liable to a 'fine' by the Taxation Office if, until the legislation passes, he charges the old rate of sales tax. The law would, in fact, give him authority to subsequently recover the increase from his customers, but that would seem more inconvenient than charging now at the increased level. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2G7">Senator JESSOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The letter contains a number of interesting points relating to sales tax generally, and I will mention some of them later. However, on the whole the letter does not address itself in any great detail to the major concern, that is, the Catch 22 situation in which many wholesalers have found themselves. This was only the first indication that I had directly of the confusion and dislocation which was resulting from the Treasurer's announcement. The media carried examples of wider and more national concern about the measure. In an article in the Australian Financial Review of 25 August the Managing Director of Cadbury-Schweppes indicated his concern directly to the Treasurer at a meeting of the Institute of Directors of Australia. In that article Mr Hughes, whose group depends on confectionery and soft drink sales for a massive slice of its revenue, criticised the sudden withdrawal of exemptions from sales tax plus the 2.5 per cent additional increase on consumer items contained in the Budget. The article reported that sales tax on chocolate, confectionery goods and non-returnable containers for soft drinks leapt from zero to 17.5 per cent on Budget day. The article continued:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Hughes said the 17.5 per cent increase on many items on the retail shelf would have a serious impact on consumer spending and would create a real backlash in terms of sales and company profitability. </PARA>
<PARA> 'This ripple effect will be very significant', Mr Hughes said. He challenged Mr Howard to nominate a time and place to sit down and discuss the implications for industry of 'the additional burden'. </PARA>
<PARA>On 29 August the Australian Financial Review reported that the director-general of the Confederation of Australian Industry had sent a letter to the Treasurer expressing his concern. In that article Mr Henderson is reported to have said:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The disruption has been exacerbated because the business community, which is charged with the collection of the tax, was given no notice that such a wide-ranging alteration to the sales tax schedules had been decided upon by the Government and were to be suddenly implemented'. </PARA>
<PARA>An article in the National Times of 30 August highlighted more of the confusion. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> While the Government said it wanted the proposals exposed to public comment before they were introduced, the changes apply from the date of the announcement. </PARA>
<PARA> Many companies are still trying to find out which of their products will be liable for the new tax and how much they will be liable for. </PARA>
<PARA> A distributor of veterinary products and insecticides, which were previously exempt, has found itself with an additional bill of $1 million a year. The company is still trying to work out which, if any, of its products are exempt.</PARA>
<PARA> A yacht charter service, which recently commissioned a new boat at a cost of $1 million, now finds that the boat, nearing completion, is liable for 17.5 per cent sales tax-the builder is seeking to recover $175,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Furniture manufacturers have outstanding orders dating back more than three months. In the absence of transition procedures, the contracts will be subjected to the additional tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Further examples of this confusion appeared subsequently in other articles in the media. Clearly the example of the Adelaide wholesaler that I cited earlier is not isolated; quite the reverse applies in fact. The effect of the changes is causing widespread dislocation on a national basis and one can only assume that such dislocation is costly to the industries concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Further details of the problems being experienced by business because of the proposed increases was provided to me by the Sydney Sales Tax Discussion Group. This group, consisting of specialists from the sales tax field, and a similar group in Melbourne are unique in Australia. They represent the only people with extensive and detailed knowledge of the legislation and its workings in the sales tax area. I have here a letter which was written to me by a member of that group. I seek leave to have the letter incorporated in Hansard. I have shown it to the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Senator D. Jessop,</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra, ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Jessop, I refer to your recent communications with Mr Stephen Bladwell and your Press release of 24 August 1981 in the matter of the sales tax bills presently before Parliament. I make the following comments as a professional advisor in the area of sales tax revenue law. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the businesses with which I am associated in a professional capacity are affected by the proposed retroactive sales tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures are not consistent with equitable revenue law making principles. They are disruptive to business practice. They cause undue speculation and sharp practice. They are not to be confused with anti-avoidance legislation or income tax legislation. The income tax legislation concerns itself with tax on a measure of gain. The sales tax legislation by contrast is concerned with a tax on the day to day dealings in goods. Depending on the point of view, sales tax may be considered a cost of goods sold or at very least an element of the price of goods. Just as cost structures and price must be taken into account in the day to day transactions of a manufacturer or a wholesale merchant, so the incidence of sales tax must be given consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The situations discussed below indicate the unthinking manner by which the proposed amendments are to be given effect. </PARA>
<PARA>To jump through hoops Manufacturers of wholesale merchants with no experience of sales tax who formerly dealt with exempt goods alone are overnight asked to become registered persons for sales tax purposes, familiarise themselves with procedural requirements, re-structure their pricing and make arrangements for the charging of the tax. It is emphasised that all this is required in a time frame which can only be described as instantaneous. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the proposed amendments of course goes to existing sales tax payers as well as new sales tax payers. Perhaps existing sales tax payers are better able to cope. The distinction is a marginal one of degree only. </PARA>
<PARA>Compromise with illegality If taxpayers continue to charge tax at the old rates in the interim period between 19 August 1981 and royal assent, they will have no right of recovery of the additional tax retrospectively imposed. The Commissioner of Taxation will however be entitled to collect tax from those taxpayers at the new rate in respect of sales made in the interim period upon which the old rates of tax have been charged. </PARA>
<PARA> Alternatively, the new rates could be charged in the interim period. However, manufacturers and wholesale merchants who do so are in breach of section 70D of Sales Tax Assessment Act (No. 1) with respect to every invoice issued which, in the interim period, shows the new rates of tax which are not law. The penalty prescribed is up to $200 per breach, i.e. per invoice prepared showing the new rates of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Sales tax payers can only preserve their interests by committing those technical breaches. It is little consolation that the retroactive effect of the proposed legislation will ensure that taxpayers will be required to account for tax on those sales at the new rate. It must surely be poor law that requires business people to trade illegally while the revenue law making process is in hand in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Actual loss Businesses which for many reasons may not have been able to accommodate the new rates of tax as of 19 August 1981 but are geared to the old rates of tax have two choices. </PARA>
<PARA> They either charge tax at the old rate in the certain knowledge that should the bills become law the new rates of tax will be applicable and they will be without right of recovery of the additional tax from their customers. Alternatively, they could suspend all trading operations whilst steps are taken to adjust accounting systems to account for tax at new rates. These new rates of course would not in any case have the force of law. </PARA>
<PARA> The penal sanctions applicable to the adoption of the latter procedure have already been mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, actual loss may extend to all manufactures and wholesale merchants selling through dealers to whom retail prices are recommended. Substantial inventories of pre-printed order forms, brochures and other point of sale materials are typically maintained at considerable expense. These materials will be useless unless overprinted or scrapped in favour of replacement. </PARA>
<PARA>Consequential loss Section 70A does offer protection for sales tax payers who have agreed a price with a customer which includes an amount of tax which is subsequently increased by change in the law. </PARA>
<PARA> It is less than satisfactory to the business community that all firm orders upon which sales tax is incident be subject to arbitrary price changes on account of sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> In markets where price has a strong influence on demand, forward planning may well have been made a nonsense on account of the tax charges where increases in the tax rate or the taxable sale value are substantial. </PARA>
<PARA> The protection of Section 70A is thus not a sufficient safeguard in all situations. It is also deficient with regard to collateral contracts. For example, a person in the business of hiring equipment who may have agreed the rentals with a customer on the basis of prices for equipment which are fixed, is afforded no protection under that section. </PARA>
<PARA> Financial planning for minor or major acquisitions, or capital works projects is immediately disrupted whenever pre-budget orders mature into post budget sales. Proper consideration to pre-existing orders is, after all, characteristically given under income tax provisions relating to investment allowance or depreciation. </PARA>
<PARA>Examples of inequitable impact of budget Even if royal assent were given on 18 August 1981, and the introduction of the legislation thus instantaneous, the following instances would indicate transitional provisions are warranted. </PARA>
<PARA> 1. A soft drink manufacturer invoices his product with delivery. Deliveries are made daily. Trucks are loaded from a manifest derived from customer orders. The paper work for the whole operation is computer produced on the day prior to delivery and actual sale. Where instantaneous changes to the sales tax legislation occur, such a taxpayer must either suspend sales until the necessary system adjustments are made; depart from all existing procedures and policy and deliver without invoicing; or, invoice product at the old rate of tax until the necessary programming changes are made. </PARA>
<PARA> Having adopted the latter course, the company must absorb the tax increase while it fully intends no such result. In the event, the price increases across the range of the company's products amount to 8% to 9% on account of the sales tax. The sales tax component itself has in the case of soft drinks increased by up to 3 times the amount of tax previously payable. </PARA>
<PARA> Three days sales were processed at the old rate of tax prior to adjustment to computer programs. Those adjustments required review of the whole pricing structure, not simply the sales tax calculation. The question of market acceptance of the new prices for different categories of goods was the subject of close consideration during that time. The increase in prices occasioned by the sales tax increase was not necessarily in the exact amount of the increase in sales tax. These decisions are necessarily commercial decisions which require close consideration. They cannot be taken instantaneously. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. A cosmetic manufacturer had on hand on 18 August 1981 brochures prepared for its range of products to be marketed during the coming season. These were purchased at a cost in excess of $25,000. They contain the pre-budget recommended retail prices which are not irrelevant. (The sales tax rise will not be absorbed). </PARA>
<PARA> If adverse buyer reaction is to be avoided, the brochures must be overprinted at a cost which compares with the original cost of the brochures. Alternatively, the brochure is to be scrapped and re-printed. Transitional provisions may have avoided such loss. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. A T.V. rental company finds it's equipment costs increased by approximately $60 per T.V. set and $100 per video cassette recorder. These increases represent an increase of approximately $10 million in the value of equipment to be acquired in the next 5 years. Forward planning in this case was complete for that period. That planning is now meaningless in terms of the increase in sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> In the interim period the company is placed in the position of justifying the increased rentals on the ground of sales tax increases which are not yet law. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. A company engaged in the blending of oils and marketing of oils and greases is affected by the new definition of aids to manufacture and the changes to items 14, 20B, 78B, 107A, 112, 113D, 113E, 113F, 127 of the First Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. As has been the case with other items to the schedule, these changes are unclear as to their practical effect. Item 127 exempts all oils for use for business or industrial purposes other than those for use in connection with the servicing of road vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA> Customers of the company will however be unfamiliar with the new provisions, in many cases they appear to be entitled to exemption, but of course they do not at this stage appreciate the Commissioner's certification requirements. The company is thus placed in the position of charging tax where conditional exemption might properly apply. Customers may resist the sales tax which has not previously been charged in the past and which is not yet law, or demand credit adjustments at future dates. In either case the taxpayer company's administrative effort is unnecessarily increased. Again transitional provisions and exposure to public comment would enable less disruptive introduction of the tax and clarification of provisions which are not incontrovertible. </PARA>
<PARA> I instance the above cases as examples of the inequitable incidents of the new provisions should they become law with retroactive effect. The difficulties obviously extend across the broad range of sales tax payers. Not the least of these is the resistance of persons to whom the tax is charged to pay tax at the new rates. Only retrospectivity and absence of transitional provisions can produce that response. </PARA>
<PARA> Transitional arrangements are clearly warranted. Exposure to public comment in advance of the bills becoming law would also be advantageous. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a senator for Queensland, I would be failing in my duty if I did not make reference to a most serious situation which has arisen in Queensland. I refer to the suggestion that the taxpayers of Queensland have to foot the bill because the Premier of that State has lost a defamation action brought against him by a private citizen. Queensland residents are well aware of what occurred, but for those who do not read Queensland newspapers on a regular basis, I will give a brief outline of some of the relevant events. Mr John Sinclair, who was named Australian of the Year on 1 January 1977 by the Australian newspaper, took court action against the Premier of Queensland for defamation. The alleged defamation occurred after Mr Sinclair was named Australian of the Year. Last Friday the Supreme Court in Queensland found in Mr Sinclair's favour and awarded him $500 damages plus costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The $500 is a relatively small amount, but the court's findings were a significant moral victory for Mr Sinclair. A man of immense fortitude, Mr Sinclair was known before this case as a David not unwilling to take on a Goliath. The result of the court case has publicly boosted that image. The Premier, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, did not become liable to pay only that $500 awarded to Mr Sinclair by the court. The costs for which the Premier became liable are believed to be in the order of $30,000. I suspect that $30,000 is a minute amount to the Premier of Queensland, but I also suspect that the more wealth one has the less one is willing to relinquish any of it. That seems to be the case with Mr Bjelke-Petersen. </PARA>
<PARA> Queensland residents were astonished when it was hinted that Mr Bjelke-Petersen's costs may be paid by the Queensland Government; in other words, by the Queensland taxpayers. The astonishment of Queenslanders, however, soon increased when it became crystal clear that this was indeed planned; namely, that the taxpayers of Queensland are to be liable for the Premier's defamatory statements. Today the message was quite clear. The Courier-Mail, a newspaper which is published in Brisbane, had a headline emblazoning the front page which stated: 'Taxpayers to pay Joh's legal costs'. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Taxpayers will meet the legal costs of the Premier, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, over the John Sinclair defamation case. </PARA>
<PARA>There are many serious consequences if indeed the Queensland Government picks up Mr Bjelke-Petersen's costs. Does this mean that the Premier of Queensland can roam at large and make defamatory statements with impunity, aware that if a successful action is taken against him the taxpayers will pick up the tab? Surely the right of members of parliament to make privileged statements within parliament should not extend beyond parliament. This is the obvious implication of what will happen if the Queensland Governments pays the costs of the Premier of Queensland on this occasion. What rights will private citizens have if members of parliament-more precisely, the Premier of Queensland-can make defamatory statements outside the parliament and have no need to be concerned at any action which may be brought against them? Some peculiar things happen in Queensland but this abuse of Executive power must be regarded as one of the most disturbing actions of the Bjelke-Petersen Government. </PARA>
<PARA> What can be done about this scandal? The Opposition in the Queensland Parliament can protest until the cows come home, but a government with such a thick hide will not be concerned about the Opposition's protestations. But it should not pass unnoticed that the Queensland Government is a coalition of the National Party-the Premier's party-and the Liberal Party. What are the Liberals doing about this move to plunder the Queensland Treasury? Will they fully support the move and all its consequences or are they just too weak-kneed to stand up to Mr Bjelke-Petersen? I suspect that the latter is the case. If Mr Bjelke-Petersen is intent on using the Queensland purse to pay for his defamatory statements made outside the Parliament, there is absolutely nothing that can be done at this stage. He has a tight rein over his National Party members and his Liberal Party coalition members are simply too weak to stand up to him. Nevertheless, whilst nothing can be done at this stage, this action will be remembered for a long time by the Queensland electorate. A government which plunders the public purse to protect a defamatory Premier will eventually have to present itself to an angered electorate. Despite Queensland's malapportioned electorates or, to use the more widely used term, the gerrymander, this action could be the beginning of the end of the Bjelke-Petersen Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, as this is the first time you have been in the Chair when I have spoken in the chamber since your election to that high office I take this opportunity to offer you my personal congratulations on being elected Deputy President of the Senate. I am very pleased to see you in that position. You have served the Senate with distinction over many years, both in the ministry and as the Manager of Opposition Business and Manager of Government Business. I wish you a long and happy tenure of office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I rise tonight to speak again about a matter which I drew to the attention of the Senate on 20 August this year. I lodged a complaint that answers I had received to questions I had placed on notice prior to the winter recess had not been published in the Hansard. I am very pleased to see both Senator Chaney and Senator Guilfoyle in the chamber tonight. They are the people who are responsible for providing the answers to me. I received answers from Senator Chaney in response to questions Nos 759, 760 and 761 which I placed on notice on 13 May. They have not yet appeared in the Hansard. On 20 August I raised the matter of a couple of other questions to which I had received answers which had not appeared in the Hansard. Senator Messner was the Minister in charge of the Senate that evening. I asked him to see whether the answers I had received during the recess could also be incorporated in the next Hansard. I have been very patient. This is the third sitting week since the Parliament resumed. Six weeks or more have gone by since the answers were provided. They are not yet public documents; they have not appeared in the Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Another question I am very concerned about is one I directed to the Treasury. An answer came back from Senator Guilfoyle. I placed a question on notice asking what the cost was of the advertising campaign for the sale of Series 18 Commonwealth Bonds. The answer is a very revealing document. It reveals that the Treasury spent $962,000 on that campaign. As I said, that answer has not yet become a public document because it has not been printed in the Hansard. I will not delay the Senate tonight by reading all the documents. They should have appeared in the Hansard at least on the Wednesday after the Parliament resumed following the winter recess. I seek leave of the Senate to have the four answers incorporated in today's Hansard. If leave is not granted I will have to read them into the Hansard. That might take most of the hour that is available to me to speak in the adjournment debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA> (5) (e) Individuals-A talent fee of $10,000 was paid to Mr Peter Ross for his services for the twelve months commencing 19 December 1980, associated with advertising of Series 18 and 19 and any other Series of Australian Savings Bonds during that period. </PARA>
<PARA> A sum of $1,800 was paid to Bennett Research. </PARA>
<PARA> (6) The advertising campaign for Australian Savings Bonds Series 18 began on 11 December 1980 and ended on 18 March 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> (7) Generally, and in the particular cases of Series 17 and Series 18, advertising campaigns for Australian Savings Bonds have coincided closely with the period during which the particular series is on sale. Australian Savings Bonds Series 18 was on sale for 16 weeks whereas the previous Series 17 was on sale from 21 July 1980 to 20 November 1980, a period of 18 weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> (8) The selection of a newspaper or journal for insertion of an advertisement is based on appropriateness of its reach and cost in terms of objectives for a specific campaign. No minimum circulation figure is set to establish eligibility for consideration for selection, but there is no guarantee that all newspapers of all circulations will be selected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I am a little surprised that Senator Chaney was in some doubt as to whether the answers should appear in Hansard. However, now that leave has been granted they will appear. They are now public documents. I refer particularly to the answer relating to expenditure by the Department of the Treasury which has engaged an advertising company to get people to invest money in bonds. So often we are told by this Government that the economy is in a great state and that it is under the jurisdiction of a good government, and I would have thought the Government would not need to expend $962,000 trying to persuade people to invest money which is guaranteed by the Government. If the Government and the country were in such a good state, people would be flocking to invest their money. We have to spend nearly $1m to persuade these people to invest their money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tomorrow there will appear on the Notice Paper another question of mine seeking information as to what companies have been engaged by Australian National Railways. I use the word 'Railways' although for some reason best known to the Government and the Commissioner of Railways the word 'Railways' has been dropped from the title. If it were not for the locomotive featured in the full-page advertisements we would not know who the advertisement was for and in what organisation the people were being asked to invest their money. We know by the locomotive that it must be the railways. I have a series of questions on tomorrow's Notice Paper asking what company was engaged to insert these advertisements and what it is costing the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt), and in the long term the taxpayers of this country and the users of the railways, to appeal again to the general public to invest their money in Australian National. If the country were in such good heart, as we have so often been led to believe, there would be no need at all to expend these massive amounts of money on advertising to persuade the people with money in this country to invest in Series 17 and Series 18 bonds and in Australian National. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with Senator McLaren in congratulating you, Mr Deputy President, on your appointment to the office you now hold. I do so mainly on behalf of those of us who use the adjournment debate as an effective forum for bringing injustices to light. I hope that when I raise many of these matters you will be honoured to be sitting there listening to me. I have a very complex assignment tonight. Like Senator McLaren, by incorporating documents I will cut considerably the time I take. On the Thursday before Parliament adjourned I spoke very savagely about delays in finalising the allegations of sexual harassment of female carriage cleaners at Sydney metropolitan railway depots. At that time I argued that I had an answer from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) to the effect that on 17 July action would be taken. The fact that nothing had happened, and we were into August, led me to speak very strongly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know Senator Chaney wants to make a contribution on this matter but, to clear the air, I have first of all a letter that I wrote to Mr Viner after that memorable night, in which I drew a comparison between his own physical courage in hobbling around the house with an apparently badly damaged ankle, my own performance at a time when I had a very heavy bout of influenza and the problems of Commissioner Walker. Apparently when the Press mentioned this matter a number of other Conciliation and Arbitration commissioners were worried about whether I was referring to them because the Press did not name Commissioner Walker. To put the matter into its proper perspective, I ask first of all that my follow-up letter to Mr Viner, in which I complimented him on his physical courage, as well as a letter from Mr Viner to me that is a hard-hitting response-if I give it, I have to take it-be incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>28 August 1981</PARA>
<PARA>The Hon. Ian Viner, M.P. </PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Industrial Relations,</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra A.C.T. 2600</PARA>
<PARA>My Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA>Sexual Harassment of Female Carriage Cleaners at Sydney Metropolitan Railway Depots</PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this year I submitted a Question on Notice which sought information on the action taken by Commissioner Walker in investigating this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be recalled that I had to badger your office to speed up a response from the Commissioner. Since the deadline for the Board of Inquiry report to come back to Commissioner Walker was mid-July, I took the opportunity last night in the Senate to make some well chosen words on the continued procrastination of the Commissioner in finalising this matter [vide attached Senate Hansard extract]. </PARA>
<PARA> I have never missed a day from the Senate due to illness since I came in during the mid 1960s, whilst you have shown courage in continuing on with your Ministerial duties despite a serious foot injury. It was in the face of our dual performances that I won't accept the phony illness of Commissioner Walker as a factor in the delays associated with this inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> As a life member of the A.R.U., I am determined to pursue this campaign against Commissioner Walker until he delivers. Unless I get a prompt reply from you, I will give him a serve on the adjournment of the Senate each night of the sittings on the week we resume. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours in anticipation,</PARA>
<PARA>James Anthony Mulvihill, Senator for New South Wales</PARA>
<PARA>8 September 1981 Dear Senator Mulvihill</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 28 August 1981 in which you expressed concern with the action taken by Commissioner Walker regarding the investigation being conducted by a Local Industrial Board established under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that since the tabling of my reply to your question on notice the Local Industrial Board has met on a number of occasions. As I am informed the Board has forwarded its report to Commissioner Walker and the Commissioner will be holding a private conference on 16 September to consider the report. </PARA>
<PARA> While I apologise for the delay in forwarding my reply to your earlier question on notice I am most disturbed at the tenor of the remarks which you made during the adjournment debate on 27 August. They quite unfairly and unjustly reflect not only on the integrity of the Commissioners mentioned but on the Commission as a whole. I would hope that both sides of the Parliament would, when commenting on the Commission and its members, have regard to the heavy responsibility they carry and the difficult and demanding nature of the statutory duty they are required to discharge. </PARA>
<PARA> I have asked Senator Chaney to have my views on this matter recorded in the Senate Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> A copy of this letter has been forwarded to the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely, R. I. VINER Senator J. A. Mulvihill</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second letter states that on 16 September there will be a meeting of the board of reference and the Conciliation Commissioner to consider this matter. My only comment, in a temperate manner, is that this matter started a long time ago. Anyone who knows industrial psychology knows that these things should not be left to fester. It is beyond my comprehension why Commissioner Walker could not have met more quickly to get this matter finalised. I only ask for the same physical and mental standards from the Commissioner as the Minister and I and others in this chamber have demonstrated. I stand by that. If I have to choose between being docile to a conciliation commissioner or to 25,000 members of the Australian Railways Union, New South Wales Branch, there is only one decision I will make. I leave it at that for the time being.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of matters have been raised in the adjournment debate tonight. I wish to respond very briefly, firstly, to Senator McLaren. I am advised that the weekly edition of Hansard for the final week of the session which ended in June is yet to be printed. When that final edition is printed the answers to which the honourable senator referred tonight will appear in it so that, with the incorporation of the answers tonight and their inclusion in Hansard of June, when the final printing is done Senator McLaren's answers will appear in Hansard twice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not sure whether I misheard Senator McLaren, but if I did I apologise. I understood him to be saying that he was very critical of the Wran Government for spending $1m of the taxpayers' money just to get them to vote Labor. If that was the thrust of Senator McLaren's outburst, I congratulate him on his non-partisan approach and I agree with him that it is strange that sometimes taxpayers' money is used for these purposes. If, on the other hand, I misheard him and he was more anxious about investment in bonds and about other investments, whether of the State governments or of the Federal Government, I apologise. A very substantial amount is spent by both State and Federal governments advertising for investment funds. If Senator McLaren peruses the newspapers of those States which are under Labor administrations he will find that of necessity they advertise their semi-government borrowings to attract investment, as indeed we find similar advertisements in non-Labor States and with respect to Commonwealth investments. I believe money that is spent in that way on advertising is a legitimate function of government. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to Senator Mulvihill, I would like to place on the record first an apology. Senator Mulvihill, as he indicated in the Senate on 27 August, did give my office 12 hours notice of the matter he wished to raise. The Honourable Ian Viner did give me advice on the matter Senator Mulvihill wished to raise. In fact I was otherwise engaged but I spoke to Senator Mulvihill later that evening and apologised for not being here for the adjournment debate. That might have prevented some of the misunderstanding which flowed from that adjournment debate. However, Mr Viner has asked me to place on the record in the Senate his concern about the comments which were made about the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. I quote from a letter I received from Mr Viner:</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that since the tabling of the reply-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, an earlier reply to Senator Mulvihill-</PARA>
<PARA> The Local Industrial Board has met on a number of occasions. As I am presently informed the Board has forwarded its report to Commissioner Walker and the Commissioner will be holding a private conference on 16 September to consider the report. </PARA>
<PARA> I am most disturbed at the tenor of the remarks which the Senator has made. They quite unfairly and unjustly reflect not only on the integrity of the Commissioners mentioned but on the Commission as a whole. I would hope that both sides of the Parliament would, when commenting on the Commission and its members, have regard to the heavy responsibility they carry and the difficult and demanding nature of the statutory duty they are required to discharge. </PARA>
<PARA>In fairness to the Commission I wanted that put on the public record. I am sorry that my absence from the Senate on 27 August prevented an earlier reply being put on the public record which would, of course, have eased the concern of Minister Viner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I claim to have been misrepresented by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney). When the Minister reads Hansard tomorrow he will see, perhaps to his consternation, that at no time during my speech tonight did I mention the Wran Labor Government of New South Wales spending $1m of New South Wales taxpayers' money trying to secure re-election. I am certain that Senator Chaney knows that that Government will be re-elected without spending 1c of taxpayers' money.</PARA></TALK.START>
