<PARA>To the Honourable President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the State of Tasmania respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. That the East Devonport Child Care Centre will close early in 1981 unless the application by the Committee of Management for the East Devonport Child Care Centre through the Department of Social Security (Child Care Division) for recurrent expenditure funding is approved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer the Minister to published reports in recent weeks which suggest that the Government is planning to push through the Parliament as much legislation as possible before it loses control of the Senate in July. I refer the Minister to frequent rhetoric in this place from Government Ministers about the role of the Senate as a House of review. Will the Minister give an assurance that proper time will be given for study of and debate on all legislation which comes into the Parliament prior to June? Does he agree that it would be totally against the public interest if the Government used its temporary majority in this place to force through legislation designed to benefit particular friends and vested interests, notably by means of changes to the broadcasting and television legislation and to the two-airline agreement?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, the Australian Labor Party itself will not command the numbers in the Senate, and therefore I take it that the Labor Party will perform according to its numbers. The fact is that the Government has been given a mandate. It will put through the legislation for which it was given a mandate through the ballot box. I have no doubt at all that the Labor Party will co-operate in putting it through. Indeed, from time to time it has said that it would not resist legislation for which the Government had a mandate. As to full time to consider legislation, I am arranging that the Labor Party, through its Whips and through its Leader, will be fully informed, as it has been in recent sessions, of the intentions of the Government. The Labor Party will be invited to work with us to ensure that the whole of the business of the Senate is put through in an orderly fashion. Mr President, Senator Button talks about bringing in legislation for vested interests. The only vested interests that we will legislate for are those for which the ballot box gave a mandate last October and for which last Saturday we were given a renewed mandate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister representing the Minister for Transport inform the Senate whether the Federal Government recently undertook an experiment which proved that private contractors could do road construction work for about one-third less than it would cost with normal day labour supplied by the Department of Main Roads? If so, was it envisaged that the Department of Main Roads also should tender for the work? Again, if this is so, who would be responsible for the final acceptance of a tender? What has been the response of the various State governments to the Federal Government's suggestion that private contractors be allowed to tender for the construction of national roads?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware at this stage of any recent Commonwealth Government studies specifically directed towards comparing the relative costs of undertaking road construction work through private contractors with the cost of day labour forces employed by the State road authorities. It is possible, however, that this issue was touched upon in the context of earlier studies relating to the construction industry. I will follow up this matter for the honourable senator and see whether I can get some further information for her.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I might observe, though, that there seem to be considerable difficulties in seeking to draw generalised conclusions about the relative efficiencies of the two methods. The situation would obviously vary between individual projects and according to the capabilities of individual contractors. It is, however, for this very reason that the Commonwealth Government believes that in order to obtain value for money in road construction competitive forces should apply. Accordingly, the Government has announced its intention to amend the legislation so that grants to the States and the Northern Territory for national roads can be made conditional upon the application of open tender negotiations. It is envisaged that State road authorities would be able to tender for work. However, detailed administrative arrangements have not yet been worked out. The views of the States are that whilst most of them are already making considerable use of contractors on national road works, they would wish to retain the discretion as to the works which would be undertaken by contractors.</PARA>

By way of preface I will say that the Australian Democrats are not at this time bringing into question the desirability of the Pine Gap installation, its uses or relevance to the defence requirements of the United States or Australia. That understood, I ask the Minister: Following allegations of illegal activity in Australia by the CIA through its use of the Nugan Hand Bank, including association with criminals and drug trafficking, has the Government made it plain to the Government of the United States that illegal acts of this kind in Australia cannot be tolerated? If the Government has not taken this action, why has it not done so? When will it do so? Can the Minister give an assurance to the Senate that any such illegal activities by the CIA in Australia will be investigated and treated by our law enforcement agencies in the same way as any other crime? In view of considerable public disquiet that the CIA-controlled installation at Pine Gap may now replace the Nugan Hand Bank as the centre for CIA activities, will the Government consider the case of Radio Free Europe in Munich which some years ago was removed from CIA control and placed under more responsible supervision? Since Pine Gap does operate on Australian soil and our Government is supposed to have some control over it, will the Government discuss with the Government of the United States the desirability of Pine Gap also being removed from the control of the CIA and placed under a more responsible agency?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that the Commonwealth and the Australian Capital Territory are the only jurisdictions in Australia without a government program providing for compensation to the victims of crime. That has been a matter of concern to me since I became Attorney-General. I refer Senator Missen to the statement I issued on 22 August 1979 in which I announced that the Government had approved the preparation of legislation to establish a criminal injuries compensation scheme for the Australian Capital Territory. That legislation was to provide compensation for the type of situation that Senator Missen correctly identifies as existing in the States. The scheme, as approved, will provide that the Commonwealth will be liable to pay amounts up to $7,500 in compensation. That figure was based upon the amounts provided for in other schemes operating at the time. The scheme that I then approved was that where proceedings had taken place the court should determine the amount to be awarded by way of compensation. In other cases the award was to be made by the Registrar of the Supreme Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter has been referred to the Legislative Drafting Division of my Department for the preparation of an ordinance for the ACT. I am advised that that ordinance has reached an advanced stage of preparation, and I am hoping that the legislation will be brought into force later this year. I think I should say that in view of the delay that has occurred I will look again, at the more appropriate time, at the amounts because they may well have changed since 1979. That is the situation in relation to the ACT. The nature of Federal legislation generally is such that the possibility of a victim suffering personal injury from a breach of a Federal law is remote. Therefore, we had not considered the extension of the scheme to Federal law generally. The obvious need was that in the ACT the general criminal laws should deal, as they do in the States, with the likelihood of criminal breaches resulting in injuries. However, as Senator Missen has raised that question again, I will give it further consideration before the ordinance is finalised.</PARA>

<PARA> The Government has, in fact, assisted the industry towards this end by providing a greater degree of certainty and stability through legislative backing for its marketing arrangements and by underwriting returns for prescribed products.

The Government hopes that a new scheme will be agreed upon in time to operate from 1 July this year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator's question has a number of parts. I will have to refer at least part of the question to my colleague the Minister for Health. The question of the imposition of safety standards may in fact require action by some other Ministers. I am advised that there was a reported sevenfold increase in the business of solariums during 1980 and it is expected that there will be a further 100 per cent increase during 1981. So the honourable senator's question is apposite. Manufacturers claim that the ultra violet rays from the machinery used are mainly UV-A with only very little UV-B, and therefore they say that it is safe. There is concern, however, that any UV-B rays present could cause sunburn and eventually could result in skin cancer and could, of course, add to the load of skin cancer which Australia presently carries.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition raises the question of the lack of government planning for the resources boom as a matter of public importance not in a spirit of partisan hostility but rather to draw attention to some aspects of the much discussed resources boom which have been overlooked and which should no longer be overlooked by governments. The energy resource boom is now upon us. It has been talked about for a long time. It has been talked about by Liberal-National Country Party Ministers, firstly, as an alibi for consistent failure to deal with unemployment problems in the Australian manufacturing industry and, secondly, as an alibi for failure to deal with the problems of the manufacturing industry in general. 'Stick to it for a while', the unemployed of Australia are told; nirvana is around the corner and everything will be all right at some undefined period in the future. It is, of course, cold comfort to those people who are unemployed in the metropolitan areas of Australia. There is an awful gap between the dream of the benefits of the resources boom and the actual reality for those who are currently unemployed and for those who hope in the future to be beneficiaries of that resources boom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The resources boom has been talked about in terms of breathless exaggeration by people such as Sir Phillip Lynch reeling off figures of intoxicating magic. He has climbed the ladder of social aspiration from the Stumpy Gully estate to Surfers Paradise's Golden Gate. The resources boom has been talked about by people such as Senator Carrick. According to a recent Press report he has a tendency to add a somewhat rosy gloss to his own National Energy Advisory Committee's interpretation of prospects for proposals such as the Rundle shale oil development project. The resources boom has been talked about by Senator Carrick in terms of the employment multiplier effects of the new mining projects. There is, I would suggest, a touch of euphoria about his references in answers to questions asked by me in the Senate on the beneficial effects of the boom. He said the effects will be 'the employment of families, the creation of societies and neighbourhoods'. What sorts of families, societies and neighbourhoods are being created and will be created as a result of a resources boom? Many questions have to be asked about the implications of resource development. The questions will have to be asked by members on both sides of politics, which accept the benefits of a resources boom. Questions will have to be asked also about the effects on other export industries. So too will questions about the effects on the rural sector in Australia, questions on the effects of the capacity to mobilise capital for other projects of importance to Australian people and questions about effects on the long term consequences for the labour market in Australia. More important are questions about the relationship between State Government and Federal Government responsibilities. The most important question of all is: What is the proper role of a national government in co-ordinating a national plan for resource development?</PARA>
<PARA> Might I suggest that some sort of crude guidelines might be adopted by a national government in planning resource development. First of all, perhaps there should be a national investment strategy. Secondly, there should be a clear decision about how essential services in development areas are to be funded. Thirdly, social planning should be undertaken well ahead of the construction phase. Fourthly, there should be a program to retrieve some of the existing very poor conditions which have been created as a result of resource development. There should be financial contribution perhaps to community needs by the development companies and economic planning to broaden as far as possible the economic base of development areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of a national plan or strategy goes right to the problem of what is the role of a Federal government in relation to these matters. Firstly, one would imagine that the role in terms of the delivery of services to the people might be to see that forces are given some sort of rational direction to ensure that the benefits of resource development are distributed in the national interests, that is, for the benefit of the Austraian people and particularly to ensure that the needs of Australians in those areas which are directly affected are catered for by governments or by the corporations which are the principal beneficiaries of resource development projects. If the needs of the people who are right at the centre of the resource development projects are not looked after, what hope is there in the future for the rest of Australian society? Again I ask: What sorts of neighbourhoods is Senator Carrick talking about when he speaks of the beneficial consequences of resource development in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> The towns and regions in Australia which are, if I may put it his way, at the eye of the storm in relation to resource development, are places such as Gladstone in Queensland, the Latrobe Valley in central Victoria, the Hunter Valley in New South Wales, Portland in western Victoria and the Roxby Downs area in South Australia. Those areas are clearly marked for development and growth as a result of resource projects. At the very heart of the mineral resources boom at present is the central Queensland town of Gladstone. Gladstone has already gone through one boom and it now faces another. It has a population of 27,500. By the end of 1980 more than 62,000 people will be living there. Already Queensland Alumina Ltd is taking 5 million tonnes of bauxite from Weipa each year and shipping out 2.5 million tonnes of aluminium. More than 6 million tonnes of coal a year is being carried by coal loading units from fields at Moura, Blackwater and Gregory. The power house is the biggest in Queensland. Plans have already been announced and schemes now being investigated will accelerate this development. Two smelters are on the drawing boards. There is the Rundle shale oil project, a coke making plant and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> These are all dramatic and very exciting figures for those who are mesmerised by that sort of excitment. But vast wealth will be generated for this country from places such as Gladstone. When one looks at the consequences and the effects of this development on the people of Gladstone there are some important questions to be asked about the role of governments in delivering community services to the people who are at the heart of the whole resources boom question-Australians who are involved in generating that vast wealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the first industrial boom began in Gladstone in the 1960s no contribution at all, either private or government, has been made to the city's infrastructure needs. Ratepayers have had to foot the bill entirely. Average rates in Gladstone have risen by 164 per cent in seven years. They rose by more than 14 per cent last year alone. The city's loan program has trebled in a year to meet sewerage, water and trunk road requirements. Sewerage treatment is at capacity. The water supply is inadequate. Roads are substandard. There is no public transport in Gladstone. Caravan parks are crowded and new ones are filled before construction is finished. In the town of Gladstone there is the development of what is called already a caravan culture. Schools are overcrowded and just under half the city's primary school children are accommodated in classrooms described as non-permanent. As if these problems were not enough, there is a serious and growing threat of pollution. Gladstone has only one welfare officer operating with a tiny budget in a town where there are enormous social problems because of the nature of the work, the environment and the heavy use of alcohol and analgesics. </PARA>
<PARA> Most people are appalled at what is happening in Gladstone, but not the Premier of Queensland. It might be said in the Senate by a subsequent speaker: 'Well, that is a responsibility of the Queensland Government', but the Premier of Queensland does not say that. The Premier of Queensland shrugs off the conditions in Queensland by saying Gladstone 'is a work town, not a play town'. That is the sort of remark which might have been made at the time of William Blake's great hymn during the Industrial Revolution in England. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> And was Jerusalem builded here amongst these dark satanic mills. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what we are doing in Australia towards the end of the twentieth century in places such as Gladstone where vast resources are being generated for this country. Vast wealth is being generated, those are the standards which exist in a town such as that and that is the reaction of the Premier of that State. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sure. The towns of the Latrobe Valley in Victoria are quickly developing symptoms similar to those of Gladstone. The Latrobe Valley is an area which will increasingly become important in terms of resources and particularly brown coal resources. There is a three-year waiting list for housing in the Latrobe Valley. Two out of every five of those waiting for public housing are single parents. There is a shortage of welfare accommodation, high rents are charged, caravan parks are filled to capacity and there is the growing prospect of a water shortage and pollution. The Latrobe Valley, Gladstone and Portland in Victoria are just three of the regional centres which will bear the brunt of the so-called resources boom. Portland has a district community service task force which was set up under the sponsorship of the Victorian Department of Community Welfare Services to assess the impact on Portland of the proposed smelter. This task force has described the housing situation in Portland as one of crisis. I remind the Senate that when the Whitlam Government lost office in 1975 the waiting time for a housing commission home in rural Victoria was down to three months. It is now three years, and the residents of Portland will feel the effects of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Victoria as a State is not alone. It is now receiving only one-seventh of the amount it was allocated six years ago. In the year 1974-75 the States were able to spend three-quarters of their Federal payments on housing programs while the remaining quarter was absorbed by debt payments. Now, however, three-quarters of this money is going into debt repayments. It is not difficult to see why, after unemployment, housing is the most serious social problem in Australia. Its seriousness is worsened in the mining and mineral processing areas such as Gladstone and the Latrobe Valley. This development is being carried out without government planning and without government concern for the residents of these places who are at the eye of the mineral storm. Without concern and planning these problems can be replicated again and again. Surely it is time that some intelligent appraisal was made of the implications of this type of development. </PARA>
<PARA> This development is occuring in non-metropolitan areas of Australia where there are already glaring inequalities with the rest of the country in terms of the provision of education, transport, housing, communication and welfare services. These are all services which are provided by government. That is why I asked at the beginning of my speech: 'What is the role of government, and particular the national Government, in relation to these matters?' I remind the Senate that in the time of the Labor Government from 1972 to 1975 regional growth areas were identified and supported. It may be said by way of criticism in hindsight that perhaps there was a lack of rationale for some of those developments in that they were not natural growth centres. They were growth centres designed, perhaps in an artificial way, to take the heat off the big metropolitan centres of Australia. But all of these places involved in the mineral boom are natural growth centres. They are all suffering, as I have already pointed out, from the inadequacy of government planning. </PARA>
<PARA> At the beginning of my comments I indicated some things which should be done. It can easily be said that these things are the responsibility of the State governments. They are also the responsibility of the Federal Government in terms, as I said earlier, of the wealth generated in places of this kind and in terms of the standards which every Australian is entitled to expect from a government which says it is a government for all the people of Australia. If Ministers in this Government, with their eyes popping out on stalks, are going to talk their heads off about the importance of the resources boom-they are entitled to do that; it is, no doubt, a pleasant pastime-they also have to confront the consequences of a resource boom in terms of its effects on the need for social and environmental planning in Australia in the sort of areas which I have delineated. </PARA>
<PARA> The resources boom will put State governments under increasing pressure to offer incentives to companies but it may not be compatible with the national interest of Australia. The Fraser Government has given almost automatic approval to State borrowings for resource projects. The Government did this 30 years ago with the car industry. Look what has happened to the car industry today. The only way to stop the cycle of competitive bidding among State Premiers is through Federal Government involvement and leadership. This is required to co-ordinate investments and to support infrastructure requirements in these areas. There has been a total lack of planning. The Government cannot have it both ways. It cannot have the benefits of a resource boom and deny responsibility for any dire social consequences for Australians, as I have indicated. As I said, these projects are occurring and will occur in non-metropolitan areas of Australia. I have already mentioned some of the vast inequalities in services which already exist in these areas and which people generally are subjected to outside the capital cities in comparison with those people living in the big cities of Sydney or Melbourne, for example. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, some attempt must be made by government to ameliorate the consequences of these sorts of things which are happening. I suppose that it will again be said by honourable senators opposite that they will wash their hands of these responsibilities because they are the responsibilities of State governments. It is not the responsibility of State governments solely to handle these matters. It is the responsibility of governments which are concerned about the people of Australia and which are particularly concerned about those people who are bearing the vast burden of wealth generation and development in this country. The Labor Party is pledged to reducing these inequalities. Crash programs are needed with national government initiatives to solve some of the problems to which I have referred in some of the areas such as Gladstone, the Latrobe Valley and which will occur shortly in Portland and so on. There should be national co-ordination and leadership with those programs. Only in that way will we stop the sort of dark, satanic mills of the twentieth century developing in this country. Great riches will grow for those who are helping in the development. </PARA>
<PARA> We are pledged to reducing these inequalities. Any government ought to be pledged to reducing these inequalities. The present Government ought to be pledged to reducing these inequalities. That is why we raise the question of the lack of planning in relation to the resources boom. Economists and others are always very happy to talk about the economic implications of the resources boom. They write learned articles about very real problems almost every day of the week. There are very real problems of an economic nature associated with resource development on a huge scale. But enormous social problems have occurred previously. There has been a lack of planning and initiative by governments to ensure that those developments take place in the interests of Australian people not only in terms of wealth generation but also in terms of the interests of people who are living in the towns and areas concerned. Any government ought to be pledged to do something about that. </PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned about the lack of planning which has been displayed to date. We are concerned about the dimensions of what will be necessary in terms of infrastructure development in the future. The sad fact is that the ratio between expenditure on community services and the provision of hardware, as it were-infrastructure development for the mining industry-has been completely turned on its head in the last few years. The percentage being devoted to community service and development, to education, transport, housing and welfare services and so on, has gone down and down. The relative percentage devoted to the building of port facilities, railways and things of those kinds has gone up and up. The beneficiaries of such developments will be found in Japan, the United States of America and the United Kingdom and in the boardrooms of countries all around the world. The development should not be at the expense of the people who live in the remote areas. We commend this matter of public importance to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I would like to tackle this matter of public importance about the claim of the lack of government planning for the resources boom, which has been brought on by Senator Button under five headings. First of all, I will discuss some recent examples of planning which the Western Australian Government has embarked on in conjunction with the Federal Government to illustrate the complete inaccuracy of Senator Button's comments. Secondly, I will make general comments about resource development. Thirdly, I will discuss the Australian Labor Party's policies or lack of policies in this area. Fourthly, I will discuss the Government's policies and, fifthly, I will discuss recent economic and employment data. I draw the Senate's attention to a speech made recently in this place by Senator Puplick. I think it was made in December last year. He illustrated very clearly the totally inept and almost criminal way in which the New South Wales Government is handling resource development in New South Wales. He gave many examples of environmental studies being totally ignored by that Government. To that degree I have to agree with Senator Button that a little more guidance and leadership is needed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to my State of Western Australia. Senator Button correctly identified that the States do have the constitutional rights and powers to develop their own resources. The Commonwealth Government has a large interest in this area. Many people in various government departments in the Commonwealth have an involvement in this area. I suggest that in some cases they have too much involvement because there are many examples of the Federal Government holding up development unnecessarily. The Western Australian Government has many departments and commissions whose job it is to plan ahead. Of course, until some indication is given by a company or government that a certain development is to take place, it is impossible to get down to the details of a planning program. One example is that a series of seminars has been conducted up and down the coast of Western Australia by the State Government in conjunction with the North West Shelf developers where the pipeline is to be sited to bring natural gas to the southern parts of my State. The purpose of these seminars is to allow the people in those towns to appreciate the scale of the project and to allow them to plan for the part they will play in the development of that project. </PARA>
<PARA> During my Senate committee's current inquiry into the alumina and aluminium industries it was demonstrated very clearly to us when we were in Western Australia how necessary it is that the planning is carried out in a proper way. It was demonstrated to us that gas from the Dongara field would not have been available to the people in Perth if the field had not been developed in conjunction with the alumina refinery industry. This means very careful planning on both accounts. Similarly, with the North West Shelf gas, without the enormous energy demands from the aluminium smelters it would not have been economic for that resource to be used by the people of Western Australia. I also point out the work done by the State Government with regard to environment and to the total public participation in the environmental studies. It is almost a requirement now that the companies involved in resources development employ their own environmental consultants. This is happening more and more, which is very pleasing. The State Government employs consultants and has established a very intense and thorough environmental network. I agree with this. I agree that public opinion and public concern are demanding that governments of either colour get more and more involved in environmental matters. I have given some examples. I could give many more where the Commonwealth has co-operated with the Government of Western Australia. In particular, although I do not have time now, I could discuss the involvement between the two governments with regard to employment and training schemes. This has been a major accomplishment and it is a major job because the mineral boom certainly will require many more trained people to take full advantage of it. </PARA>
<PARA> I direct the Senate's attention to a publication by the Department of Industry and Commerce in December 1980. It contains 191 pages of small print, listing the major development projects for the future. If anybody doubts this mineral boom is with us he has only to skim through that publication and he will see the tremendous variety and range of development resources that can be tapped in this country. We do not deny that there are social and economic challenges to be faced with this resources boom; nobody denies that at all. I will demonstrate that the Government is well aware of those problems and is meeting the challenge. There are also challenges to the employers and to the unions, but there are great opportunities. The great mineral resources which will be developed in the 1980s will enhance the prospect of improved standards of living for all our people. They will provide more jobs for young people and an increase in job opportunities for those who choose to join the work force. The funds generated by these great developments will assist the governments to respond to the particular needs of the aged, families, the disabled and others in need. </PARA>
<PARA> It is rather extraordinary that during Senator Button's address-although this debate is really supposed to be about the economic and social effects of resources development-he totally ignored the massive benefits that will flow to the Australian community. If we took the Australian Labor Party's advice, the resources boom in Australia in the 1960s and early 1970s was a disaster for this country. How ridiculous! Its spokesmen might have a hard task in convincing the Government that no benefits arise from the taxes and royalties paid by these giant corporations. The workers who are receiving the high wage levels paid in the mining towns will treat Senator Button's comments with the contempt which they deserve. The contractors who are building and maintaining the mining developments know how the benefits of the natural resources development are being distributed; so do small businessmen who are benefiting from these developments. I can illustrate by stating the position in my own town of Geraldton, which is a relatively small town compared with some of the larger towns of the east coast. That town already is gearing itself to play a major part in the development of the North West Shelf gas field. There are mechanisms by which new jobs are created from mining development, real jobs which are created by encouraging enterprise and the initiative of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> When Senator Button began his address he questioned some of the figures, in particular those Senator Carrick has been citing in this place. I draw his attention to an answer in the Senate Hansard of 30 April 1980 in which Senator Carrick listed many of the projects that he has been talking about and in particular used the names of Mr Manderville and Mr Jensen who conducted a lengthy inquiry into the economic impact of industrial development at Gladstone. At the present time Mr Manderville is conducting an inquiry into the economic impact of the Weipa bauxite mine. These figures were used by Senator Carrick when he gave the multiplier effect of employment development. We on this side of the chamber certainly know what socialists mean by the words 'planning' and 'leadership'. It is not what I understand those words to mean. Senator Button should go to the Pilbara if he questions the amount of resources that companies are providing for the well-being of the people who live in those areas. They are enormous. I can also take him to places in Western Australia where development is taking place and where the companies involved are making a major contribution to the schooling and social life of the people in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the Labor Party's policies, or lack of them, what was the Labor Party's answer to the resources boom of the 1960s? Its answer was to stop almost totally Australia's development. The hopeless policies conceived by the Labor Party stopped mineral exploration in Australia. The overseas enterprises which assisted Australia with the know-how and capital packed up and went home. The Opposition will be aware of Professor Blainey's book The Rush that Never Ended. It could be said that the final chapter in that book could have been written by the Labor Party. That chapter talks about the rush and the ending of that rush. When Senator Button and his colleagues speak about government planning, as I said before, we all know what sort of planning they mean. It ultimately means the total nationalisation of those industries. Such policies are anti-business, anti-foreign investment and anti-mining. They would expand the public sector and increase taxation. There would be no room left in the Australian economy for a resources boom. I suspect that Senator Button does not really mean what he says, so I give him that amount of regard. I understand from Press reports his rather tenuous future representing the State of Victoria. Recently Mr Hayden was kind enough to give the Australian people an idea of what the Labor Party is all about. Two weeks ago Mr Hayden made a particularly interesting speech at the Hilton Hotel in Sydney. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . re-affirm the ALP's steady and unflinching commitment to democratic socialism. </PARA>
<PARA>Does anyone believe we would be entering the 80s with such confidence if the country had been governed by such socialistic doctrines over the last five years? Who would have been prepared to invest when private enterprise was held in such low esteem by the Government, when its economy was riddled with inflation and its deficit soared out of control? It took Bill Hayden and two other ALP Treasurers just three years to wreak havoc on the Australian economy. Yet the same sort of prescription for economic disaster continues to emerge from the ALP policies. I refer again to Mr Hayden's use of the term 'socialistic planning'. I suggest that the Australian Labor Party cannot plan for three months let alone a decade. Mr Hayden said on 19 August:</PARA>
<PARA> Retail sales are flat, production has been pretty disastrous, motor car sales have been dreadful, unemployment is starting to climb again and inflation is taking off . . . I would argue that it will be in excess of 12 per cent by the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA>We all know what inflation was at the end of the year. In fact, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) said today in the other place that figures for the September quarter of 1980 indicate that private sector investment was no less than 36.7 per cent above the level of the December quarter of 1979. Furthermore, the Treasurer continued today:</PARA>
<PARA> The investment from the private sector in capital expenditure for the December quarter shows a continuation of that same strong growth. </PARA>
<PARA>Just as the Opposition was writing-down the economy, strong growth was under way. The figures cited by the Treasurer are the latest in a long line of statistics which indicate with increasing strength the pace and momentum of the economic recovery taking place in Australia at present. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to speak now about government policies in this area. It is recognised that Australia is on the threshold of the greatest development the country has ever seen. It is also recognised by people in this country and in other countries that Australia, because of its relatively cheap energy resources -we have been kindly treated in that regard -and in order to make a contribution to its own welfare and particularly to countries which lack these resources, has an obligation to develop these resources at a reasonable rate. The Fraser Government has dramatically changed Australia's economic prospects. The Government has been determined to create real jobs and to restore business and consumer confidence. The Government has done this in four particular ways: By fighting inflation; by restraining government expenditure; by encouraging wage restraint; and by taxation reform. </PARA>
<PARA> A survey released recently by the Department of Industry and Commerce indicated that 306 projects were committed or were at the final feasibility stage in the manufacturing and mining industries. This represents a total investment of over $33 billion. This latest survey doubles the level of projected investment identified in October 1979. Honourable senators will remember that in the 1977 election the Government stated that some $6 billion worth of investment projects were planned in Australia. We heard a chorus from Opposition members to 'show us the list'. I have already referred to part of that list in the publication produced in December 1980 by the Department of Industry and Commerce. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently there has been a flood of encouraging economic data. I have cited some. The Opposition, which has been bitterly critical of our policies, has been forced at last to admit to the improved outlook for the economy of Australia. The labour market has shown consistent improvement over the last two years. Almost 170,000 new jobs were created in 1980; some 70 per cent of this increase related to full time jobs. There has been a total increase of almost 300,000 jobs in the last two years. The labour market has been more receptive to school leavers. Junior unemployment rates were lower in 1980 than in previous years. The latest figures show that the number of teenagers looking for full time employment is 12,500 below the level for January 1980. Unfilled vacancies have increased substantially over 1980. As more people are seeking work and as the participation rate is the highest for four years the fall in the unemployment rate is not as dramatic as the growth in jobs might indicate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is optimistic that its continuing youth employment and training initiatives will progressively enable increasing numbers of young people to improve their job prospects. I have proved to the Senate that the Government is participating fully in the resource development of Australia. I mentioned before that the States have the constitutional power and the resources to steer this resource development but that the Commonwealth is playing its part where it feels there is a need. I suggest that in some areas the Commonwealth is overzealous in the job it does with regard to exercising control over resource development and that the States, particularly my own State of Western Australia, are well equipped to handle this problem. We do not deny that there are problems but I strongly suggest that the States and the Commonwealth is well equipped to handle them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the matter of public importance proposed by Senator Button concerning the lack of government planning for the resources boom. The Australian Democrats support the thrust of the discussion. I compliment Senator Button on his speech. He dwelt on the social and economic conditions manifest in various parts of Australia because of the lack of planning in the so-called resources boom. I support his comments. Senator Button canvassed the boom town of Gladstone and pictured the economic and social consequences of the lack of planning already manifest in that town. He also described conditions in the Latrobe Valley, which I too have visited, in which caravan parks and caravan towns are sprouting up without the ancillary back up facilities of education, health and social welfare. This spells tragedy for future generations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button touched on the town of Portland. To develop on that, one sees this beautiful little country town into which a multinational, Alcoa of Australia Ltd, is about to descend to create a multibillion dollar complex. It will spray the town with fluoride and impact an environmental crisis upon it. Alcoa will do that assisted by the Victorian Government which is massively subsidising this impoverished multinational. I will speak more of that in a moment. Senator Thomas responded to Senator Button's speech. Apart from the fact that his speech was in good humour and contained no abuse, just as one would expect from the thoroughly decent man that he is, it did not enlighten me as to the justification for the Government's policies. He spoke of massive benefits to the Australian people out of the resources boom. This catch phrase which is being taken up by members of the Government was initiated by Mr Fraser and seconded by Mr Anthony. They said that this resources boom will give massive benefits to everyone. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that we are about to embark on a resources boom of breathtaking proportions. A figure of $29 billion has been mentioned; I do not necessarily query it. I think the point of how much the boom will be worth is irrelevant. There will be a massive boom with huge mining projects in all sorts of areas. Bauxite, alumina, coal and iron ore projects-just to mention a few-are about to begin yielding billions of dollars to the entrepreneurs involved. I think it is time in this debate for me to paint a backdrop to the boom. Let us ask ourselves: Who owns those resources and who will benefit from them? To me those questions seem essential to a debate such as this particularly when one is discussing the lack of planning for the boom that is inevitably to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> I will cite some figures, even though figures are boring, because I want them on the record. These figures come from the United Nations publication Trans National Corporations in World Development, New York 1978. The figures concern foreign control or ownership of industrial sectors in Australia. We are talking about a resources boom. The publication states that 55 per cent of all mining ventures in Australia are owned by overseas companies. Some 36 per cent of manufacturing, 48 per cent of service industries and 62 per cent of all Australian chemical, coal, rubber and petroleum industries are owned by multinationals or overseas companies. Some 46 per cent of fabricated metal product industries are similarly foreign-owned. Those are 1978 figures. I apologise for using them, but we cannot get later figures because one of the little known scandals of statistics-keeping in this country is that by order of this Government that section of the Australian Bureau of Statistics which keeps statistics on foreign investment and ownership was disbanded two or three years ago. Let us remember that we are talking about a resources boom. I am asking the simple and honest question: Who will benefit from those resources and who owns those resources? If we dig deeper under those general figures that I cited we find that the Australian motor vehicle industry is 100 per cent foreign controlled, that oil refining is 91 per cent foreign owned, that oil exploration is 74 per cent foreign controlled, that tin production is 81 per cent foreign controlled and that the mineral sands industry is 62 per cent foreign controlled. We also find, for goodness sake, that 51 per cent of advertising agencies are owned by foreign companies. So those claims by Government supporters and Ministers that massive benefits will be given to everybody in this boom sound a little hollow. </PARA>
<PARA> The Age newspaper has said: 'So far so good, but we must question, in respect of this boom, where most of the billions of dollars will finish up'. The Age aptly puts it: 'For whom will the boom really bang?' Few Australian companies will share equitably in the bonanza. Of course, some will do quite well, including some mining companies which are still owned by Australians and those companies building mining equipment. But the vast majority of Australians will not gain much at all from the boom. We know that the resources boom entails capital intensive industries and that, therefore, the contribution to lessening unemployment will be minimal. I was interested to hear Senator Thomas talk about the multiplier effect. All economists whose writings I have read do not foresee much of a multiplier effect on other industries springing from the resources boom. For example, I hope that the next Government speaker can explain to me how the clothing, textile, footwear and car industries will benefit in any significant way from the resources boom of the 1980s. The real beneficiaries will be the large multinational corporations which control much of the mining industry at the moment-CRA Ltd, Utah and Alcoa, to name just a few. </PARA>
<PARA> I digress slightly to illustrate one of the sickening things that is happening in this country today. I refer to the Foreign Investment Review Board, which will be the subject of some further detailed criticism from me in later months. I find incredible the disposition of this Board, which is charged with the task of keeping Australia for Australians, in putting up a most pathetic record of bowing to the wishes of multinationals. In response to anything that a foreign company wants with respect to the removal of the 70 per cent or 50 per cent of Australian ownership clause, the Foreign Investment Review Board seems to be grovelling by saying: 'Yes, multinational or foreign company, we will grant your wish'. I may be doing the officials on that Board an injustice. It may well be that they are acting under ministerial direction.</PARA>
<PARA> How about this for a pathetic un-Australian action? It concerns the recent takeover by Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd of the Golden Fleece company. The Caltex company, in return for offering a very small percentage of itself to Australian shareholders, will now be able to trade much more easily through the foreign investment guidelines laid down by the Government. The performance of the FIRB in promoting Australian ownership of Australian resources already leaves a lot to be desired. It seems that following the Caltex decision we are in for yet another multinational invasion. Of course, to accompany this resources boom we now have an influx of international financiers. They are arriving in force to cash in on the boom. How much joy is that for small Australian investors and shareholders? I cite Citibank, Morgan Gauranty and the Bank of America as just a few of the merchant banks and financiers coming to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some other questions. What should be done? First, Australian ought to develop a resources policy and an energy policy. At the moment we do not have a resources or energy policy. In fact we have eight different resources policies for a country of 14.5 million people, and that is insane. We have one alleged policy espoused by the Federal Government. Each of our little State Premiers also has his State energy or resources policy. Of course, the eighth policy is the energy policy determined by the foreign companies or multinationals to suit themselves. The Australian Democrats believe very strongly that there ought to be a referendum with all parties getting together to recommend to the Australian people that powers over resources and energy should be a Federal responsibility and not a State responsibility. We now have the rather amusing sight of State Premiers going overseas, waving bits of paper to impoverished multinationals and saying: 'Please do not go to Victoria, which is providing electricity at a give-away price of 1.4c a kilowatt. Come to my State. I will undercut other electricity suppliers. I will sell you electricity at 0.9c a kilowatt. It does not matter that we put Western Australians, Tasmanians or whoever in debt for the next 20 years as long as we get the precious multinational in our State to dig the guts out of our ground and to exploit our people'. That is the be-all and end-all in policy-making. It is time that stopped. </PARA>
<PARA> I have just returned from Tasmania, where there are forces at work amongst State politicians to dam one of the most beautiful rivers in the world to create power. I suppose that the creation of power is a worthy object, but when one asks them whether they have a market for the power or whether they need it, they say: 'Oh yes, we will sell it allright'. I ask: Where are the bits of paper with signatures on the dotted line showing undertakings to buy this power? That sort of evidence is conspicuous by its absence. We are saying that there has to be a national policy on energy and resources which would allow some planning. We have to allow the small Australian investor a chance to invest in Australian resource development. I again bring to the notice of the Senate the insanity of Australia's policy of having a double tax on income from investments for small investors. To my knowledge we are the only country in the Western world, other than Canada, which has a double tax on dividends for the small investor. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe we ought to have a resource tax. I believe the Federal Government ought to tax the mining companies and those exploiting our resources at the source-when they rip the stuff out of the ground. I am sure of the fact that we do not know and cannot know what real profits multinationals are making in the exploitation of our resources. I have previously cited the case on record of Alcoa's selling alumina from Australia to its United States parent company at $108 a tonne in 1978 at a time when the world price was $150 a tonne. Clearly the price it charged its parent company was the cost price in Australia. Therefore, it could say to the Australian Taxation Office: 'We made no profits. It cost us $108 a tonne to make and we sold it at $108 a tonne'. The parent company then sold it to the client at $150 a tonne. </PARA>
<PARA> I have discussed that question with former Deputy Commissioners and Commissioners of Taxation, men not renowned for their radical beliefs or their left wing tendencies. They are tax gatherers. They told me that they have spent hours, weeks, months and years with the best brains in the Taxation Office trying to find ways of catching multinationals which under-cost those sorts of exports. They told me that there is no way they can do that because a multinational's accountant can always produce every document that is asked for. Therefore, the Australian Democrats would support very strongly a resource tax so that at least we would have some chance of getting something for the assets that are being taken out of our ground. </PARA>

<PARA> The lack of Government planning for the resources boom. </PARA>
<PARA>I very much regret that the Minister for National Development and Energy, Senator Carrick, has not seen fit to enter this debate and, as the relevant Government Minister, to indicate where a proper defence can be mounted against this matter of public importance. What we on this side of the chamber are asking for-and I very much applaud Senator Chipp for his contribution on behalf of the Australian Democrats-is not for government intervention of a heavy kind which would require blue prints which would so stultify the accumulation and the marshalling of capital and manpower by private enterprise that resource development would come to a standstill: Far from it. I think all Australians would welcome a resources boom which was so controlled, so developed that all Australians would benefit from it. What we are looking for is some sort of strategy, some sort of co-ordination, whereby those national resources can return proper dividends to every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chipp made a plea for this area to be regarded as one of truly national concern. But one does not even have to go as far as that to query whether the Government is really interested in evolving some sort of strategy of co-ordination to ensure that this development does benefit the Australian people. At a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources on 3 February which was attended by top bureaucrats within the Federal structure, I put this question: To your knowledge over the past three years has there been any forum of ministers, or very high level officials where all the proposals for the aluminium industry expansion have been put on the table by the various State governments so that they can be scrutinised? The answer of Mr Monaghan, the Director of the National Energy Office, was:</PARA>
<PARA> I do not think so. </PARA>
<PARA>So there we have a top public official, the Director of the National Energy Office, admitting to a Senate Committee that even accepting the constraints of federalism there was no co-ordination involving the Australian Minerals and Energy Council, at which all the relevant Ministers concerned could discuss, co-ordinate and evolve a strategy to ensure that the benefits of the resources boom did flow to the Australian people. So it is not good enough for the Government to hide behind constitutional barriers and to say that this is a State responsibility whereby the forums constructed in deference to the Federal structure have themselves not been utilised. In my view, it is disgraceful that the various Ministers of the State and Federal governments have not got together to ensure that our resources are not auctioned off in the way in which Senator Chipp so graphically illustrated. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give some examples of where the lack of planning has a concrete focus. I do not suppose that there would be any greater concern within the community at the moment than the question of pricing of electricity to these great resource projects. Every consumer of electricity is asking whether he or she is subsidising the energy costs of the aluminium industry, for example. Every householder who has to pay his or her electricity bill as it increases quarter by quarter is asking that question. But I think of equal concern to the Australian Democrats and to the Labor Party is the fact that the smaller commercial and trading concerns, the smaller entrepreneurs, the businesses which are paying commercial tariffs are also asking the question. So it is not only the domestic consumers but also the other consumers of electricity within our trading and commercial enterprises who are asking whether, in the absence of the great resource muscle of the very big projects, they are being forced by tariff policies of State electricity commissions to subsidise the energy components in the finished products of, for example, the aluminium industry. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Federal Government's attitude in the face of this concern within the community? Is it even putting itself in a position where it can aid the plant allocation of electricity energy resources in this country? I regret to say that the answer is-and I was astounded when I heard it during the Senate committee hearing-that not only is the Federal Government not demanding that State governments supply that information, but it is not even requesting it. I refer very briefly to page 704 of the transcript of evidence of the meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources on 3 February 1981 which records my asking Mr Monaghan, the Director of the National Energy Office, this question:</PARA>
<PARA> What formal request has the Department made, for example, to the State Government of New South Wales or its Electricity Commission or any State government where relevant, to obtain the tariffs which you say are regarded by them as confidential?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Monaghan replied:</PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier arrangements for obtaining information which is not regarded as confidential by the authorities. We have not made a formal demand on the authorities for information which they consider to be confidential because we have not felt that we had the power to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>I interposed:</PARA>
<PARA> I did not say 'formal demand'-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that such a phrase has all the characteristics of perhaps breaking into constitutional areas which are not those of the Federal Government-</PARA>
<PARA> I said 'formal request'. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Monaghan said:</PARA>
<PARA> I amend my response with the words 'formal request'. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Director of the National Energy Office, no doubt acting under ministerial direction, has not seen fit even to make a formal request on the Government's behalf to the State governments and electricity generating authorities concerned to try to find out what is the actual level of tariff being charged by these great energy projects. How can the Government have the gall to appoint Senator Carrick as Minister for National Development and Energy when it prevents him from even asking those sorts of questions. </PARA>
<PARA> Two consequences are readily apparent from this failure of the Government even to ask for this sort of information. One has already been alluded to by Senator Chipp. The Government is not then in a position to know the true costs of the production process if it does not know what this energy component input really costs the producers. Therefore, the true level of profitability cannot be correctly analysed and the Commissioner of Taxation is not in a position to ensure that the revenue is not being led astray when it comes to ensuring that the community shares in the very profitable use of Australian energy resources. I add that further evidence of lack of planning would be the fact that the Government has not yet seen fit to put aluminium along with bauxite and alumina on the list of those commodities over which the Government will exercise some sort of surveillance when export contracts are entered into. Once again, the problem of transfer pricing is thereby not faced up to. Unless the Australian Government has a surveillance role in relation to the pricing of aluminium ingots when they go overseas no doubt the highly integrated aluminium industry will ensure that transfer pricing means that the true benefits from the exploitation of these Australian resources do not flow to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> A second consequence is that this Minister for National Development and Energy is in no position to say whether the coal or gas resources, whichever might be used for the generation of electricity, say, in the Hunter Valley or in Western Australia are being used in the best possible manner, or whether, for example, they ought to be reserved for coal liquefaction plants to overcome our transport fuel difficulties which may be expected to emerge, say, in 15 years' time. We do not know, for example, whether that coal ought to be allocated for export to the growing steaming coal market. What I am saying is that the Government's lack of planning has totally prevented the so-called Minister for National Development and Energy from acting in a way which would give any bite or credence to that portfolio. Instead the national Government is hiding behind a constitutional veil. As I said, it refuses to recognise the truly national character of these resources and the responsibility of the Government to ensure that the resources flow to benefit all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I was pleased to hear Senator Chipp, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, say that there is a need to consider the introduction of a resource rent tax in this area. Indeed in doing so, the Democrats once again are joining the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources. It was acknowledged by senators from all sides of the chamber on that Committee that sensitively handled in a way which does not remove the incentive to invest, sensitive to the fact that some of these projects are indeed risk projects, a resource rental tax will ensure that some of the very great profits generated by these projects go into the Federal Treasury for proper disbursal to the Australian community. In the absence of that disbursal certain things will occur and are occurring. State governments will increase their charges, for example as the Queensland Government does in regard to the rail freighting of these materials around Queensland. In other words, State governments will recognise that there is a gap in the return to the community from these highly profitable operations and will be in for their share. </PARA>
<PARA> An even more surprising aspect concerning the Government's neglect is the fact that the people directly employed by these projects perceive that there is an opportunity for them to share in a greatly profitable enterprise to the neglect of the greater Australian community. In that instance unions, of course, will be bargaining as hard as they are able in order to ensure that the great profits generated-the Utah company is a well-known great example-go to the workers directly employed in that industry. My question is: What will be the effect of that very high escalation of wages within those very few projects and industries on the overall employment market within Australia? We know that what will be involved will be a poaching of employees-skilled tradesmen, particularly in the electrical and the metal trades-from existing employers. Has the Government undertaken any planning to try to forecast the effect on existing employers by these projects poaching with offers of very high wages to very skilled tradesmen?</PARA>
<PARA> The other effect which also is becoming apparent, is that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) is indeed becoming the Commonwealth Employment Service of the resource projects. Skilled tradesmen are being sought overseas instead of the Government using its power, which it constitutionally has whether by virtue of the Foreign Investment Review Board or by export permit control, to say to these project developers: 'Permission to export your product will not be given unless you satisfy us that you have a fully worked out program of training of Australians to work within your industry'. Unless that is done and unless apprenticeship training and skilled tradesmen training are undertaken, not only of young Australians presently unemployed but also by way of upgrading the skills of people already within the Australian work force, I believe that these developers ought to be told now that the Government will not assist by way of immigration in the manpower shortages that may be expected to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> In this very short time it has been quite impossible to cover the whole gamut of matters which ought to be touched upon in a debate of such importance to Australia's future. The Australian Labor party is concerned that these resources be developed in such a way and at such a pace that the whole of the Australian community benefits. We want an increase in national income. We want an increase in national living standards. We believe that a resources boom, properly planned for, can guarantee the achievement of those very desirable objectives, but it will require planning, initiative and leadership by the national Government to ensure that there is a true integration of national aims, State government aims, and the legitimate aims of private enterprise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join in the debate on this matter of public importance, namely, the lack of government planning for the resources boom. The contributions to the debate from both sides of the chamber have been constructive, although undoubtedly my colleagues and I are probably at variance with some of the propositions put foward by the Opposition. Nonetheless, the general tone of the debate has been constructive. Senator Button, when he led this debate, waxed quite poetic and quoted William Blake's wonderful poem, now a hymn, Jerusalem. The second verse is: 'Bring me my bow of burning gold, bring me my arrows of desire'. Let me take some of those arrows and see whether I can puncture a few of the balloons that have been floated this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The resource boom actually started in the 1960s. I well recall it because then the primary industries of our country were in really desperate straits. The wool industry was in a bad way and there was a very bad drought which affected western Queensland. It was there that we started to see the vast exodus of people from those rural areas. As the resources boom was picking up at that stage it provided many jobs that otherwise would not have been. Right from that stage it has had an advantageous effect in providing employment. Of course, that has picked up since. Costs as they have been related to the primary producer are such that he no longer can afford to employ as many people as he once did and employment has been provided, particularly at some of the mines away from the capital cities and the coastal areas. </PARA>
<PARA> We all agree that there are problems involved, but does this indicate a lack of government planning or does it indicate that the Government has provided, by its policies, an atmosphere in which large scale investment and development have been able to take place and that maybe we have not been able to keep up with it. How would one plan for a resources boom? I believe that much has been done. Much needs to be done. The Federal Government is a little limited. Mention has been made of its constitutional powers; they are there. The States very jealously guard their constitutional powers and they hold many of the keys to the locks on the doors which need to be opened in order to provide for this large scale development. The development is there. We could not expect it to go along as though it were on a rainbow. There have been bumps on the road. We accept that. The point is that we learn and try to prevent them happening in the future and try to fix the problems as they arise. </PARA>
<PARA> Many mining towns are in a pretty good situation now. The size of the caravan parks is decreasing. Senator Button and Senator Chipp alluded to Gladstone, which has problems. It is pretty close to where I live. Infrastructure needs to be provided. But the situation is not all that bad. Senator Button referred to the dark satanic mills of William Blake, but that is not altogether what Gladstone is about. There are problems, I have admitted that, but it is still a very desirable place in which to live. Many people are living there quite happily. It has a wonderful area for boating and for fishing. Heron Island is off-shore. There are many things available there which make life a little more enjoyable. The problems are there, but it is not the pariah of places in which to live, as some people would indicate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has been trying, indeed with a fair bit of criticism, to increase Australian equity in these projects. It is a well-known fact that the Australian investor is pretty tardy when it comes to investing in risk projects, and indeed some of the mining programs are risky. We are having a lot of trouble in increasing Australian investment. We may not have the statistics available to which Senator Chipp alluded but I think the Foreign Investment Review Board is doing a good job keeping tabs on what money is coming in. It is trying to be sympathetic and is recognising the lack of Australian investment. It wants to get some of these projects off the ground. When we look at the State governments involvement-I refer to my State government's involvement in Queensland-we see that they have done a pretty good job. There are some large scale mining areas in Queensland. They are giving the Commonwealth and State governments and the people of the State a very good return. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate mentioned the freight rates charged by the railway. I wish to go through this matter again. It is a greatly misunderstood aspect of the Queensland Government's policy. Much was made in the early days of the fact that the royalty was, I think, 6d a ton. Somebody said it was a tomato for a ton of coal. It was never intended at that stage that the State Government would recoup any money from resources through royalties. They were merely a token. The recoupment was effected through the railways freight scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not think it was. I think it was a pretty good way. The honourable senator should wait one minute. The railway on which I worked is quite magnificent. Not one cent of the cost of it was paid by the taxpayers of Queensland or, indeed, of Australia. It was part of the agreement that the mining companies provide that complete railway network from the largest diesel electric locomotive to the last dog spike. Not one cent of taxpayers or railway customers' money was used for that. The money was provided by the companies. The repayment was to be made by way of freight rates. The freight rates were organised so that, I think working on a 15-year contract, the freight rate would escalate, starting off at a low base. I think the mining companies would have been repaid for their original investment. It is a very good railway. In my first speech in the Senate I mentioned the new technology that it brought into the railways alone, let alone the technology that it has brought into the mining industry in relation to the bulk handling of coal and the ports of Hay Point and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have reaped a wonderful reward in Queensland. I think the Queensland Government has done an excellent job in the contracts it has organised with the mining companies. I do not think the mining companies like the contracts. Nonetheless at the conclusion of the period-I think it is to be a lesser period because the tonnages have increased-we will own a magnificent railway and the rolling stock. This does not apply so much to the wagons because they are made specifically for the coal traffic, but the diesel electric locomotives will be fit to be used on any other section of the Queensland railway network. I think the Queensland Government has done a very good job indeed in its organising of those contracts for the benefit of the people of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation is in marked contrast to the current situation in New South Wales. It is unfortunate for the people of New South Wales that the State Government seems to have taken a different attitude. We have heard about the coal loaders that are going into Newcastle, where I think the depth of the water in the port is such that it can take only 60,000 tonne to 80,000 tonne ships. The Botany Bay coal loader has been abandoned. This is all having its effect. Of course, contractors are looking to other States. It is most unfortunate for the coal industry, the mining industry, the resources boom and ultimately, of course, the people of New South Wales. Unfortuately, the New South Wales Government, instead of investing money in education, health and all the other essential services, is buying into the resources boom when there is no necessity for it to do so. I understand that the Electricity Commission of New South Wales has bought or is buying shares in coalmines to the tune of $800m. That certainly will not be advantageous to the people of New South Wales. It is unfortunate that that is happening. I just instance the marked contrast between that and what has happened in my own State of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> Mention has been made of the resources tax. Neither I nor, I think, any of my colleagues, would support the concept of a resources tax. This afternoon we are talking about the resources boom. We recognise that the mining companies pay company tax, rail freights and royalties. All in all, these companies probably pay about 60c out of every dollar they earn. I think that is a pretty good contribution to the coffers of Australia. I could not go along with the thought of a resources tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall make brief mention of union involvement, which has sought to divide and maybe even to isolate the mining industry. Senator Tate rightfully touched on the fact that very high wages are being paid in the mining industry and that that is having a very heavy social effect on the surrounding area. Other employers cannot get workers. People on the land probably within 100 miles of the central Queensland coalfields find it very hard to get people to work on their land because they cannot afford to pay them the high wages that are being paid on the coalfields. If a person is selling petrol in a service station in a town such as Blackwater or Moranbah, there is no way in the world that his employer could expect to give him the same conditions or pay him the same wages as the mining companies can afford to pay. So we are experiencing quite a problem in that area. It is one to which there is no ready answer, but I think it must be acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the situation at Gladstone. At present maintenance workers at the Gladstone power station are on strike for an $81 a week site allowance. We have already acknowledged the fact that there are problems associated with living in Gladstone, but I do not think the maintenance workers at that power station have any greater problems than do most of the other workers in that town, whether they are pumping petrol or working in the railways. It is unfortunate that people are capitalising on this situation, not only dividing the community but also providing further problems in the future. They are not acting altogether responsibly. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of our resources boom is associated with the development of our uranium mines. I worked in Cloncurry for many years and carried yellowcake from the Mary Kathleen mine to shipping. I know most of my colleagues in the railway are not one little bit concerned, yet we see the Australian Railways Union, I would say not with the will of its members, trying to ban the shipment of uranium, which, of course, will be a much needed resource in the future for the provision of power. </PARA>
<PARA> Our steaming coal exports are mounting. I have no objection to that, except for one thing. I ask: Just how much further can we go with burning these masses of coal and pouring the pollutants, including carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere? One thing that we are not sure of, of course, is the ultimate greenhouse effect that it will have on this continent, maybe even in our lifetime. I think we must consider quite reasonably just where to cry halt to the burning of masses of steaming coal and where we can bring in one of the cleanest methods of power generation, that is, nuclear power generation, until something cleaner and better comes along. I reject the suggestion that the Government is lacking in its planning, but I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to Senator Thomas for some information he revealed during his speech which had not come my way before; that is, that the Western Australian Government intends using North West Shelf gas to generate electricity to be supplied to the proposed aluminium smelters. I was not previously aware that the Western Australian Government had such a policy. The Government is vulnerable to criticism, as is stated in the wording of the matter of public importance, because of the lack of forethought and planning on its part in the resources boom. It is vulnerable for reasons other than lack of planning. It is vulnerable in the sense that Senator Button spoke of-that is, in respect of providing an adequate social infrastructure for people who will populate the developed mining areas. The clearest manifestation of Government ineptitude, of its inability to handle the resources boom, is its categorical rejection of a resources rent tax. High tory dogma has taken precedence over national interest, economic rationality and social justice. I will deal with those three points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the social justice question, I assert-it is an assertion backed by value judgments-that mineral bonanzas are public property, that those who mine are entitled to rewards, both to capital and to labour, but that abnormal profit, which economists call 'economic rent'-that is, the return to capital or labour above the going market rates of return for both of those inputs-ideally should be appropriated by the state. In reality, since we live in something less than an ideal world, that means that such an economic rent and those abnormal profits should be taxed progressively. The national interest, given the high degree of foreign ownership of our mineral resources, which is something that is likely to continue in spite of some cosmetic adjustments that are being made now, surely demands that they be adequately taxed inside Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Both of those points, as I conceded initially, are at least to some extent value judgments. They reflect personal, political and philosophical views which I and my colleagues hold. Even to those who reject those philosophical and ethical views, the case for a resources rent tax as against quantum levies-that is, royalties based on the level of output, on production-on purely technical grounds is irrefutable. When I say 'purely technical grounds', I mean on evaluations as bereft of value judgments or emotive content as the arithmetic laws from which the case for a resources rental tax is derived. </PARA>
<PARA> The essential difference, which I repeat for the benefit of the high tory ideologues and innumerates who populate the Government benches both here and in the House of Representatives, between quantum royalties and a resources rent tax is that quantum royalties are levied on the volume of output and a resources rent tax is levied on profits. I note that although Senator Collard has some objection to the principle of a resources rent tax, which was not clearly spelled out, he has no objection to and indeed applauds the existence of a very crude and inefficient attempt to levy a resources rent tax in Queensland by way of excessive rail freight charges. The charges are excessive in relation to the costs incurred in providing the service. </PARA>
<PARA> Traditionally, taxes on mining enterprises in Australia have been levied on production. They are quantum royalties, although some very crude and inefficient attempts to tax profits are in existence. I refer to the sliding scale of royalties which have been long established in Broken Hill; the Western Australian Government practice of imposing by an Act of Parliament royalties on iron ore development in the 1960s on an individual project basis; the coal export levy, which is extant despite a five-year-old promise by the Fraser Government to remove it; and the question of railway freights in Queensland to which Senator Collard has already referred. I will be saying something more about railway freights later. </PARA>
<PARA> The best existing example of the technical unacceptability of quantum levies, or mining royalties as they are generally referred to, is the crude oil levy. I shall use approximate figures but they are close enough to reality to demonstrate very clearly the technical unacceptability of any royalty or levy based on output instead of on profits. Currently Australian oil produced from Bass Strait oil fields receives a market price of $27 a barrel. Of that $27, $20 goes on taxation, almost entirely to the Commonwealth Government through the crude oil levy, and about $7 goes to the producers. The current cost of producing the oil is less than $2 a barrel. When the cost of producing that oil rises-as it inevitably will as the fields approach the end of their producing life-above $7 a barrel, production from those fields will cease unless some other changes are made to the taxing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Oil producers are not philanthropists. I see no reason why they should be. The simple reality is that if the market price is $27 a barrel, if the tax is $20 and if the cost of extraction exceeds $7 a barrel, production will cease and oil which has a market value of $27 a barrel and a production cost of less than $8 a barrel will remain in the ground until such time as that inept taxing policy is altered. If this Government survives long enough to outlive the major producing life of the Bass Strait oil fields, which is highly unlikely, despite its reiteration of high tory dogma as recently as yesterday, it will be forced to change those arrangements. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The tax should be related to profits instead of output. The effects of inept quantum royalties are less obvious but still apply to mining in general. They apply because they affect the cut-off grade-that is, the amount of payable mineral in the ore which determines whether the ore will be pulled out of the ground and processed. There is a point at which the extraction and processing of ore becomes payable. If a fixed royalty related to the volume of output applies, that is something which must be taken into account by the producer before his cash and capital costs of production are dealt with. If these two factors exceed the market value of the commodity then ore which is economically recoverable will be left in the ground. The essential point, which relates back to the question which Senator Young raised a while ago, is that this means at the margin, at the point where the market value of oil and the cost of pumping it out of Bass Strait, or wherever the field may be located, are equal, or at the point where the cost of extracting and processing ore is equal to the market price of the product, there must be no taxation. A proper profits-related resources rent tax automatically ensures that that happens. A quantum royalty guarantees that it does not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In sticking to this policy the Commonwealth has abdicated its responsibilities. It has created a tax vacuum which is being filled in two ways: Firstly, in Queensland, it is being filled by excessive rail freights-I use the definition of 'excessive' that I used earlier, that is, in excess of actual cost-and, secondly, it is being filled sometimes by the small number of skilled people but at other times by the not particularly skilled people who are employed in the mining projects. In other words, the economic rent is being appropriated partly by the State governments and partly by members of the work force, acting usually in a collective way through unions. I regard that as inequitable and inefficient. The inefficiency of quantum royalties has already been proved. I regard the practice of appropriating the economic rent by the work force as inequitable. I believe-I think this is the correct ethical and moral position for any social democrat to adopt-that the windfall gains of the economic rent should be appropriated by the State for the benefit of the whole of the community and not by the relatively small work force actually associated with the extraction of the product. Members of the Government probably do not care much for that sort of value judgement. They probably think it is irrelevant. But what ought to concern even them is the macro-economic effects of the extremely high wages paid by the Utah Development Company in Queensland and paid to some extent by other companies in other parts of Australia and likely to be paid to workers employed on other resource projects if the present policies are continued. </PARA>
<PARA> The potential benefit of a flow-on of high wages throughout the rest of the economy, exacerbated by specific labour shortages in some cases-this is another example, of course, of government negligence; the absence of an adequate manpower or labour training policy-will be dissipated by high inflation generated by that flow-on among other things and the contractionary economic policy which such a condition would inevitably evoke from this Government. In other words, the resource riches are in danger of being transformed not into rising material welfare but into rising unemployment and misery. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other related examples of the Commonwealth's abdication of power and responsibility in this area. Most notorious of all, especially in view of the fact that constitutional constraints have been raised as a problem in the application of a resources rent tax-constraints which are not insurmountable, but I do not have the time now to explain why-is the pathetic, craven abdication of power and responsibility last year by the Fraser Government under the territorial seas legislation when it transferred back to the States power over off-shore resources which the High Court of Australia had determined belonged to the Commonwealth. So we may see repeated in the area of territorial sea resource development the same self-destructive competition between States that we are witnessing now in respect of aluminium smelters. </PARA>
<PARA> The other glaring example of abdication of power was the decision in December 1978 of the Fraser Government to give the States virtually unlimited power to borrow both at home and abroad for infrastructure development. That was tantamount to a declaration of open season for irresponsible State borrowing. We did not have to look very far or to wait very long for examples of such irresponsible State borrowing. I refer to the World Trade Centre in Melbourne and, possibly before this decade is out, the staging of the Olympic Games in Melbourne. That declaration of open season for irresponsible borrowing by States underwrites the self-destructive competition between States for industries which would have located in Australia anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously the Government had no appreciation of what is required to manage the impending resources boom in the national interest. Its response to it is limited to gung-ho eulogising of what it believes will happen and the gutless surrendering of the national interest to foreign interests and to parochial State interests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proper development of Australia's resources for the economic benefit of all those concerned, having regard for environmental protection, as has been mentioned in this debate today requires the full co-operation of governments at all levels, industry and very importantly the trade union movement. I suggest that the Fraser Government has, since its return to the treasury bench, developed a climate whereby industry has been encouraged to get back to the job of developing Australia. The first and foremost requirement was to bring under some control the tremendous inflation rate that we inherited when we came into office. I think that is central to a government's responsibility of creating an economic environment in which development is encouraged to take place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have listened with interest to what the speakers have had to say in this debate. The question of foreign capital rose time and time again. I think it is proper for a government to be very careful about how foreign capital is to be used in Australia. I think the Government is aware of the need to survey and to continue a surveillance on the use of foreign capital. When debates of this type are taking place in this place I always think of the experience of the United States. The history of America shows that it used foreign investment very largely and almost entirely to develop the resources of that country which today is the most powerful industrial nation in the world. I cannot see anything wrong with encouraging the wise investment of foreign capital in this country to develop our resources. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1968 or 1969 I visited Gove. It was at a time when exploration was being carried out there and the exploitation of the minerals had not taken place. At that time I asked what the proposal was in respect of Australian equity. I was told that the Gorton Government policy required a 51 per cent Australian equity and that that was the objective. I went back a year or so later when mining had commenced and I examined the tremendous industrial growth that had occurred there. I again asked what Australian equity there was in the project. I was informed that the developers were able to get only 33 per cent from Australian sources and that the rest of the finance had to be attracted from Aluswiss. I have to ask the question: Why is this so?</PARA>
<PARA>The situation in Australia today seems to be that the savings banks have record savings in their vaults. Are we doing enough to encourage Australian people to take their money out of the banks and to invest it in the development of Australian companies and Australian resources? I think that is a question that is attracting the attention of the Government-it should attract the attention of the Government-in order to encourage more Australians to invest in their own country. I am not opposed to the discreet use of foreign investment provided that government has regard for the application of such investment and it makes sure that it gets appropriate taxes from the development companies to boost our revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Fraser Government has been in power it has done much to encourage the provision of infrastructure finance for various projects throughout Australia. I think it is quite firmly the Federal Government's responsibility to promote and to continue to encourage the provision of such finance. Last year the Federal Government decided to approve the infrastructure finance required for the Redcliff project in South Australia. This will entail the provision of a new power station which is under construction at the moment at Port Augusta. A wharf facility and the duplication of a pipeline from the Cooper Basin are also involved in that project. The housing requirements, which will have to be met by the State Government, and things of that nature are an intregal part of the development of this type of industry. I think the Federal Government has accepted that responsibility in other areas as well. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am talking about this matter I would like also to remind the trade union movement of its responsibility. It seems to me that when we are dealing with the development of uranium, which Senator Collard referred to earlier, we become frustrated by certain elements of the trade union movement. This attitude is certainly impeding the development of South Australia. We have quite large uranium deposits at Beverley and Honeymoon in the north-eastern part of the State, as well as the huge deposits at Olympic Dam on Roxby Downs station. Those projects will mean much to the development of South Australia and to the people who are at present looking for work in that State. That is an example of the type of development which will provide tremendous job opportunities not only directly but also indirectly. </PARA>
<PARA> The deposit I will highlight is the Beverley deposit. Senator Young is very familiar with this project. I believe that the mining of that deposit will be carried out by a leaching process whereby fluid is injected into the ore body and the ore is extracted, pumped out, in slurry form. I understand that can be done in a very short time span-from memory, in the order of two years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or probably less, as Senator Young reminds me. Associated with that project-and my figures from memory go back three or four years or perhaps even longer-was the contemplation of a requirement of $100m worth of plant to be prefabricated. Of course, that could be done at a place such as Whyalla or another of the northern Spencer Gulf industrial cities which would provide fringe benefits, indirect work opportunities, for those areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the Olympic Dam project really gets off the ground-and there are about 250 people currently working there carrying out $58m worth of continuing exploratory work to establish the true nature and extent of the ore body-it will provide work opportunities for many hundreds of people. I understand from what I have heard from industrial sources and from State government sources that a town population of 35,000 to 40,000 people could live in that area. I think that sort of encouragement, given by the Government in the first instance in providing infrastructure requirements for those developments, has been provided quite responsibly by the Fraser Government. Apart from that, of course, we have provided money to ensure that adequate railway systems are available to connect South Australia to the Northern Territory. This will ultimately mean tremendous benefits to the development of mineral resources in not only South Australia but also the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect that concerns me and perhaps others in this chamber is that governments need to recognise the necessity of providing additional financial assistance to local government in these growth centres. Mackay has been mentioned. I was at Port Augusta on Friday of last week to open a Commonwealth office which will provide regional headquarters for several departments and a service to the 27,000 people living in that area. The growth in that area over the next few years will be considerable. The added population will require additional services to be provided by local government. This matter certainly requires additional attention by the Federal and State governments. I think this would apply in many other growth centres throughout Australia. Whether or not this should be done by providing a long term, low interest loan or in some such way, I believe that is an urgent requirement which needs further attention by the Federal Government and the State governments concerned. I think that the debate has been quite interesting. I hope the Government will take note of some ideas that will flow from it. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. I thank the Tasmanian Parliament for the confidence placed in me by appointing me to replace Ken Wriedt for the remainder of his term of office. I thank the people of Tasmania for the responsibility that they have entrusted to me to represent them in this Parliament. I feel very humble before the stature of a man such as Ken Wriedt. He is a caring and able man. He is a good man who has the respect of the whole community. He earned the approval of more than 70 per cent of farmers for his handling of the primary industry portfolio. His concern for peace was practical and balanced. He called for sanity, understanding and trust as a basis for world peace. The principle of a national superannuation scheme was written into Australian Labor Party policy on his initiative. It was a scheme which would contribute much to the security of people in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My concern is for the people of Tasmania and the people of my country. Everywhere they are sacrificed to a system which puts economic values and profits before the value and potential of a human person. They are sacrificed to a system which has brought our world to the brink of catastrophy, which uses the riches of our earth, not to serve the needs of mankind, but to serve the greed of men who control large corporations. Our finite resources are wasted. Vast sums of money are spent on armaments while millions die of starvation each day. The world has, in kilograms per person, more explosives than food. Yet, it is not only the shortage of food which is the cause of hunger but the price that is put upon food. </PARA>
<PARA> During the last few decades, many groups of people and individuals have called for changes in values and priorities, values which put people first. At the United Nations Special Assembly on Disarmament in 1978, many groups, including doctors, scientists, churches, youth groups and women's organisations gave papers which expressed a great concern and tenderness for the human family. They expressed that anger that can sometimes be the greatest expression of love. I wish to read from a paper given by the union of 30 million Catholic women. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> We are deeply concerned by the cruelly inhibiting effect on development, produced over the years by the arms race and its spiralling technology. The expanding trade in increasingly sophisticated and expensive weaponry and huge military budgets. We believe that the basic security of people everywhere resides in the availability of food, health services shelter, education, employment and the wholesome, unpolluted environment. It is both irrational and immoral to commit almost half the world's scientific research and technological development to increasing the already unimaginable potential for total destruction. Disarmament is everyone's business. We would ask you to keep in mind that disarmament is a global right-to-life issue, that you are dealing with the future of unique, precious human beings, not abstractions. </PARA>
<PARA>All governments, including the Australian Government, were called upon to publicise widely to the people in their countries the declaration from that Assembly, in the hope that an international conscience might develop and that world public opinion might exercise a positive influence on disarmament. This has not happened. If we consider the money that is spent on armaments-as much money is spent on armaments in one hour as is spent on all the underprivileged children of the world in one year-surely it is a matter of shame. The recent North-South report commissioned by the United Nations and chaired by Willy Brandt called for radical, social and economic changes and showed what this could mean. Page 14 of that report states:</PARA>
<PARA> One-half of one percent of one-year's world military expenditure would pay for all the farm equipment needed to increase food production and approach self-sufficiency in food-deficit, low-income countries by 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>So it continues in like manner. In 1967 Pope Paul VI in his encyclical on the development of peoples, in speaking of the liberal society, said:</PARA>
<PARA> But it is unfortunate that on these new conditions of society a system has been constructed which considers profit as the key motive for economic progress, competition as the supreme law of economics, and private ownership of the means of production as an absolute right that has no limits and carries no corresponding social obligation. This unchecked liberalism leads to dictatorship rightly denounced by Pius VII as producing 'the international imperialism of money.' One cannot condemn such abuses too strongly by solemnly recalling, once again, that the economy is at the service of man. </PARA>
<PARA>These calls, also coming from Australian churches and welfare groups, are for the redirection and redistribution of wealth. As Australia approaches the bicentenary year of 1988 we must assess those things which we have achieved for future generations and we must seriously examine the failures during those 200 years. We must look at the aims and the aspirations of the early settlers and the hopes of those who came here in servitude. They hoped for a new society and a new life, free from the poverty, the injustices and the class distinctions that they had experienced. They wanted, more than anything, hope for the future of their children, the opportunity to work and build security and for a democratic society of justice, equality and human rights for everyone. The pioneering spirit, the courage to fight injustices and the comradeship which made life bearable in a new land are qualities which are still necessary now. Perhaps much of this has been lost. But perhaps much more of it is still in the souls of the Australian people and is expressed in the attitude of a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA> We who are here today, who are responsible for this time in history and the effects of our actions on future generations, must ensure that the hopes and the dreams of those early settlers are realised. We must be mindful of the hopes and the expectations of the later settlers who have made Australia their home and who have brought so much to our culture. We must ensure the rights of older people in our community to realise their hopes. Are the actions of government, which deny work to our young people in a country where there is so much work waiting to be done, actions which will kill their dreams and hopes for the future, for marriage and family and which deny the satisfaction of work, of security and of human dignity for the sake of the economy something which we can look upon with pride or with shame?</PARA>
<PARA> Working people are not to be discarded as an item of cost at the swing of an imbalanced market, because people have a right to work. The fact is that the declaration of the Assembly of the United Nations in December 1965 on the promotion amongst youth of the ideals of peace, mutual respect and understanding, expressed the recognition of the need for young people to have an assured future, that peace freedom and justice were among the chief guarantees that their desires for happiness would be fulfilled. The declaration also included the recognition that it is the young who are destined to guide the future of mankind and it is the young who should know respect for and develop a cultural heritage of their country. The fact is that this declaration has not been promoted by Australian governments, as requested by that assembly. This shows the disregard by government of the important place of youth in our community. Youth brings with it the spirit of the future, and we must ensure that there is a future. We educate, it is hoped, to give the capacity to think free from bias, to develop a creative potential of the human person and to give a clear and wide vision of the world in which the young have a part and a responsibility. The youth of today see a world where more than half of humanity is starving and the other half have much more than they need. How can they accept this as making sense and how can they respect the actions and the policies which have brought this about?</PARA>
<PARA> Is the exploitation of our natural resources, belonging to the inhabitants of this country, including the original Australians, and is the exploitation of our environment by overseas interests for their own profit something for which we feel pride or anger? Let us consider Alcoa in Western Australia, about which the Conservation Council of Western Australia said:</PARA>
<PARA> We'd argue that in fact the wages bill might well be outstripped by subsidies on things like gas and rail freight . . . and as far as corporate taxation is concerned Alcoa didn't pay any tax from 1964 through to 1978 in Australia and yet they made 276 million dollars profit . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Can the workers avoid paying tax for 14 years? Farmers in Western Australia are justified in their concern about the fall-out of fluoride from smelters destroying productive farmland. Should the Australian people's money be used to subsidise the huge infrastructure and to train the skilled workers needed to enable foreign corporations to exploit our raw materials which will then provide employment and profit in some country overseas? How does government assess what is in the national interest or people's interests when it gives approval for foreign companies to acquire Australian-owned industries? The recent takeover of a food company and a leading alternative energy resource group is cause for grave concern. Decisions could be made by foreign companies in the future which could affect the nutrition of Australian people and the development of new energy resources. These are basic needs of the Australian people and should surely be controlled by Australian interests. The greed of the men in control of corporations is destroying the enterprise and the initiative of small Australian business people. Is the fact that 60 per cent of wealth is owned by 10 per cent of the people a fulfilment of the dream of the early settlers? Is the fact that more than 2 million Australians live well below the poverty line and experience the denial of the right to food, housing, security and human dignity a matter of pride or shame?</PARA>
<PARA> This is the time when our nation must decide whether we continue to follow the path which puts the economy, and values of profit, property and materialism first or whether we follow the path which puts the human person, and the human values of equal rights, freedom and fraternity as our first priority. At a conference in 1980 on future directions for Australia there was a general acceptance that things must change to democratise our institutions, both corporate and government, and put people first in our goals as a nation. Only the latter path can give us true democracy. Democracy can flourish only when there are equal rights for all, when each person is enfranchised in the work place, in the community, as well as at the ballot box. </PARA>
<PARA> If the only motive in the work place is the economy, man merely becomes a cog in the machine. When working people have the democratic right to make decisions in the work place about issues which affect them and their community, such as technology, industrial health, child care, consumerism and the production of socially useful products, then there will be a real democracy. When members of a community, as individuals and collectively, have the conditions and the responsibility to participate in decision-making, then there will be democracy. Only when people have the knowledge and the freedom of information necessary to make correct judgments and choices can they use human intelligence to find the answers to the problems which society faces. How can people make decisions about Pine Gap if they do not know the facts? How can they judge the plant varietal rights issue when governments have been discussing it for 11 years and the people have known about it only in the last eight months? Only when people are able, as equals and in freedom, to work together for the common good, both in the community and in the work place, can we have a healthy economy. The economy, according to the Oxford Dictionary, is 'The administration of concerns and resources of a community-the theory of the production and distribution of wealth'. I would suggest that this Government's definition of the economy ignores the concerns of the community and shows bias in the distribution of wealth. We should not forget that the economy exists because of human ideas and human labour and the resources of nature working together to provide for the needs of people. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary that there be not only equal distribution of wealth but also a redirection of money towards people-orientated needs-the right use of taxpayers' money. Compared with the 10 per cent spent on health, the 27.4 per cent on social welfare and the 9.8 per cent for defence, the total of 2.4 per cent of the Budget allocated to housing, urban and regional development and the environment, culture and recreation is very small. A very large increase in this area would help to alleviate much of the health costs and the social costs in our community. It would also eliminate much misery and prevent the undermining of family well-being. This would lead to a much happier and healthier society. There are many examples of the inefficient use of people's money, the limited and uncertain funding for essential community services, such as family planning and child care services, that prevent them from making long term planning and efficiency. It is wasteful of the energies of voluntary groups in the community who work so hard in these areas and it is also wasteful of the taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> We are moving toward the year 2000. It is estimated that the percentage of elderly people of pensionable age will increase from 11.5 per cent now to 18.6 per cent in the year 2020. The work force percentage of the population, including the increasing amount of part time work, will increase from 44.5 per cent now to a possible 48.8 per cent in the year 2000. This increase of only 4 per cent will mean a much reduced tax base to support an increased demand for social welfare benefits. How can this greatly increased aging population be cared for in conditions of human dignity unless we direct the rich resources of this country to services and benefits? We have a debt to the elderly in our society for their contribution, and that debt has to be honoured. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most disturbing events in recent years has been the attack on the trade unions in this country. Unionists are not a race apart; they are the fathers and mothers, the sons and daughters, the husbands and wives, the consumers and the producers in our society. They are the people who through struggle have raised the living standards of this country and whose labour has built this nation. It should not be forgotten that the fascist regimes of Hitler and Mussolini first attacked and decimated the trade union movement in order to take power and establish dictatorship. It is with great concern that we see this happening in our own country. The media and the Government continually publicise the days lost through strikes but they rarely mention those days lost through injury, work-induced illnesses and accidents although these often far exceed days lost through strikes. There is no mention of the days lost through unemployment or the resultant loss of productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be said that the things I have spoken of are idealistic, impractical and emotional. But I believe that people are very practical if given the opportunity to use their experience of life and the freedom to use their skills. I think that ideals are both the mark of man and the inspiration for progress of humanity. They can be the cure for apathy. Women are considered to be emotional and I make no apology for that. I think it is the lack of emotion and the lack of emotional concern in male-dominated parliaments for human issues, which have allowed the problems facing the world at present to arise. The young people of our nation need not only economic solutions-which I believe will come from people themselves if people are placed first-but also ideas to inspire them; they need hope to encourage them and help to implement those ideas. They need a belief in humanity and a belief in themselves. They need a belief in the future. They need to know human dignity and human rights. They need a belief in peace, justice, freedom, love and generosity and reason and wisdom. We have a grave and vital reponsibility to the youth of our nation to ensure and protect the development of the creative human spirit in young people. They must not be crippled by the failures of government. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of this Parliament have been given responsibility by the people of their respective States to work for their well-being and the well-being of their children; they have not been given responsibility to work for the multinationals or for the profit or privilege of the few. I do not believe that that responsibility is being fulfilled by government. The shaping of our common future, the direction our people must take and the example our nation must give to our neighbours and the world are too important to be decided by government and bureaucratic experts alone. But the people of Australia must exercise their right to know the truth and to have the information and the facts presently denied. This will enable them to make correct judgments in their communities and in the Parliament. There must be an outflow of information and an input of the people's wishes and ideas in the light of this knowledge. The Government must find the machinery to enable this to happen. The human person is the highest value and must be our first consideration. I have the greatest faith in the wisdom and responsibility of an informed and democratically free Australian people to choose the way leading to peace and to the well-being and happiness for future generations and the way that might make our nation honoured when the pages of history are written. We must ensure that people have the opportunity in freedom and in knowledge to direct this country in that way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that all honourable senators congratulate Senator Jean Hearn on her maiden speech in this place. I know that many of us share the points of view that she expressed so clearly and well. I refer to her concern for people and for a just distribution of the nation's resources and to her statements on generosity, peace and other matters. In fact, I know that honourable senators from all parties come here with ideals and a very real concern for people. Warm sentiments such as those that Senator Hearn expressed then take the shape, according to our political philosophies, of hard particular policies that are very much the subject of debate in this chamber. Speaking on behalf of, I think, all honourable senators I welcome the first speech that Senator Hearn has made in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the Address-in-Reply debate, of course, we are directly responding to the Governor-General's Speech which he made when he came to open this Parliament. In his remarks in this chamber to the combined sitting of the House of Representatives and the Senate he referred to the policy speech last September of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and said that the Government's program was most particularly and specifically set out. He said that in his address to the Parliament he would refer in general terms to the broad issues to which the Government would address itself. In doing so he gave a further commitment that his Government-the Fraser Government-would fulfil during the period of this Parliament, all of its policy commitments as set out in the Prime Minister's policy speech of 30 September. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Governor-General has brought a very real sense of prestige and ability to the position that he so ably fulfils. In coming here to speak in the Parliament he continued the high standard that he has set in his public activities throughout the nation. I have very high respect for Sir Zelman Cowen and I am grateful for the contribution he has made to Australian life and to the high office of Governor-General. At the same time I want to identify myself most particularly with the form of words before the Senate as the Address-in-Reply; that is, that we as senators express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign and thank His Excellency the Governor-General for the Speech which he was pleased to address to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Last evening the Prime Minister and in this chamber the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Carrick, spoke directly about the engagement announcement of Prince Charles. I identify myself again with the expressions of loyalty to the sovereign and of joyfulness with the royal family in the happiness of that announcement. I think there are times such as this Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General's Speech when it is appropriate, not just in symbolic terms and not just by general reference, to note the strengths, the unity of purpose and the continuing momentum and tradition of our Australian origins that the monarchy supplies. The Queen of Australia is very much respected and looked to by the Australian people. On such an occasion as the Governor-General's Speech there are high emotions in the chamber when not only senators and members, packed in shoulder to shoulder on special seats added to the chamber, but also many guests and representatives of the diplomatic corps in Canberra are present. I can only say that it is a splendid occasion which is really a fitting beginning to a parliamentary session. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, as a Liberal senator listening to that address by the Governor-General I was all the more heartened and encouraged because it was my party's and Government's program which the Governor-General was announcing. His reflections upon the direction of the Government's program for the coming three years were very much reflections on a program for which I had worked hard in the election period and which had been worked for through the high degree of consultation and dialogue which Ministers and back bench members pursued here in Canberra inside and outside the chamber and with the people of Australia. I like to think that I contributed some small part to the program which the Governor-General announced. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also usual on these occasions to make some reference to the election itself and to the immediate consequences in the re-arranged ministry. I regard the election result as another great win for the Fraser Government in terms similar to those of 1975 and 1977. This Government has now been elected most substantially and by very significant popular support at three elections in a row. There is, however, a tinge of disappointment in the actual result of the latest election in that I believe too many of our Liberal colleagues were defeated by very narrow margins. I believe 13 lost their seats. That is disappointing because I believe the Government's program, its legislative achievements and its fulfilment of policy promises were sufficient to have won it an even better result than the good result it achieved. As everyone may recall, in the early weeks of October there was a great deal of media speculation that the Government was even more directly threatened. I did not share that view. Nevertheless, I believe that in those first two weeks in October the Liberal campaign unfortunately did not sufficiently portray its strengths to the ordinary people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, in this Address-in-Reply debate I was reflecting on the election result of last October and noting that for the third time in succession the Fraser Government had been elected by an overwhelming popular vote. I also noted my smaller disappointment that some 13 colleagues, Liberal Party members of the Parliament, had lost their seats. I indicated that I believed that this was a loss for the Liberal Party beyond what should have been the result had we communicated the real strengths, the real achievements, the real policy gains, the real legislation that had been achieved in the preceding Parliament-not in the least comparable to the alternative program put forward by the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was a sense of disappointment that our success was not greater. I think the reason can be summarised by saying that we needed much more of a human face in the presentation of our policies to the people of Australia during the election campaign. It is all very well for me as a Liberal back bencher to be aware of the strengths of my own Government, of the Fraser Ministry, and to know that Liberal philosophies are being followed carefully in the foundation of what we are doing for the benefit of all Australians; but it is very important in the campaign context for those too readily assumed strengths of the Liberal Government actually to be communicated to the ordinary voters of Australia. This sense of identification by members of this Government team with ordinary people, communicating in ordinary language, should not involve too much grandstanding, should not involve our commending ourselves but rather should allow the natural dialogue and strength of our policies to become evident and allow the people to make their own judgment. I believe that had we been better at campaigning our policy strengths would have been better supported and perhaps my colleagues would not have lost their seats. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course in South Australia we had a particularly pleasing result in that whereas across Australia in first preference voting terms the average swing towards the Labor Party was 5.5 per cent, in South Australia it was only 1.8 per cent-the smallest swing in any of the Australian States. I believe that this was a direct result of the particular campaigns of Liberals in the House of Representatives and the Senate, not the least being those of Ian Wilson in the Sturt electorate and Grant Chapman in Kingston. Another contributing factor was the very real success of the Tonkin Liberal Government in its first 12 months in office. The identification of the State Premier of South Australia with the Federal campaign in October could not have been greater. He stood shoulder to shoulder with us in commending Liberal policies to South Australians. He was one of our most frequently used speakers in media advertisements. The confidence that the Premier of South Australia inspired in South Australians was, I believe, a factor in the very good result that we had in South Australia. In fact, in South Australia, in two party terms the swing was as low as 0.9 per cent compared with a two party preferred Australian average of 4.2 per cent. So once again, South Australia stood out as an area of very significant Government support. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the three by-elections held last Saturday, the South Australian vote was once again distinctive in that in the Boothby by-election there was a swing to the Government despite the long established track record of results at by-elections leading to swings against governments. The people know that a by-election will not lead to the fall of a government and they try to show some degree of criticism, some peppering of the government that is then in office. This happens whichever party is in power and it happens in any of the Western democracies. But in South Australia there was a swing to the Government and Steele Hall's result in Boothby is, I believe, further confirmation of support for him as a candidate, for the Liberal Party in South Australia and for the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the composition of the Ministry that was appointed following the election result. I support the decision of the Prime Minister to reduce the number of Ministers in that with the reduction of the Ministry by one and the re-arrangement of portfolios into a more rational grouping, we have a smaller government and a trend towards making sure that we fulfil our Liberal principle of opposing big government and of getting decisions made closer to the people. The welcome change to the composition of the Ministry meant that the Senate now has six Ministers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Chaney notes, they are very good ones. I point out that not only have Senator Baume and Senator Messner been appointed to the Ministry as a result of the election but also Senator Chaney has joined two other Senate Ministers in the Cabinet. So, as a result of Liberal senators' strong requests to the Government, the number of senators in the Ministry has been increased from four to six and the number of Senate Ministers in the Cabinet has been increased from two to three. This is a welcome change and I urge the Government to add another senator at each point of restructuring the Ministry so that in the not too distant future one-third of the Ministry is comprised of members of this chamber. This clearly is the path for the Government to follow in the involvement of Ministers from the Senate. It does not agree with the minority point of view that some honourable senators genuinely hold that there be no Ministers in the Senate. I am one of those who are very much opposed to this so-called reform that would take Ministers out of this chamber, this half of the Parliament. I believe that in the debates of this chamber Ministers bring a sense of direct responsibility in what we talk about and a direct answerability on the part of the Executive Government under question from senators. This makes it a much more realistic and responsible chamber for debate. If there were no Ministers in this chamber it would become a debating hothouse in which all manner of topics could be discussed without our really engaging in the practical responsibility of governing this country. I believe that strongly and I welcome this trend in the rearrangements of the Ministry following the election whereby there has been a substantial increase in the number of Senate Ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the Governor-General's Speech itself. He spoke of the key elements of the Prime Minister's policy speech and outlined five areas in particular; youth employment, the economy, caring for people, the Public Service and, finally, foreign affairs and defence. Briefly, in the time available to me, I think it would be profitable to add some comments of my own to each of those five areas. Youth unemployment is clearly the most tragic social problem facing our country, and that is why it has received maximum priority in the policy decisions of the Government. The programs of assistance for transition to employment, to encourage employers to take on apprentices and other employees, the present review calling for public consideration of better ways of helping under 18-year olds than simply giving them the dole hand-out, are examples of responsible initiative by the Government which I support. </PARA>
<PARA> There was an immediate reaction by a few in the community who said: 'What a scandal. After the difficulties which unemployed youth have suffered in these years, to take the dole away from them is cruel and horrendous'. I believe they are short-sighted and are superficial in their reaction to what in fact was an alternative announcement by the Government. Surely we must be able to do much better for those unemployed under the age of 18 years than allow them to remain as dole receivers. So I believe we must give very careful public attention and seek the views of every area of the community as to how we can improve the transition scheme and other schemes for better assisting unemployed youth. </PARA>
<PARA> One view which I have held for many years now is that unemployed young people do not have a fair go in Australia in competing with adults in trying to gain jobs in the market-place. When a school leaver-perhaps seeking an unskilled job, of which there are fewer and fewer-goes to an employer and applies for a job, he competes with middle-aged women, with adults in their twenties, thirties, or even in their fifties who, in many cases, have a degree of maturity, skill and stability. Those qualities may well lead the employer overwhelmingly to choose the more mature, more reliable and more skilled applicant. Therefore, the young person who has to compete for that job is not getting a fair go. He is not able to say: 'I want to receive 80 per cent of an adult wage for six months in order that I may gain some skills, some experience, and may learn from my involvement in this company so that I can then say to an employer that I am worth the full wage'. I believe we need to see a restructuring of wages so that young people can get a fair go and can compete in the market-place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Governor-General talked about the economy, the importance of restoring healthy economic growth, of maintaining, as a first priority, the fight against inflation and of encouraging the private sector. The Governor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA> My Government will give particular attention to encouraging the growth of the private sector and to increasing the freedom of choice of taxpayers in spending their own incomes. It will be an important policy objective to continue to restrain public expenditure so as to provide scope for reducing the burden of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA>The emphasis in those words was on reducing public expenditure, and I believe that is the realistic option before the Government in this parliamentary period in order to reduce the burden of taxation. The Government has already made decisions this week that the alternative options of an indirect tax, whether a retail tax, a wholesale tax or some other form of indirect tax, have inflationary consequences which would outweigh the benefits of their being introduced and would have complications in terms of the timing of their introduction and the machinery for their implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> The real alternative, to gain the kind of tax relief that so many Australians seek, is to ensure that public expenditure comes under increased scrutiny and that we see careful economising in the area of the present Commonwealth Government programs. The committee which has been set up to review the functions of government and which has been called the razor gang still, despite media rumouring, will present a hard hitting, careful assessment of those functions which need to be eliminated, those functions which need to be reduced, those functions which need to be transferred to the public sector or those functions which need to be transferred to the States. It will be seen in the coming weeks what that committee of review brings to the Cabinet and what the Cabinet decides on Sir Phillip Lynch's committee's recommendations. I believe the findings of that committee should not be razor thin, as the media speculate, but should truly be evaluations of those functions which we need to re-arrange to economise on our expenditure and to fulfil more faithfully our responsibilities as the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Governor-General's address directly referred to caring for people and in particular referred to Australian families. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> My Government has already introduced a number of measures designed to assist families. It will be looking closely at its policies with the objective of further enhancing the position of Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe the first of the two reforms that should most capture the Government's attention to fulfil that statement of intention by the Governor-General should be the actual achievement of the income-splitting proposal which was put forward by a back bench committee of Liberals in the Parliament, chaired by Ian Wilson. Secondly, the Government should substantially increase the family allowance so that it more than catches up with its previous purchasing power which has been eroded by inflation since it was introduced in 1976. This means that it is now of much less value to families than it was when it was first introduced. I continue to welcome the Fraser Government's introduction of the family allowance and I believe it should be substantially increased. I am aware that earlier tonight I talked about expenditure restraint and about easing the taxation burden. The only way in which the family allowance can be increased with real equity and the only way in which personal income tax can be reduced, I believe, is for the family allowance to be part of taxable income. (Quorum formed). </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth area to which the Governor-General referred was the Public Service. He was quick to acknowledge that the Government appreciates the contribution which the Public Service as a whole makes to the life of this country. Nevertheless, there needs to be a review of the functions with which the Public Service is directly involved. With that in mind I wish to underline the need, as I see it, to review the superannuation provisions for public servants under the Commonwealth Superannuation Act and under the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances (Increases) Act so that the superannuation provisions of the Commonwealth are much more in line with the ability of the community to pay in every area of Australian life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Governor-General's Speech, which lays down in very broad outline the program of the Fraser Government for the next three years. I wish to give most of my attention to what has happened since the Governor-General's Speech was delivered. On 5 December last year the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) sought to give some philosophical underpinning, if I may use that grandiose phrase, to what in the words of Gilbert and Sullivan might otherwise be described as 'a bald and unconvincing narrative'. In a sense it was an attempt to create order out of chaos, to offer Liberal members of Parliament some understanding of what they are all about, a feeling which has clearly eluded them over recent months. In Adelaide on 5 December the unhappy Senator Chaney had to deliver a speech on behalf of the Prime Minister to a gaggle of the Liberal Party faithful.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am told that it was a very well-attended function. It was a sea of blue rinse, I can imagine. Senator Chaney was the unhappy mouthpiece unveiling the latest wisdom. I use the expression 'mouthpiece' advisedly, reminding myself of the American underworld phrase 'If you get the right mouthpiece you will get the electric chair'. Unfortunately, the unhappy Senator Chaney got the electric chair just a few months later. I do not wish to dwell on the details of the speech which was given by Senator Chaney on behalf of the Prime Minister on 5 December. To dwell on the details would be tedious indeed. I wish to concentrate on what I might euphemistically call the highlights of the speech, if there were any such things. Let me begin by quoting the opening paragraph of the speech, which, of course, is very significant. The Prime Minister said, through Senator Chaney:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the conclusion of his address to parliament, the Governor-General indicated that the Government believes that it is important to explain to the Australian people the philosophy which shapes its policies and actions. This seems an excellent opportunity to make a start. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the speech is all about. In the speech there is a reference, which borrows freely from American political history, to what Liberal Party people describe as self-evident truths-things which are self-evident to members of the Liberal Party but which are clearly evident to no-one else in Australian society. That is what the speech is all about. It is designed to explain to Australians the self-evident truths which are so apparent to members of the Liberal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech is high on questions such as the importance of freedom of choice, a concept with which I would think no member of this Parliament particularly disagrees. There are thinly veiled references to the grey socialist societies of the Northern Hemisphere. I do not think that anybody in this chamber seriously disagrees with this strongly argued concept of freedom of choice. But what is ignored throughout the speech is what these concepts mean in reality in the context of the Governor-General's Speech. One is entitled to ask: What choices are available in Malcolm Fraser's brave new world of 1981 which were not available in Australian society previously and to whom are these new choices available? What choices, one is entitled to ask, as a result of five years of Fraser Government are available to the unemployed? What new choices are available to the sick, particularly the uninsured sick? What new choices are available to the uneducated as a result of the policies enunciated in the Governor-General's Speech and the previous five years of government? What new choices are available to young people in Australian society? Are there more or fewer choices? Is there a widening or a reduction in the range of choices for the average Australian? What the speech has to say about freedom of choice was interesting, but what does it all mean? It goes on to talk about beliefs in checks and balances. We are not told to which checks and balances it refers but interestingly we are told the following:</PARA>
<PARA> It--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, liberalism-</PARA>
<PARA>believes that society is healthier . . . when responsibility, enterprise and power are spread widely throughout the community rather than concentrated in one or a few places. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the ideal to be aimed at and any deviation from it requires special justification. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an old story but, again, what does it mean? What does the whole notion of checks and balances mean in terms of the relationships between State and Federal governments in Australia? What does it mean in respect of thousands of small businessmen, when we have the highest number of bankruptcies amongst small businessmen in the history of this country? What does the concept of checks and balances mean to them? What does it mean out of the mouths of members of a government which has cut the budget and the staff of the Trade Practices Commission by 20 per cent in real terms and which has amended the legislation to make it less effective in terms of monopoly in Australia? What does the notion of responsibility and enterprise being spread amongst a number of people in a healthy society mean in respect of all those actions of government?</PARA>
<PARA> In this chamber this afternoon Senator Jessop expressed his profound admiration for American society. I have a degree of admiration for American society but the things about it which I admire most are the things which we just do not have here in Malcolm Fraser's brave new world. We do not have real trade practices legislation or freedom of information legislation in an effective sense and we have none of the mechanisms for making competition in private enterprise vigorous and really working in an effective sense in this country. Whenever this Government is confronted with those desirable ideals about which it talks it backs off in favour of its great and powerful friends in the corporate sector, who really do not believe in vigorous freedom of enterprise, vigorous competition, real trade practices legislation, freedom of information legislation and things of that kind as the Americans do. </PARA>
<PARA> What does this sort of thing mean when it comes from the Fraser Government? What does it mean in terms of freedom of information and trade practices? What does it mean in respect of the system of broadcasting in Australia and the newspaper industry in Australia? What does it mean when the State of Victoria has to have a public inquiry into media ownership in that State because people are very concerned about it? What does it mean in respect of the Government's rumoured commitment to changing the broadcasting legislation in order to help the companies of one particular great and powerful proprietor? I now quote from a very distinguished authority on this question. I refer to none other than Mr Rupert Murdoch who in an interview with More magazine in the United States of America in 1977 stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I think it would be a pity if I grew any bigger in Australia . . . That would be against the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>Six months ago a body which had been established by this Government to police the public interest found that Mr Murdoch's enterprise's getting bigger in Australia was against the public interest. That body acted on Mr Murdoch's own advice of 1977 and said it would not be in the public interest for him to get bigger in Australia. This present Government is now about the task of amending the legislation as a consequence of that decision to try to get him off the hook. That is inconsistent with his own philosophy of 1977, is inconsistent with the philosophy of the Liberal Party of Australia throughout the years of this century since broadcasting began, and is totally inconsistent with the garbage contained in the speech delivered by Senator Chaney on behalf of the Prime Minister. </PARA>

That is the matter about which I believe we have to be concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A section in the speech deals with the benefits of private enterprise to Australian society and the benefits of private property. Nobody in this Parliament takes issue with the importance of that point as a matter for serious political discussion. It is of no use the Prime Minister rushing around tilting at Leonid Brezhnev, because he is not a member of the Australian Parliament. We do not have to deal with him. Nobody is particularly concerned about him. The subject of debate surely is: What are the desirable limitations on unrestricted private ownership, what are the benefits to Australian society of private enterprise and private property, and what are the things which derogate from the public good in terms of the application of private enterprise? There is no mention of that in the speech. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech went on to say, in what I would have thought was a piece of lightly dancing over the truth historically, that private enterprise is responsible for unprecedented improvement in human conditions over the last 30 years. I would have thought that that was an oversimplification. That is one proposition which would be difficult to sell in the People's Republic of China where there has been considerable progress over the last 30 years without the benefit of private enterprise and it is one proposition which I think would be difficult to sell in the social democratic countries of Western Europe where there is both private and government enterprise working side by side in a balanced relationship. Of course it is very interesting that throughout this speech, which espouses the Fraser Government's philosophy for the 1980s, the social democratic societies of the Western world are completely ignored. Sweden, for example, is a society which is ignored. No mention is made of the balance between private and government enterprise in a country such as Sweden.</PARA>

When a person talks about private enterprise being the basis and the condition for the establishment of a free society and ignore a society such as Sweden, he is talking a lot of rubbish because Sweden has had freedom of information legislation for 150 years. This lily-livered Senate is still messing around with a sort of milksop version of what that country has had for donkey's years. I would have thought that in a sophisticated community these were the ingredients of a society in which freedom was allowed to run as far as possible. They are not based necessarily on private enterprise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one were to look at the question of the social democratic societies of the Western world one should surely see that the political debate in Australia should not be directed at these absurdly ideological questions of whether private enterprise is all good and public enterprise is all bad or whether public enterprise is all good and private enterprise is all bad. What we should be looking at is the nature of the sort of mixed economy which would best serve the Australian community. In the present debate we have heard this blind ideological discussion where corporate raiders of the private enterprise sector look at the public enterprise sector in Australia and say: 'We will have that nice lucrative bit of Telecom's work. We will have road transport but we will not have the railways. We will have a bit of the airlines but we will not have the difficult routes which are expensive to operate. We will have the best bits everywhere and then we will be able to say, ''My God, are we not efficient because we have the profitable bits of all the enterprises in Australia''.'</PARA>
<PARA> That is what the argument in this country should be about. The argument should be about the sort of mixed economy that a country such as Australia should have. It should not be based on the blinkered ideological rubbish, which is apparent in the newspapers at the moment, which has been created within the environment by the Fraser Government. The sharks of Australian industry feel they can grab the most lucrative bits for themselves in this laissez-faire environment-this absence of leadership-which has been created by the Federal Government. I make my point in the terms of a very distinguished writer, Fred Hirsch, who was the author of a very important book entitled Social Limits to Growth. He summarised the point I am trying to make with the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> The principle of self-interest is incomplete as a social organising device. It operates efficiently only in tandem with strong supporting social principles. </PARA>
<PARA>We need strong supporting social principles in this country. We will not get them from the private sector. We never have. The private sector is based on self-interest. We will get them from governments which are enlightened and thoughtful about the issues which I have been attempting to discuss. In this very important speech I wish to quote a passage which sets out the virtues of private property. The Prime Minister had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> It spreads throughout society the habits of free activity-the ownership of property, the disposal of one's own income by freely made decisions, the right to decide between security of employment and the risks and rewards of entrepreneurship, the freedom to enter into voluntary contracts. </PARA>
<PARA>According to the Prime Minister, these are some of the things which spread like some healthy virus from private enterprises. Let us ask ourselves again: What percentage of the Australian people have those freedoms which he enumerates in that passage-the freedom to spend one's money as one wants, the freedom to enter into entrepreneurial activities, the freedom to own property as one wants, the freedom to make decisions between security of employment and other matters? What sorts of freedoms are available as a result of five years of Fraser Government? How are they better? What are the choices? I might quote from the great poet, T. S. Eliot, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Human kind</PARA>
<PARA> Cannot bear very much reality. </PARA>

Of course the truth of the matter is that the Prime Minister did not write this speech at all or address his mind to any of these issues. I will come to that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know you have read it, Senator Chaney, but I am telling you that the Prime Minister did not write it. I do not know whether I have sufficient time to examine the nice little passage on the role of the State. The role of the State under this Government has not declined at all. Sixty-four expensive promises which were made in the last election will increase the role of the Federal Government in Australia. Look at what has happened over the last five years. All that has happened is that powers which previously were exercised by the national government have been diverted to the States. The State public services have mushroomed while the Federal Public Service has remained static. That is not much of an achievement in dealing with the role of the State as the Prime Minister has expressed it in this speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next principle dealt with by Senator Chaney in delivering this speech was what is called the principle of 'Conservatism'. There is a very eloquent and high-sounding statement on the principle of conservatism in this speech. It is summarised in the passage which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Conservatism on the other hand stresses the need for a framework of stability, continuity and order, not only as something desirable in itself but as a necessary condition for a free society. </PARA>
<PARA>Speaking only for myself, I do not have much difficulty in agreeing with that proposition. Conservatism does have some very important values to offer to a society, particularly a society undergoing rapid change. In fact, this is a very sound expression of traditional conservative principle. But where is the stability, the order and the continuity in the policies of this Government which the principle of conservatism espouses? Where are all those things? Where is the continuity, the order and the stability in the resources boom which is taking place in Australia? Where is the continuity, the order and the stability in the relationships between State and Federal governments? Where is the continuity, the order and the stability in the delivery of health services and other services to the Australian people? Where is the stability, the continuity and the order in the manufacturing sector of Australian industry? All these questions loom very large in a speech which is not related to the realities of the society of Malcolm Fraser in 1981. It is a speech dealing with a fantasy world. The fascinating thing about this speech is that throughout it there is no reference to equality. The word 'equality' is not used. The word 'freedom' is used again and again. What I suspect is meant by 'freedom' in the context of this speech is the freedom to make as much money as you like if you have the opportunities without running the risk of paying death duties or probate duty, without running the risk of paying a capital gains tax or a wealth tax and without running the risk of clamp downs on your tax avoidance schemes. Those are the sorts of freedoms which have been talked about in this speech if there is no reference to equality. Let me put it in these terms. There is not even any reference to the concept of equality of opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> Without some reference to the relationship between equality and freedom the concept of freedom is meaningless to the Australian people for whom this speech is meant to be of benefit in understanding what this Government is doing. If you believe in freedom to work but there is no equality of opportunity to work, if you are unemployed, for example, it is a meaningless freedom. If you believe in the freedom to spend money-bearing in mind that 2 million of our population have not enough money to spend-freedom to spend money means nothing because there is no equality. That is the most extraordinary omission in the speech. If you believe, for example, in freedom from fear-and half the population of this country, many poor people, are uninsured in respect of medical and health services-there is no freedom of fear because there is no equality. That is why the Labor Party sought in years gone by to introduce a universal health service in this country. If you believe in freedom before the law, as I think we all do, and there is no adequate legal aid system, there is no freedom before the law because there is no equality. Freedom and equality in terms of political concepts are very closely bound, very closely interwoven. They are the essential ingredients of the good life to which all Australians are entitled. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech given on 5 December in Adelaide by Senator Chaney on behalf of the Prime Minister made no reference to those things. This point is very interesting because a comparison of the speech with the Liberal Party platform reveals that the platform is full of talk about equality of opportunity, for example. Anyone who looks at Senator Puplick's seminal little work called Liberal Thinking-the little blue book-will find a whole chapter on the question of equality. Although I have my differences with Senator Puplick I admit that he knows what it is about. The section on equality begins by saying this: 'From what we have said about dignity and freedom it follows that the concept of equality will always play a central role in any liberal philosophy. We all of us have an equal claim for our dignity to be respected and are entitled to receive equal consideration from governments and to be held in an equal position with all other citizens before the law'. And so it goes on. Of course that is, if I might say so, the basic tradition of the Liberal Party which became a very thin strand in the speech of 5 December which is described as the philosophical basis of the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing in the speech about the relationship between equality and freedom. One must ask the question: Why not? I will tell honourable senators why not. It is because the Liberal Party, the great Liberal Party of old Bob Menzies and young Chris Puplick, has been hijacked by a bunch of B-grade academics from red brick universities. That is what has happened. The great Liberal Party of the past has been hijacked by a collection of academics. What has happened is that the academics have written all this stuff for the Prime Minister. I can see him asking Owen Harries in December: 'For God's sake, what are we doing here? What is it all about? Can you put something down on paper for us?' Off he went to put down on paper this unreal garbage which has nothing to do with the record or the program of the Fraser Government at all; nothing to do with the great traditions of the Liberal Party of Bob Menzies and Chris Puplick to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that by referring to this matter the Liberal Party speakers, in the months ahead, will frequently quote from this speech given on behalf of the Prime Minister on 5 December-'The Philosophical Basis of Liberalism' for goodness sake! When they read that speech they will know what they are on about; they will understand what it is all about, what they are doing here and what they are getting paid for. All those things will come back to them. When the Liberal Government takes away the dole from young kids its supporters will be able to give us a lecture about what this means in terms of freedom of choice for young Australians-new freedoms of choice introduced by the Fraser Government! When the Liberals have a few tensions in their party they will be able to quote this passage:</PARA>
<PARA> There is always a certain tension involved between liberalism and conservatism. Liberalism always emphasises the freedom of the individual. </PARA>
<PARA>So if honourable senators opposite get a few tensions they will be able to quote from that passage to tell us all about them. When they introduce broadcasting legislation to help Mr Rupert Murdoch they will be able to tell us how much they believe about the division of power in Australian society, the desirability of division of power and polycentric power as distinct from centralist power. </PARA>

When the Government introduces yet another change to Australian health services it will be able to tell us about the conservative principle of order in Australian society which is stressed so much in this speech. At the end of it all I suppose we will all be in an even bigger mess than we are now. Let me give honourable senators opposite a bit of advice: Stick to the old pragmatic survival stuff and do not start to mess around with philosophy. That would be very dangerous for a party such as theirs. At the moment it is a time to face realities. There is a yawning gap between all this waffle in this speech and the reality of the Governor-General's Speech. For those reasons, on behalf of the Opposition I move:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise in this chamber the subject once again that I raised during Question Time yesterday with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) regarding the Aborigines who had been evicted from Gordon Downs station. I think it is important that I read into the Hansard the response from the Minister to show that somewhere along the line there has been either a misunderstanding or perhaps a mishandling of the truth. I have grave fears that it is the latter rather than the former. I asked the Minister:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . what action will be taken by the Federal Government in the future to safeguard Aboriginal rights in relation to traditional homes on station properties, particularly in the State of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked the Minister what action would be taken as a result of the report of the officer of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs who had supposedly gone to speak to the 50 members of the Gordon Downs Aboriginal community who had been expelled from that station. In response Senator Baume said:</PARA>
<PARA> An officer of my Department did go to the area and did consult with the Aboriginal people. It has been quite difficult in the last few weeks, because of the wet, to travel in the area around Halls Creek to get to Gordon Downs and to complete the consultation. Although Aboriginals have a right of entry on to pastoral stations in Western Australia, the pastoralists are not compelled to provide services or accommodation for them. The matter of the people from Gordon Downs is properly one for the Western Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA>After some interjections, in a supplementary question I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Is the site chosen by the group to which the Minister is referring known as Ringers Soak? If so, it has nothing whatsoever to do with the community that I am talking about from Gordon Downs. </PARA>
<PARA>I am quoting from page 15 of the Hansard of 24 February. The Minister responded:</PARA>
<PARA> I have been advised by my officers who have been in the area and who have spoken to the Aboriginals that the answer I gave is correct-that the Aboriginal people who were so cruelly expelled from Gordon Downs do not wish to return to the station and that they do wish to settle at the site chosen by the group, a site called Yaruman or Ringers Soak. That is my advice. I have no reason to doubt that it is correct. </PARA>
<PARA>This afternoon a member of my staff spoke to people in the area where these people from Gordon Downs are now staying, that is, in the Halls Creek area. The Minister admitted that it has been quite difficult during the past few weeks because of the wet to travel in the area of Halls Creek. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did advise the Minister's office. I advised the Minister's office at 5.10 this afternoon that I would be the third speaker after the suspension of the sitting for dinner. If the Minister has not received that message I can suggest only that the officials in his office in Parliament House are working no more efficiently than the officials in his Department in Western Australia, if the information he gave to this chamber yesterday, as he asserts, is correct. At the moment the people from Gordon Downs are still living in deplorable conditions in the Halls Creek area. They have been provided with tents and canvasses. They did not make any mention of any provision of food. They are living in wet and swampy conditions. They have inadequate ablution provisions, and the whole scene at the moment is deplorable. At the moment they consider that they will have to move to higher rocky ground to escape the mud and the wet. They have problems with other people bringing alcohol in amongst their community. This is something that did not apply when they were living on the Gordon Downs station. They are concerned that they will have to move away from that area if they cannot get to Ringers Soak very shortly, simply because of the alcohol problem and so that they can remain together. I am assured that their main concern is to get land so that they can restructure their community. That is the first point. They are at present living in deplorable conditions in the Halls Creek area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the second part of the answer which the Minister gave me yesterday. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the Aboriginal people who were so cruelly expelled from Gordon Downs do not wish to return to the station and that they do wish to settle at the site chosen by the group, a site called Yaruman or Ringers Soak. </PARA>
<PARA>My information is that they have been offered-not that they want to go to Ringers Soak-a small portion of land at Ringers Soak officially designated as a temporary site. I am also given to understand that that could mean a period of as little as 12 months which means that at the end of that time they then have to move their entire community just so that they can stay together. The Government can now say: 'Well, we are not going to provide you with any necessities because you are going to be here for a short time only. You are still on a temporary site'. Anybody who has lived in Western Australia knows what happens to temporary sites in that State because of the political attitude of the Western Australian Government. Senator Kilgariff is in the chamber also, and I would suggest that he should be well aware of the temporary site situations in the Northern Territory. Many of them have been turned into permanent situations where the Aboriginal people have not had the opportunity to get back to their own land. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked the Minister whether this site had been chosen by the group. He said that he had been assured that it had been chosen by the group. I am equally assured that it was not chosen; it was offered. In my visits to the Kimberleys-I go there fairly frequently-during 1979 and 1980 I was constantly being asked what was happening to the applications that had been made by this community for the State Government to excise part of the Gordon Downs station. I think I should make the point that what they wanted was a small strip of land on the southern part of Gordon Downs, a part of a pastoral lease known as Coronado to the north of that leasehold and some vacant Crown land which would have provided them with a reasonable amount of land and a viable amount of land for pastoral activities. That application was rejected because, according to an article in the West Australian of 31 January this year, there happens to be uranium exploration in the area. So, what is new? The article reported what the Minister for Lands in the State Parliament, Mr Wordsworth, said. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the exploration was one of the reasons why he had rejected a special lease application from the community last year. </PARA>
<PARA> However, Mr Wordsworth said that temporary reserves for uranium in the area would not affect any government plans to establish a settlement on a smaller piece of vacant Crown land around Ringers Soak. </PARA>
<PARA>He did not tell us whether the vacant Crown land around Ringers Soak is a viable pastoral leasehold for these people to go to and try to become independent and to keep their community together in conditions that they consider to be safe. But he continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It was government policy that pastoral leases remain as intact, viable economic units. </PARA>
<PARA>He did not make any mention of the fact that Coronado is held by absent leaseholders, that there has been no improvement, and that it has not been worked as a pastoral property for some time. The article went on:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Wordsworth said that the Government had dropped its policy of stopping the granting of pastoral leases to Aboriginal groups. The policy had been instituted during the Noonkanbah dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, during that massive dispute that we had in Western Australia last year, the State Government moved to stop granting pastoral leases to Aboriginals per se. It stopped entirely. Incidentally, that article went on to say that that community asked the Minister, Mr Wordsworth, to reconsider its application for the excision of land from both Coronado and Gordon Downs and the application that it had put in for the small amount of Crown land that was necessary. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It claimed that the area it wanted from Gordon Downs was of little economic importance to the station; that Coronado was held by absent and unproductive lease-holders and had never been developed; and that it could be resumed technically because of non-compliance with the lease covenants. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter said that the community comprised members of the Djaru people who wanted the land to allow them to re-establish control over important sacred sites. </PARA>
<PARA>We have had many debates in this place and in the other chamber about sacred sites, sites of significance and traditional land. In a little while I will read into the record the Western Australian Acting Premier's reference to traditional land. It does not seem to have occurred to anybody that sacred sites, sites of significance and traditional land, depending entirely on who is using those phrases, could mean one and the same thing. The white man's term does not necessarily apply to the black man's language. </PARA>
<PARA> Also in the newspaper appeared a few words from Mr Hassell, the Minister for Community Welfare. Mr Hassell has not had a particularly good record in community welfare in Western Australia. He has been quoted as having said that he will wash his hands of the whole affair because he does not really want the bother of tracking down the leaseholder of Gordon Downs into the Northern Territory where, apparently, Mr Sherwin resides. I will come to that in a little while. In the first instance, I think it is rather important to give a detailed account of the whole matter. Whilst the Press in Western Australia have played a magnificent role in this instance-I admit to having been very critical of the role of the print media in particular on a number of occasions in this place-I want to say that I congratulate it on the handling of this matter. It has made the people of Western Australia aware of what has happened to this community. It is continuing to apply pressure to ensure that something is done to try to counteract the reputation that Western Australia has gained over the Noonkanbah debacle last year and the attitude that has been constantly expressed by members of the Ministry in the State Government. I want to make it quite clear that it was 13 days after the expulsion before even the Press was aware that this had happened. I suppose that that 13 day gap could be said to have been the fault of the Aboriginal community because it was concerned that if it was learned that the community was not on the property some mischief could have been done to what could be called its sacred sites, its traditional land, its site of significance. </PARA>
<PARA> An article on the front page of the West Australian on 15 January under the heading 'Aborigines told to go', pointed out that the new owners of the Gordon Downs station property had been told to leave. It does not give any reason because no reason is known even now, as far as I know. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> About 55 members of the community-including eight old men-are living in poor conditions in Halls Creek . . . </PARA>
<PARA>At that stage they were living in poor conditions at Halls Creek. I have already told the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs that when I spoke to people in the area this afternoon I was told they were still living in poor conditions in Halls Creek. They have been there now since just after 2 January. It is about time someone got off his bottom and made sure that their conditions were a little better than poor. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Many of the people were born on the station. Some of the men have spent all of their working lives there as stockmen. </PARA>
<PARA> It is understood that up to 100 Aborigines have been living on the station. Some of the men are travelling to ceremonies and others have gone to the Aboriginal community at Balgo mission. </PARA>
<PARA> A Northern Territory pastoralist, Mr Peter Sherwin, took over the Gordon Downs lease from the British Vestey group in the middle of last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Sherwin said yesterday that her husband was not available for comment. </PARA>
<PARA>The article stated that the new member for the Kimberleys, Mr Bridge, was endeavouring to raise the matter with the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in Perth on that same day. I understand the Minister was appearing at the summer school at the West Australian University. Whether he actually spoke to Mr Bridge or not I do not know. But it is important to point out to the chamber that Mr Bridge has an Aboriginal background. He has lived in the area for many years. His family has lived there. He knows Halls Creek and he knows the Aboriginal communities. What he would have to say about the Gordon Downs situation would be based on his personal knowledge. The article on 15 January continues:</PARA>
<PARA> An adviser to the Aboriginal communities in the Kimberleys, Mr T. Stephens, said that he understood that the new management of Gordon Downs had approached the Commonwealth Employment Service in Kununurra to get help in obtaining white stockmen. </PARA>
<PARA> This, presumably, was to replace the black stockmen whom he had told to get off his property. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> A group of Aborigines at the station, headed by a man called Mick Rallah, had been trying for several years to have some land excised for their own use. </PARA>
<PARA> But this had been stopped by the State Government's ban on the transfer of pastoral land to Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA> What a magnificant reputation. The Government had placed a ban on the transfer of all pastoral land to Aboriginal communities. The article further states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Acting Premier, Mr Old, said last night the Government knew that a problem existed with the Gordon Downs people at Halls Creek. </PARA>
<PARA> A Community Welfare Department officer had been sent from Kununurra to investigate it. He was expected to report today. </PARA>
<PARA> We have never heard what that report to that Minister was. Until I asked the question yesterday we had not heard about the report to the Minister in this chamber. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Old said he did not know the circumstances that had led to the people leaving the station. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the people were old and Gordon Downs was their traditional land. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister admitted that. I have already spoken about traditional land, sacred sites and sites of significance. I believe that they all mean one and the same thing. It is no good saying that we will determine which is which, because the black people in Australia want the right to determine which is their land. It really does not matter what they call it. What does matter is that we accept what they call it, that we acknowledge their right to it and we should make sure, where possible, that they get it. But it is probably the first time that a Minister in the Court Government of Western Australia has ever used the phrase 'traditional land'. I think it is an admission on the part of the Government that it recognises that it is so. Once again, in the West Australian on the following day, 16 January, Senator Baume is reported to have said that he was concerned about the expulsion and that his Department was sending an officer from Kununurra to investigate and that he would be reporting. We had to get that report from the Minister during Question Time yesterday. Senator Baume is reported to have said:</PARA>
<PARA> If the reports are correct, we would be seeking the return of the Aboriginal people traditionally associated with Gordon Downs to their original location pending the outcome of discussions or any alternative arrangements that may prove necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume said that his department would be seeking talks with the station management, the Aborigines and the State Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether they have been able to have any contact with Mr Sherwin because he has not been accessible to the State Government. I doubt very much that he has made himself accessible to the Federal Government because he has thumbed his nose at both. He has said: 'I do not want to discuss the matter and you are not going to make me'. Both governments have backed down and said: 'No, that is quite all right old fellow. Carry on. We will acknowledge that you have a right to treat Aborigines as you like'. The Minister for Community Welfare in Western Australia, Mr Hassell, decided that it might be worth while his getting in on the act. All he said was that he was awaiting a report on the situation. Goodness only knows where he was going to get his report from. Was he going to get it from Mr Old's report or was he going to confer with the Federal Minister? We have not heard any of that. The chairman of the Aboriginal Lands Trust, Mr Ken Colbung, suggested that, in actual fact, there is already provision in the State Parliament for the Western Australian Government to provide those Aboriginal people on Gordon Downs with that land under the Aboriginal Heritage Act. So now we have not only the Lands Act in on it but also the Aboriginal Heritage Act. No one is moving under any of those Acts. The Aborigines are still sitting in Halls Creek. They have been there now for almost seven weeks in the wet. Quite frankly, I do not know how they are feeling, but I am quite frustrated about the whole matter. </PARA>
<PARA> We move on to the report on the front page of the West Australian of 17 January. For three consecutive days the West Australian has seen fit to bring to the attention of the people of Western Australia and, we hope, the people of Australia what is happening. It turns out that when three of the men from the community went from Halls Creek back to the station they found that 50 dogs had been shot and poisoned. At the same time the State Government and the Federal Government were accepting that Mr Sherwin was unavailable for comment. I wonder what the situation would have been had those doys belonged to white people. Surely there would have been prosecutions under some Act? We have already got in enough of them, so perhaps we can drag in the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. As a matter of fact, the general secretary of that Society said that the Aborigines should lodge a complaint about the poisoning of the dogs. I think the Senate would agree that it is pretty reprehensible that a man should shoot and poison dogs, just as it is reprehensible that a man would turn off his property 50 Aboriginal people, including young children and old people. The West Australian of 17 January reported as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> A meeting of members of the Gordon Downs community in Halls Creek yesterday called on the Federal Government . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This was a report which appeared on 17 January, so presumably on 16 January the Federal Minister received a communication of some sort asking for help immediately to re-establish their camp on the station. The Minister said yesterday that they did not want to go back to the station. Yet in the West Australian it is reported that they had communicated with him. The report says quite clearly:</PARA>
<PARA> A meeting of members of the Gordon Downs community in Halls Creek yesterday called on the Federal Government to help them immediately re-establish their camp on the station. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister said in this chamber that they did not want to go back to their station, that they wanted to go to Ringers Soak. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what the newspaper said was communicated to you in a letter of 16 January. Once again, we see the entrance of the Western Australian Minister for Community Welfare, Mr Hassell. He has decided that he had better say something a little more constructive than 'I am awaiting a report'. The West Australian carried the following report of Mr Hassell's remarks:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Community Welfare, Mr Hassell, said an officer from his department and from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs had taken steps to ensure that members of the community in Halls Creek had shelter and food. </PARA>
<PARA>The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Attempts to contact Mr Sherwin had not been successful. There were problems with the telephone link to Mr Sherwin's Northern Territory station. </PARA>
<PARA>Apparently that is where he had gone. The report then went on:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hassell said he was advised that pastoral leaseholders were entitled to exclude people from their leases. </PARA>
<PARA> However, Section 106 of the Land Act conferred on Aborigines the right at all times to enter pastoral leases in areas which were unenclosed and unimproved to seek sustenance in the accustomed manner. </PARA>
<PARA>One has to question what is meant by 'the accustomed manner'. It seems to be a pretty ridiculous phrase to put in legislation anyway. We do not know what the accustomed manner of those Aborigines who were resident on the Gordon Downs station is. Are we suggesting that the accustomed manner is as they lived perhaps 20 years ago where they hunted all their own food, or are we suggesting that they could then petition to the station management for sustenance in the form of food and accommodation? It is a ridiculous statement to be contained in legislation, but then anything can happen in Western Australia. The Western Australian Government likes to have a little bit of two bob each way. It put up the Lands Act and the Aboriginal Heritage Act, and one contradicts the other. It asked for a report from the Aboriginal commissioner attached to the State organisation. What did it do? It ignored his report. It ignored a report that it had specifically requested from the museum authorities. It said: 'Go up and get a report on what is happening in Noonkanbah'. So it got a report on what was happening in Noonkanbah or what the likely results of oil exploration on Noonkanbah would be. When it was brought back the Government would neither release it nor act on that report. This is the two-faced attitude that is being adopted by the Western Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There is legislation to enable pastoral leaseholders to tell people not to go on to their properties. At the same time, there is legislation which enables or entitles Aborigines to go on to pastoral leases. Where on earth are these people going? They do not even know which particular piece of legislation they come under. They do not even know whether they are entitled to be on this land, or whether they are entitled to be told to clear off. I remind the Government that some of these people, and presumably their families, were employed on Gordon Downs. If it were a strictly industrial situation, what has happened could be considered to be a lock out. The Government has not taken any action in that regard either. No reasons have been given for the dismissal or the eviction of these people. The State Government has sat on its hands and the Federal Government is doing exactly the same thing. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, I congratulated the print media on the way in which they handled this story. There have been two very important leaders. Time is getting away from me, so I will not have time to read both of them. A particularly important one appeared on 30 January, which was 15 days after the Press first became aware of what had happened and a full month from the time that those people were evicted from Gordon Downs. We all admit that the West Australian is not the most progressive newspaper in the country. I do not think anyone will quarrel with that statement. Under the leader 'Feeble effort', this is what the West Australian had to say:</PARA>
<PARA> What a feeble attitude the State Government has shown over the expulsion of 50 Aborigines from the Gordon Downs cattle station in the Kimberleys. What a contrast to the determination shown over Noonkanbah. </PARA>
<PARA> Unable to get in touch with the Gordon Downs leaseholder, the Minister for Community Welfare, Mr Hassell, has simply given up. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the man who said he was waiting for a report and then said he could not get one. I repeat:</PARA>
<PARA> Unable to get in touch with the Gordon Downs leaseholder, the Minister for Community Welfare, Mr Hassell, has simply given up. No explanation, so end of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Never mind that the Aborigines appear to have been harshly treated, legally or not. </PARA>
<PARA>How one would legally harshly treat a group of Aborigines I do not know. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>To the Government, apparently, it is just one of those things. </PARA>
<PARA> Others, however, will see it as further evidence that in Western Australia Aborigines are people to be pushed around. </PARA>
<PARA>The article concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>Like Pontius Pilate, Mr Hassell might be able to wash his hands of the matter. It may not be so easy for the State to wash another stain from its reputation.</PARA>
<PARA>This article is contained in a conservative newspaper in a very conservative State under the most conservative State Government that one is ever likely to come across unless of course one makes a comparison with the situation that pertains in Queensland. But the conservative Press in the conservative State of Western Australia has been prepared to come out and say that the State Government is wrong. I am standing here tonight saying that not only is the State Government wrong but also the Federal Government is wrong because it has not moved on this matter. It has done nothing. It has been sitting on its bottom for nearly the last seven weeks while people are living in deplorable conditions. These people have canvas shelters and tents. We are told that it just happens to be the wet in Western Australia. The wet comes round every year. Almost invariably with the wet comes problems with Aboriginal communities. We have a problem in Western Australia not only because of the State Government but also because of what is happening to people on communities such as Gordon Downs and Noonkanbah. It is time that the Federal Government stood up and was counted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister for Aboriginal Affairs) (9.22)-I start by reminding the Senate of the maiden speech which we heard earlier tonight and by adding my congratulations to those already made to Senator Hearn on her first contribution in this place. I am rising only briefly tonight to respond to a couple of points made by Senator Coleman in her speech. The important thing to keep in mind is that we have to think about the interests of the Aboriginal people at all times. I want to be certain that nothing said in this chamber will diminish opportunities to advance the best interests of the Ngoonjuwah people in the very difficult situation that has arisen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator has raised a whole series of matters only three of which I wish to address now. I wish first to say something about what I understand the wishes of the community to be. I think it is fair to make known to the Senate the information I have which indicates the wishes of the communities in this matter, to set down the sequence of events insofar as they need to be filled in and perhaps to say something about the present position. I think not all honourable senators will know the story of what has happened at Gordon Downs. Senator Coleman has with a little rodomontade--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Coleman" NAMEID="5V4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With what?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is just an English word. The honourable senator has filled in some of the details. The fact is that the Aboriginal people from Gordon Downs were evicted by the station management on 2 January and they then moved to Halls Creek. The people have established a camp at a rock hole about one kilometre east of Halls Creek town centre. Since that time they have been assisted by the Western Australian Department of Community Welfare with emergency needs. The honourable senator has also referred to those and given her opinion of their adequacy. I must say that my Department has been concerned to try to assist in finding some longer term solution. When that solution is found my Department will try to assist in providing longer term facilities for the people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Arrangements were made for senior officers of my Department to go to Halls Creek as soon as they could with officers of the State Department. Not all honourable senators will know that the arrangements made in Western Australia link very closely officers of the Commonwealth Department with officers of the State Department. Commonwealth officers went with those from the Department of Community Welfare and also with a member of the Aboriginal Lands Trust. In addition to those groups which attended the meeting on 23 January at Halls Creek were Mr Peter Yu from the Kimberley Land Council and Mr Ribna Green, the Aboriginal resident community worker training officer for the Ngoonjuwah Council at Halls Creek. The reason that 23 January is an important date is that it is about a week later than the newspaper report to which the honourable senator referred. I think that is approximately right. </PARA>
<PARA> We had to be careful that the wishes expressed in the newspapers at one time were contemporary wishes. I will suggest to the honourable senator in a moment that the report I will give of the outcome of the meeting will indicate a different set of instructions. I am not saying that the honourable senator's information of a week earlier is wrong. I am simply saying that my information, dated from 23 January, is the information that I want to put before the Senate. The people I have mentioned met with about 30 members of the Gordon Downs community. The purpose of the trip was explained at the meeting and three members of the community were nominated to travel with the group to Ringers Soak to look at the place. The purpose of the trip was to confirm with members of the community the actual areas on which they wished to re-establish themselves. Ringers Soak had been suggested as one of them. </PARA>
<PARA> The communal group had been split over the last two years. This is the point; some of them had been living on the station while others had moved into Halls Creek. The community had not been unified, and that is not an unusual condition in Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal communities. But, there had been a split in the communal group. Some of the people, in fact, had been camped at Ringers Soak. They assured Government representatives nevertheless that they were all members of one group in the sense that Senator Coleman used the term; that is, they were one group in terms of language, clan and other factors. In fact, the people are incorporated as a group and have office bearers such as Mr Lightning Djooringah and Mr Mick Rahlah, who is the vice-chairman, representing them. </PARA>
<PARA> The spokesman for the group confirmed to the departmental officers that all of them-approximately 80 people-wanted to go to the area they called Yaruman, the area around Ringers Soak, and that none wanted to return to Gordon Downs homestead. That is the first important point that emerged. Up to that stage we had been uncertain as to whether the Aboriginal people wanted, as the first option, to go back to Gordon Downs. They did not want to go back; they made that clear to the officers. That fact has been reported back to me. But, the people did more than that; they also provided a copy of a letter they had recently written to the West Australian Minister for Lands seeking reconsideration of their earlier request to obtain a large area of land to which the honourable senator referred. It covers vacant Crown land and excisions from Gordon Downs--</PARA>

Members of the group reported that though they had retrieved very few of their possessions from Gordon Downs unfortunately there had been contamination by dog carcasses. This is another example of the total unpleasantness of the whole situation. Their dogs had been poisoned or shot. They stressed that they wished to return to the area known as Yaruman or Ringers Soak as soon as possible. They were concerned about staying at Halls Creek for reasons which I think Senator Coleman has set out. They were concerned about overcrowding and about social pressures particularly those related to the presence of alcohol. The impression that we got was that the move to Yaruman, to Ringers Soak, was a preferred solution of the group.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator is adding a qualification. That may be right or it may not be right. The area is about seven kilometres south of the Gordon Downs homestead. It is not a long way. The honourable senator drew attention to the association with the land which these people have. The Ringers Soak area is part of their country as well. It is as much their land as any other part of the area. They would still be in their own country, in their own land. A number of factors make Ringers Soak quite attractive, including the location of airstrips, the capacity to service the area with community services and the fact that there are transport possibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I think I said yesterday, the Western Australian Government has decided to grant a temporary lease of 3,500 hectares over this area. A temporary lease apparently is what it issues straightaway while it is examining other possibilities. I hope that in due course the Western Australian Government can proceed to a more permanent grant of land in that area or in one of the other areas. I do not think Mr Sherwin's actions, this precipitate eviction of people, should go unanswered. We are anxious now to provide support for this community when it is set up at Ringers Soak. The honourable senator made light of the wet, but we cannot move to establish or to build facilities which we are planning until we can get good access to the area. The Federal Government has already informed the Commissioner for Aboriginal Planning that it will provide financial assistance for basic facilities on the land made available to the group near Gordon Downs. If further proposals for financial assistance are put to us, they will also be considered. In other words, we are very anxious to help with what the group needs, namely, money to establish itself. </PARA>
<PARA> I think I agree with everything the honourable senator said about the unsuitability of Halls Creek for what the Aboriginal group needs. So I do not want to talk for too much longer except to say that the honourable senator referred to Mr Ernie Bridge, the local member of the Legislative Assembly, who has been very helpful throughout this whole episode. The honourable senator is not the only person who has consulted with him. The consultations I have had with him have confirmed in my mind what I felt within myself-not what I heard from officers-that the action we are taking is appropriate and acceptable to him. I just place that on the record too because he is the Labor MLA for Kimberley. That is another point to be remembered. In summary, the relocation at Ringers Soak appears to have the backing of the community involved. </PARA>

<PARA> Finally, on checking on the situation today our afternoon reports are that Halls Creek has been cut off by floods and that we are now having to airlift food into Halls Creek. It is a very severe wet at the moment which is creating very great difficulty. We are seeking urgent reports on the situation, but it emphasises the access problems which the Aboriginals have and the sorts of problems which will be associated with moving and relocating them. It is one thing to have the intention, the desire and the commitment of resources. It will be another thing actually to do it physically. I do not think this situation will be helped by politicians trading insults; I do not think that will help it at all. I think what we have to do is to continue to build on every bit we can.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to use this Address-in-Reply debate to raise an issue which I believe concerns more Australians at the moment probably more closely than almost any other. It is an urgent matter for clear-cut and decisive action by this Parliament, which I hope we will get. I refer to the state of health care in this country, a region of general muddle, inefficiency and a quite terrifying escalation of costs which must stop. I assert that it must stop because I think it has become more than just a financial matter but an actual danger to many members of the community. Matters have reached a stage at which the cost of insurance to meet health needs has become a frightening burden to tens of thousands of Australian families, especially those with children, and it shows no signs of getting any better. This should be a matter of great concern to this Parliament and should be, as I said, an area of action soon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have the opportunity to take that action because a report which was presented to the other place today and which will be presented to the Senate tomorrow-the Jamison report-would allow us surely at least to come to grips with this problem after so long. It is a truly complex and massive problem and in no way do I underestimate it. I hope that the Senate can at some time provide ample time for full debate on it because the Australian Democrats do not pretend in any sense to a monopoly of wisdom in this area-far from it-nor do I believe can anybody else. But we think it is so important that we must raise it. In doing so I will make some comments on the Jamison Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals which I trust will be tabled in this place tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem overall is so massive that I think it will require an honest and co-ordinated effort on the part of all concerned. That has been lacking in the past. It needs the Federal Parliament, State parliaments, the Australian Medical Association, the Doctors' Reform Society, hospital administrations and all other areas of interest and possible input to get together to try to sort out the mess. If ever there were a job of importance for a government to carry out with success, surely this is the one. I do not think from my contacts with the community that anything is really more important to the general well-being and indeed to the peace of mind of most Australians than the knowledge that they can have access to efficient, practical and effective health care at reasonable cost. They do not have that knowledge now. They certainly do not have that assurance. Are we all going to give up? Are we going to say that government, the medical profession and hospital adminstrations have failed? Are we going to continue to flaunt our failure and to say to the Australian people that they must continue to bear the burdens of higher costs and perpetual worry about family health costs?</PARA>
<PARA> When an issue becomes too troublesome and too hot to handle governments can remove it from the public arena by establishing a commission to inquire into the problem. A possible approach by government is to set up a commission of inquiry, to set it impossible time deadlines and to insist on quick results. When such a commission presents its report a government committee can extract those elements it thinks suits its philosophy or its ends and ignore the rest. The more various and numerous the recommendations are-and they are very many and various in the Jamison report-the denser the smokescreen that might prevent all but the most careful inquirers from detecting a process of heavy selection. I trust that that unsatisfactory fate is not in store for the Jamison report. It has already been much criticised in the media and elsewhere as naive and ambivalent in its important basic themes. One of those is that the cost of health care must stop accelerating. I think the Australian community and indeed every honourable senator in this place would agree with that proposition. We cannot really see any reason why these costs should not come down. Certainly they ought to be able to come down, provided some chronic maladies of the system can be cured. </PARA>
<PARA> The Jamison report also stresses the thought that the private sector rather than the public sector ought to be encouraged in the health care area. The Australian Democrats and I are not altogether sure that in the region of health care those two objectives can be reconciled. Selling health care is not like selling shoes or butter or motor cars and, indeed, it ought not be like that. Possibly our problems are associated a good deal with the fact that it is getting too much like that, and if that is a criticism of wide areas of the medical profession then let it be so: It is intended that way. </PARA>
<PARA> I propose to tell the Senate a story I heard recently, to me, a very disgraceful but at the same time, illuminating story. A constituent of mine, like many other ladies, regularly and prudently has pap smear tests to ensure that she does not have cancer. For many years her doctor had these smears processed by a public sector pathology facility which sent out a card promptly and regularly notifying the results. However, this has changed in recent times. A private pathologist has come into the act at a very high fee. Fair enough, one might say, but on one recent occasion the lady did not get the pathologist's bill. She had paid previous bills. Perhaps she should have asked for a bill, I do not know. She waited for some time then rang her doctor's office to see what was the result from the smear test. She was told that the results of that test could be released only after she had paid the pathologist's bill. I suppose that is a normal commercial judgment but, I asked myself, what would have happened if the lady had thought: 'Perhaps everything is okay. I won't worry about inquiring. They might let me know if anything is wrong'? Would that pathologist have done anything about it if in fact that person had needed urgent medical attention? I suppose there is an ethical problem here which derives directly from a commercial approach and certainly needs some examination. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats are a private enterprise party but we believe in private enterprise being enlightened. It must be responsible. It ought to concede that it has a primary duty to the community to provide a service and that is perhaps more important in the medical profession than in any other area of private enterprise. Doctor friends have complained to me about the shrinking public esteem of the medical profession. I can only say, as I have said to them: Is this to be wondered at when we hear stories of the type I have just related, to say nothing of the story about the group of seven pathologists in South Australia who earned $6m gross in one year and another about a doctor who can afford a private helicopter to service his string of blood shops, as I believe they are called in the trade, around Sydney? Such things are becoming notorious and if the private sector of the medical profession is to continue to be allowed to make a contribution to health care in this country and if it has any conscience at all it must smarten up, get its own house in order and through some process of effective self-regulation force out of business these ghouls who are grossly exploiting this community or at least get them to the stage where the rewards given to them are reasonable, even by medical standards because they are certainly not reasonable now. I say that there should be self-regulation because, of course, most doctors are honest and decent men and women who do want to provide a service. Those decent ones, I suggest, have a special responsibility to clean up the unsavoury areas of their own profession because unsavoury areas there certainly are and the public is becoming increasingly aware of them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats feel that the huge volume of health costs is coming from several major maladies which ought to be recognised for what they are and ought to be corrected. We do not believe that they are beyond solution: Far from it. The first of these would appear to be over-treatment, a controversial subject, I know. A volume of evidence suggests that 80 per cent of the costs of medical treatment are doctor initiated, for one reason or another. Statistics from various parts of the world where health maintenance schemes exist suggest that many procedures would appear to be quite unnecessary. What I am saying is that in areas in America where there are health maintenance schemes there are much lower rates of certain types of operations, certain types of procedures, than in adjacent areas which are statistically much the same and which are deemed to be nuisance control groups where a fee for service situation prevails. This is a reality and I think it is something that has to be considered in Australia. Should we have significant changes towards a health maintenance scheme and by that I mean a situation wherby a group of doctors perhaps with a hospital or with other supporting professional people charges a flat fee to a certain number of people a year with the job of keeping them healthy? So it is in their interest for the patient to be kept healthy, for preventive medicine to take the accent and for a proper system of health maintenance to be adopted rather than there being a situation whereby if something goes wrong with a patient the doctor makes money out of it. We are all human beings, doctors included. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest this is a terrifyingly bad basic approach to any type of service to the community. I know this has been said before but I say it again without apology: I think it is something which this Parliament must look at as an option for Australia. I think a proper, honest change towards health maintenance would have a much greater effect than the recommendation of the Jamison report that patients ought to pay a certain proportion of medical costs themselves and that they should not be reimbursed completely by insurance. That is at first sight perhaps an attractive proposition. One says: 'Joe Blake will go along to the doctor with a sore toe because he thinks it is not going to cost him anything'. But this brings us back to the estimate that only some 20 per cent of medical costs are patient originated. One wonders really whether the deterrent to the patient of paying a small sum of money would be as great as seems to be envisaged. I wonder whether the patient who is worried about himself will be deterred in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> The Jamison report has had some hard and just words to say about hospital accounting. From the report it does seem that many areas of health care in the hospital region are unduly expensive. It is not hard to find examples which I propose to mention to the Senate. The Jamison report castigated the hospitals for their inability to identify just what these huge areas of spending within their budgets had amounted to. They seem to be very careless over their accounting. </PARA>
<PARA> There is much controversy over expenditure on intensive care units and I believe, and the Australian Democrats believe, this should increasingly become a matter of community debate. Intensive care is very expensive. Its results in restoring not only life but a reasonably healthy life-I think that is an important consideration-are in many cases doubtful. Should the community proceed indefinitely along a line of thought which says that every human being should be kept alive for as long as possible and by whatever means possible, and if hospitals costs are huge now what will they be in another decade's time if this principle is to be actively projected into the future? If it can be questioned then, it ought to be questioned now and that is something else which I believe the community itself should make decisions on, not doctors. Some doctor friends of mine say that a grave ethical question is involved. So there is, but I think it is an ethical principle, a question of priority which the community itself ought to be able to consider. </PARA>
<PARA> Associated with this area of hospital costs could be the question of extensions of hospital services and equipment. I was in Perth earlier this month and I noticed that the Health Care Consumers Association had criticised the Western Australian Government's approval of spending three-quarters of a million dollars on a new body scanner for the Royal Perth Hospital. Three-quarters of a million dollars for one piece of equipment is a lot of money and one wonders whether some hospital administrators believe they should have a completely open cheque for hospital costs and that the community somehow ought to meet any cost whatsoever which will further some health aim. This, I suggest, is contributing to the dangerous situation I mentioned earlier where people are being forced into a situation whereby they cannot afford health care. That is a very dangerous situation for any community to allow itself to come to. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote briefly from an account in the West Australian of the criticism by the Health Care Consumers Association. It pointed out that this purchase gave Western Australia its fourth scanner while interestingly enough there were only four such scanners operating in the whole of Britain. A spokesman for the Association, Judyth Watson, was reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> We already have more scanners per head of population than Britain, yet the government is going ahead with the purchase of another. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a really crass decision for them to make at this time, when so many essential health-care services are being cut due to a supposed lack of funds. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the case in Western Australia where even nursing services were being cut by the Government apparently because of lack of money. Judyth Watson went on:</PARA>
<PARA> It is just another case of duplication of services already available to patients. </PARA>
<PARA> These scanners do nothing for the actual treatment of patients. They simply make the diagnosis more pleasant and safer. </PARA>
<PARA> The final outcome and treatment is not aided. Perhaps the money could have been better spent on preventive medicine.'</PARA>
<PARA>I am sorry to say this plea appears to have fallen on deaf ears. The article further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Health, Mr Young, said RPH had put up a sufficiently valid case for a new body scanner. It should be installed within a year. </PARA>
<PARA>Such a view must assist the cause of those who are worried about proposals in the Jamison report for block funding to States and who believe that if this recommendation was adopted then extension services, community health services and things of this kind might suffer because the money would inevitably go through the sort of government institutional way of budgeting to expensive institutionally oriented equipment and services. There again on this question of hospital control I think it is worth noting at this point the Jamison report's recommendation, supported by other enlightened people in this area, that area boards ought to be instituted instead of hospital boards in Australia so that there is not necessarily a feeling that the hospital board is responsibly only for what goes on within the walls of its institution but that it has responsibilities to a general area of the community and in fact should provide community health services and various other things to that area. That one recommendation alone, if implemented-the Government could encourage it-might make a tremendous difference in the long run to the way in which our hospitals are run and the way in which their costs are escalating. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a huge fact of importance in the report, one so vast that the mind boggles at it although it is very simple. According to the Jamison report, some 60 per cent-I repeat, 60 per cent-of hospital beds in Australia are occupied by people over the age of 65. Many of these cases simply are geriatric cases which could be accommodated in hospitals especially designed for them and in which I am assured they would be much happier and would be much better treated, and most of which would involve a very much lower bed cost than the general hospitals which are now accommodating them. As a layman, I feel that if our medical planning has reached the degree of insanity which that single fact demonstrates, it should not be too difficult to make improvements. Surely, in this case if the decision makers have allowed our hospital facilities to be misused to that extent through lack of planning they ought to be properly castigated. Every effort should be made to induce them to develop a more balanced situation of smaller hospitals which provide all facilities and which would certainly provide hospital accommodation as well for elderly people but still with health care nearby and with domiciliary care also in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> These things are well known in the community. Why can the hospital administrations and those concerned with health care not actually do it instead of moaning, screaming and complaining about higher costs and then throwing up their hands and saying that nothing can be done about it. Of course something can be done about it. That is one thing that could be done very quickly. Nursing homes represent major and expensive problems. I shall quote now from the report of the Auditor-General on efficiency audit of 13 February of this year which in fact was released today. It is the report of the Auditor-General on efficiency audit of Commonwealth administration of nursing home programs. It would have arrived in the offices of most honourable senators, I believe, today. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> More than 50,000 people received benefits in 1979-80 and Commonwealth expenditure on the programs in that year exceeded $340 million. </PARA>
<PARA>That is no mean sum. The report observes:</PARA>
<PARA> A number of studies report that 20% of nursing home patients could more appropriately be cared for in alternative accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA>We come back to the same problem of a lack of planning and of a misuse of facilities because nobody has thought about the future clearly enough. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> If this is so the additional cost to the community is in the order of $72 million p.a. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, a not inconsiderable sum which the community would have removed from its health cost budget. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Of more than 137,000 admissions in New South Wales from 1973 to 1980 only one was rejected. </PARA>
<PARA>This indicates the lack of proper control over this area of admission to nursing homes. I have a friend, a social worker, who deals in this area, and she says that a lot of this work is done on the telephone. Of course, when one rings up a nursing home and says: 'Can you have this patient?' the home asks: 'Does he or she need intensive care?' They want a certificate from a doctor to the effect that intensive care is required. Why? Not because these people need intensive care at all but because the nursing home gets an additional $6 per patient on that basis. That is something that should be looked at very promptly. The Auditor-General's report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Over-expenditure by the Commonwealth could have exceeded $4.2m because of nursing home owners calling patients 'extensive care' unnecessarily and getting an extra $6.00 per day per patient. </PARA>
<PARA>So it is not just the Democrats making this statement; it is there in one of the Government's own reports. I should have thought that our health administrators who considered ducking that sort of thing would look at that and say: 'I have a duty in all conscience to do something about that'. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> 50% of non Government nursing homes in New South Wales during 1979 overstated wage costs costing the Commonwealth some $2m. If this is so in other states, then we are being 'ripped-off' by $4m. </PARA>
<PARA>Again a not inconsiderable amount. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In 3 cases in New South Wales, false information submitted by nursing homes cost the Commonwealth $159,649. </PARA>
<PARA>That is relative peanuts by governmental standards but still to most average people a large sum of money. The report of the Auditor-General cites as problems accommodation of more than the number of patients approved for the hospital-this is known in the trade, I believe, as cramming-charging more than the approved fees, reducing wages for staff without notification and charging for services not provided. I should have thought from that that there was an area that the Commonwealth Department of Health or whoever is responsible for this might look at quite quickly. Indeed, all of us would be glad to see that done. It is again an example that there are gross errors of waste and mismanagement in our health care area which are the real problems and that those real problems are being ducked or evaded by those who are paid huge salaries in this society to deal with those problems. It is time they were brought to book. If they cannot do their jobs properly, let us fire them and get somebody in who can do them. I think it ought to come to that stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know. I am aware of that. The profit motive is the problem. I mentioned earlier that, although we are a private enterprise party, I did not believe that private health care and private enterprises were always reconcilable, and that was one of my reasons for saying that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to medical insurance. There is something in the Jamison report which worries me a lot and which worries the Australian Democrats. If indeed we are to accept-there are rumours that the Government may well do so-the Jamison report's recommendation that the Commonwealth benefit be removed from people who should be able to take out private insurance and do not do so, then the Australian Democrats believe that a very liberal and compassionate interpretation of need or disadvantage will have to be associated with that. This is because-I refer to my earlier point-very large numbers of families who could not necessarily be called poverty stricken or disadvantaged just average families, are in quite difficult financial circumstances. Those financial circumstances are not getting easier, the way things are going in the community. In many cases the wife worked and lost her job. These people have very real problems. The financial constraints on them are harsh and real. That is why they are not taking out health insurance. It is not because they do not want to have it or because they are lazy; it is because it it too expensive for them and they are setting it against other things and are taking a calculated risk. A decent, reasonable society should not force them to take that risk, especially when the health or our next generation and of our children is at stake. </PARA>
<PARA> Say the Government does take this action and does use a big stick against these people. Will they take out health insurance in large numbers if the benefit of $20 is taken from them? I doubt it. I do not think it will make any difference at all. The proposition may seem tempting and easy as a categorical government action, but I assert that it ignores the reality for many Australians in funding health care. As a government action I suggest it would achieve very little except to cause a great deal of hardship and to exacerbate the problems which already exist. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer briefly to recommendation 35, which is another very hairy one. This is the one which calls for an immediate investigation into a scheme of taxing benefits received by all free patients, that is public patients, in public hospitals. The degree of intrusion into people's affairs and the administrative horrors that this raises, worries me greatly. I suggest that honourable senators might think about that and consider whether they would agree with me that it is unworkable and wholly undesirable. </PARA>
<PARA> A better prospect lies in the subsequent proposition in recommendation 36, which urges the Government to establish a working party to devise a health insurance scheme which:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . satisfies the principles of equity, freedom of access, and payment by those who can afford it, and promotes universal participation. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are good words. They are not cliches. They mean, and ought to mean, something in this society. I repeat:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . satisfies the principles of equity, freedom and access, and payment by those who can afford it, and promotes universal participation. </PARA>
<PARA>No major political party in this country has demonstrated when it has been in government that it is in any way competent to develop an effective and equitable health insurance system. Its philosophical hangups have prevented a satisfactory consensus. That satisfactory consensus is the only way in which we will ever get to first base in relation to this problem. Political expediency or ideology instead of the only barometer which should matter in society-the needs of the people-has dictated the terms of health insurance. The past decade has seen a tragic situation of change after change in the health insurance system. It is the one thing in a society, one would think, that ought to stay stable, that people ought to be able to rely on. It is the one thing that governments ought to leave alone and not tamper with for political reasons, because it affects so many people so fundamentally. Each change has led to more confusion and less understanding for the public and has undermined confidence in the system, so that that confidence is now at the lowest possible ebb. That also is tragic. </PARA>
<PARA> The failure to contain, to rationalise or even to explain costs, because the medical establishment sets itself like God above any explanation, has, as we know, led to thousands of people deserting the system. They will go on deserting it until something is done. Government has no reason to congratulate itself for that state of affairs; it will have been the fault of government. It will have neglected a job for which it was put into power and which it is paid to do. It has failed to do it effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that the working party should involve not only insurance bodies, government officers and health administrators but also consumer groups, State authorities, health commissions, professional organisations and appropriate education authorities, all of whom from time to time have had points of view to express but have too often not been listened to. Without such broad participation we risk losing sight of a health system which can provide the highest possible standards of care without bankrupting the country, as was the case in Britain, or bankrupting the patient, which can be the case in the United States of America. Recommendation 36, we believe, is one of the most positive of the Jamison inquiry's proposals. It is no mere cliche but is something which could well be undertaken by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Jamison inquiry has, we believed, laid bare the problems, warts and all. It has presented some plausible solutions. It has clearly defined the problem areas and the shortcomings and it has provided the framework, the guidelines for a more extensive study of the problems, leading perhaps to a complete overhaul without the impositions, the pressures created by decisions made piecemeal or merely for political expediency. The Australian Democrats would deeply regret and urge the Government against snatching any sort of piecemeal, small decision from the report. We are worried about certain reports in the Press, which may or may not be true, that the Federal Government is contemplating rushing headlong into the field and introducing hasty legislation to implement isolated individual recommendations which might satisfy one section of the community without considering the ramifications that such legislation would have on the rest of the community. That is what we do not want to see happen. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole report, every point, every issue, needs to be analysed-not by an interdepartmental committee established by the present Government, which committee we would quite readily expect to be appointed, with due respect to its members-to produce opinions in line with the Government's policies. So far this Government is no different from its predecessors in this respect in that it has not been able to solve the problems. That, after all, is what it is there to do. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that what is required is a more broadly based inquiry, perhaps even an all-party parliamentary committee which would consult and involve all concerned with health and hospital administration, health insurance, the handicapped, the aging and so on. We know that this will take time. It will take trouble. There is no way in which this problem will be solved easily or quickly by anybody, but if we have waited the 80 years since Federation to begin looking at the problems constructively perhaps we can wait a little longer to find this time equitable and real solutions to these problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Address-in-Reply debate affords honourable senators an opportunity to canvass a whole number of issues. Obviously, honourable senators have availed themselves of that opportunity. My purpose in entering the debate this evening is to talk about a matter which has not been raised in this Parliament in the Address-in-Reply debate to the Governor-General's address. I wish to speak about electoral reform. Before I do so I extend congratulations to Senator Jean Hearn on her maiden speech this evening. She put forward a variety of views which express in a very forthright way the philosophical position of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian labour movement. She expressed the aspirations, expectations and desires of our movement to build a better society, which is clearly on the agenda for the Australian people. She applied herself also to the problems of the undeveloped parts of the world-the Third World countries-and the widening gap between the rich and the poor. Senator Hearn, by the manner in which she dealt with these matters, I think produced an unusual situation insofar as a very considerable number of senators were in the chamber when she made her contribution. I congratulate the Government and Opposition senators who listened to her when she made that contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I support the amendment moved by Senator Button which indicts this Government for its lack of concern about the growing unemployment, the state of the economy, the reduction in living standards, the high taxation and the rising level of inflation in this country. This is one of the few opportunities that the Senate has to deal with these matters, which are of considerable substance and of considerable concern in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is a matter of great regret and it is always unfortunate when the office of the Governor-General is perverted for party political purposes. We saw this in 1975, we saw it at the opening of the Parliament in 1977 and we saw it last year in the Governor-General's address at the opening of the Thirty-second Parliament. In that address the Governor-General referred to the people of Australia returning the Government, to use his words, 'with a substantial majority'. Let us look at that statement that the Government had been returned with a substantial majority. In the time that is available to me I will deal with the electoral imbalance, manipulations and frauds that make up the substance upon which the Governor-General's Speech relied. Lest the people of Australia are misled by the words of the Governor-General and the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that the Government was elected with a substantial majority I wish tonight to clarify this matter by looking at this so-called substantial majority and in so doing bringing to the attention of the Senate and the people of Australia the inadequacies of the present electoral system in this country. I do so in my capacity as shadow Minister for Administrative Services, with particular emphasis on electoral matters. I hope to focus some attention upon the deficiencies of the existing system. I hope that ultimately there will be a vigorous, rational and tripartisan debate on the whole field of electoral reform and the representative parliamentary democracy that ought to flow from a proper electoral system. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that after the election results were announced late last year there was considerable disquiet in the community regarding the fairness and justice of our system of electing representatives to our Parliament. It is true that the Labor Party has been aware for a considerable period of the inbuilt bias that exists in the present electoral system. But when it became apparent to the public at large that Mr Fraser and his Government had been returned with so many seats in their control when there had been a substantial swing to the Labor Party, the questioning and perplexity in the community grew. That was seen in a number of editorial comments, letters to the newspapers and important articles written by those concerned, as they are, with the imbalance that now exists in the national Parliament with respect to the total majority vote of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> It should not be necessary for me to point out that the credibility of our parliamentary institutions is at stake, because justice must be seen to be done as well as be done. Statistics that have been prepared by our own Parliamentary Library-I think they cannot be challenged-show that in national two-party preferred terms the minority party, the Australian Labor Party, polled 49.8 per cent for the House of Representatives and the coalition parties polled 50.2 per cent. That was a margin of 0.4 per cent for the Government. When the seats in the House of Representatives were counted and allocated the Government controlled 73, or nearly 60 per cent of the total number. The Labor Opposition's 51 seats were a mere 40 per cent of the number of seats. </PARA>
<PARA> The people are entitled to ask whether this is a fair system. Is this really what democracy is about when such imbalance can occur because of the way in which the electoral system operates? The question has been asked before, and justifiably, because since the major alterations in electoral redistribution were made by the Chifley Labor Government, which first took effect in the 1949 Federal election, the Labor Party has secured on more than five occasions in that intervening period, on a national two-party preferred vote, a majority of votes-in the years 1954, 1961, 1969, 1972 and 1974-and yet has gained government only twice for a total of three years out of 33 years. One needs only to refer to those three years when Labor was in government to appreciate how the entrenched conservative majority in the Senate reacted and acted during that period to negate even that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Anyone who is involved in politics-let us not beat about the bush; let us accept the facts for what they are-knows that when electoral commissioners are appointed they are appointed for the purpose of contriving to bring about a desired result. Consequently, electoral redistributions take place which invariably, in the great majority of instances, favour the government of the day. That is a matter that cannot be contested. They would not be appointed to those positions to carry out a redistribution unless they produced a result that was satisfactory to the political party occupying the majority view in the Houses of Parliament. It will be argued that in 1949 the Chifley Government, in appointing the commissioners, did so on the basis of equity and fairness and that it was the principle factor in bringing about the changed political situation at that time. It will be argued that men who occupy some positions of influence and power within our community are beyond political persuasion and influence. Those who believe that believe in fairyland. Those who believe that influences do not exist even within the judicial system do not understand, or do not want to understand, the way in which these things operate. </PARA>
<PARA> The present electoral system is designed to prevent a majority of votes returning to power a party with a majority of seats. That electoral system has been manipulated over the years by successive coalition governments-denying the basic majority viewpoint. This has been expressed in the number of seats held in the lower House. The 1980 result did not provide a majority of votes for the Labor Party but the result was very close. We do not criticise that. It is proper that a party which does not get the majority of votes should not have the majority of seats. It is this closeness which serves to bring home the discrepancy between the seats held and the seats gained. If we had a proper electoral system the representation in the lower House today would be something along the lines of 65 seats for the coalition parties, the conservative parties, and 60 seats for the Opposition, the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> This system operates in this way because we have been persuaded for a great number of years to rely upon the proposition that single member constituencies provide for clear majorities, enabling a government to work effectively. I suggest that that factor is not relevant, is not fair, is not pertinent and is not democratic. The present situation exists to pervert the democratic process. The present situation persists to ensure that only a Liberal-National Country Party government enjoys an inflated majority. Even when the Labor Party received a clear majority of votes on a two-party preferred basis in 1972 and 1974, it will be recalled that it still had a struggle to find a small parliamentary majority. While ever we have a single constituency basis for our electoral voting system, Labor can never expect a large majority. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation has caused many letters to be written to the newspapers and many comments to be made in special articles in a number of the more thoughtful journals in our community about the need to change the emphasis away from the single member constituencies. Of course, the situation is very starkly shown if one looks at the result of the 1977 election in Western Australia-I bring this to the attention of Government senators-when the Labor Party obtained 40 per cent of the votes and 10 per cent of the seats. The party which obtained 60 per cent of the votes got 90 per cent of the seats. Honourable senators on the Government side have the audacity to suggest that that is a fair and equitable system. It is a system that needs to be changed. It is a system that will be changed. I throw down the challenge to the Government. Make no mistake about it, it is a system that will be changed. In New South Wales the Labor Party received 50.4 per cent of the votes and won only 42 per cent of the seats. In Queensland, with 47 per cent of the votes, it gained 26 per cent of the seats. The same sort of analysis can be applied to Western Australia. In Tasmania and the Northern Territory--</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Knight-That is not analysis. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator GIETZELT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Knight claims to be a democrat. In Tasmania and the Northern Territory, where the Labor Party polled 47 per cent and 49 per cent of the votes respectively, there is no Labor representation at all in the lower House. Effectively, just under half of the electors in those areas have representatives in the House of Representatives whom they voted against. That is not a democratic process. In all 3,412,750 people, or 41 per cent of the Australian voters, have representatives in the House of Representatives whom they preferred not to have. That means there is a deficiency, a manipulation and an unsatisfactory state of affairs in the way the present voting system operates. The system of single member constituencies has much to answer for in this respect. The manifestation of the people's choice, which the Governor-General spoke about, is not only warped but is an unproportional manifestation. The Governor-General stated that the election result was a manifestation of the people's choice. Certainly, in a majority sense it was, but not in the imbalanced and unfair proportion of seats finally allocated because of the single member constituency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to compare the situation in the lower House with that which operates in this place. It is very peculiar and very interesting to find that honourable senators who are elected on a system of proportional representation would not be here if it had not been for the change in the voting system of the Senate which was introduced in the late 1940s by the Labor Party in order to bring about a balance in the way in which the Senate should operate. They seem to have some objection to the operation of that system for the House of Representatives. The present situation in this chamber reflects more accurately the electoral position. Of course, after 1 July it will properly reflect the views of the Australian people when there will be a much more balanced situation in this Senate. What does the vote for the Senate election in 1980 show? It shows that the Labor Party with 44 per cent of the vote got 44 per cent of the seats. It shows that the coalition with 44 per cent of the vote got 44 per cent of the seats. It shows that the Australian Democrats with 10 per cent of the vote got eight per cent of the seats. This is the sort of system that ought to be looked at, examined and adopted for the lower House as well. </PARA>
<PARA> What we of the Labor Party are concerned to bring about is a system whereby the party that gets 50 per cent of the vote gets 50 per cent of the seats in the lower House. The only way this can be brought about is by introducing a new system, of proportional representation, that is, on a State-wide basis. Proportional representation, a system which can properly reflect the will of the people, can be implemented by incorporating a system of multi-member constituencies within a State, as is the procedure that now operates in the State of Tasmania. It is known as the Hare-Clark system. All points of view are represented in the Parliament. Proportionally almost to the last digit in percentage terms, seats are won according to the number of votes polled. This system also has the advantage of maintaining links between the representatives and their constituencies and establishes an awareness of regional identity, something which is sadly lacking in the present system in this place. Some combination of single-member electorates and proportional representation may hold the key or a refinement of the present system may be possible to establish the basic principle of parliamentary, representative and majority democracy. Certainly that system does not operate so far as the lower House is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Without losing sight of the most pressing need of our electoral system, that of true expression of the people's will, there are many other matters to which we must address ourselves in the meantime to achieve a more effective representation. Let us look at the present system which this chamber is primarily responsible for. The entrenched conservative majority capriciously used its majority from 1972 to 1975 and refused to adopt the amendments to the Electoral Act which the Whitlam Government was attempting to implement. What does it mean in practice? It means that a significant number of Australian people, because of their education standards and their inability to understand our electoral system, vote informally and therefore negate their vote. I suggest to honourable senators and the public at large that they ought to examine the voting figures at the recent election. Those figures reveal that in all the areas where migrant communities exist, in all the areas where rural poverty exists and those areas in which education facilities are not up to standard, there is a pattern of about 10 per cent of the vote being informal. In the circumstances those people are denied an effective say in their choice of government. The conservative majority in this place refused to allow optional preferential voting to be instituted in the electoral changes that the Labor Party proposed during 1972 to 1975. If the expressed will of the voter were clear that vote would be regarded as a valid vote. </PARA>
<PARA> It is significant that this Government which claims to be concerned about the rights of minority groups, this Government which claims to be concerned about the democratic processes, this Government which always talks about the need to bring more migrants to this country, perpetuates a system that denies to those people, after they have been in this country for long enough to be placed on the electoral roll through the due processes of the law, the right to vote effectively because of their inability to understand our voting system. Because of the perversity of the conservatives in this chamber approximately one in ten votes is declared invalid, whether it be in the electorate of Melbourne, Gellibrand, Wills, Lalor, Melbourne Ports, Grayndler or Sydney. A bias is working against the democratic rights of our non-English speaking migrant communities. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever system we decide upon, we have a duty to ensure that all those people who wish to vote are able to do so unhindered by mechanisms which by their very complexity effectively disenfranchise them. We ought to be adopting an electoral Act which in fact protects the rights of people and gives them the opportunity to record a vote in a way that expresses their desire and their will instead of placing impediments upon them to the degree that their vote is negated. For example, in a Senate election in which about 50 candidates are involved and in which the clear will of a voter has been expressed up to candidate No. 43, because the voter has marked two 44s or two 45s the vote is declared by the electoral officer to be informal. What an absurdity! What a stange system of illogics bearing in mind the sorts of amendments which we attempted to introduce to change that process so that the vote became effective! After all, if a person had voted for the dozen or so candidates whom it was necessary to elect, that ought to have been sufficient indication of choice and that vote ought to be regarded as an effective vote. If we want to be associated with the democratic process, if we want people to be able to have the vote of their choice recorded, we must consider the introduction of optional preferential or limited preferential voting whereby the elector is required only to vote for a minimum number of candidates to record a formal vote. Of course the State Labor Government in New South Wales has done precisely that in local government elections. The candidates are elected on the principle of proportional representation. If three candidates are to be elected out of 30, the voter has to vote for only twice the number of vacancies to be filled plus one. So the voter needs to vote for only one to seven, and that becomes a formal vote. Of course voters are given how-to-vote cards which show how to vote for candidates who have nominated. If they fail, perforce of a lack of understanding, a lack of education or any other reason, to complete the ballot paper, provided they have marked the card one to seven, that vote becomes an effective, formal vote. Honourable senators on the other side of this House say that they believe in the democratic processes. Yet they took the steps that they did in 1975 to prevent the passage of our amendments to reform the Electoral Act. It just shows how far out their understanding is of the whole of the democractic process. It indicates very clearly that they are not concerned about the democratic right of the people to vote. They are concerned only about maintaining their place in power; they are concerned only about the principle that pervades the conservative parties in this country-the right to rule; the born to rule concept which is so much synonomous with the conservative attitude and which was clearly reflected in the obstructionism of the Senate during the whole of the period from 1973 to 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> We must also allow the political affiliation of candidates to be shown on the ballot paper. This would prevent confusion in the minds of electors who do not know the names of a Party's candidate. After all, the political parties themselves go through the process of selecting candidates. As we well know there are those who win and there are those who lose. The candidate who is selected by the political party is not always well known locally in the community. When people vote they want to vote for the candidate belonging to the political party which they have been persuaded they ought to support in the particular election. On the ballot paper we need to have the name of the candidate and the name of the party or group-Independent or whatever it is-that he represents. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that we must also find some way-and the Senate perhaps ought to be exercising its powers of inquiry-in which we can reduce the capricious number of candidates who nominate, particularly for the Senate, without denying the right of a citizen to seek election to the Senate. I am thinking particularly of the candidates who deliberately nominated in 1974 and 1980 for the purpose of gaining publicity and causing confusion. They exhibited sheer flippancy in their attitudes. Their whole purpose was to negate the majority vote. Let us face it; in 1974 in New South Wales that was a precise tactic designed by the conservatives. They succeeded in causing a greater number of informal votes to be recorded on that occasion. Something like 80 candidates nominated for that election. We all know that even the brightest people in our community, even those who claim that their education level is above standard and even those who claim to understand the democratic process, found great difficulty in filling out that ballot paper, not to mention the elderly, the people who might have some disability in eyesight, the people who did not understand the voting system and all the great diversity of groups within our community who are not tuned in, as it were, to the whole political process. </PARA>
<PARA> We must also consider a technique such as rotating the names of the candidates on the ballot papers in order to eliminate the mathematical advantage accruing to those candidates on the top of the ballot. During the recent election campaign in Queensland I went though the list of candidates standing for the National Party and the Liberal Party in Queensland. I found that more than 60 per cent of those who nominated were at the top of the ballot paper. In other words it was the Abels, the Bakers and the people with names beginning with A, B or C. Was that just an accidental occurrence or was it a deliberate political ploy? I submit that it was a deliberate political ploy by the political parties in order to gain the advantage of what is known as the donkey vote. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, particularly in marginal seats in the various States of the Commonwealth, we can point to the conservative parties specifically selecting a candidate whose name will head the ballot paper. How important that is because seats are won or lost by those people who perhaps do not have much interest in the voting processes and who just decide to vote for the candidates as they are listed straight down the ticket. That has happened in numerous electorates and even in the last election. So we suggest that if there is any sincerity in the Government parties and if there is any sincerity amongst the Australian community about bringing in a fairer electoral system we ought to have either a draw out of a hat or a system whereby the political parties rotate on the ballot paper from one election to another. These are details which are on the agenda, which need to be examined by the Senate and which ought to be worked out. </PARA>

<PARA>National Companies and Securities Commission Amendment Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is the first of four Bills that I have introduced today pursuant to the Commonwealth's obligations under the co-operative companies and securities scheme. Before I discuss the Bills, I would like to outline, for the benefit of honourable senators, the administrative and legislative context in which these Bills will operate. </PARA>
<PARA>FORMAL AGREEMENT ON COMPANIES AND SECURITIES</PARA>
<PARA> Background material on the formal agreement and on the four basic elements of the co-operative companies and securities scheme is contained in paragraphs four to 18 of the explanatory memorandum on the National Companies and Securities Commission Amendment Bill 1980 which has been circulated to honourable senators. The aim is that, as far as possible, any person or company should be able to deal on all general companies and securities matters as if that person or company were subject only to one system of law and administration throughout Australia. The co-operative scheme thus provides a framework for uniform general laws on companies and securities matters that will apply throughout Australia. It was, however, never intended to fetter the sovereign right of any parliament to pass particular laws which are not inconsistent with the general legislation agreed to under the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>THE SUBSTANTIVE CODES</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the legislation establishing the National Commission and supporting its operation in jurisdictions other than the Australian Capital Territory, the substantive legislation for the scheme will at this stage be contained in four codes: (a) a share acquisition code which will regulate the acquisition of company shares; (b) a securities industry code which will regulate the securities industry; (c) a companies code which will cover the remaining areas dealt with in the current companies and marketable securities legislation; and (d) an interpretation code which deals with the interpretation of the Commonwealth legislation under this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>PUBLIC CONSULTATION</PARA>
<PARA> The formal agreement foreshadowed a major exercise in legislative uniformity and law reform where this was necessary. In embarking on this exercise, this Government and the other governments which are parties to the formal agreement have sought to ensure that there is at all times adequate opportunity for the proposed legislation to be considered by interested persons. Comments were sought and received on the proposed share acquisition code, the proposed securities industry code and the proposed companies code. Further comments are presently being sought on the companies code. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, committees of interested Government and Opposition members and senators have been regularly briefed on the scheme and the Commonwealth legislation under it. It was necessary that these briefings take place because of the nature of the co-operative scheme. Following exposure of the various Commonwealth Bills, public submissions were examined by the Ministerial Council which then approved the Bills in their final form for presentation to this Parliament in accordance with the procedures laid down in the formal agreement. Accordingly, it was necessary for any criticisms and review within the ranks of the Opposition and the members of the Government parties to take place in this rather unusual way. </PARA>
<PARA>THE PRESENT POSITION</PARA>
<PARA> We have now reached the stage where there is substantial and visible progress towards the completion of the co-operative companies and securities scheme. As is to be expected where seven governments are involved, there will from time to time be differences which require resolution at a political level. To date all differences have been resolved and I am hopeful that we will continue to be able to resolve any future differences that may arise. </PARA>
<PARA>THE FUTURE</PARA>
<PARA> There are, of course, many matters which remain to be attended to. First, there is the need to make certain amendments to the Commonwealth Acts which have already been passed to take account of the further work that has been done on the scheme legislation. The four Bills I am presenting today cover these amendments. Secondly, there is a need to finalise the content of the regulations that will be required under these Commonwealth Acts. Thirdly, there is a need to settle the form and content of the companies code which was introduced into the House of Representatives on 27 August 1980 to allow further study of the code's provisions by honourable members and senators and the public. Fourthly, each State will have to pass a series of Bills. There will be a National Companies and Securities Commission (State Provisions) Bill to support the National Commission in each State. There will also be an application of laws Bill for each of the four codes in each State. The State Bills other than the Companies (Application of Laws) Bill have been cleared by the Ministerial Council for introduction into individual State parliaments. However introduction and passage of the State Bills will depend on the prgram of the individual State parliaments. Fifthly, the National Commission will have to proceed with its adminstrative arrangements for the administration of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hoped that in the longer term it may be possible to provide for the establishment of automatic data processing facilities which will assist the National Commission and the State and Territory corporate affairs offices in maintaining a unified system of administration. Accordingly, Ministers have directed their advisers to examine a feasibility study prepared by the Commonwealth-State working group. This working group reported on ADP systems which could be used to assist with the administration of the co-operative scheme. It is the hope of Ministers that the new share acquisition code, the new securities industry code and the interpretation code will be able to be brought into operation by mid 1981. Following further community consultation in relation to the companies code we would hope to have the Commonwealth companies Bill ready for introduction into the Commonwealth Parliament during the first half of 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to discuss very briefly the first of the Bills that I am presenting today, the National Companies and Securities Commission Amendment Bill. A detailed explanation of the amendments contained in this Bill is set out in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill. The definition of 'agreement' will be amended so that references to the formal agreement made between the Commonwealth and the States on 22 December 1978 will cover that agreement as amended or affected by subsequent agreements. The provisions in the National Companies and Securities Commission Act relating to the application of moneys of the National Commission will be amended so that moneys that vest in the National Commission under another law can be dealt with in accordance with that law. The provisions in the NCSC Act dealing with audit by the Auditor-general will be amended to ensure that the State governments participating in the co-operative scheme retain exclusive control over the auditing of the books or records kept by their authorities or officers where they are acting as delegates of the National Commission. The provisions in the NCSC Act relating to divisions of the National Commission will be amended to allow a division to be constituted by members other than the chairman of the National Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The NCSC Act is also being amended to provide for the establishment of a secretariat for the Ministerial Council. Staff and facilities for the secretariat will be provided by the National Commission. The Bill will come into effect on the day on which it receives royal assent. The National Companies and Securities Commission Amendment Bill has been approved by the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities for introduction into the Commonwealth Parliament. I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Amendment Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Amendment Bill is to amend the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Act 1980 which sets out the substantative law for the proposed new Australian code which will regulate the acquisition of company shares. A detailed explanation of the provisions of the Amendment Bill is contained in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The first two clauses of the Bill deal with the short title and the Bill's commencement of operation. The remainder of the Bill is concerned with substantive amendments and drafting changes to the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Act. Among other things, the principal Act will not now apply to a compromise or arrangement under section 181 or section 183 of the existing companies legislation. Where an expert's report accompanies a Part B statement, the target company will now lodge with the National Companies and Securities Commission a notice signed by the expert stating that the expert consents to his report accompanying the Part B statement. If such a report contains a project forecast or a statement on the target company's asset valuations then it may not accompany the Part B statement unless the National Commission consents. A new provision on the variation of formal takeover offers will be inserted into the principal Act. Variations are to be made only with the consent of the National Commission unless the variation is in accordance with the provisions of the relevant section or the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, Part A and Part C statements will be required to set out the bidder's intentions regarding continuing the target company business, any major changes to be made to that business, and also the future employment of its staff. The Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Amendment Bill has been approved by the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities for introduction into the Commonwealth Parliament. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Securities Industry Amendment Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Securities Industry Amendment Bill is to amend the Securities Industry Act 1980 which regulates the securities industry in the Australian Capital Territory. The other jurisdictions that are covered by the formal agreement on companies and securities will pass legislation applying the securities industry code in those other jurisdictions. A detailed explanation of amendments in the Amendment Bill is set out in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Among other things, the principal Act will be amended by the Bill to ensure that the National Companies and Securities Commission can exercise its powers of inspection only for the purposes of the co-operative scheme. The Commission will now be able to require information from a person only if that person is able to provide such information. Where a person takes possession of books under the provisions of the Act, any lien on those books will now be protected. There will now be a defence to a prosecution for offences relating to false or misleading information if the defendant had reasonable grounds to believe that the information was true and not misleading. Proven copies of extracts of books will now be allowable as evidence. There are a number of amendments to the investigation provisions in the principal Act. The National Commission will now have additional powers to obtain information from certain persons in specified circumstances and subject to specified safeguards. Where the record of an examination under the investigation provisions is reduced to writing, the inspector may require the person being examined to sign the record. Copies of the written record will be able to be provided by the National Commission to certain persons and they may be provided subject to conditions imposed by the National Commission. There are also a number of drafting changes made in the amending Bill. This amending Bill will come into operation on the same day on which the principal Act comes into operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Securities Industry Amendment Bill 1980 has been approved by the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities for introduction into the Commonwealth Parliament. I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Companies and Securities (Interpretation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Amendment Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Companies and Securities (Interpretation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Amendment Bill is to amend the Companies and Securities (Interpretation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act which provides for the interpretation of the Commonwealth legislation under the co-operative companies and securities scheme. This Amendment Bill will assist in the uniform interpretation of all of the legislation that is to be administered by the National Companies and Securities Commission. A detailed explanation of the Amendment Bill is contained in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill. Among other things this Bill will amend the definition of formal agreement to take account of amendments to that agreement before the principal Commonwealth Act comes into operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The definition of 'statutory declaration' will be omitted as these declarations will not now be required under any of the provisions of any of the substantive codes. The Bill will ensure that the present law relating to the persons in each jurisdiction who are entitled to present indictments remains unaltered. The Bill also indicates which offences should be treated as indictable offences and which offences should be treated as summary offences under the co-operative scheme. Provision is also made in the Bill for recognition to be given for evidentiary purposes to corresponding laws in a State or another Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will come into operation on the day on which the Companies and Securities (Interpretation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1980 comes into operation. The Companies and Securities (Interpretation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Amendment Bill has been approved by the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities for introduction into the Commonwealth Parliament. I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak only briefly to the Senate on a matter about which I have written to the Treasurer (Mr Howard) but in relation to which I would now like to draw some further information to the attention of the Government. It is the matter of the imposition of sales tax on the cost of the manufacture of sets and properties used in productions of non-profit theatre companies. This matter came to light in October last year and was mentioned in one newspaper article-only one to my knowledge-and has drawn no further comment. Recently I think honourable senators would have received a letter from the Confederation of Australian Professional Performing Arts Ltd on the subject. I am sure a large number of members and senators have made representations to the Treasurer. Since I did so myself a couple of weeks ago there have been additional representations to me in Queensland about the effect of the imposition of this tax on these non-profit companies. It is worth mentioning in passing that the tax is not levied on those non-profit subsidised theatres which are either statutory bodies, such as the Queensland Theatre Company, or attached to universities. So not all theatre companies in this position are so affected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The concern that I expressed is one that I am sure many members would share and certainly one which is now exercising the theatre companies. It has fairly lately come to their attention and they are now making representations to members. As I said, since contacting the Treasurer about the matter I have had further contact with people in Queensland about it and a very particular concern has been expressed. In the article I referred to some publicity is given to very large amounts of tax that could be levied on some companies. Advice that I have received from the Australian Taxation Office does not comfort anyone, I am sure, when it is pointed out that the exemption is applicable if sales of taxable goods do not exceed $12,000 a year or the tax payable is less than $250 a year. I give to the Senate the example of the TN Company in Brisbane, which has estimated that that tax would cost it $350 for each of the six annual plays. The professional non-profit theatre companies that I know of can all look forward to paying some of this tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Particular concern in Queensland arises out of the fact that Queensland is a State in which the arts are very important. Those senators and members who do not come from Queensland but who have travelled there and who are interested in the arts never cease to comment to me, if I am involved in their trip, just how involved in the arts the citizens of Queensland are and how very much they care about them. They have a very high degree of participation in the arts. Visits by professional companies are therefore regarded as being very important to people living in provincial cities and towns. They will suffer most if subsidised theatre, opera and ballet companies in Queensland are forced to face extra costs. Our companies attempt, as best they can, to meet the cultural needs of the State. But thousands of Queenslanders outside the metropolitan area rarely, and sometimes never, get a chance to see professional performances which I am sure honourable senators would agree are important in the standards of the arts. I include also those performances which are amateur. These people will have even less chance if our non-profit companies have their funds further reduced since theatrical touring is a high cost business, particularly in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> People living in Brisbane are given a reasonable choice in live entertainment. In far north Queensland there will be an extended choice in more regular theatre soon with the establishment of a subsidised company. However, Queensland is the country's most decentralised State. It is a very large State. We are merely seeing the start in Queensland of a consolidation of the developments in cultural activities. I hope that the Government will do all that it can to assist rather than hinder this development on a Statewide basis. It seems a ridiculous anomaly, as was commented on in the newspaper article that I referred to earlier, that the Commonwealth Government gives money to non-profit companies through the Australia Council and then that money is taken back through the Australian Taxation Office. Already the subsidised companies pay other taxes such as group, payroll and general sales tax on the purchase of equipment. The imposition of sales tax on the manufacture of the companies' own stage sets and properties could have a crippling effect on what are very tight theatre budgets. It must lead, on the information I have been given by these companies, to a reduction in planned activity. </PARA>
<PARA> People in the non-profit performing arts in Queensland, and, I understand, nationally, were unaware until late last year that they had to pay this tax. I believe that the tax should be examined by the Government to discover whether it is contrary to the spirit of the Act as pointed out by CAPPA. CAPPA went on to make further requests which could be considered. But I would be sorry to see a situation emerge where the Government, in giving grants to the arts, finds that the benefit of those grants is whittled away through the implementation of a section of the taxation Act which I believe was never meant to have this effect. I want to extend a plea to the Government to take into consideration in reaching a determination on this matter the types of points that I have raised tonight and how very important-in fact in some cases decisively important-it will be for the performance of a number of professional theatre companies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last evening while speaking on the 1979-80 annual report of the Australian National Railways Commission I cited figures from page 8 of the report under the heading 'Statistical Summary: Passenger Operations'. I find on examining Hansard today that I was incorrect in some of the figures I cited. I now wish to set the record straight. In doing so I shall quote from Senate Hansard of 24 February. The incorrect figures appear in column 1 of page 21. I have cited the figures in dollar terms and they should, in fact, read 'Gross tonnes hauled one kilometre'. Where I have stated that ANR had suffered a drop in revenue despite increased fares I now find on reading the report today that there was an increase in revenue, due to the increased fares charged, by 6 per cent from $12m in 1978-79 to $12.7m in 1979-80. This is shown on page 11 of the report. However, page 13 of the report reveals that 9,600 fewer passengers were carried on the Indian Pacific and the Trans Australian, Port Pirie-Kalgoorlie section, during 1979-80 than were carried in 1978-79, with a reduction of 33,900 from 1976-77 to 1979-80.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The errors I made and have now corrected were due to the fact that I did not have a copy of the report to study in depth in sufficient time prior to its being tabled in the Senate. Mr President, you will recall that on more than one occasion senators have lodged a complaint in the Senate that if those senators who have an interest in any of the reports that are tabled want to speak to them they have to do it in great haste and by looking at the report as they are on their feet. Unfortunately that is where I fell into error last night. I have corrected the error. I hope now I will not have the Commissioner for Railways down on my neck by saying that he had such a massive amount of revenue because I was citing, in the one instance, $1,467m and in fact it was 12.7m and $12m. </PARA>
<PARA> Another short comment I wish to make relates to an answer given to Senator Jessop by Senator Baume on the provision of television services to the west coast of Eyre Peninsula. This is a matter which has been aired on many occasions in the Senate. I will not deal with it in depth tonight except to place on record a question for Senator Baume to answer. He may be able to come up with an answer before the Parliament rises tomorrow. I understand that a very important local government meeting is to be held on the west coast next week which I am sure the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wallis) will be attending. The people who attend that meeting from the local government bodies will be interested to know just when television services will be available. Senator Baume in his answer today gave an indication of when they will be available. The people on the west coast will be concerned about the origin of the current affairs programs which that television station will be showing. I am given to understand that these programs will not be South Australian current affairs programs; they will be beamed in from either New South Wales or Western Australia. Many people on the west coast of Eyre Peninsula would have no interest at all in current affairs programs which deal purely with events that take place in New South Wales, Queensland or Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask Senator Messner who is at the table tonight to relay my question to Senator Baume. He may be able to tell the Senate tomorrow just what the origin of those programs will be so that if the matter comes up for discussion at the local government meeting on the west coast on Monday the people in attandance will be correctly informed as to the types of programs that they will be able to tune into if these television services are in fact made available. As I said, there is a long history of promises about television for the west coast. Today when I was going through my files I came across an editorial in the West Coast Sentinel of Wednesday, 3 September 1980. The editor said: 'What a bore'. He then went on to refer to Senator Jessop's having promised nearly four years ago that television would come to the west coast if the Liberal Government were returned to office. Senator Baume said in the chamber today that television for the west coast is getting a little closer-four years after the promise was made that it would come into being. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise very briefly this evening at this late hour simply to bring to the attention of the Senate the plight of the East Devonport Child Care Centre. This centre fulfils, in a very friendly and constructive way, a very real need in the community centred on east Devonport in north-west Tasmania. It is a centre which, as I say, fulfils a real need as is shown by its constant utilisation. It is always fully booked. It is a child care centre which, like so many throughout Australia, enables many women to contribute to the upkeep of their families. Of course, in the case of a woman without a husband in the household, it allows her, in many instances, to undertake such work that enables her to support totally a family situation. The need for this centre has been recognised throughout the general community around Devonport. This is particularly evidenced by the gathering of some two and a half thousand signatures on a petition over the last few weeks. It is also evidenced by the fact that many community groups such as the Apex organisation, Parents Without Partners, the local council and many other community groups-I have singled out some for particular mention-have indicated their strong support. The question is whether that need, attested by so many people in north-western Tasmania, is equally recognised and would gather support from the Federal Government. In order to continue beyond 18 March the centre needs a recurrent grant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We know that whilst such centres rely in large part on a great degree of voluntary support, both from some of the mothers concerned and from community groups such as I have outlined, nevertheless to fulfil the responsibility towards the children concerned professional child care attendants are required. In order to attract people of the proper quality and disposition it is necessary to offer them a salary commensurate with their responsibilities. What this particular centre needs, after several years of operation without any Federal funding, is a recurrent grant in the order of $12,000 per annum to enable such a person to be engaged with the security of tenure involved with the certainty of such a salary being available. </PARA>
<PARA> At the invitation of Mrs Jeffries, the public relations officer of that centre, I have visited the home which has been converted. It remains a home in its atmosphere and the construction which has been undertaken in order to enable it to handle some numbers of children has in no way detracted from the friendly and homely atmosphere which I believe is so beneficial to the young children concerned. I draw the attention of the chamber to the fact that a Catch-22 situation is involved in that I believe that special grants, which have been formerly made by way of subsidies for special needs children, have been withdrawn and certainly will not be available in the future because the centre is not federally funded. If that understanding of the situation is correct, it exacerbates the plight in which this centre, amongst many in Australia, finds itself. We have had some replies to Senator McLaren from the Minister concerned, I think on Tuesday, to the effect that the Department is already overcommitted to the tune of some $7m in respect of the funding of child care centres already undertaken, let alone the Department's undertaking any new venture in this direction. </PARA>
<PARA> If the centre closes, as it must do on 18 March if such funding is not available, many households will be disrupted and many children's emotional and indeed material development will be retarded. I make a very strong plea to the Minister to use whatever discretionary powers he may have to make such a grant as will enable this much-needed facility in East Devonport to remain open. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I relate my remarks firstly to Senator Martin's remarks in connection with the problems with theatres in Queensland. Senator Martin is well known for her activities in supporting groups of all kinds, especially of Queenslanders. She has a well-known personal interests in the arts and the development of those arts in the great State of Queensland. The point that she raised in respect of the sales tax on theatre props is one of general interest not only to the people of Queensland. I will raise the matter with the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to see whether I can get an early reply for her.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second matter I refer to was raised by Senator McLaren. We are unused to Senator McLaren making errors with numbers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I assume that the term 'American bases' in fact refers to the joint US/Australian defence facilities. I refer to my answer to Question on Notice No. 6374 (Hansard, 18 September 1980, page 1634). The existing US strategic nuclear doctrine is the result of a progressive evolution of doctrine over more than a decade. It can hardly be described as 'new'. It cannot be discounted that in a nuclear war Australia along with a lot of other countries could come under nuclear attack. But the likelihood of nuclear war is low and the policies of this Government, and those of the governments of the US and other like-minded countries, are directed towards ensuring that nuclear war does not occur at all and that no part of Australia will therefore be subject to nuclear attack. It has been the view of successive Australian governments that the presence of the joint US/Australian defence facilities in Australia is of benefit to Australian and Western security.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) In conformity with the practice of successive Australian Governments, speculation or assertion on the role or functions of the Joint Defence Space Communications Station at Nurrungar will be neither confirmed nor denied.

<PARA> (4) The effects of fallout in the immediate area of a nuclear explosion would not be significant when compared with the effects of blast and heat that would precede it.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of an air burst of an 0.5 to 1.0 megaton nuclear weapon over Nurrungar a small quantity of fission products would be carried into the upper atmosphere generally in an easterly direction and would slowly deposit over the whole area covered by the middle latitudes of the southern hemisphere.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of a ground burst of such a weapon at Nurrungar a small quantity of fission products might similarly be carried into the upper atmosphere. Most of the fallout, however, would be distributed in an area up to about 100 miles from the burst point.</PARA>
<PARA> Data available to the Department of Defence indicates that the chance of a fallout cloud passing over Adelaide in the event hypothesised by the honourable senator, is about one half of one per cent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 4 December 1980:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) What are the present guidelines for Commonwealth medical officers in determining 85 per cent permanent incapacity in an invalid pension claim.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) How do the guidelines differ from the guidelines applied by the Department of Veterans' Affairs in determining total and permanent incapacity.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="145" SPEAKER="Baume Sen The Hon P.E." NAMEID="ME4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourble senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The present guidelines require Commonwealth medical officers (CMOs) to assess whether or not a claimant for invalid pension is permanently incapacitated for work to the extent of not less than 85 per cent as provided for in the Social Services Act 1947. This assessment is based primarily on medical/clinical considerations of the disabilities, severity and degree of permanent incapacity. Broadly, the assessment of a person's capacity (or incapacity) for work involves an evaluation by the CMO of the person's present and future capacity to engage in any field of employment which might be considered suitable for the person to undertake. In addition to assessing the person's degree of medical impairment, such factors as age, sex and education are relevant in assessing the degree of incapacity for work. An incapacity is regarded as 'permanent' if no fundamental or marked change can reasonably be expected in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Total and permanent incapacity is the degree of incapacity specified in the Repatriation legislation for the payment of disability pension at the Special (T &amp; PI) Rate. A Repatriation disability pension is a compensatory payment payable for a Service-related incapacity and the Special Rate of $122.75 per week is the maximum rate of this pension.</PARA>
<PARA> Schedule 2 of the Repatriation Act 1920 provides for the Special (T &amp; PI) Rate disability pension to be paid to a veteran who is totally and permanently incapacitated. A veteran is regarded as totally and permanently incapacitated if he is, because of service-related incapacity, incapacitated for life to such an extent as to be precluded from earning other than a negligible percentage of a living wage. The determination of whether a person is totally and permanently incapacitated is made by the respective independent determining authorities established under the Repatriation Act.</PARA>
<PARA> The disability pension is not comparable to the invalid pension because, during assessment, only incapacity from Service-related disabilities is taken into account. A more suitable parallel would be the Service pension which is payable for permanent unemployability by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The Repatriation service pension is a social-welfare type payment similar to the invalid pension. It was introduced for those veterans who served in a theatre of war and who are permanently unemployable. It is payable at the same rate as an invalid pension and incapacity from both Service and non-service-related disabilities is taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA> Permanently unemployable, as applied to the Service pension, is defined in section 23 of the Repatriation Act as meaning permanently incapable, by reason of physical or mental disablement, of being employed in a remunerative occupation in which, in the opinion of the Repatriation Commission, he can reasonably be expected to obtain regular employment.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's interpretation of the term is that a veteran will be deemed to be permanently unemployable for Service pension purposes if, by reason of:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) physical or mental incapacity from all disabilities or,</PARA>
<PARA> (b) physical or mental incapacity coupled with any limitations imposed by his age or unsuitability for training, or the unavailability of suitable work locally,</PARA>
<PARA>he will for the foreseeable future (and probably permanently) be unable to retain remunerative employment of a kind for which he is fitted.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 3 December 1980 (Hansard, page 268) Senator Walters asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce the following question, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Does the Government support the expansion of the electronics industry in Australia? If so, does the Minister agree that the continued importation, duty-free, of components such as integrated circuits, thick film hydrant circuits, semi-conductors and even copper and aluminium wire by Commonwealth departments, corporations and commissions undermines the expansion of the local industry?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industry and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's industry policy is directed towards and supportive of the development of an industry structure, including the electronics industry, which has a greater degree of specialisation, is more internationally competitive and export oriented, and is less reliant on Government assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's purchasing policy is to give preference to goods of Australian origin, or of relatively greater Australian content, unless there are substantial reasons to the contrary.</PARA>
<PARA> Under this policy Departments and authorities are also required to ensure that tender specifications are not drawn up to exclude Australian products suitable or reasonably adaptable to their needs.</PARA>
<PARA> To assist Australian industry a preference margin of 20 per cent of the value of the Australian content is applied when considering competitive tenders.</PARA>
<PARA> In evaluating competitive quotations and tenders local products are compared with imported goods on a duty paid basis even though they can be imported duty free for use by the Commonwealth. This ensures that Australian producers receive the same protection against competition from imports in Government purchasing as they would in commercial transactions. The level of assistance against import competition provided for most electronics industry products produced in Australia is higher than that accorded manufacturing industry generally.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 5 December 1980 (Hansard, page 434) Senator Archer asked the Minister representing the Minister for Education the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At a recent symposium on small business held in Melbourne attention was drawn to the fact that much of the failure in small business had to be attributed to the fundamental lack of teaching at primary, secondary and tertiary levels, Professor Meredith stated:</PARA>
<PARA> 'In Australia, innumerable Government departments, agencies, tertiary institutions and private organisations are associated with education and training programs for small enterprises without any visible co-ordination or national plan.'</PARA>
<PARA> Can the Minister have the Minister for Education institute an examination of this matter at ministerial council level and have a special curriculum committee set up to prepare appropriate courses for use throughout Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The problems of small business management in particular the need for adequate training, have been considered in the survey, 'Small Business Education and Training in Australia', which was commissioned by the National Training Council in late 1979.</PARA>
<PARA> A summary report on the survey (the Bailey Report) was released by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs on 11 January 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> The report is to be widely distributed with copies being sent to all State Small Business Agencies, all respondents to the Survey, all universities, colleges of advanced education and TAFE institutions, and to accounting firms. It is available for purchase also, from the Australian Government Publishing Service Bookshops.</PARA>
<PARA> Within the advanced educational and technical and further education sectors, a wide range of courses is available for people who operate or are planning to commence small businesses. However, in the Bailey Report it was concluded that:</PARA>
<PARA> 'a large majority of small business owner/managers in Australia are not oriented toward involvement in traditional education and training programs'.</PARA>
<PARA> The survey suggests that people who operate small businesses prefer training and advice which is tailored to their own particular circumstances. Hence nationally co-ordinated curricula, whilst of possible application as part of a general education, are likely to lack the flexibility and applicability needed to be of benefit in the wide range of business ventures which must be considered.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has established an Inquiry into Management Education which, inter alia, is examining the special needs of small business for management education. The inquiry will consider the roles of universities, colleges of advanced education and technical and further education institutions. The Chairman of the Inquiry delivered the keynote address at the International Symposium on Small Business to which you referred in your question.</PARA>
<PARA> The Report of the Inquiry is expected to be available by the end of this year and will contain recommendations on ways to improve the availability and effectiveness of education for small business.</PARA>
