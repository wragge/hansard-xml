<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 5 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That on the 10 December 1948, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted and proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which declares that, 'Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration. . . .' (Article 2) that 'Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives . . . The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or equivalent free voting procedures.' (Article 21 (1) and (3).)</PARA>
<PARA> Elections for Senators meet all requirements except one. Senators are elected periodically, by secret ballot, with universal franchise, and the quota-preferential method of proportional representation ensures that the vote values within states are equal as nearly as can be.</PARA>
<PARA> However the provision of the Electoral Act that compels voters to show preferences for all candidates on the ballot paper interferes with the free expression of the will of the voters, and is unjust.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia, as a Member State of the United Nations, is pledged to achieve observance of Human Rights and Freedoms.</PARA>
<PARA> We, the undersigned citizens of Australia, therefore humbly pray that the Senate will fulfil the pledge of a Member State of the United Nations and take steps to remove the compulsion from the Electoral Act in order to allow freedom of expression for everyone who has the right to vote for Senators.</PARA>

<TITLE>Plant Breeders' Rights</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate, in Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth, do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Note that legislation establishing plant breeders' rights in other countries has had serious adverse effects, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Virtual monopoly control of seed production has passed into the hands of a few large international corporations seeking to profit from the exclusive rights over plant genetic materials created by such legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The varieties of seeds available have been restricted mainly to hybrids which will not reproduce truly and will not grow without the aid of artificial fertilisers and pesticides, thus maximising corporate profits without regard for the interests of growers and consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The genetic diversity of crops has been eroded, rendering them vulnerable to disease and other environmental threat.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Recognise that maintenance of the genetic diversity of plant varieties is crucial to the continued well-being of the Australian Nation, and take all necessary steps to preserve and promote such genetic diversity as a public recourse and to prevent exclusive control over plant genetic materials from falling into private hands.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Defend the vital interests of Australian farmers and gardeners, independent Australian seed companies and their employees, and consumers of Australian farm and garden produce, by rejecting any proposal to legislate for the establishment of plant breeders' rights in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The clear understanding of all who participate in the production of oil, whether indigenous or synthetic crudes, is that the Australian market will be satisfied ahead of any export demands. That is understood. No commitments other than that understanding have been given to the Rundle partners. I am not aware of any commitments having been given to Japan or to Exxon, with one qualification: In a variety of discussions that have taken place between this Government and other governments regarding product sharing-that is, the product of synthetic crudes-the Government has indicated that it accepts in principle the idea of product sharing but that each case must be considered on its merits and, until the actual industry is so defined that we can know what its product will be both in quality and quantity, no decisions can be made on that matter. As to the specific details of Senator Grimes' question, it is quite clear that the Australian market has to be fulfilled ahead of any others. The Rundle partners know that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. I refer to newspaper reports about the various councils on the aging and the claim that they will be forced to curtail some of their many services unless further funding is forthcoming. Can the Minister advise on the effectiveness of these councils? Is it a fact that their services will be restricted unless further funding is available? What consideration has the Government given to the restoration and/or improvement of Federal Government assistance?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="483" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of bodies operate in the same way as the councils on the aging, namely by having a series of State organisations and a national body. There are the councils of social service, councils for rehabilitation of the disabled and so on and the councils on the aging. In each case the Commonwealth Government provides grant-in-aid funding to the national organisation and the State bodies are funded either by their constituent organisations, by State assistance or by a combination of both. In the case of the councils on the aging, until a couple of years ago the grant-in-aid was shared by the national body with the State bodies. I think it was in 1979 that the Australian Council on the Aging came into line with the other national bodies. It receives Federal funding for its own purposes and it does not pass on funds to the State councils.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that all of these bodies perform a useful service in terms of representing the interests of different welfare groups. At the Federal level they are able to bring together the views of consumers and organisations around Australia. That is, of course, of great assistance to the Government. With respect to the Australian Council on the Aging, the Government is at present engaged in a survey of the needs of the aged. I believe that from that survey will come some very useful information for the Government with respect to its policy development in this area. I think it is likely that the State councils will have to continue to rely on the support of their constituent bodies and the support of State governments, which have a similar interest to the Commonwealth Government in maintaining such representative organisations.</PARA>

Is it true that company tax is levied at the rate of 47 1/2 per cent and that with other items, notably the sale of aircraft, Ansett claims an overall profit of $14.6m? Does the amount set aside for tax indicate that the real profit before tax would be in the vicinity of $43m?

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="484" SPEAKER="Messner Sen The Hon A.J." NAMEID="9I4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="VETERANS' AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I noted Senator Button's comments in making the point that the Ansett report is not audited. I am not clear as to whether this report has been drawn up separately from the financial statements of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd, which would have been presented to the Corporate Affairs Commission in the normal course of events. Therefore, I am unable to say specifically whether that statement has been audited. In looking at that statement yesterday, I noted that no auditor's certificate was attached to it. However, it was clear that the statement was separate from the total operations of Ansett Transport Industries and represented only the airline operations. I would imagine, therefore, that if the total company had been audited in the normal way, as required by company legislation, that statement would have been so audited. Nevertheless, I will take that point on notice and check it out for the honourable senator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the figures that he mentioned, I do not have those details before me. Clearly, I do not carry them around in my mind. However, it would seem to me, again remembering some of the comments made last night in the debate on this matter, that the calculation of the profit of some $43m which Senator Button has mentioned appears to be based on very simplistic understandings of the way accountants draw up these figures. I believe that there are probably some amounts which represent actual costs, which are in fact economic costs to the airline and which are not taken into account as taxation deductions. Many expenses come into that category. One of the chief ones, of course, is provision for long service leave. Another might be the cost of depreciation on the assets which would be written off in excess of the rate allowable by the Commissioner of Taxation but which otherwise might represent a real cost to the business.</PARA>

<PARA> The birthplace of parents helps determine the origins of the Australian Population.</PARA>
<PARA>Does this mean that people of Italian, Greek or French origin born, say, in Egypt are of Egyptian origin or that, for instance, Senator Puplick is of Indian origin because his father was born in India? Question 14 of the Census Guide asks for the country of birth of the parents. Does the Australian Statistician not recognise that many European countries have had their borders redrawn in our lifetimes? My parents were born in Austria and I was born in Yugoslavia, even though we all were born in the same town. Is the question in its present form likely to cause confusion, and affront many Australians who are proud of their origins? Would it not be better to ask what is the national origin of the mother or the father? If it is too late to amend the census form will the Minister give consideration to issuing an amendment slip to the census forms?</PARA>

I would hesitate to speculate on anything which might relate to one of our colleagues, Senator Puplick, or on any of the other matters that have been referred to. I think the best thing I can suggest is that I refer the matter to the Treasurer and ask him whether he sees any need for the amendment which was suggested by Senator Lajovic or whether he feels that the question and its interpretation by the Australian Bureau of Statistics is one that is able to clarify the matters which were raised.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a question of the Leader of the Government in the Senate which follows the excellent question asked of him yesterday by Senator MacGibbon concerning the granting of mining rights to the Winchester South steaming coal deposit which was awarded to the consortium of British Petroleum Australia, Sir Leslie Thiess and Westfield Holdings companies. Has the Minister seen suggestions that this deal was pushed through the Queensland Cabinet by the National Party Minister for Mines, Energy and Police, Mr Gibbs, without reference to the State Treasury and, extraordinarily, without Mr Edwards, the State Treasurer, properly understanding it? Senator Lewis is trying to interject, but I point out that I am quoting the Minister. If Senator Lewis would like to keep abreast of what Mr Edwards said, I am sure he would support the thrust of my question. Will the Commonwealth Government intervene in this arrangement which surely constitutes yet another example of a large transnational company buying up Australia's mineral wealth and evidently at a much cheaper price than might reasonably have been expected? Will the Commonwealth Government now take the initiative of holding a constitutional referendum designed to give the Commonwealth adequate power over energy and resources so as to prevent States from selling Australia's natural resources to multinationals, as has been done in this case? Does the Minister have any information that the dubious circumstances in which this deal was concluded are related in any way to any substantial donation to the National Party of Queensland through the Bjelke-Petersen Foundation or by any other means?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is fair to assume that politicians are honest unless we have evidence to the contrary, otherwise we would all be very uncomfortable here together. Therefore, I must say that if anybody has any information which suggests that there is any illegal transaction of any kind, please let me know, otherwise I suggest that inferences are disorderly in this regard. As to the Winchester coal undertaking, I have not read the Press, except cursorily. The fact of the matter is that, as Senator Chipp well knows, this is a matter which lies entirely within the State Governments' rights, and the Commonwealth has absolutely no responsibilities or rights in regard to this matter at all. Therefore, it is not within our present capacity to say what are the facts. If there is any further information that can be obtained to throw light on this subject, I will be happy to obtain it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clearly, the Commonwealth cannot intervene. As to whether there is merit in the Commonwealth's seeking a referendum to amend the Constitution in order to assume such powers, that would be a policy matter. I will refer the matter to the Prime Minister and look at it myself to see whether that should be so. The presumption within a federation ought to be that any sovereign government has both the capacity and the integrity to carry out its duties. One must assume, lacking other evidence, that not only has the Queensland Government the sovereign right to do this but also it has done so capably. Any suggestion of a decision made by a government being related to a donation to a political party, while not strictly offensive under the Standing Orders, implies that politicians are dishonest.</PARA>

If this report is correct, will the Minister reconsider such moves so that the central inquiry bureau is retained in its present position to provide easy access to a service for its clients?</PARA></TALK.START>

However, no proposals have been submitted yet to the Government. A second country network is part of a 10-year plan currently being prepared by the national broadcasting station planning committee. The honourable senator will no doubt be pleased to learn that planning is under way for the installation of an ABC FM transmitter to serve Townsville.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for National Development and Energy. What is the typical cost in fuel economy of the use of a car air conditioning set? Is the fitting of such sets increasing rapidly in this country, at considerable cost to our fuel conservation policy? Is the main cause of this situation overseas design rules which force modern cars into being glass boxes on wheels-almost perfect green houses; good for growing flowers but bad for people-and quite unsuitable for our summer climate, althought they may be suitable for the cooler climates of Europe, Japan and North America? Will the Minister consult his colleagues about encouraging at least one of our manufacturers to design and produce cars which would be more suitable for our climate and which would not require air conditioning? Might we not even be able to export some of these cars to tropical countries for which the current North American, Japanese and European designed cars are as unsuitable as they are for us and which also have the need to conserve fuel?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The estimates of the additional fuel consumption caused by the use of air conditioners in cars vary considerably, depending on the size of the vehicle, the speed in traffic or on the open road and the weather conditions. Some estimates put the additional use as high as 15 per cent whilst other tests have shown that cars with air conditioners used at cruising speed on the open road do not incur a fuel penalty compared with similar cars driven without air conditioners but with the windows open. Honourable senators will know that with the windows open there is an aerodynamic drag on cars which increases the amount of fuel consumed. The National Energy Advisory Committee, in its report, quoted an average penalty for air conditioners in the order of 5 per cent. So it is somewhere between 5 per cent and 15 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that apparently there is no Australian design rule which specifies the area of glass which can be incorporated into motor cars. Glass areas are incorporated to achieve design objectives regarding safety, field of vision, et cetera. Nevertheless, the honourable senator has raised an important question as to whether the design of the cars produced in Australia is suitable for the kind of climate in Australia or whether cars are designed for winter conditions elsewhere, and to that extent I will have this matter examined. I will ask my colleague in another place, Sir Phillip Lynch, to look at it. Of course, a major factor in the success of the export of cars to tropical areas would be their price. The question of whether a car uniquely designed for such climates could compete with existing designs is no doubt a matter for commercial judgment. What is needed, of course, to get the price of cars down is long production runs, as the honourable senator would know. Nevertheless, I think he has raised a very interesting point. Perhaps in the design of the world car we are getting a world climate car and that is not suitable to Australia. I will have the matter looked at and see whether anything can be done about it.</PARA>

Inadvertently included in some scrap metal which was derived from Western Mining Corporation Ltd and which was exported by Simsmetal Pty Ltd to Singapore to a smelter, a measuring gauge which contained some radioactive material was included. Upon it being known by the health authorities in Western Australia that the gauge was missing, the Singapore health authorities were notified and the material secured. Discussions have been held to see whether the material could be disposed of safely in Singapore. Discussions have been held between the Federal Government and the Singapore Government. My understanding is that, recently, discussions have been held between the Commonwealth Government and the State Government and the industry concerned to ensure, at the request of the Singapore Government, that the material is returned to Australia, properly handled and properly secured for the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is, of course, a responsibility of the Commonwealth Government to ensure that the movement to and from Australia of such materials shall be safely handled and offer no health risk in any way.

That advice has been given presumably to the Government as well as to the industry concerned. I am not aware of a date being fixed in this matter but I do stress to Senator Coleman what I said recently. In industry and in medicine there is a very considerable traffic and movement of these radioactive materials and, therefore, an experience and ability to handle their disposal.

<PARA> My understanding is that the South Australian Uranium Enrichment Committee is in dialogue with what is called the Uranium Enrichment Group of Australia. Senator Young will recall that UEGA is a private enterprise joint venture made up of four major Australian companies. The joint venture is undertaking, at its own cost, a study of the technical and economic viability of establishing a uranium enrichment industry in Australia, and we have a particular interest in the long term development of Roxby Downs. As to the South Australian Government's interest in these matters, it is in close and continuing consultation with both the Commonwealth and UEGA and we are aware of its views. The Commonwealth considers that any future Australian uranium enrichment industry would need to be commercially viable in its own right. To this end, we are facilitating UEGA's work, and we believe that any decisions on proceeding, siting, or other matters must be based on commercial factors. The study is well advanced.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator's question touches on an area in which there have been difficulties, that is, in industrial relations on Christmas Island. He will be aware, as will many other honourable senators, that in late 1979 the Government appointed Mr Sweetland, a former senior executive of the Broken Hill Pty. Co. Ltd, to examine that and other matters which were of concern on the island. The report which Mr Sweetland prepared was in fact tabled in Parliament early last year, and no doubt the honourable senator has seen it. The report has now been carefully considered by the Government and, following that consideration, the Government proposes to take certain action which touches on the areas of concern to Senator Mulvihill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the most important initiatives is that the Government is to provide for a review of the Christmas Island Arbitrator's decisions by an appeal bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. I think this will bring the Christmas Island workers within the Commonwealth arbitration system in the way that the honourable senator was suggesting. The Government intends to introduce legislation in this session of Parliament to give effect to this decision, which was taken by the Government only after the closest consultation with all interested parties, including the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the principal unions representing the Christmas Island work force. The new arrangements will mean that the industrial practices and procedures applying on the island will more closely approximate those applying in the various mainland industrial jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator also referred to the formation of a Commonwealth-owned organisation. As from 30 June 1981, the British Phosphate Commissioners will cease operations on the island and a new organisation, owned and controlled by the Commonwealth, will be responsible for the island's mining operations. The Government has decided to appoint a trade union representative to the board of the new company and proposes to discuss this appointment shortly with the ACTU. In order to ensure an harmonious transitional period, the Government has also agreed that former employees of the British Phosphate Commissionersshall have continued employment with the new organisation, with no loss of the service entitlements which may have accrued from their previous employment with the Phosphate Commissioners.</PARA>

The profit made from the sale of those stock is subject to taxation, which in some cases can be about equal to the value of the stock sold.

There has been some conflict because, as the honourable senator pointed out, sensitivities are involved in the seizure of medical records. I do not believe that the activities of themselves place in jeopardy the rights of patients, as he suggests might be the case. The honourable senator asked whether action should be taken to stop the practice of issuing warrants and to replace it with some other appropriate mechanism.

I claim that the honourable member has severely misrepresented me because, in fact, in a speech which I made in the Senate last Thursday night, I quoted directly from the Hansard.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, Senator O'Byrne asked me a question about an accident involving a semi-trailer loaded with radioactive materials. I regret that I could not give him the information at the time. In fact, it appears that the incident occurred on the day I left Australia to go abroad to the International Energy Agency meeting and I had not registered the fact that the incident had occurred. I now point out that on 4 December 1980 a semi-trailer overturned on the Pacific Highway near Port Macquarie-regrettably killing the driver-and blocking the highway with cargo, including DDT, foodstuffs and packages containing radioactive material. The highway was cleared by emergency services. The radioactive substances involved in the accident were part of a density measuring device for geophysical logging of bore holes. These two substances had half lives of 30 years and 458 years respectively and are moderately to highly toxic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Atomic Energy Commission officer who inspected the accident site, shortly after the accident, on behalf of the State Health Commission-I interpolate that happily he was on holiday at the time and therefore on the spot-reported that, although the outer packaging had been broken, the radio-isotope container showed no sign of damage and no radioactive material escaped. The sources were being transported, in accordance with international and State regulations, in containers designed to withstand such accidents. The radiation levels on the surface of the containers would have been such that they could have been handled safely without special protection. Normal procedures, in the case of such accidents, are for the police to contact the State Health Commission which has legislative responsibility for matters relating to radioactive materials. If necessary, the Health Commission contacts the Atomic Energy Commission for assistance. Both the Atomic Energy Commission and the Health Commission operate 24-hour emergency services and a safety officer is on duty at Lucas Heights at all times.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator O'Byrne referred to an incident between the State police and the police at Lucas Heights. I am advised that the State police contacted the Australian Federal Police security officer at the Commission who, in fact, was briefed on the procedures to be adopted. The reason why that policeman apparently did not follow the procedures is the subject of investigation. Nevertheless, I indicate that it so happened that there was an officer of the Atomic Energy Commission at Port Macquaries at the time of the accident and that he was at the scene shortly afterwards. At the request of the police medical officer, medical tests have been carried out on the policemen concerned but it would seem unlikely that any ill effects would have resulted from handling the containers. It is noted that the truck was reported as containing a large quantity of DDT and a fungicide called sodium propanate. As I have said, the incident coincided with the day I left for abroad.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Last Thursday, Senator Tate asked a question in regard to El Salvador. I have consulted with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I am advised that the Australian Government has made its own assessment of the situation in El Salvador. As to the causes of the present conflict, El Salvador's political instability has arisen from a prolonged period of acute inequality of income and wealth and repressive governments in a densely populated country. Following a coup in 1979 a series of governments have attempted a number of major reforms including, crucially, land reform. Caught between right wing and left wing extremists the present Government has found it increasingly difficult to pursue its efforts at reform. Violence and terrorism have accelerated and human rights have been violated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Based on the Government's own assessment of the present situation and the Minister's conversation in Washington last Friday with Vice President Bush, it is clear that a two-pronged approach is necessary in El Salvador. While strong words and actions are justified to cut off external arms supplies for left wing guerrilla movements, support for economic reform and for social reform is also necessary to remove the historical causes of political instability and this is recognised by the United States Government. While the Minister is not able to release the details on which the Government's assessment is based, he can say that on the basis of its own assessments, the Government accepts evidence provided by the United States of external support for left wing guerrillas in El Salvador. As the Prime Minister said last Thursday, we consider that the United States is entirely right in seeking to cut off that source of disturbance, that source of revolution, in Latin America. The Prime Minister's statement was welcomed warmly by the United States Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have submitted this matter for discussion today because it is a matter of public importance, I believe, to this Senate, to this Parliament and indeed to all Australia. I have done so in the hope that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume), on behalf of the Government, will respond positively and not attempt to defend the indefensible. I hope that the Minister will not spend a lot of time telling us what has been done but will direct his attention to what is not being done and give some positive undertakings on behalf of the Government. As everyone in this Senate will know, the disadvantages suffered by Aboriginal Australians are numerous and cover all areas of public policy and the law. Wherever one looks-housing, employment, education, health, transport, access to communication facilities-one finds serious, gross disadvantage for the Aboriginal people. However, I suggest to honourable senators that the underlying problem of Aboriginal disadvantage, as with all areas of disadvantage in our sort of society, is economic. Simply put, Aborigines are the poorest people in Australia. They fall into this category because the majority of them are without income other than inadequate and often erratically provided social security benefits. Aborigines by and large are unable to compete on the job market because they have no skills. This is the matter I wish to draw to the attention of the Senate today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a number of matters to which I expect and hope that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will respond. First of all, if we look at the situation concerning education for Aboriginal people and in particular vocationally oriented education we find a picture which goes quite a long way in explaining why Aboriginals are so unable to compete on the job market. I quote from the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training, the Williams report of February 1979. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Census returns--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, for 1971-</PARA>
<PARA>indicated that 25 per cent of the Aboriginal population had never attended school, that 43 per cent had not proceeded beyond primary education (and only one-third of them had completed primary education) and that only 2 per cent had proceeded as far as Year 10 of secondary school or higher. </PARA>
<PARA>The Williams report also cited figures for Aboriginal enrolments in Technical and Further Education institutions in 1975. Only eight Aboriginals enrolled in diploma courses; only 63 enrolled in certificate courses; 88 enrolled in apprenticeship courses; and 428 enrolled in pre-employment courses. The report states that 3,310 Aborigines enrolled in what was described as other courses. The bulk of these enrolments would have been in adult education courses, not apprenticeship or certificate courses which could be expected to lead to employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal people suffer a serious lack of employable qualifications compared with the white population. The data from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs concerning the qualifications of Aboriginal people as at the June 1976 census reveal that the number of Aboriginal people with diplomas or degrees was only 252 men and 231 women. There were 2,958 men and 1,069 women with technician or trade qualifications and another 393 persons with some form of vocational training. But of course the vast majority-over 83 per cent of Aboriginal people-have no qualifications at all. Education statistics to which it is very hard to get access-I will have something to say about the statistical problem later in my remarks-show an equally disadvantaged picture. Of those Aboriginal people for whom education statistics do exist, 9 per cent of the present school age population do not attend school; 13 per cent of the Aboriginal people over the age of 15 years have never attended school and overall Aboriginal children leave school earlier than their non-Aboriginal counterparts-75 per cent leave at or before the age of 15 years compared with 63 per cent of the total population, and only 2.5 per cent stay on to the age of 18 years compared with 6.3 per cent of the total population. </PARA>
<PARA> I present these statistics to the Senate this afternoon because I believe they are not commonly or widely recognised and their significance is not widely recognised. While we have this sort of gross disadvantage in respect of the access of Aboriginal children and adults to education and vocational education courses we will continue to have the very high rates of Aboriginal unemployment from which the Aboriginal community currently suffers. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a serious lack of trained personnel in the Aboriginal community. That lack exists particularly in the areas of greatest need. For example, I was very concerned to discover from an answer to a question I asked recently of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, that of the 340 Aboriginals employed in Commonwealth funded Aboriginal health programs in the latest year for which figures were available, none were doctors, only 12 were nurses and 328 were employed in support roles mainly as Aboriginal health workers, aides or assistants. I would be very interested to hear the views of the Minister, himself a trained doctor, on the total absence of any Aboriginal doctors in Australia at a time when more and more information about the appalling health problems in Aboriginal communities is being brought to the fore. </PARA>
<PARA> In Alice Springs, the figure for registered Aboriginal unemployment as at July of last year was 1,199 or over 7 per cent of the total number of Aboriginals registered as unemployed throughout Australia. On a recent visit to Alice Springs, I was told that the number of vacancies registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service was not far behind the number of registered unemployed. That picture, of course, could be interpreted by some unsympathetic people to mean that Aboriginals were not genuinely seeking employment. However, that is not the explanation. The explanation is that Aboriginal unemployed do not have the skills for the jobs that are available; so the vacancies cannot be filled from this vast number of Aboriginal people. The Government will, no doubt wish to point out that the advertising campaign conducted by NAEDC, the National Aboriginal Employment Development Committee, which was designed to create some sympathy for Aboriginal employment in the private sector, is soon to come to Alice Springs. Of course, I welcome that intention. However, if Aboriginal skills are as badly mismatched with job vacancies in Alice Springs as I am informed, surely such a campaign will have only limited success and the real solution will be the training of Aboriginal people to do the jobs. There are a number of Aboriginal people in training at the moment. Currently the figures show that 2,391 Aboriginal people are in full time training. However, I suggest that this is not an adequate number to meet the needs of either the Aboriginal community or the available job vacancies. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the consequence, nationally, of these inadequate education and training schemes we find a picture of considerable disadvantage. Currently, over 17,000 Aboriginal people are registered as unemployed. The Department of Employment and Youth Affairs estimated that this represented an unemployment rate of 37 per cent of the estimated Aboriginal work force. This is an unemployment rate six times that in the general work force. In our society and in our sort of economy, we find it intolerable that we have unemployment in the general work force approximating 7 per cent from time to time. That is a national scandal and a national disgrace and it is acknowledged, I think, by all political parties to be the case. But when we look at Aboriginal unemployment, we find a rate six times that in the general work force. Yet we hear very little from the Government about this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> It must also be pointed out that these figures represent only those Aboriginals registered with the CES as unemployed and therefore underestimate the real level of Aboriginal people unemployed. They do not include, for example, those who do not have access to the CES. That would include many Aboriginals living in remote areas or Aboriginals who are not contacted by vocational officers of the CES. They do not include over 1,200 Aboriginal people who are paid at the level of unemployment benefit for working on community development programs under the Community Development Employment Project. The figures do not include Aboriginal people seeking part time work. Therefore, the CES figures reflect a minimum level of Aboriginal unemployment. When we look at Aboriginal youth unemployment we find, as with youth unemployment in the general community, a picture of considerable disadvantage. The most recent figures for Aboriginal unemployment in the 15 to 25 year age group show that 3,670 Aboriginals aged between 15 years and 19 years and 3,969 Aboriginals aged between 20 years and 25 years were unemployed. Forty-seven per cent of Aboriginals unemployed at that time were under 25 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA> In presenting these statistics to the Senate, I am aware that I am presenting a very fragmented and incomplete picture. I wish to make some comment on that. One of the main difficulties in assessing the real problems of Aboriginal employment is the lack of systematic statistics on the subject. The most significant inadequacy concerns the Department of Social Security. The Department of Social Security does not maintain regular statistics on the number of Aboriginals in receipt of unemployment benefit. Statistics are not kept on the number of Aboriginals employed under the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training Scheme. The Public Service Board does publish a statistical bulletin called 'The Employment of Aboriginals in the Australian Public Service' which is useful. However, statutory authorities are excluded from this bulletin and so the access of Aboriginals to employment in statutory authorities is very hard to establish. Similarly, in the area of education I am informed by the Minister in answer to questions on notice about Aboriginals in education that official statistics are not available since some education authorities do not maintain records based on race. It may have been regarded at some time in the past as racist to keep separate statistics on separate races or persons of separate ethnic origins. However, I reject that view very strongly. The usefulness of such statistics concerning education and employment of people according to race, if collected properly and regularly, must be apparent to all honourable senators. I urge the Minister to take steps to ensure the proper measurement of Aboriginal employment throughout the entire public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Another difficulty relating to Aboriginals getting access to training and subsequently to employment is presented by the inadequate training allowances. Because of the disadvantaged situation concerning education and training, many Aboriginal people currently wishing to undertake work force training are mature age people. They are in the 20 to 30 age group and have families to support. Yet the highest amount a trainee student with a dependent spouse and two children could receive under current training schemes is $125 a week. This amount, of course, is totally inadequate, in many parts of Australia to maintain a reasonable standard of living. I ask the Minister to turn his attention to the need for positive discrimination or particularly helpful training allowances for Aboriginals with dependent families who need and wish to undertake training. While ever training opportunities are beyond the financial reach of the Aboriginal people, the employment situation will not improve. </PARA>
<PARA> The crux of my argument today is that the Government, as the largest employer in the country, ought to be providing more employment opportunities for Aboriginal people. If the Government were serious about Aboriginal unemployment, it could ensure that all of its departments and all statutory bodies initiated affirmative action for Aboriginal employment. The level of Aboriginal employment within the public sector has been declining. I could cite statistics to indicate that but I see that my time is running out. I also have available-I am sure the Minister also has this available to him-the number of Aboriginals who are currently employed in the public sector. The numbers are too low. As I said before, I hope the Minister will not defend the current situation. </PARA>
<PARA> If we pass on to statutory authorities which seem to me to present an ideal opportunity for affirmative action with regard to Aboriginal people, we find a very unbalanced picture. As I said, regular statistics are not available concerning the employment of Aboriginal people in statutory authorities. However, I inquired what the situation was from a number of our larger statutory authorities. Qantas Airways Ltd, with an approximate staff of 13,000 people, employed probably two Aboriginal flight stewards. There may be a couple of other people employed amongst the general staff. But there are two Aboriginal people employed by that huge statutory authority. Surely that is not a situation that the Minister will defend. Trans-Australia Airlines employs nine Aboriginal people; that is, 0.1 per cent of its work force. I inquired of Joint House Department about the number of Aboriginal people employed here in Parliament House where we again have a large and very visible public area of employment. It is, I suggest, a most appropriate area of employment for Aboriginal people in terms of positive discrimination and for presenting positive role models. No Aboriginal people are employed in Parliament House. So it goes on. I was unable to get statistics from the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The Australia Council employs one Aboriginal person. The Australian Postal Commission employs 0.2 per cent Aboriginal persons, and so it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Minister that the Government must adopt two main strategies if the economic disadvantage of Aboriginals is to be overcome by the creation of employment. The first strategy concerns the Government's role as trainer and provider of subsidies to the private sector to encourage it to adopt a training role. As I have pointed out, current training schemes are inadequate. What is needed is a nationally co-ordinated Aboriginal training program which will work within the public and private sectors and which will provide Aboriginal trainees with financial support at a realistic level. </PARA>
<PARA> The second strategy concerns the Government as employer. I put it to the Minister that the Government should require each Federal department and every statutory authority to set Aboriginal employment goals over a set timetable, and not a very long one-perhaps five years. The effect of putting a significant number of Aboriginal people into very visible employment areas, such as our national and international airlines, on ABC television and in Parliament House, would be significant. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I say that the Minister can make no plausible case that all is well with regard to Aboriginal training and employment. I hope he will not attempt to do so. In the spirit of constructive bipartisanship, which the Minister has invited me to take up, I ask these specific questions and hope that in the course of the Minister's response I shall receive some specific answers. Is he prepared to support the introduction into the Department of Social Security of a method of identifying Aboriginal recipients of pensions and benefits so that the true effect of social security programs on the unemployed Aboriginal persons can be known and assessed? Is he prepared to initiate a national Aboriginal employment and training council to co-ordinate and develop training and employment for Aboriginals throughout Australia? Is he prepared to support training allowances at a reasonable level for Aboriginal trainees with dependent families? Is he prepared to pursue with the Government the adoption of a clear, affirmative, action policy which will ensure the employment of a greatly increased number of Aboriginal people in all Commonwealth departments and all Commonwealth statutory authorities?</PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the outset, I recognise that the problems facing Aboriginal people in our society are manifold. I do not pretend that I have addressed all of them today. I have addressed only one problem-that of Aboriginal employment. But I would say that whereas a lot of the problems that Aboriginal people are facing-because they are of such long standing, because they involve such complex legal issues and because they involve such an accumulation of neglect and disadvantage-are very difficult to deal with, I have never said that the solutions were easy. But in the area of employment I think we have an area in which a Federal government of good will can act directly and effectively. As I have said, the Federal Government is the largest employer in this country. If it wishes to be an equal opportunity employer and an employer with affirmative action programs to bring Aboriginal people into the mainstream of economic life in this country, it can do so. I urge the Minister to treat this matter in the spirit of good faith in which I have raised it in the Senate and to tell the Senate what steps the Government, as an employer, is prepared to take with regard to Aboriginal employment in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the debate which has been brought on by the Opposition. I welcome the suggestion by the Opposition spokesman that we should take a bipartisan approach. I too want to see the benefits of this debate and of the policies towards Aboriginal people flow to the Aboriginal people. I want to see outcomes in terms of employment and I am not seeking a moment's political advantage in approaching this debate now. Nevertheless I draw to the Senate's attention the fact that the subject we are discussing, which was put forward by Senator Ryan, is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Federal Government to develop employment opportunities for Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA>With respect, that has not really been discussed at any length in the case that has been put to us. I would agree with many of the points raised. Aboriginal disadvantage is undoubted. The handicap under which Aboriginals labour is not questioned. But more is required than for the honourable senator or her colleagues to want to suggest that there has been a failure of the Federal Government to develop employment opportunities. They are her words-'the failure to develop employment opportunities'. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a story to tell and I would like to spend my time putting a balance to the view which the honourable senator has put. She has made a number of statements which are quite correct. It is undoubted that a large number of our corporations, our institutions and our own Parliament do not have a record of offering employment to Aboriginal Australians. I remind the Senate of the observation made by Professor Bernard Smith when delivering the Australian Broadcasting Commission Boyer lectures in 1980. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has an opportunity to develop a convergent culture with its sources in European traditions and the ancient land culture of the aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very good, desirable, goal statement by Professor Smith. But the development of that culture has not been, will not be and cannot be easy. Undoubtedly there will be areas of difficulty, areas of friction and areas of turbulence; and employment is one area. Employment-as we use the term in the non-Aboriginal sense-is an activity to provide cash resources. It is something which is quite new to many traditional Aboriginal people and Aboriginal communities. The Commonwealth Government has not failed to develop employment opportunities for Aboriginal people. Senator Ryan may argue that it has not developed these opportunities enough, not quickly enough, or at an appropriate level. But to say that these opportunities have not been developed is simply to ignore the facts as they exist. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is only too well aware that levels of Aboriginal unemployment are six times those of the non-Aboriginal community. We are aware of that. We acknowledge the handicap. We understand the problems such as the historical and continuing lack of access to education and skills training which Senator Ryan has already mentioned. We understand and recognise the lack of economic development in areas of high Aboriginal unemployment. It is not easy to find jobs in a depressed country town which has no employment for anyone. I think of some towns in my own State. It is very difficult when there is no work in such places. We understand the problems of lack of motivation. We understand the sometimes adverse community attitudes and-not to put it too bluntly-the racist attitudes, all of which require action and will require long term solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> But, in tackling the Aboriginal unemployment problem, the Commonwealth Government has developed programs which have been aimed at the Aboriginal population which seeks access to normal labour markets, particularly the urban Aboriginals; also it has sought to address itself to those Aboriginals who choose to live in remote Aboriginal communities with no economic base to generate employment. Our programs have also sought to address themselves to non-Aboriginal Australians because the attitudes of non-Aboriginals will be critical in some areas in making the jobs available and making people appropriately willing to cope with their new employees. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a paradox. If we want to, we can concentrate on the efforts at job creation, on the number of people who have been placed, or we can concentrate on the unemployment registrations. I suggest that we should be looking at both sets of figures and not just at one set of figures. We cannot look at the job creation or job placement figures and ignore the unemployment figures. I will not try to. On the other hand, we cannot concentrate on the unemployment figures without recognising what has been done over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA> If one is looking at the figures showing unemployment among Aboriginal Australians, it is worth while remembering that, of the 16,000 registered unemployed Aboriginals, 81 per cent of them are country registrations. Most of the time it is a problem of non-metropolitan unemployment. They are particular problems which are applicable, in some part, to non-Aboriginals as well. This is a particular problem of non-Aboriginal Australians. What is interesting and what is important is that the rate of rise of Aboriginal unemployment has been dropping steadily. In other words, the rate went up very rapidly between 1977 and 1978, and less rapidly the following year. The rise in Aboriginal unemployment between 1979 and 1980 was under 2 per cent. Although the unemployment is unacceptably high, it is beginning to drop. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recognise the honourable senator's interjection and I acknowledge the point. We are talking about people who are registered for employment. I recognise that that may not completely identify Aboriginal unemployment. I put it to the honourable senator that, as we extend our capacity to move into communities and as we extend our capacity to bring social security benefits to those who are entitled to them, there may be an apparent rise in the number of unemployed. It may in fact represent the discovery of some hidden unemployed among the Aboriginal people. We have to be careful in interpreting that as a worsening of the situation. It may be in fact the first step in improving what is a bad situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to concentrate for a while on what Aboriginals have available to them, but before I do that I want to indicate that, State by State, Aboriginal unemployment-in doing this I am coming back to Senator Robertson's point-is highest in New South Wales, followed by Queensland and then Western Australia, with the number of registered unemployed in the Northern Territory being considerably less. The Aboriginal population is less in the Northern Territory, but the number of registrations suggest that possibly there are more Aboriginals in the Northern Territory who have not been discovered. I put it to honourable senators that we have to be careful about their discovery. That does not mean an increase in the number of unemployed. We have to look as well at the balance of what is being done to provide resources, facilities and opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment, Aboriginals may avail themselves of the full range of services of the Commonwealth Employment Service, particularly in the more populated areas. Where particular employment assistance is sought, specialist employment officers-they are vocational officers-are available to counsel and support the Aboriginals seeking employment. We have to acknowledge that these vocational officers are useful and helpful. They are located in areas of significant Aboriginal population and they supplement services provided by the general Commonwealth Employment Service staff. That is the first thing the Commonwealth Government is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Employment Service is placing Aboriginals in jobs. This is part of the balancing of the grim picture painted by Senator Ryan. In the financial year 1978-79 almost 6,500 Aboriginals were placed in employment throughout Australia by the Commonwealth Employment Service. In the following year 7,472 Aboriginals were placed in employment. That is an increase of 16 per cent. Let us look at the present financial year. We can say that in the first six months of it almost 4,500 Aboriginals have been recorded as having been placed. Those figures are up considerably on those for the previous year. What we can see in this situation is that, through our normal services, we are able to place more and more Aboriginals in employment with each year that passes. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1978-79 over 12,500 Aboriginals were referred by the Commonwealth Employment Service to prospective employers. In the following year almost 14,000 Aboriginals were referred. I must say that the figure is probably higher than that because in two of the areas operated by the Commonwealth Employment Service no returns were available owing to industrial action. We know that at least 14,000 Aboriginals were referred by the CES. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a large number of government programs that are designed to alleviate unemployment among Aboriginals. There are training programs that are designed to try to help them to overcome some of the disabilities to which Senator Ryan has already referred. These are some of the affirmative policies which are being put into place. We have no difficulty in Senator Ryan's call for affirmative policies. We accept that proposition. The National Employment and Training system already provides training to enhance the long term employment prospects of individuals by giving them extra skills which will be helpful to them in the open labour market. In this financial year approximately 4,500 Aboriginals will receive training through the NEAT system.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the national employment strategy for Aboriginals in the Australian Public Service. Over 650 positions in Commonwealth Government departments and authorities have been identified as requiring the ability to communicate with Aboriginals or some knowledge of Aboriginal culture. So far this amounts to 650 positions. We are looking to increase that number of positions. A pilot-scheme-the Clerk (Aboriginal Services) Scheme-has been commenced to promote the recruitment of Aboriginals into the Australian Public Service. Although there have been only a few recruitments to date, that program is already under way, working and in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The projects funded under the Community Development Employment Project scheme, which has been introduced in remote areas of Australia, employ some 1,300 Aboriginals in 18 remote communities. From some areas-notably the Torres Strait area-there is a call for those schemes to continue. The Torres Strait area actually wants them extended. The special works project scheme, which is funded through my Department, provides employment for Aboriginals in local government areas. Aboriginal organisations and some private employers can also take part in the scheme. Priority is given to employing Aboriginals who are ineligible for assistance under other employment or training programs. In this financial year the Government will be able to provide 415 man years of employment under this program alone. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Aboriginal Affairs' training programs are being extensively funded this year. About $5.5m has been set aside. Approximately 3,900 Aboriginals will receive some form of training through these grants. This training will include training in vocational skills, community management and welfare assistance. The National Aboriginal Employment Development Committee is at work and approximately 1,600 Aboriginals have been placed in employment in the areas covered by its promotion programs. It has been estimated that over 1,000 of these positions are extra positions which would not have been filled without the promotion programs that are run through this Committee. I am an employer of Aboriginals. I commend Senator Bonner, Senator Robertson and Senator Melzer, who will be speaking in this debate, for employing Aboriginals. I even commend employing Aboriginals to Senator Ryan. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is excellent. I did not say that the honourable senator did not employ Aboriginals. My first trainee left about one month ago to take up a permanent position. A second trainee has now started work in the electorate office. I have an Aboriginal clerk working in my office and one of the Aboriginal assistant research officers who was with me several months ago has now been promoted to a class 5 position in the Third Division of the Public Service. I hope that he is just one of very many who will be following that course. A large number of people do not just talk about employing Aboriginals but are involved in doing what they can. In my own Department 322 positions at various levels have been identified as being positions which could be filled by aboriginals. This figure is about 32 per cent of the Department's establishment. This is the largest number of identified positions of any department within the Australian Public Service. We make sure that the job vacancies for these positions are advertised in the Press through a weekly circular to all Aboriginal organisations to make sure that they know the jobs are there. We have a list of interested persons among all Aboriginal tertiary students. We modify our selection procedures to include a recognition of special Aboriginal abilities as a significant selection criterion, to try to make it easier for Aboriginal applicants, and more likely that they will be successful in applying for these kinds of positions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As at 1 October 1978 about 1,180 Aboriginals were employed in the Commonwealth Public Service. A year later there were 566 but what had happened in the meantime was that a number of Aboriginals who had appeared to be employed in the Public Service were still employed, but the authorities under which they were funded had moved out. Senator Bonner will take up this matter later. He will talk about the Aboriginal Development Commission and about the grants-in-aid programs. He will also talk about some of the other bodies with which Aboriginal employment can be seen. The figures I gave to honourable senators actually represented a slight increase of some 13 people for the period after allowances had been made for transfers. During the period 1976-80 while the non-Aboriginal numbers had decreased from 820 to 550, the number of Aboriginals employed had almost doubled, from 109 to almost 180. The number of Aboriginal people employed in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs is now about 132. This figure covers people at all levels of the Service from Special Adviser, Level 4 in the Second Division, down to clerical assistants and steno-secretaries. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not gone through some of the other programs at any length. I have not talked at any length about the National Employment Strategy for Aboriginals scheme, nor have I spoken at any length really about the CDEPs or some of the other training schemes. My Department has allocated this year some $3.5m for specific training programs. We have allocated $234,000 to develop new steps in training with emphasis on self-management. We have provided support to Darwin and Alice Springs community colleges to establish courses to provide Aboriginals with skills necessary for community management and self-sufficiency. The Aboriginal resident community worker training program is also under way. Approximately 9,000 Aboriginals are expected to be assisted in some fashion by government employment and training programs this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Charles Perkins was the first Aboriginal university graduate. He finished his university training only in the mid-1960s. He is now at a very senior level of public administration in this country. He is the first of a stream of Aboriginal university graduates. He is the first of a stream of graduates who are coming out of the colleges of advanced education. If honourable senators look at the undergraduate schools they will see that Aboriginals are there, not in the numbers that I or Senator Ryan or any other participant in this debate would want, but they are there. Aboriginals are now taking part in technical training. There are now thousands more high school graduates than there have been in the past. There are many more job holders. We are getting somewhere, we are making progress. There are programs in place and the fact that there is a lot more to be done is simply a reason for us to try harder. There is no way that the Opposition can assert, as it would seek to do in raising this matter of public importance, that there has been a failure on the part of the Federal Government to develop employment opportunities for Aboriginals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the matter of public importance so capably raised by my colleague Senator Ryan. Before I enter into my prepared material, I must make a couple of comments on what was said by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Sentor Peter Baume). The Minister claimed that Senator Ryan had not addressed herself to the topic. The topic, as I understand it, is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Federal Government to develop employment opportunities for Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA>I am a simple soul. I would have thought that that meant basically the failure to get Aboriginals into employment. I think the man in the street would accept that sort of proposition. If the Minister has developed programs, if the Government has done these things, then the man in the street is quite entitled to ask: How effective are they? Of course the percentage of Aborigines employed would have to be the criterion and the percentage unemployed would have to be a factor. The Minister also said that he recognised the problem, and I do not doubt that at all. He is a very astute person. He has taken a keen interest in the Aboriginal situation over the years. I am encouraged by this because a philosopher tells us that if we recognise the problem we are half way towards a solution. All we want to see now from the Minister is the solution. The Minister mentioned training. I have some comments to make on this aspect, but first let me repeat what I have so often said in this place, that training is not the key, that the creation of job or employment opportunities is the key. </PARA>
<PARA> I will direct my attention to the situation in the Northern Territory, though I think the comments I will make will apply fairly generally. The Minister has indicated that unemployment in Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory is high. The recorded figure is high and the unrecorded figure is even higher. It is high also in the urban areas of the Northern Territory. Both of these situations are to be deplored because something can be done about both and unemployment need not be so high. I will spend just a couple of minutes speaking very briefly on the effects of unemployment on the individual and on the community, but in particular on the youth because that is where the problem is the greatest. </PARA>
<PARA> Studies have been carried out by the Young Men's Christian Association and others of non-Aboriginal people in urban areas, but similar studies have not been done for Aboriginal people, although social workers, teachers, Aboriginal elders and others have all commented on the problem. The effect of unemployment and virtually no prospect of employment is a debilitating and damaging one on the young people of the Northern Territory. We see at an early age-at the age of 12 or 13-the young boy or girl, and particularly the boy, losing interest in school. The boy feels that the teachers have let him down because they have said to him: 'If you work hard, if you do well at school, you will get a good job when you leave'. Of course there are no jobs, so he becomes disillusioned with teachers. He becomes disillusioned with whites because most of the teachers are white. He becomes disillusioned with authority and he becomes anti-social. At a later age the same sort of anti-social behaviour comes forward as anti-authority. The sad thing, of course, is that it is not only anti-authority towards white people; it is also anti-authority towards his own Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an old adage that the devil finds work for idle hands. Unfortunately, this is the situation that we see in communities in the Northern Territory. There is juvenile delinquency out of sheer boredom. There is juvenile drinking and petrol sniffing out of sheer boredom. There are crimes of break and enter to get grog because they do not have any money to buy grog. The situation for the older people is almost as bad. There is an abdication of responsibility for their families. The man with a wife and several children will say: 'I have no money. It is your fault I have no money. You look after my wife and kids'. He then goes on the grog. The breakdown of the old men's authority leads to a disintegration of the community. There is no doubt that the extension of the outstation movement has many causes. Some of these are: The need to get away from the grog, that is, where the central community is not dry; the need to keep the group or the clan integrated on traditional authority; the need to find meaningful employment for all the young people; and, of course, the desire to occupy traditional homeland centres. There are many other causes but the two key ones are related to the topic we are discussing at present-the need to find meaningful employment for young people to keep them out of trouble and the need to keep them away from this rejection of any sort of authority, particularly the authority of the old men. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is Aboriginal unemployment in the communities of the Northern Territory so high? I suggest that there are three basic reasons and I will deal with them. First, there are the limited employment opportunities; second, there is the fact of people being not trained to fill the vacancies; and third, there is the fact that finance is not available to employ those who want to work. We have always heard the cry in this area of limited employment opportunities that the location of the Aboriginal communities does not lend itself to industry. This is the usual answer. We talk about inhospitable country and the fact that there are no resources there and no opportunities to develop anything. But studies that have been carried out have shown quite clearly that almost all adults-by adults I mean those 16 years and older-could be employed in the communities with the right sort of organisation. Let us just take one simple case of all those services that are required by the community. There is the need for shop attendants, mechanics, projectionists, teachers, drivers and gardeners. All these avenues really have not been explored. The studies are available. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend, as the Minister has done-I give him and his predecessors full credit for this-the introduction of the Community Development Employment Project. It was a proposition I spoke about when I first became a senator and it is one which I have always supported. Of course, we must see an extension of this proposition. We cannot hold up one or two communities or a small percentage and say: 'This is the answer'. If it is the answer, let us use it everywhere else. There is little real evidence of attempts to create employment opportunities. As I indicated in my introductory remarks, I see the creation of employment opportunities as the key. We need to study the area to find out what can be done, then create opportunities for employment and train the people to do the jobs that have been created. I will come back to that matter in a moment when I talk about training. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter that I want to mention is that there has been little attempt to provide guidance and assistance for individual projects. I refer to the CDEP as well as many other individual and group projects. People have not been trained to fill the vacancies when they occur. So when we need to have houses built on settlements, to use the old phrase, the carpenter, the bricklayer and the plumber are not available. When we want to put sewerage in some of the areas the only jobs that we can offer the people are the ditch digging jobs. We do not have the plumbers there to do the job. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that the two areas where training has been better than in others are nursing and teaching. In nursing, unfortunately, training is taken only up to the aide level but teachers are trained up to the full level because of the work of my senior colleague, Senator Cavanagh, and many others from 1972 to 1975 when we had that wonderful concept of Aboriginality as a qualification and a desire to see Aboriginal people moving into all the jobs. I remember quite clearly the times that I have spent in the Territory trying to make the point that every job in the Education Department, which was my area, would eventually be filled by Aboriginal people. We want to see that happening but despite the comments that have been made by Senator Baume, we do not see it happening and we do not see any great indication that it will happen in the near future, but rather in the quite distant future. Aboriginal people have become full members of the Commonwealth Teaching Service. There are problems, of course, as I raised with the Minister last week. Again, because of lack of finance from the Government, we are not able to seek replacements, so the training is not going ahead as fast as it should. </PARA>
<PARA> In the main, little training has been done, but not because it has not been attempted. There is no doubt that the Ministers' advisers could tell them of 20 years or more of real attempts at training, but the training has not been appropriate and it has not been effective. It has not been appropriate because it has not been related. The Government cannot say that over the years it has not been told what ought to be done. Many people have told it that the Aboriginal people who are brought to Darwin to do bricklaying do not relate this to bricklaying at Hooker Creek. If they do plumbing at Alice Springs, in some strange way it is not the same as doing plumbing at Areyonga. This has been said many times. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the report of the Stephen committee. It set very clear guidelines on what ought to be done. I will sum up very quickly the recommendations it put forward. Firstly, it said that any training undertaken should be on-site training and that any essential training should be done by visiting trainers, supported by the local tradesmen and the local school teachers. It recommended that all work should be designed on modular programming so that it could be done a bit at a time, and that the certification should be cumulative so that as each module was completed an indication could be registered on the certificate that that module had been completed. Each module would be capable of being sold in the market-place, that being either the town situation or the rural situation. Numerous interdepartmental committees have talked about this for years. I talked to my old colleague Martin Ford, who has been commissioned to do a study yet again. He has just completed that study. I do not know what will happen to it. He does not know either. I wonder whether that study will give us any more information on what ought to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I make the point strongly that training-just training-is still not appropriate. We need to have job creation first and then appropriate training. As Senator Baume has said, we do have Mr Perkins in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, and other Aboriginals are filling positions throughout the Public Service and in the Northern Territory. I do not deny that in other areas also-such as mechanics, nursing, teaching and others-we have had some outstanding successes but there is no doubt that the vast bulk of the people are missing out on getting a job in their community or in the town because they are not qualified. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth area of government inactivity at which I wish to look is the lack of available finance. Last week I asked the Minister: Why do we have inadequate municipal services? Quite obviously the answer is that there is not any money to pay for them. The answer that came from the Minister was: The Northern Territory Government has not made the finance available. I am afraid, with due respect, that we cannot pass the buck that easily. The Minister has the responsibility to see that money is provided-he was given that responsibility in 1967-and then, having seen that it is provided, to see that it is properly spent. What is the situation of the Aboriginal people in urban areas? Aboriginal people are not qualified to fill the jobs that are available. In many cases they are not prepared for living in urban areas. As the Minister stated, the attitude of employers in some cases is racist in the extreme. Others are not prepared to make the sorts of special allowances that are necessary to cope with the working habits of the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> What has the Government done? Firstly, it claims that it has set up an example in employing apprentices and others. I accept that. All I ask the Minister to do is to give the Senate some indication of the number of people in apprenticeships and the number of people in employment at present. He has given us some of those figures. I would like to relate those to the number who are unemployed. I suggest strongly that the Government has not provided appropriate training along the lines that the Stephen committee and other committees have recommended. It has not prepared employers sufficiently to take Aboriginal people into their employment. Let me say that some individual Commonwealth Employment Service officers have done outstanding work. I commend them for it, but sufficient work has not been done. Again I ask the Minister to give us the figures for unemployment among Aboriginal people and non-Aboriginal people and let us see who is disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the solution? Quite clearly, the solution is firstly to create employment opportunities, preferably by Aboriginal-run enterprises-with assistance, of course, rather than the dumping of money onto people and telling them to do the job. Many industries are favoured by the Aboriginal people. I refer to the pastoral project at Willowra and many others. The Minister knows of these. We should provide appropriate training for Aboriginal people along the lines that I have suggested. It should be done at the Aboriginal community by visiting trainers, supported by the local tradesmen, the local school teachers and then, through modular programs, cumulative certificates should be given. We should make sure, of course, that this work is tied in with schooling. I use the word schooling rather than education because it is broader. Training of any sort, to be effective, must be tied in with what goes on in a school. I would suggest that education is attitude development. We need to do a lot of that. Children will not work at school if there is no job for them when they finish. They have been fooled too often. I cannot make the point too often that job creation is the vital aspect. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, let me simply say that I believe the Opposition has shown that Aboriginal people are disadvantaged. We have shown the solution is quite clearly in the hands of the Federal Government and the State or Territory governments. We have demonstrated that the Federal Minister has responsibility and we can claim that the present Minister and his predecessors have let the Aboriginal people down. The way is open to correct this situation. I suggest that in what we have said today the Minister and his advisers have been given some additional thoughts on how this might be done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been indicated we are discussing a matter of public importance, namely: 'The failure of the Federal Government to develop employment opportunities for Aborigines'. I say at the outset that I wish the situation were so simple that it could just be defined as: 'The failure of the Federal Government to develop employment opportunities . . .' That there is a problem is not denied. It is accepted by both sides of this chamber and I think by every serious thinking person within the community. I think the situation has resulted from more than just a lack of employment opportunities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are dealing with a people who for about 200 years have been seeking to make their way in a society that has been 2,000 years or more in the making. I guess that they are suffering from culture shock, future shock or whatever we might like to call it. They are a people who have lived and survived in probably one of the harshest environments on earth. Their living and surviving have not despoiled or fouled the environment. They have lived in and, I suppose I might say harvested, or at least found a way to come to grips with, the environment without harming it. They have not had the benefit of the technology that we have. Of course, we must recognise that we could not survive in this country as they have for 2,000 years. During that time they have developed traditions and a culture. We are still doing that in our new land. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the beginning of my remarks, for Aborigines to make their way in our society we must provide them with more than employment opportunities. We must look at their difficulties with sympathy and compassion, while at the same time trying to provide employment for them. In the last few years many people, unfortunately with more zeal and sympathy than knowledge and common sense, have advocated advancements that have not had the desired effect. I will give two examples: Firstly there was the court decision that required Aboriginal stockmen on station properties to be paid full award wages. It was an unfortunate decision at that time, although one must agree that it was inevitable; it had to happen. At that time an arrangement existed on the station properties which may be called paternalism, but it worked. The stockmen were employed on properties and they were kept by the property owners. They worked and had pride in their jobs. Those who were good at their jobs were automatically promoted. They might have run mustering camps on their own-without the station foreman. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I regret the results. I regret what has happened. I lived through it. I was not in this area; I was in the north-west of Queensland when the changes occurred and saw what happened when station property owners could no longer afford to pay the full award wage to large numbers of Aboriginals. I saw them become fringe dwellers on the outskirts of country towns without the pride that they had when they had good employment. People who sought to do good for the Aboriginals have not yet come to grips with the tremendous problems created and which still remain. As I said, it was inevitable but I think the change could have been handled better and brought in a lot more smoothly so that we would not have seen the degradation of these fine people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In one fell swoop we decided to give Aboriginals equality. They had the right to consume alcohol. On the face of it, who can argue with that, if we see it as one of the attributes of a white society. Of course, alcohol has had a tremendous and far-reaching effect on Aboriginals. We have almost literally written off a generation of Aboriginals because of alcohol. It has been very damaging to these people. It is quite interesting to note-Senator Robertson with his knowledge of the Northern Territory touched on the matter-that where the clan structure is still intact and where there is clan discipline, the elders are doing their best to steer the young people away from all the problems that the consumption of alcohol involves. Some Aboriginal communities are dry. In some areas when the canteen is open, Aboriginals are allowed to buy alcohol-that is, mainly beer and no spirits-only in a jug. In other words, they have to drink it there. They cannot take cans or stubbies away with them. It is quite ironic that the elders are trying to come to grips with a situation that we in our paternalism thought would provide them with equality.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the story is not all bad. There are many Aboriginals in all types of employment. They are holding down good and permanent jobs. Indeed, two bright parts of my life this year have involved Aboriginal families who have been very close to my family. In one instance, the father phoned me and asked me whether I would like to go to the Edinburgh Air Force Base because his son was taking part in a passing out parade. When I arrived, I found that not only had he completed his basic training but also he had come first in his course. I thought that was tremendous. Also, on Monday of this week an official in the Queensland railways phoned me. We were both engine drivers and spent many hours together in the railways. He thought I would like to know that my friend had just passed his locomotive inspectors examination. That is no mean achievement and I thought it was marvellous. I rang him and he was rightfully proud because he had done so well. I give just two examples that have happened this year and which prove that the Aboriginal story is not all bad, that they can hold good and permanent jobs and take their rightful place in society. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, as this matter of public importance indicates, there is a problem and it is recognised by all honourable senators. Of course, the Federal Government is aware of it and has developed programs aimed at both the Aboriginal population, which is seeking access to the normal labour market-normal employment-and also at that other section, the Aboriginals who choose to live in remote Aboriginal communities with no economic base to generate their support. Investigations by the National Aboriginal Employment Development Committee in 1978 found the following causal factors: Absence of economic development in areas of high Aboriginal population, lack of education and skills and depressed rural industries. The latter finding was one of the contributing factors involved at the time of the granting of award wages to Aboriginals. The wool industry was on the decline and since then we have seen the massive problems in the beef industry, the lack of motivation and the resultant adverse community attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose one of the first aspects that we have to look at is education. We realise that massive problems exist there. The Government has put money into education. I think in 1980-81 $13.2m was directed towards Aboriginal education. There are 68 direct grant projects for 3,000 students, plus employment for 480 Aboriginals working as literary officers, teacher aids and traditional teaching and liaison officers. It is expected that about 2,800 Aboriginals will receive direct training under grants for training and that 4,500 will be trained under programs supported by grants to the States. It is interesting to look at the increase in the numbers of Aboriginals involved in basic education. In 1979 there were 499 participants in receipt of Aboriginal study grants, and in 1980 there were 7,202. In 1971, 4,025 Aboriginals received secondary grants. In 1979, 16,189 Aboriginals received such grants. Quite often, more of these grants are available to Aboriginal children than to white children who are in similar conditions, particularly in the rurally depressed areas surrounding some of our country towns. </PARA>
<PARA> In tackling the Aboriginal unemployment problem, the Commonwealth Government has developed programs aimed at both the Aboriginal population which seeks access to the normal market and those who live in Aboriginal communities. We can only spend money wisely; we cannot throw money away as though it will solve all of our problems. We must have the adequate resources and people who can work in these communities. I suppose that we would like to spend more money in this area but we would also like to spend more money on lots of other things. I think what is more important is that the money that has been allocated is well spent. I will go through some of the schemes that were outlined by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Employment Strategy for Aboriginals is one scheme which is known pretty well to many of our members. As has been indicated, members are employing Aboriginals under that scheme. In my own town of Rockhampton, the Australian Broadcasting Commission employs two young ladies under that scheme. One is doing general announcing duties both on television and on radio and has progressed to interviews as well. She is doing a very good job. The ABC is quite proud of these young ladies. NESA, as it is called, is an intensive effort to create training and employment opportunities for Aboriginals in the public sector. Of course, this scheme has been complemented by a concentrated and a geographically spread campaign to create employment opportunities for Aboriginals in the private sector as well. Together with that there is the National Employment and Training system. Many people are trained under this system. I believe that, in December 1980, 986 Aboriginals were receiving training under the NEAT system in Commonwealth, State or the Northern Territory Public Service departments or agencies. In the Commonwealth Public Service alone, between August 1978 and August 1980, 563 NEAT trainees had completed their training and 302 had gained employment. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned, the National Aboriginal Employment Development Committee is seeking to stimulate employment amongst private industry. I believe it has done so with some success. Its operations extend to many areas, including north Queensland, Dubbo and Spencer's Gulf, to name a few. Its activities begin with media campaigns which help to stimulate community awareness of the employment problems facing Aboriginals and then there is direct contact between employers and the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs officers. As has been mentioned, the Department does a tremendous job. Its officers are people with great capacity, compassion and sympathy, and they go and talk to these people. Of course, there are discussions on employment issues with the local Aboriginal organisations and their communities. Through this program, approximately 1,600 Aboriginals have been placed in employment in these areas.</PARA>
<PARA> The Special Work Projects provide subsidies to local governments, to Aboriginal organisations and to private employers so that they also can employ Aboriginals. The Community Development Employment Projects are aimed at community projects which do not have a viable base on which to operate. The grants are basically similar to the unemployment benefit. A further subsidy is provided to meet overhead costs. The Aboriginals then are employed on a part-time basis. In 1980-81, 18 communities operated under the CDEP scheme, which employs approximately 1,300 Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA> In my own State, the Queensland Government is conscious of its responsibilities and it employs Aboriginals in all government departments. I mentioned a friend of mine who works in the railways. Indeed, I worked in the railways with many Aboriginal people who were guards, engine drivers or fettlers. Others were driving graders for local councils. They are making their way and they are employed. Our Queensland Government encourages communities to go into industries which are based on handicrafts, tourism and also primary industry. The Torres Strait community is encouraged to enter the prawning, pearling and fishing industries. As I indicated earlier, there are problems-we all recognise them. The problems will not be overcome tomorrow. It is one of those unfortunate facts of life in the situation in which we find ourselves, but I think that, while there is sympathy, compassion and a will within the community and within the Government, we can do much to alleviate these problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak in this debate in order to put a point of view about the Aboriginal people in Victoria. When I saw the speakers list, I found that two of my old comrades in arms, Senator Bonner and Senator Peter Baume, also were to join in the debate. We three were part of a Senate committee which produced a long and comprehensive report about the conditions of Aboriginal people in Australia. Seeing their names, I hoped that I would be preaching to the converted; but, of course, I had to realise that my two colleagues would not be making all of the decisions in regard to Aboriginal people in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must say at the outset that I resent the patronising tone which is used so often in this chamber when speaking about Aboriginal people. They are not people who desperately need love, understanding and kindness: They are real people who need real jobs and the ability to lead their own lives. I am not talking about the outback Aborigine-some vague mythical figure which seems to appear in debates here so often-but about Aboriginal people who have been born and have grown up in large cities and in large country towns, about people who have proved that they do not need great paternalistic help, and about people who do not have to be called 'these people'. They are Australian adults who, given a chance, have proved that they have the ability to learn, to work, to hold jobs, to drink alcohol in moderation or not at all and to keep their families together if the community and the Government would give them half a chance to get out on their own and to get started. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a very high level of unemployment in the Australian community. Everybody-even the Government-admits that we have an extraordinary high level of unemployment for a country with such a wealth of resources. We have a country at this time in which a university degree, six years of high school, years of experience in the work force, proven managerial ability or first class tradesmanship will not necessarily get a person a job. So, what hope have we for people who have never had a job, apart from a month or two of fruit picking, who have left school at the age of 13 years, who have no training and who have never had an income that really copes with the expenses of a family, who have lived in second rate accommodation in crowded conditions, who have been expected not to use their initiative but to do as officialdom tells them. </PARA>
<PARA> Many Aboriginal people in Australia today and many of the Aboriginal people in Victoria have lived in those conditions all their lives and, given some government assistance to get them out of that hole, could live as proper human beings. Many Aboriginal people in Victoria, when they found that the cities-the ordinary work places-would not provide jobs for them, tried hard to move out to the land and set up for themselves. They tried to set up fruit blocks, garages and farms in the country, but they failed not because they did not have the ability, not because they did not have the desire to succeed or the will to go on but because, in a pure commercial sense, they did not have the capital necessary to keep those sorts of enterprises going. The Government would not provide the capital necessary to get those enterprises off the ground and so many of those people sank back in despair. </PARA>
<PARA> If the employment scene is bad for white males and for Aboriginal males in Australia, for Aboriginal women and girls it is very much worse. Forty-three per cent of Australian women over the age of 15 years are employed, but they are in a very restricted area as far as wages are concerned. Seventeen per cent of full-time male employees earn less than $150 a week, but 38 per cent of full-time working females are in that low income bracket, and Aboriginal women are at the bottom of that pile. If it is bad for white women, it is even worse for Aboriginal women because they are regarded in the community, without a great deal of evidence, as being bad workers, alcoholics and people with no ability. They really are at the bottom of the pile. Youngsters growing up in our community today are hard hit by unemployment. The rate of unemployment amongst young girls in parts of this country, and certainly in parts of Victoria, is well over 20 per cent. Well qualified, bright youngsters may find it impossible to get jobs. If that can happen to white youngsters, how much harder is it for Aboriginal youngsters who are not regarded highly in areas where employment is available?</PARA>
<PARA> For young Aboriginal girls it is becoming almost impossible. They have, first of all, to overcome the prejudice in the community. They have to put up with the extraordinary level of unemployment within the community and then there are the youngsters who drifted out of school at the age of 13 years because they did not think that they had any future. The children live with despairing parents who may never have worked in their lives. They see the dole as the only income possible to them. They drift into alcoholism because there has to be something to kill the pain. Aboriginal people who have grown up in closely settled areas of Victoria-not remote areas-have worked for only two months of the year, that is, when fruit picking work is available. Aboriginal unemployment falls below about 80 per cent in some of those areas only when fruit picking work is available. </PARA>
<PARA> Figures given to me by the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs and by Aboriginal people in Victoria indicate that there are only 288 people in real training in that State. At present about 50 Aboriginal people are apprentices and about 200 Aboriginal people are coming out of high schools. About eight Aboriginal people are in Victorian universities and 30 of them are participating in the national Aboriginal training scheme. We have a minimum of 14 per cent unemployment amongst Aboriginals in Victoria. I use the word 'about' because nobody in Victoria is willing to give firm figures. As has been said in this debate by Senator Ryan, no statistics are kept on Aboriginal conditions in this country despite the fact that the Senate report to which I referred earlier recommended strongly in 1976 that statistics be kept so that we would have some idea of the extent of the problems existing amongst Aboriginal people. Five years later we are still using the word 'about'. We do not even now how many people in Australia claim Aboriginality. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that only 21 per cent of the full time workers amongst the white community in Australia have trade qualifications and that only 2 per cent of the working females have trade qualifications. I know that in Victoria at the moment there are 50 apprentices from the Aboriginal community. The figure for the Aboriginal people who will go on under those schemes to achieve some sort of standing as tradesmen-people who are really needed in their community-is very low. The employment figures for Victoria raise grave doubts because of the strong move over the last few years to push Aboriginal people out of the unemployment benefit area and into the invalid pension and special benefits area. On the surface this is not hard to do because misery, loneliness and despair have pushed many Aboriginals into alcoholism and they are easily seen as invalids. The feeling of personal unworthiness which pervades the Aboriginal community can push the Aboriginal people into a deep depression in which they can be seen as invalids, but in point of fact these people are not invalids; they are people who are looking for work. Work would cure so many of their problems. There are training programs, but the real problem lies in what happens when a training program is finished. We know that there is a problem in getting people into training programs in the first place. We know that there is a problem in finding places for them to live while they train. That is not easy in Victoria, so I daresay that in places such as the Northern Territory and Queensland it is much worse. Where do these people go when they are trained? I will quote from a letter written by Mrs Nessie Skuta, the National Aboriginal Conference member for Victoria, which deals with precisely this problem. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> When the NESA Policy was introduced it was my understanding that part of that Policy required all Government Departments to investigate and identify positions in which it would be desirable to employ Aboriginal People. I know that this Policy has been carried out in some Departments and positions have been identified. For instance I am told that some 13 counter Officer positions have been identified by the Department of Social Security in Victoria. However it appears to me that this Policy has not been followed through in the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that your Department has a number of Vocational Officer and Assistant Vocational Officer positions in which Aboriginals are employed, but each of these Officers has to cover a number of CES offices. These are many CES offices, especially in the country areas, which have a significant and continuous flow of Aboriginal clients. It is my belief there should be an Aboriginal person permanently situation in Offices which have Aboriginal clients. </PARA>
<PARA> For the past 12 months, Miss Glenda Mongta has been employed in the Bairnsdale CES as a NES trainee. I was amazed and distressed today when Miss Mongta told me that she was not going to be employed in the CES when her training period ends in a couple of weeks time. </PARA>
<PARA>This is just a little evidence of what so many of us are afraid of. So many of these training programs are just camouflage schemes to get the Aboriginal people off the unemployed list and make it look as though the Government is really doing something about employment. Giving training is one thing, but if there is no job at the end of it the training is useless and the despair that follows is very heartbreaking. There are other areas at which the Government could look. Aboriginal health in Victoria is not good. With a minimum of funds, the Aboriginal health organisation in Victoria does more for the health of the Aboriginal community there than the State itself does with four times the funds. With more understanding and funding in that area, not only would Aboriginal health be better but also more Aboriginal people would be trained and earning a living. Aboriginal people say over and over that as soon as jobs are advertised for Aboriginal institutions and organisations in Victoria there is an overwhelming number of applications for these jobs because Aboriginal people love to work with Aboriginals. For once they have some dignity, they are accepted as equals and they have a job to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal legal service in Victoria provided a pattern for the Australian legal service to follow. We would love to say that such a service is no longer necessary in Victoria, but it is very necessary. The housing of Aboriginal people in Victoria is abysmal because responsibility for that has been handed over to the State housing authority. If the money for Aboriginal housing were given to the Aboriginal people there it would be found that with understanding and tolerance the overcrowding, lack of maintenance and lack of houses would be overcome by the people who understand the problem and who have the ability to look after that area. It might even be found that there are people with imagination who can use that need for housing and maintenance to train young Aboriginal people as carpenters, builders and building workers of all types. Certainly, that sort of imagination is not being used by Federal and State authorities in that area. I will close with a quote I have used every year since 1976 when the Committee brought down its report. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we still must express our conviction that if we are ever able to make atonement to the remnant of this people, it will require no slight attention, and no ordinary sacrifices on our part to compensate the evil association which we have inflicted; but even hopelessness of making reparation for what is past would not in any way lessen our obligation to stop, as far as in us lies, the continuance of iniquity. </PARA>
<PARA>That came from a House of Commons select committee on Aborigines in 1837. It was quoted in our report in 1976; I have quoted it ever since. We have governments and people in government who insist on treating Aboriginals as idiot children, giving them no chance to control their own future, no control of funds, no chance to make their own mistakes and no chance for a future. I hope that my two colleagues who helped to write that report feel as I do: We have waited long enough and it is time for Aboriginal people to be treated as Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Knowing that a matter of public importance was to be dealt with today I was struck especially by that section of the prayer which precedes our deliberations in the Senate every day and which mentions our prime responsibility as parliamentarians to advance the welfare of the people of Australia; not solely the welfare of the white people of Australia. This, of course, begs the question: Does this Government really carry out its duty towards the public welfare of black Australians? Basically, this is the issue we are discussing. I have risen to speak in this debate because the welfare of Aborigines is a basic concern of the Australian Democrats. We believe that the Australian nation, of which the Government is or ought to be the leader of opinion and action, has failed to solve the Aboriginal problem and shows very little prospect of mending its ways. There seems to be no real light at the end of the tunnel. Judging from what the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) said earlier, there is only a feeling of complacency, that somehow enough is being done and the problems are being engaged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The subject of this matter of public importance is the need to develop employment opportunities for Aboriginals. It is possibly the most important and significant part of the overall problem because equality of opportunity in the work place tends to be the basic test of equality between communities; and that is especially the case in this country now with growing and stubborn unemployment. I commend the current television advertisements which are seeking to alleviate the problem of Aboriginal unemployment. They contain the slogan: 'The right to a job is as important as the right to live'. I have sat through various annual functions, such as National Aborigines Week, listening to some speakers defining problems and to others giving reasons for those problems not being solved. By now I am heartily sick and tired of the lack of progress we have made. I must say that the speech by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs here today struck me as very much another one of those speeches giving reasons why the real problems are not being solved. To be honest, I found his speech disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the nature of the unemployment problem? It is plain enough and bad enough. I do not think it has actually been stated squarely yet, but I shall do so. More than 160,000 Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders are in Australia. Of those some 37,000 are actually estimated to be in the work force. They are suffering the highest rate of unemployment of any identifiable group in the community. This has been placed by some people at 37 per cent and by some at 40 per cent. It is said to be perhaps as high as 50 per cent which is, of course, so many times higher than for the rest of the community as to be, I would have thought, a cause for alarm and not a cause for complacency in any way. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the future? According to a bulletin of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs issued late in 1979, based on present birth rates our Aboriginal population is likely to double over the next three decades. Then there will be about 320,000 people, many of them young people, who will face especially difficult problems of employment unless something is done in the meantime. There will be a much higher proportion of young Aboriginal people unemployed than the proportion in the total community. We have a responsibility, I suggest, to that group. Such major solutions to the problem of Aboriginal employment as we have at present seem to us to be crude palliatives. They are mostly a matter of money subsidies of one kind or another to Aborigines. Others are seen as protected patronage-certain types of jobs and training. This, I believe, in no way solves the real problems. Indeed, it creates a new and growing one of division within the society. Many Australians of non-Aboriginal origins, especially those who may be poor or disadvantaged themselves-as we all know, there are many such people-believe Aboriginal people are being given an easy option, a kind of hand-out, which places white people at a disadvantage. This is steadily creating divisiveness and resentment and can be in no way acceptable as a long-term policy. It would only lead, I suggest, to a steady growth of community backlash against Aboriginal people; and there is evidence of that already. </PARA>
<PARA> Our society has grave internal weaknesses over this matter of Aboriginal unemployment. Many influential people seem not to be disposed to admit that there is any kind of problem at all. Even worse is the tendency they have to strike back at those who try to identify the problem and to do something about it. I must number among those racists the truly influential areas of the Liberal Party of Western Australia. When our colleague the honourable Fred Chaney was the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs I several times had good occasion to congratulate him for the enlightened and thoughtful way in which he was trying to grapple with the overall Aboriginal problem. I recall reading, I think last year, a Press report in which Senator Chaney was reported as mildly chiding the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party at a convention for its almost complete lack of interest in his portfolio. We all know now his reward for his comparatively mild and certainly far from extremist or revolutionary policies in that portfolio. It has earned him the name of Red Fred in his own State and among his own Liberal colleagues; that has been said to me by them personally. He has recently had his political throat savaged by the same colleagues when they engineered his defeat in the preselection for the seat of Curtin in the recent Western Australian by-election. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise that matter because it is relevant to this debate. It is not good enough that these reactionary and racist elements in our society should be able to do those things, get away with them and apparently wield the influence they do. Does the Government really wish to restrain them or merely use them as an excuse for its current inactivity in these areas? I plead with all honourable senators, especially Government senators, to consider the plight of the present Minister, Senator Baume, after observing in Western Australia this object lesson in practical politics. If we are to get anything effective done in this area of Aboriginal employment Senator Baume will have to be supported solidly by his own party and, of course, by others. He certainly would have the support of the Australian Democrats for any decisive moves he makes to solve these kinds of problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the problem of unemployment cannot be isolated as a single problem; it is not really that at all. It is a symptom rather than a basic issue. It is a symptom of other things that are wrong. What are those other things? They include bad health conditions, especially child health; bad housing; and dismal failure in coping with the special needs of Aboriginal education which has tended to perpetuate the problems from generation to generation. I heard nothing in what the Minister said to suggest that he even understood this problem, much less that he was prepared to consider reasonable options open to us. Firstly, with regard to education, I would like to quote the words of a Mr Colin Bourke who was written about in the Melbourne Age last year. Mr Bourke is the head of the Aboriginal Research Centre at Monash University. The Age said of him last year:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bourke has bachelor degrees in commerce and education, an MBE and an Aboriginal ancestry in which he takes pride. He is involved in several black community groups, and in the National Aboriginal Employment Development Committee's Victorian campaign and the Victorian Aboriginal Education Consultative Group. </PARA>
<PARA>His comments on education are interesting. I quote them from the Age, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Schools are designed to be extensions of the home-a white man's home, 'Mr Bourke said. Black children were at an immediate disadvantage when they attended normal schools. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bourke said so many things in a classroom were unfamiliar to a black child that he felt isolated. Many had not sat behind a desk before, or had used a pen. Suddenly they were being taught by a white teacher, surrounded by white children and with another sort of discipline. </PARA>
<PARA> Many black children were further disadvantaged because their parents had not gone through school and were perhaps illiterate themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> To some children, English was a foreign language. In the 1976 census, more than 27,000 people said they spoke an Aboriginal language regularly. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bourke said Aboriginals should attend special schools which gave them a closer tie with their culture and taught them in a more familiar way. </PARA>
<PARA>It has been suggested to me that somehow some kinds of institutions, perhaps boarding schools, will be necessary for young Aboriginals so that they can actually break away from a home environment where lighting is poor, where they cannot find a place in which to study in quiet and where, if they have any potential or any chance of breaking through in life, their environment prevents them from doing so. We would have to look at, not as a matter of compulsion but as a facility that might be offered to outstanding Aboriginal children, a boarding school situation, financed by the state, in which they were able to realise their potential among their own peers, their own people, in skills in which they themselves excelled, but not necessarily the kinds of skills we would expect children from a European culture to be expert in. There again, research so far suggests that those things may be very different. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot see that there is any problem about getting such a program going. It is a matter of money and the will to do it. The fact is that the Government has not the will to do it and is listening to the racists, the reactionaries, in the society to the extent that it does not want to do it. I mentioned Senator Chaney's position not in any way as a jibe at him-far from it; I feel he has come through that matter completely to his own credit-but to point out that there are in the community those obstacles, those forces, who wish not to have done certain things which should be done. It seems that young Aboriginals are good at certain trades, including motor and marine engineering, metal working, boilermaking, the metal trades and heavy machinery driving. I have talked to people who have employed them in those fields. They are good at them and they like doing the work. I cannot see why special training areas should not be organised to do those things. Some are being done, as I will show a little later. They are also being closed down; that is another matter I want to put to the Minister in a few minutes. I feel that we can provide for young Aboriginal men and women-who are good at nursing, secretarial work and other things, I gather-facilities which would allow them to be employed; but those things are not being provided for them now. </PARA>
<PARA> The same kind of situation pertains with regard to health. I suggested at last year's National Aboriginal Week that instead of just talking about things we might as a project get rid of leprosy in our Aboriginal community. There is no excuse at all for this medieval disease still to exist in our midst. I have undertaken to prepare a position paper for the Minister on this subject. I merely say that the information available indicates that very small efforts, money and expertise would have cleared this problem out of Australia long ago but they were not made available. The problems of trachoma and infant mortality amongst Aboriginals are also indictments of this Government. They are a background to the employment problem because those children who do not die of malnutrition suffer brain damage. They reach the stage at which their difficulties with education and health make it impossible for them to compete effectively with the rest of the people in the work force. All of us in this place know that to be true. It is one of the things which we have elected to ignore. </PARA>
<PARA> Maybe we should have an Aboriginal task force trained in housing construction methods with wide autonomy like that given to Maori work gangs in New Zealand that are working extremely well. There should be autonomy in housing design. It has been suggested that the Aboriginal people might welcome hamlet-type housing with communal amenities and would prefer semi-rural surroundings. Let us create the means for Aboriginal people to solve these problems for themselves. I ask the Minister: Why was it that the Aboriginal housing company in Sydney was closed down last year and its funding cut off although its function was to provide training for young Aboriginal people in housing construction skills? Why were the 30 white tradesmen there who were training Aboriginal apprentices sacked? That is an example of the way the Government provides additional employment opportunities for Aboriginals-by cutting off funds for these valuable programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, time will have to pass to solve the problems such as health, housing and education that I have mentioned. Those problems span generations. Therefore, it seems that some effective short term measures are necessary. Like Senator Baume, I have availed myself of the opportunity to have an Aboriginal staff member. I commend the Government for this initiative in attaching Aboriginal people to the staff of senators and members of Parliament. The experiment has been a triumphant success in my office and I shall certainly repeat it. It may give us more than a hint of what we should be doing for the Aboriginals. We might have to consider some kind of preferment of Aborigines for jobs in certain areas and training Aborigines to fit them with skills to work in those areas. I understand from those who know this problem better than I do that many areas of government employment could be available but in fact are not being made available to Aboriginal people. An obvious one is training more Aboriginal teachers for the teaching of Aboriginal children. I would have thought that that would have been square one. But the training of Aboriginal teachers in terms of numbers is pitiful. I have been told that in New South Wales there are only four. Positions in those areas involving Aboriginals, such as education and housing, ought to go to Aborigines on a planned basis geared in with a training program aimed at developing the specific skills which are required. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to stress finally these other areas for which specific training might fit young Aboriginal people. They include the trade skills, in which many Aboriginals have proved apt-motor and marine mechanics, boilermaking, metal work, heavy machinery driving and the training of girls as secretaries and nurses. None of this training is being done. It would not be difficult to carry out such training. The Government has no cause for complacency. On the whole, the Australian Democrats must support the subject matter of this matter of public importance. The Government has little to congratulate itself on in respect of Aboriginal employment. There is much more it could and should do and the sooner it starts the better. </PARA>

<PARA> The failure of the Government to develop employment opportunities for Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA>It is all very well for Senator Ryan to propose such a discussion. In her early remarks she said that she wished to adopt a bipartisan attitude on this matter. If that were so and if that also was the position taken by Senator Mason on behalf of the Australian Democrats, perhaps the kind of wording of the discussion should have been 'to deplore the high unemployment rate amongst Aborigines' and 'to urge the Government to do more than it is already doing'. I would have thought that that wording may have led to a bipartisan attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> I have sat here and listened to all of the speakers from the other side of the chamber; including Senator Mason. I am still waiting for one honourable senator to come up with one constructive idea to let the Government know what it should be doing, apart from what it is already doing. I am very conscious of the high unemployment rate amongst the Aboriginal people. I suppose I have some qualifications in this respect because I have five Aboriginal sons, two Aboriginal foster daughters and 18 Aboriginal grandsons including five Aboriginal children of one of my foster daughters. In Aboriginal terms, that makes me a grandfather of 23 Aboriginal children. Therefore I have some qualifications, I believe, to speak on this very important matter being discussed in this chamber today. </PARA>
<PARA> I think one has to look at the achievements of Liberal-National Country Party governments over the years since the 1967 referendum. It was a Liberal-National Country Party government that set up the Office of Aboriginal Affairs after the 1967 referendum and created for the first time in Australian history a position of a Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. The honourable Bill Wentworth, one of the greatest fighters for Aborigines, I think, that this nation has seen in a long time, was appointed to that position. The Office of Aboriginal Affairs changed to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and there has been a string of Ministers in charge of the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. It was like musical chairs during the Labor Government's regime of about five years. Since that time we have had three Ministers who have done a remarkable job in the field of Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to some of the things that the Government has been doing and is doing about unemployment among Aboriginals. The Lord knows that I am conscious of this because I grew up in a situation which a lot of people today would not even have a clue about. I know what it is to be unemployed. I know how degrading, how dehumanising it is not to have a good job, not to have a decent income to be able to buy the things that one would like for himself and his family. I know what that is all about. Let me deal with what the Government has tried to do. I ask honourable senators to look at some of the achievements of the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA> For example I refer to the announcement in the House of Representatives on 26 May 1977 in respect of the National Employment Strategy for Aboriginals. That strategy has the following strands: The Community Development Employment Projects Scheme; the National Aboriginal Employment Development Committee; Aboriginal Employment and Training in the Public Sector; an expanded use of the National Employment and Training System for Aboriginals and a greater use of the Commonwealth Employment Service. They are some of the things that the Government is doing to try to create employment for Aboriginal people. The Community Development Employment Projects Scheme, which is conducted by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, provides an alternative to the unemployment benefit by making money available to Aboriginal communities to allow them to pay participants for work done on projects chosen by the community. This scheme is aimed at putting the responsibility back into the hands of the Aboriginals by making money available to Aboriginal communities for the creation of employment opportunities for their people in their own communities. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, the honourable Ian Viner, is responsible for the running of the National Aboriginal Employment Development Committee. The role of the Commitee is to stimulate private sector employment and the training of Aboriginal people. The Committee consists of representatives of the Aboriginal people, commerce, industry, trade union groups, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs. </PARA>

It is doing so slowly and sensibly. There is no sense in creating employment opportunities which will not be satisfactory for Aboriginal people and which will not give them a sense of responsibility and a sense of achievement. I know what it is like. I do not want to work on a job where I am just digging a hole, passing the dirt over from that hole to another one and back again. I want to do a job that is worthwhile, so do my children and so do my grandchildren. They want to contribute something to the Australian way of life. That is the kind of employment that we want. Under the present Government and the schemes that have been initiated by it, that is exactly what we have been endeavouring to do. Sure, we can criticise, say that more should be done and that more money should be spent. We can say that. But overall, the Government, I believe, is doing what it needs to be doing at this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The National Aboriginal Employment Development Committee has conducted campaigns promoting the employment image of Aborigines and to secure job placements for Aboriginals in areas of high Aboriginal unemployment. The most recent campaign was conducted in Perth during October 1980. Similar campaigns have been held in Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia. I was very proud to be involved in the launching of the campaign in Kempsey and Lismore last year on behalf of the Minister. I believe that campaign was a tremendous effort. At Kempsey and Lismore, literally hundreds of people came to find out what the scheme was all about and to see in what way they could be of assistance. It was a great success. </PARA>

We all have to participate in any program that the Government may put forward. It is pointless for the Government to put forward some kind of proposition that will not be accepted by the trade unions or by industry. Such a proposal would be to no avail. I have seen this happen time and again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can quote what has happened over the years. Before I left Palm Island in 1960 I was in charge of building and construction work there. I was a carpenter in my own right. I did not have a little piece of paper stating that I was a carpenter. But I trained 23 young Aborigines to build houses. We were building houses for the community. When we came to the mainland, we could not get a job in our trade because the trade unions said that we did not have this little piece of paper. Do not tell me what it's like to be an Aborigine. I know what it is like. When other honourable senators have had that experience they can tell me. The union would not accept me without that piece of paper. I could not become a carpenter on the mainland because I did not have a little piece of paper stating that I was a tradesman. What the Government is endeavouring to do is to ensure through the education system that young Aborigines taking on jobs are fully trained and that they will be accepted by all sections of the community. This is what the Government is endeavouring to do at the moment. </PARA>

The restructured National Aboriginal Conference provides advice to the Government and members of such bodies at the Aboriginal Development Commission and the Council for Aboriginal Development. It is negotiating with the Government for a Makarrata. It is hosting the Third General Assembly of the World Council of Indigenous Peoples with the help of a $90,000 grant from the Federal Government.

As a result of education grants introduced by the Gorton Government, there are now 5,000 Aboriginal children studying at secondary schools, compared with 3,690 in 1967, with a further 4,500 at technical and tertiary institutions. The action of the Government which is enabling Aboriginal children to get a better education will result in Aboriginal people being able to obtain responsible, decent employment. Tertiary education and secondary education are very important. As a result of such education, Aboriginals will be able to fit into the community where they want to and not where they are told to. They will be able to compete on the open market with other Australians. That should be the aim of all people. We do not want handouts; we want our standards to be uplifted. We want to be able to do things for ourselves. We want to be given the responsibility for doing these things. That is what the Fraser Government is achieving in Aboriginal affairs at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>

We are employing only those non-Aborigines who have the expertise that, unfortunately, we do not have at this time in certain skilled occupations.

It is necessary that we finish this matter by the end of May in order that a detailed design of the new Parliament House can be presented to this Parliament in August, when the new session starts, to become what is known as the next declared stage. The Committee, the Parliament House Construction Authority and the architect are working to a tight schedule to enable completion of the building in time for the bicentenary in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The demands on the Committee in the next two or three months while the plan is finalised will be such that it cannot reasonably maintain the schedule without holding some meetings during sittings of the Parliament. I think I should emphasise that the Committee will also be meeting during the winter recess of this Parliament to make sure that the requirements of the program will be met and that the declared stage will be presented to the Parliament in the spring sittings. The number of meetings envisaged at this stage is one a week, mainly of the Sub-committee. Sub-committee meetings will involve a maximum of three senators. I appeal to the Senate to give the Sub-committee leave to enable it effectively to carry out its responsibilities and obligations to this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate for a few moments to support the motion before the Senate. We all hope that the project will follow the timetable for completion in 1988. Some targets have already been reached, but many of the discussions that have to take place, particularly in the Sub-committee of the Joint Committee on the New Parliament House, are difficult to arrange, as has already been pointed out. I think that in asking for the permission of the Senate to meet during sitting hours and to depart from the normal Standing Orders concerning that practice we are asking for a one-off concession. It is my view that there is no need for the business of the Senate to be disrupted by the meetings of this Sub-committee. The members are conscientious and capable people who are giving all they have towards achieving the very great end which they have in view of providing the Parliament and the nation with a new and permanent Parliament House. I feel that the reasons behind the seeking of permission for the suspension of the normal Standing Orders to allow the Sub-committee to sit are very strong and deserve the support of all honourable senators.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will have the effect of removing from the Public Service Arbitrator the jurisdiction to make determinations in relations to matters covered by the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act 1979, hereafter referred to as the Act. This Bill arises in connection with the Government's decision announced on 5 February, the day before the Act was proclaimed to come into operation, that the Government would move to disapprove under section 22 of the Public Service Arbitation Act 1920, Determination No. 503 of 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> The Determination has been disapproved by the House of Representatives. The effect of this action is that the Determination has ceased to operate and it has no practical effect prior to the Government's announcement of its intention to move for disapproval. The Government believes that it is essential in relation to matters as fundamental as the efficient and economical use of staff in the Public Service that the Parliament should lay down and be seen to lay down the rules and regulations appertaining thereto and not some other body. </PARA>
<PARA> It was and is the Government's intention that Determination No. 509 of 1977 should operate in conjunction with the Act. Together they would provide a code of practice and benefits which would have to be followed by the Board and departments in the handling of redundancy situations. The Bill seeks to amend section 24 of the Act and, as I have already pointed out, it will in effect remove the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to make a legal determination for or in relation to the matters comprehended by the Act. Its true effect will be that any future change which might be thought necessary to the code of practice and benefits applicable to the situations referred to will have to be brought about by the government of the day by legislation and thus it will, as it should, make the Parliament the ultimate arbiter on matters relating to redeployment, retirement, termination and other aspects covered by the Act and Determination No. 509 of 1977. </PARA>
<PARA> I must emphasise that the Government makes a real distinction between matters relating to the engagement and termination of the service of staff which are the prerogative of management and determinations in relation to traditional areas such as wages and salaries, annual leave and hours of duty which are properly matters for arbitration. Let me also remind honourable senators of the history of this matter. In 1976 the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill was introduced on the basis that it would not proceed further until there had been an adequate opportunity for debate and for consultation between the Public Service Board and unions. In the event, the Bill lapsed on the prorogation of Parliament in early 1977. When the Bill was introduced again in 1979 changes had been made arising from the intervening discussions with peak union councils. The main changes were the specification of reasons for which staff could be identified for redeployment and retirement and the inclusion of more detail of the appeal arrangements for the review of decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The revised legislation gave comprehensive and elaborate protection to staff and was the result of extensive consultation with Public Service unions. Despite this, during 1979 some unions introduced bans and limitations. Some staff were stood down. In the result the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association, the Australian Public Service Association (Fourth Division Officers), and the Federated Clerks Union lodged applications with the Public Service Arbitrator, which were later referred to a Full Bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. These applications sought a determination relating to procedures for consultation with staff organisations in redundancy situations and the specification of minimum time periods of up to 29 months to be observed before staff could be redeployed to a lower paid job or terminated, plus a range of related claims. In effect, part of the purpose of the application was to change the provisions and frustrate the intent of legislation which had been passed by the Parliament and which at that time had not been put into operation. The Board opposed the application, arguing that the claims made were inconsistent with the Act and that the provisions of the Act together with the provisions of Public Service Arbitrator's Determination No. 509 of 1977 provided sound, workable, and fair arrangements for the handling of surplus staff, invalidity retirements and other redeployment and termination in Commonwealth employment and that the applications should be rejected. The Government supported the Board's attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> The Full Bench decided in December 1979 that a determination should be made and that it should cover a range of matters. The Commission did not issue a determination but directed the parties to discuss and draw up a draft determination to give effect to the Commission's decision. Agreement could not be reached between the Board and the relevant unions and in the result two documents were submitted to the Commission; one prepared by the Board, the other by the unions. It was made clear to the Arbitrator and the Commission that nothing in the draft determination prepared by the Board or the Board's comments should be taken to indicate agreement by the Board to the terms of a determination nor should be seen as committing the Board in any respect. So much for the claim which has been made by the unions that the Board got what it wanted. </PARA>
<PARA> On 23 December 1980 the Commission made a determination which came into operation on the date of proclamation of the Act-6 February 1981. Shortly before the Act came into operation the Board issued 106 staff with six-month or 12-month notices of redundancy, not retrenchments, in accordance with the provisions of Determination No. 509 of 1977. These notices were not issued under the provisions of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act. Not unexpectedly some leaders of the Public Service unions chose to make deliberately confusing and misleading comments about these notices, implying that they were retrenchment notices issued in secrecy and had been issued under the Act. They set about putting fear into the minds of their members that something new and horrific was happening to them. They chose to ignore the fact that 89 of the notices were issued to staff who had declined to move to Canberra with their jobs under the normal Canberra transfer arrangements and that these staff had known for at least 12 months of the Government's decision to transfer their jobs to Canberra. They chose to ignore the fact that long established and well understood practices meant that the notices would issue at about the time they did. </PARA>
<PARA> These same leaders also chose to ignore the fact that it was not the first time staff declining transfer to Canberra had been issued with such notices. They were silent about the fact that there has been a Canberra transfer program since time immemorial and there was nothing new about these transfers. They were also silent about the fact that over the years they have been fully involved in developing procedures to be followed in the transfer program, including the timing of the issue of notices to staff who decline to transfer with their jobs. The unions and the officers themselves know the rights of persons involved in transfer programs and the detriments if they decline to transfer. The Senate will accept, I am sure, that there must be changes in administration from time to time that involve relocation of staff to the place where the work is required to be performed. This is ordinary responsible administration. There is nothing untoward, unreasonable or arbitrary about the processes involved in reallocating staff resources in this way. It is therefore a serious act of irresponsibility on the part of the unions to confuse and mislead their members in this respect and foment fear in their minds. </PARA>
<PARA> The other 17 staff who received notices of redundancy are located in the Australian Capital Territory and various States and their jobs were not required because of the winding down of a program, for example, at Woomera, revised administrative arrangements introduced by the Government or normal organisational changes to meet the current needs. Most of the staff involved had been surplus for some time. In this case the unions were advised of the Board's intention to issue those notices to the 17 staff members and they raised no objection. Now some of the same unions obscure the issues and the facts and incite members to industrial action. Transfers to Canberra, and administrative changes have occurred for very many years and will continue to do so. Organisations simply cannot operate without adjusting to change. But the Public Service Board and departments have handled such situations in a careful and responsible way and quite properly have made every endeavour to find other jobs for staff when their existing jobs are no longer available. Indeed, the Board and departments have been successful in redeploying over 1,500 staff since 1976, in addition to larger numbers of staff involved in the Canberra transfer program. The termination of employment is clearly the last resort. </PARA>
<PARA> When the legislation was introduced in 1979, the Government ensured that Determination No. 509 of 1977 would continue to operate. That Determination provides a generous code of conditions and some procedures for the handling of surplus staff situations. The Determination requires the Public Service Board to advise the relevant staff association immediately it appears that a surplus staff situation has occurred or is likely to occur, and to provide all relevant details and arrange discussions with union representatives. In addition that Determination also provides for:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) six months formal notice for a permanent officer that he is excess to the requirements of the Service and 12 months if over 45 years of age or with 20 or more years service;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a temporary employee shall be entitled to one months formal notice that he is excess to the requirements of the Service;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a permanent officer shall receive an additional one month's formal notice that he is to be transferred to a lower salary level or terminated;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) a permanent officer shall be entitled to be retained as an officer on full pay for the notice periods;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) paid leave and expenses, where not met by prospective employer, to seek employment;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) use of accumulated sick leave in certain specified circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA> (g) reasonable expenses of moving household associated with transfer or termination;</PARA>
<PARA> (h) every endeavour to redeploy to continue during notice periods; and</PARA>
<PARA> (i) subject to minimum periods of service and age a temporary employee who is transferred to a lower salary level or terminated shall receive income maintenance for six to 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> The mere recitation of the benefits available under Determination No. 509 of 1977 to officers and employees who become excess to the requirements of the Service serves to point up the fairness, even generosity, of the conditions which apply to staff under that Determination. Against this background, there seemed at the time of introduction of the legislation in 1979 to have emerged a general acceptance of the appropriateness of the proposed revised arrangements for redeployment and retirement. Sub-section 24 (3) was included in the Bill to facilitate adjustment of existing arbitral determinations in the light of the revised framework introduced by the Act. The provision also allowed retention of existing arbitral determinations dealing with matters related to redeployment and retirement of government employees. The Act, moreover, provides for appeal procedures for the protection of employees from arbitrary or capricious action. </PARA>
<PARA> What happened as a result of discussions with staff organisations following the introduction of the Bill initially in 1976 and the subsequent revision of the legislation was that instead of general acceptance of the fair and reasonable revised arrangements the ACOA, in particular, sought determinations under the Public Service Arbitration Act which would undermine the practices and procedures provided for under the Act so as to take out of the hands of management its rightful prerogative for the efficient and economical management of the Public Service as provided for under the Public Service Act. The Government has therefore decided, in order to ensure the integrity of the operation of the Act, to preclude future determinations from detracting from what are, reasonably and properly, management prerogatives. This amendment will leave unaffected the powers of the Public Service Arbitrator to make determinations in traditional areas such as wages and salaries, annual leave and hours of duty. The introduction of this Bill must be seen against a long history of irresponsible and persistent union opposition to the redeployment and compulsory retirement provisions of the Act and a determination by some unions to change the intent of the legislation and frustrate its operation. The unions, in effect, have attempted to challenge through the Commission the right of the Parliament to determine the legislative provisions that will apply to matters as fundamental as the efficient and economical use of staff of the Australian Public Service. The fact is that the Parliament must be the arbiter in such matters. This point is given added force by the fact that the Public Service Arbitration Act has had the disapproval power in it since its inception in 1920. This power has been used by the Senate as recently as 1973.</PARA>
<PARA> An important responsibility of the Parliament and the Government is to ensure that the Public Service Board and departments have the appropriate powers to ensure that the services of staff are used efficiently and effectively. This is the very least that the Parliament would require and that the taxpayer would expect. The Government is convinced that matters such as the hiring, redeployment and termination of employment of Commonwealth employees should be the prerogative of the Board and departments operating within the framework set by the Parliament itself. There can be no doubt that Parliament through its legislation has cared well for its employees and protected the rights of individual staff members. Public servants enjoy many advantages over employees in the private industry. They have permanency of employment. Their advancement is by merit. Their rights of redress against arbitrary actions by management are protected by very elaborate and comprehensive appeals provisions in both the Public Service Act and the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act, which are second to none. On top of that they have a generous superannuation scheme and are well paid. Most employees would be satisfied with this but some Public Service unions want more, almost without limit. They seem to say that public servants should never be reduced in level, even if work at the employee's level is not available or the employee is inefficient; and that a public servant's employment should never be terminated, even if there is no work available for him or her to perform. Such propositions would be quite unacceptable to the community. They are unacceptable to the Government. It is our firm view that public servants have obligations and responsibilities which follow on from the generous conditions and protections which the Parliament has provided. Not least, public servants have a duty to provide an uninterrupted high standard of service to the people of Australia. Such responsibilities seem to have been put in the background by those union leaders who have incited public servants to industrial action over the Act, legislation which plainly aims to ensure that the services of public servants are used efficiently, effectively and economically. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will, as I have pointed out, leave in operation Determination No. 509 of 1977. It will also preserve the provisions of other determinations, in particular clauses specifying notice periods which have already been made by arbitral authorities. It will also permit the parties to these determinations to be varied. The Government considers that the provisions of Determination No. 509 of 1977 taken together with the provisions of the legislation are fair, just, adequate and appropriate to protect individuals and to see that they are fairly treated in relation to redeployment and retirement. Certainly, many outside the Public Service would like to have such conditions. The Government as always is prepared to consider constructive comments about the operation of the Act. The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister (Mr Viner) has already given a commitment to the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations that the Government is prepared to review the provisions of the Act if, after some experience with its operation, it can be demonstrated that its procedures operate unfairly. </PARA>
<PARA> The staff of the Australian Public Service and Commonwealth authorities are, generally speaking, dedicated and hard-working. They come in for a good deal of criticism. Much of the criticism is exaggerated and unjustified and does not pay proper respect to the dedication and service given to their countrymen. It is a great pity that the actions of a minority of public servants and of some of the present leaders of the ACOA have tarnished the proud history of a non-political public service in Australia. Therefore, I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Shipping Registration Bill 1981 may appear to be a rather innocuous piece of legislation but, as I will seek to show to the Senate, it is a very important piece of legislation. In fact, the three Bills before the Senate-the Shipping Registration Bill 1981, the Flags Amendment Bill 1981 and the Navigation Amendment Bill 1981-have been a long time coming before the national Parliament. The purpose of the Bills is to abolish the requirements for British legislation to register Australian owned vessels, to establish the criteria for Australian registration, to set up a single Australian register and to establish the Australian Red Ensign as the colours of the Australian merchant fleet and the Australian national flag or the Australian Red Ensign as permissible colours for other Australian vessels. Because this is an important step towards national independence, the Opposition does not oppose the Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) mentioned in his second reading speech, the principal Bill of the package, the Shipping Registration Bill 1981, seeks to repeal Part I of the United Kingdom Merchant Shipping Act 1894 insofar as it applies to Australian law. I remind the Senate that that piece of legislation has had application to our shipping industry for the last 87 years. A navigation Act was passed in 1912 which took us a little bit along the way towards an independent position, but that was 69 years ago. It was not until 1931, just 50 years ago, that we took another step to establish a somewhat independent position. So we have been a long time travelling the road to bring about the situation that this legislation seeks to bring about, that is, the establishment of our own presence in our own maritime industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill seeks to abolish the present Australian registration system which registers Australian owned ships as British ships, hence enabling Australian nationality to be granted to Australian owned ships. To that extent we are coming of age. In fact, we have cut the umbilical cord that has been with us for more than 100 years. The legislation establishes us in an independent position, a position which I hope will ultimately put us in a situation in which we will have our own maritime fleet, maritime industry and independent shipping industry. The agreement in 1931 to which I have referred was rescinded by all member countries, thus rescinding their participation as part of the British Commonwealth of Nations. A mutual agreement was signed in 1978 which took us slightly closer to the position being taken in this piece of legislation. Yet Australia is the only independent member of the Commonwealth, apart from Britain, that has continued to operate under the Merchant Shipping Act system. Therefore, this legislation is rather important and will completely cut our dependence on the British shipping legislation. To that degree we will have taken a very important step when we pass this legislation this evening. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal Bill seeks to establish criteria for both compulsory and voluntary registration of Australian ships. Compulsory registration will be required for commercial vessels which are more than 50 per cent Australian owned and which are more than 12 metres in length. Voluntary registration is permitted to government vessels, fishing vessels, pleasure craft, Australian-owned vessels of less than 12 metres in length, vessels less than 12 metres in length solely operated by Australian nationals or residents and ships on demise charter to Australian based operators. One has only to refer to those matters to realise what a subordinate position this country has been in with regard to our shipping industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation seeks to establish a single Australian register, with a central office and branches as required. This will overcome the present peculiarity of having 20 ports of registry with no complete national register in one place listing all registered vessels. As a consequence of this legislation, there will be no ports of registery as such. However, because of the importance of the port of registry concept for legal and other purposes, as I think the Senate will appreciate, the Bill provides for the adoption of a concept of a home port for each ship. So the practice of marking the port on a ship's stern will thus be maintained. It is a national disgrace that the Australian Parliament and the nation as a whole has permitted the present state of affairs to continue for so many years, and to that extent the Government is to be commended for the steps taken in this legislation to establish Australian shipping in its own right, independent of any former relationships. </PARA>
<PARA> The two subsidiary Bills, the Flags Amendment Bill 1981 and the Navigation Amendment Bill 1981, are consequential on the principal Bill. Together they make provision for the Australian Red Ensign to be the colours of our merchant fleet. I do not canvass the view that that is a very acceptable position. For all other Australian vessels the Australian national flag or the Australian Red Ensign will be the national colours. Of course, this will not remove our dependence upon foreign vessels. The Opposition concedes the importance of the step, but we have a long way to go before a fully independent position is taken. For example, Australian vessels have carried between 0.1 per cent and 3.1 per cent of our exports and between 0.3 per cent and 2 per cent of our imports. In terms of general cargoes, the respective figures are 3.3 per cent and 7.3 per cent of exports and 6.1 per cent to 12 per cent of imports. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely it must be conceded that these are abysmally low figures for such an important country as Australia, a country engaged in world trade of tremendous and growing magnitude. As I have said, those figures are very low. Most of the remaining cargo is transported in ships owned by British container shipping companies the Conference system or in bulk ships and tankers belonging to the big multinational companies. Most bulk exports from Australia to Japan, for example, are transported in Japanese bulk carriers. Japanese flag vessels have carried between 39 per cent and 45 per cent of bulk cargoes which have left these shores since 1972-73. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator GIETZELT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course. Since bulk exports account for some 80 per cent in volume of all Australian overseas trade, the power of Japanese shipowners can be readily gauged and we can understand the desire of the maritime industry in this country to improve Australia's position. Because of the lack of an adequate Australian overseas fleet, and consequently lack of control over conditions for shipping Australian exports and imports, Australia is placed in a very weak commercial and strategic position, as a result of which all Australians suffer. I concede, of course, that places such as Tasmania would suffer particularly in that respect. Each year we lose hundreds of millions of dollars in freight and insurance payments to overseas shipowners. This has had a tremendous effect over the years in keeping the Australian shipbuilding and ship repair industries in a subordinate position, a position in which they are starved of capital and unable to develop for want of markets and work. I hope that the Government, having taken this important step, will move quickly to the next stage and establish a more durable shipbuilding industry in this country. The industries having been starved of capital and markets, the resultant loss of jobs, both direct and indirectly, has been substantial. In recent years various regions of our country have been affected by this decline in our shipbuilding industry. Jobs for seamen and for those who could build or repair vessels have been lost abroad, some might say for all time because of the economies of scale that have been developed in other parts of the world. We hope that, given government encouragement and assistance, these jobs can be won back for us. If this massive freight expenditure were retained in Australia, the multiplier effects on Australian industry, especially shipbuilding and ship repairs, would be substantial. It has to be conceded, surely, that these are the sorts of labour-intensive industries we need if our economy is to be strengthened by the current rearrangement of exports and imports, and by the manufacturing and trade changes that currently are affecting the prosperity of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator GIETZELT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is true. Additionally, the conditions and cost of shipping Australian overseas trade rest in the hands of overseas corporations, and this affects domestic freight pricing. Australia being an island continent, most of our markets are a great distance from where our goods are produced. The cost of transport is of great significance in determining whether our goods will be competitive in the international market, yet we have very little say in the prices charged for shipping these goods abroad. The Conference system is largely outside our control and has not operated in the interests of Australia. This means that pressure is exerted by producers and manufacturers, wherever and whenever they can do so, on the cost of Australia's domestic freight system. Often this means the Government providing what I term commercial welfare to local exporters in the form of freight subsidies via government instrumentalities, and cost recovery on the cost of road freighting and the construction of export roads. This is something that has to be changed, and I am sure that it will be changed as more and more of our indigenous industries demand action by the national government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia is a major trading nation which each year has about 6,000 vessels calling on its shores and carrying upwards of 200 million tonnes of cargo. Yet up until now Australia has not been regarded as a maritime nation. Only a meagre amount of our overseas trade is carried in our ships. With the development of resources in Australia, how important it is for us to look at this aspect in terms of an industry being given a shot in the arm by a national government. I have already mentioned the cost to the Australian community, Australian industry, and Australian primary producers of failure to do this, but there are a number of reasons for this detrimental imbalance. Some people seek to explain it by economics, by claiming that our costs are too high, our wages are too high, and so on. Rather, I think it is better explained by Australia's colonial heritage, against which we are still struggling, and I hope the Bills now before us will help to remedy that past situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has never been a major maritime nation, and one finds it difficult to understand why in the past we have not taken steps to establish ourselves in a more independent position. It is probably due to the historical ties to Britain, which is a strong maritime nation. Time and again I hear Senator Carrick ask why changes did not take place during the years from 1972 to 1975. If we consider the post-war years we appreciate that the conservatives have been in office for very much longer than a Labor government has been in office. We were in a somewhat beseiged, beleagured state during the years of the Whitlam Government, and one could not have expected it to take all the steps necessary to put Australia in the position which this legislation seeks to establish. We have been in a position where we were part of a colonial heritage, and our ship registration system was a captive to the British system. We are now taking the step to cut that tie. Our lack of a large locally-owned fleet led to a short term expediency of seeking the best freight conditions from overseas ship owners, and I recall many debates in this Parliament which sought to improve our indigenous position. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy of conservative governments of the past has been one of neglect and one which Labor rejects as being unsatisfactory for the past or for the present. We support the extension of the Australian fleet both internationally and on the Australian coast. The later Labor Government supported the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development on the 40-40-20 principle. This is often quoted as representing a fair international distribution of freight carriage. In essence, the conference recommended that Australia and other trading nations should carry 40 per cent of their trade. It recommended that 40 per cent should be carried by the importing nation, 40 per cent by the exporting nation and the remaining 20 per cent by cross-traders. I believe that a similar policy is desirable in respect of repairs to overseas vessels. This would have a tremendous effect upon our ship repairing industry. At the moment we perform about only one or 2 per cent of those repairs. If the principle in respect of the carrying of our exports and imports was carried into effect in our ship repairing industry there would be a very important and regenerative effect upon our ship building industry. Consequently, we expect the Government to be more energetic as a result of the carriage of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> An understanding has developed within the maritime industry between the owners of our shipping industry and the unions. I appreciate the time factor involved but I think it is worth while to note and approve of the balanced approach that has been taken by the maritime industry-by both employer and employee organisations-to reach a point where there is common ground and a common desire to establish a better understanding and acceptance of the responsibilities and the problems on each side of this industry. We regard it as a welcome development for Australia. I hope that this approach is supported by both sides of the chamber and that the maritime industries will move forward as one in the interests of capital investment, of labour and of our indigenous industries. If that is able to be achieved, this piece of legislation is a very vital and important one. We must see it only as step further back from the 1894, 1912, 1931, 1978 and 1979 legislation. The legislation in 1981 puts us in a position where we will take the essential steps to establish this country as capable of sustaining and maintaining a viable maritime industry. We support the passage of the legislation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Honourable senators will recall that negotiations on the staging of B52 aircraft through Australia were temporarily suspended to allow the new Administration of President Reagan time to examine and consider the matter. I am pleased to inform the Senate that in the course of his recent talks in Washington with Secretary of State, Alexander Haig, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street), took this matter further and was able to bring it to a successful conclusion. Agreement has now been reached between our two governments on the terms and conditions which will govern United States Air Force B52 staging flights through Darwin. I am tabling the texts of the notes exchanged between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the United States Embassy on 11 March 1981, which constitute this agreement. As honourable senators will note, the agreement provides that: The B52 flights shall be for sea surveillance in the Indian Ocean area and for navigation training; the agreement of the Australian Government would need to be obtained before the facilities at the Royal Australian Air Force Base, Darwin, could be used in support of any other category of operations; the B52 aircraft on surveillance flights will be supported by KC135 tanker aircraft for aerial refuelling and the operations shall consist of periodic deployments of up to three B52 and six KC135 aircraft; about 100 United States Air Force personnel and associated equipment will support the staging operations and some of these may be stationed at RAAF Base, Darwin; there will be no change in the status of RAAF Base, Darwin, as an Australian facility under Australian control. As the terms of the agreement make abundantly clear, nothing in the arrangements governing these flights could be regarded as in any way infringing Australian sovereignty; and the United States will provide the Australian Government with full and timely information about strategic and operational developments relevant to the B52 staging operations through Darwin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate will be aware that United States Air Force B52 aircraft are currently conducting low-level navigation training over Australia. As the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) stated on 3 February 1980, these flights originate at Guam, the aircraft carry out navigational training over Queensland and then return to their base at Guam. The operations will be an extension of these current operations. After completing the low-level training exercises, the aircraft will land at Darwin and refuel. After appropriate crew rest the aircraft will undertake sea surveillance and navigation training operations over the Indian Ocean-an area of great security interest to both Australia and the United States. The flights will then return via Darwin to Guam. As is the case with the current navigational missions, the flights landing at Darwin will be unarmed and will carry no bombs. </PARA>
<PARA> As there has been much speculation in the media and elsewhere about this matter, I should like to emphasise that it has been agreed between the Foreign Minister and the Secretary of State that the aircraft staging through Darwin under the arrangements now agreed for surveillance flights and navigation training will be unarmed and will carry no bombs. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have also told the Senate, the exchange of notes provides that the Australian Government's agreement would need to be obtained before the Royal Australian Air Force facilities could be used in support of any other category of operations by the United States. In that regard, so that there can be no grounds for question or doubt, let me state the basis on which the agreement of the Australian government would be given to such other operations: Australia would need to know, firstly, what the strategic and tactical objectives are-Australia would need to be in agreement with these-and, secondly, what weapons are being carried and in particular whether nuclear weapons are being carried. The Australian Government has a firm policy that aircraft carrying nuclear weapons will not be allowed to fly over or stage through Australia without its prior knowledge and agreement. Nothing less than this is consistent with the maintenance of our national sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is particularly pleased that it has been possible to reach finality on this question so soon in the term of the new Administration. Australia shares the United States determination to take all steps within its power to deter further Soviet expansionism. We stand ready to lend our ANZUS partner what assistance we can in pursuit of our common aims. The provision of staging facilities at Darwin for these United States aircraft will facilitate the surveillance and training operations they are carrying out in an area of prime security concern to Australia. It also affords a further example of the close practical co-operation which has been developed over many years between our two nations. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator McLaren would just listen for a minute, Mr Street, on the honourable senator's behalf as well as on my behalf, said that he expected the Opposition would be happy with this. He did not speak for Senator McLaren and he did not speak for me. That is the point that I seek to make. I hope, if I am given the opportunity, to make it a little more carefully so that it might be fully understood. A number of items in this statement do not bring the warm inner glow to the hearts of members of the Opposition which they apparently bring to the hearts of Government members. I wish to refer to some of those matters in slightly more detail What is extraordinary about the matter is that the Parliament, not having had any opportunity to consider the matter, is presented with a fait accompli in terms of what is essentially a treaty between Australia and the United States. I would have thought that we might have had the benefit of at least a statement of intention regarding that matter in the Parliament before we were presented with such a fait accompli. I shall turn in a minute to some of the details of the fait accompli. I think the way in which they have been set out in the proposed agreement is quite extraordinarily sloppy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall in reading the first paragraph of the statement that the first indication of B52 bombers landing in Darwin was given in the gung-ho pre-election atmosphere in Australia. It was at that time that the idea was first floated, one suspects from Australia rather than from the United States. There was some brief discussion about that in the context of the recent election. Be that as it may, the matter is now consummated, as it were, in terms of this document. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer the Senate to one or two points in the document because I argue here that the statement, which has been made by the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) is in a sense inconsistent with the agreement which we are asked to accept. I will refer to the details of that agreement in this way. Firstly it is stated at the foot of page 1 of the prepared statement:</PARA>
<PARA>the B52 flights shall be for sea surveillance in the Indian Ocean area and for navigation training. </PARA>
<PARA>The agreement of the Australian Government would need to be obtained before the facilities were used for other purposes. It is quite clear that it is for surveillance functions and navigation training, which I think is a new element to which I do not attach any particular importance. It is a new element as it arises in the statement. We are told that nothing in the agreement could be regarded as in any way infringing Australian sovereignty. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The United States will provide the Australian Government with full and timely information about strategic and operational developments relevant to the B52 staging operations through Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA>There are, of course, two matters involved-first, the question of the B52s flying over Australia and, secondly, the question of staging operations. But there is an undertaking in the statement that Australia will be provided with 'full and timely information about strategic and operational developments'-whatever that expression might mean in this context. The important point in the statement appears at the foot of page 2 of the prepared statement where Senator Carrick said:</PARA>
<PARA> As there has been much speculation in the media and elsewhere about this matter, I should like to emphasise that it has been agreed between the Foreign Minister and the Secretary of State that the aircraft staging through Darwin under the arrangements now agreed for surveillance flights and navigation training will be unarmed and carry no bombs. </PARA>
<PARA> Page 3 of the prepared statement reveals that there is a firm policy against carrying nuclear weapons in aircraft which fly over Australia. I refer to sub-paragraph (i) of the purported agreement which states:</PARA>
<PARA>The B-52 staging operations shall be for sea surveillance in the Indian Ocean area and for navigation training purposes. The agreement of the Government of Australia shall be obtained before the facilities are used in support of any other category of operations. </PARA>
<PARA> Sub-paragraph (VII) of the agreement-this is something which I have difficulty in understanding in view of the provisions of sub-paragraph (I)-states:</PARA>
<PARA>Arrangements shall be made for consultations to ensure that the Government of Australia has full and timely information about strategic and operational developments relevant to B-52 staging operations through Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Whatever the expression 'arrangements shall be made' means-there can be a lot of dispute about that-it is quite clear that arrangements are to be made for consultation about other uses of the Darwin facilities and about other uses in circumstances of strategic and operational developments. One wonders why sub-paragraph (VII) of the purported agreement with the United States is necessary if sub-paragraph (I) of the agreement means what it says. It states what the purposes of the flights will be and goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The agreement of the Government of Australia shall be obtained before the facilities are used in support of any other category of operations. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to be quite clear. The agreement of the Government of Australia will be obtained before facilities are used for other purposes. Yet sub-paragraph (VII) states:</PARA>
<PARA> Arrangements shall be made for consultations to ensure that the Government of Australia has full and timely information about-</PARA>
<PARA>Other purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Sub-paragraph (I) states that the agreement of the Australian Government will be obtained before there is any change in the arrangement, yet sub-paragraph (VII) makes the point that information shall be given to Australia about other uses of the base and other uses of the B52s through Darwin as a staging point. That seems to me to be an extraordinary sloppy inconsistency which, I think, justifiably causes worry in the minds of people who are concerned about the implications of the actions of a country which in terms of foreign policy was prepared to talk only a year ago about the Indian Ocean as a potential zone of peace. The Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) only yesterday, I think, answered a question to the effect that he had no information about the deployment of naval vessels in the Indian Ocean. That is the same Minister for Defence, who for years has been able to give most detailed and specific information about the deployment of defence forces in the Indian Ocean region. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is not happy with the way that this statement is couched and more particularly with the way the purported agreement is couched. It arouses great suspicion that it will be depending upon an exercise of sloppy goodwill between gung-ho politicians here and in the United States, rather than on any detailed specifications about what the arrangement is, to which the people of Darwin and Australia are entitled. By interjection somebody asked how we would know whether the United States would honour the terms of the agreement insofar as it deals with the carrying of nuclear weapons. I think that is a very good question and people are entitled to ask it. If one looks at the history of our defence arrangements with the United States in recent years, it is quite clear that members of the government of Australia, of whatever political persuasion, are being treated as banana republic politicians who have been told about defence arrangements what it is necessary to tell them and nothing else. For example, in October 1973, at the time of a war in the Middle East, when the North West Cape base was placed on full alert, the government of the day was not informed. The subsequent government was not officially informed. The story leaked out over a period that that had in fact happened. It is quite clear from the arrangements between Australia and the United States in relation to that base that the Government of the day would be informed. </PARA>
<PARA> More recently, when there was an attempt to involve Australia in operations in the northern part of the Indian Ocean, following the Afghanistan crisis, it was clear that there was not an absolutely frank exchange of information. It was only as a result of National Country Party pressure relating to the sale of wheat and wool to the Soviet Union that the Australian contingent, which was committed to the north Indian Ocean at that time, was in fact withdrawn. If those sorts of factors are to operate in international politics and the relationship of this country with the United States, there seems to be a need for a better spelling out in a document of this kind what the actual arrangements are. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement sounds good in terms of the Government's intention but as honourable senators can see from the fine print in the agreement there is very grave cause for concern and doubt about the Government's intentions or worse, the capacity of the Government to carry out its intentions in terms of its entering into treaty obligations with the United States. I take it that there will be ample opportunity to consider further at a subsequent time the implications of this matter, and not only in the Senate. As I believe that it will be a divisive issue in Australian political life, it is for that reason a matter in which the i's ought to be dotted and the t's crossed. This has not happened in the sloppy statement which the Government has brought down. We very much regret the contents of the agreement as are set out. We would very much like to know the meaning of sub-paragraph (VII) which should be deleted because the provisions of sub-paragraph (I), I think, effectively cover what ought to be the Government's intentions about this matter. Mr President, I shall not seek leave to continue my remarks later in case somebody else wishes to speak now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to the motion that the Senate take note of the paper. I will speak briefly not because the matter is not vitally important but because my leader has already dealt with most of the topics that need to be mentioned and I did dwell on the situation in my contribution to the Address-in-Reply debate yesterday. I listened to the statement tonight of the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) with a feeling of sadness and frustration. I felt sad because Darwin is my home, and all honourable senators know what that implies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have seen Darwin grow from a small country town of some 3,000 or 4,000 people to a modern city of some 50,000 people. I have seen it rise from tin sheds, Sydney William huts and so on to a modern capital with attractive multi-storey buildings. It is a place which I have seen demolished by a cyclone and rebuilt from the ruins by a group of people who transformed it once again into a pleasant place. I felt sad because I am convinced that it will become a prime target simply because the Government wishes to ingratiate itself with the United States. I felt frustration because it seems to me that at this stage nothing can be done. As my leader has pointed out, we have been given no opportunity to consider this matter. We can do nothing, it would seem, but accept what the Government has done. I hope that the people of Australia who are sitting outside this chamber tonight will offer some alternative. Certainly, those in Darwin will be thinking about it. During the suspension of the sitting for dinner I read the Laurie Oakes Newsletter, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> American secret defence bases likely to become nuclear targets in a conflict between the super-powers have all been in Australia's outback, remote from major population centres. </PARA>
<PARA> That is one reason there has been relatively little community concern about them. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been a case of out-of-sight, out-of-mind. </PARA>
<PARA>I have to pose the question: Is this the case with Darwin in the present situation? Is it out of sight, out of mind and, therefore, expendable to the Government? Why do I feel disturbed? What aspects of the proposal that has been put in front of us tonight concern me? I hinted at some of these in my speech yesterday. I shall go quickly through them. Russia has made it quite clear that the staging of B52 aircraft in Darwin will make Darwin a potential target. No matter how much we pontificate about the matter, Russia has warned us that that will happen. It is a fair warning and it is a warning which we should heed. The second point I mentioned yesterday was the possibility of a nuclear accident, which also would wipe out the city. The third point I made and dealt with for some time was that it ties Australia to United States policy. I made the point then that while we would normally go along with the United States and while our aims would be basically the same most of the time, there would be times when we would not want to be involved. I will mention a couple of these instances later. Much less important, but worth mentioning, is the disturbance which this will bring to the local citizens of Darwin. Canberra, Sydney and other cities will not even have commercial aircraft but we are being asked to have B52 aircraft, and all for virtually no return. </PARA>
<PARA> Does anyone really believe that the establishment is simply for training and surveillance, whatever that might mean? Anyone who is naive enough to believe that would believe that the United States would tell us when the planes were carrying activated nuclear warheads. Of course it will not. Senator Button has already indicated that. The United States did not tell Australia when all the bases went on red alert. It did not tell Australia of the purpose of its bases in Australia. It did not tell Australia that commercial information was being made available to commercial firms in the United States by eavesdropping on Australian airwaves. It is not likely to tell us of any change in what it calls strategic and operational developments. Why do I say this? Why do I believe that the United States will not tell us? Senator Button has already hinted at it. Honourable senators will recall that when the present American Secretary of State, Mr Haig, was before a Senate committee in the United States and being tested as to whether he was the right sort of person to be the Secretary of State he said quite bluntly: 'I see no reason to tell the United States legislature that the United States was bombing Cambodia for five years. It is not their concern'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Haig, who is now the Secretary of State. So we could hardly expect him to tell the Australian legislature. Some of our critics on the other side of the House might say: 'But he would tell the PM and the PM would know'. What good would it be to the people of Darwin for the Prime Minister to know that the planes coming into and going out of Darwin were carrying activated nuclear warheads? It would be of no value at all. We could not take any sort of action at all. I make the point strongly that we could find ourselves involved in United States involvements in, say, the Middle East and not want to be involved. I will be very interested in what the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) has to say about the question on nuclear non-proliferation that I put to her this morning. My understanding is that on the signing of that treaty we have agreed not to service or to provide facilities for planes for any other vehicle carrying nuclear warheads. That is mentioned in sub-paragraph (VIII) of the agreement put before us tonight. Sub-paragraph (VIII) also mentions ANZUS-not by name but it refers to our association with New Zealand and the United States. Let me just read the comments which I made yesterday on ANZUS. I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What ties Australia and the United States together? Basically it is the ANZUS treaty. Let me deal quickly with the ANZUS treaty without going into it too deeply. Article IV states:</PARA>
<PARA> Each Party recognises that an armed attack in the Pacific area on any of the Parties would be dangerous to its own peace and safety and declares that it would act to meet the common danger in accordance with its constitutional process. </PARA>
<PARA> Article IV states:</PARA>
<PARA> For the purpose of Article IV, an armed attack on any of the Parties is deemed to include an armed attack on the metropolitan Territory of any of the Parties, or on the island Territories under its jurisdiction in the Pacific or on its armed forces, public vessels or aircraft in the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically the ANZUS treaty is a watered down version of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. Honourable senators will recall the NATO phrase which goes something like 'an attack against one, shall be considered as an attack against all'. </PARA>
<PARA>This is not contained in the ANZUS Treaty; it was specifically left out by the United States. I will not go any further except to recall one comment made by Arthur Caldwell when the ratification of the treaty was debated in the House of Representatives back in those days. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is an obligation on USA and all the other participants in the European Treaty, NATO, to go to each others aid. The only guarantee that it is given in the Pacific Treaty is that the nations will consult in common . . . </PARA>
<PARA> There is no real obligation in the Pacific Treaty on anybody and on some grounds it would be better to have no treaty at all. </PARA>
<PARA>Certainly, we want to be good to our friends and good to our allies, but at what cost? 'All the way with LBJ' did not bring much to Australia. 'Down the road with Reagan' is not likely to bring us much more, except to take us further down the road. The point I wish to make strongly is that B52 aircraft do not have to stage in Darwin. There are plenty of other places with a lower population, places with airstrips which are not right smack in the centre of the city-Learmonth, Gove, Tindal, to name just a few. As far as I am concerned, the role of a senator is to speak up in this place for his State or territory. I believe that the Government of Australia has sold out the people of Darwin for reasons of sheer expediency. History will record this decision as one of the many blunders of the Fraser Government. I grieve for my city and its people. They have been unnecessarily placed in real danger by a callous government. </PARA>

My colleague Senator Primmer, who is a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, wishes to make a few remarks. It is a gross discourtesy to this chamber, which has always claimed to be a House of review, for this statement to be put down tonight and then pushed off by a few words by the most junior Minister in the Ministry about adjourning the debate on it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave out the words 'next day of sitting', insert 'later hour this day'. </PARA>
<PARA>In moving the amendment I make the point that the Australian Democrats have been refused the right by the Government to speak on this important issue. I asked for a few minutes to speak on a matter that concerns people like ourselves. After all three quarters of a million Australians voted for the Australian Democrats. Therefore, we thought our request a reasonable one. Two speakers have spoken for the Australian Labor Party. I do not deny their right whatsoever to speak to this matter. We would have thought, however, that it was not unreasonable that the Australian Democrats who have given considerable thought and time to this very important matter-after all we are only going on to a Standing Orders debate after this-should have been allowed the time to discuss this issue. It is not sufficient to argue that we will be given the time to debate the matter at some later stage. Time and time again debates of this sort are adjourned and then it is not possible for honourable senators to speak to the matter when they wish to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is reasonable in this context to give some reason for my moving of this motion. The Australian Democrats have no real objection to the idea of navigation and surveillance by B52 bombers. But we are very concerned by the fact that in the statement read by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) matters are mentioned which in fact are not mentioned in the text of the note. In other words, the statement makes claims of Australian sovereignty which are not carried out and supported by the text of the agreement. Sub-paragraph (I) of the agreement states:</PARA>
<PARA> The B-52 staging operations shall be for sea surveillance in the Indian Ocean area and for navigation training purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no mention of the status of the armament of those aircraft. Why could this not be included in the agreement because the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has made the statement that definitely there will be no nuclear weapons. We in the Australian Democrats are concerned for the safety of the Australian people. We do not take an extreme view of this. We believe in co-operation with our ANZUS allies but we feel that our Government has allowed a sloppy deal to go through which in fact does not permit us to know in terms of the note prepared by the Department of Foreign Affairs and exchanged with the United States Government what is the status of the arming of these aircraft. My second reason for seeking to move an amendment to the motion that the debate be adjourned is to develop more fully the points made by the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button) on sub-paragraph (VII) of the agreement. We are interested in the agreement not in the statement. After all the agreement is the nitty gritty. Sub-paragraph (VII) states:</PARA>
<PARA> Arrangements shall be made for consultations to ensure that the Government of Australia has full and timely information about strategic and operational developments relevant to B52 staging operations through Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>To the Australian Democrats, that is far too passive a view. In other words, it indicates that we have a sort of passive role, that Australia will be consulted so that we will have full and timely information. There is no indication in the statement that we will have any choice in what happens if, indeed, strategic and operational developments take place. What are strategic and operational developments? Does this term include the use of nuclear weapons? I have spoken to an ex-Australian diplomat of very senior status whom I do not propose to name. He was in a position to know and he has told me that there is no way in the world that the United States Government will tell any other government whether or not its aircraft are armed with nuclear weapons. And I see no reason why it should. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall do that immediately, Mr President. Thank you for your advice. We wish to discuss this matter because of the inconsistencies between the statement brought down by the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the note with the United States of America which apparently has been signed, sealed and delivered. We believe that this is a matter of great importance which should justify an urgent debate in this place. It should not be left just to slide at this stage. I cannot think of anything that would be more important to the Australian people than to have this matter debated thoroughly now. Do we become a nuclear target? What safeguards have we taken? We cannot blame our friendly allies. We are the ones who are supposed to be looking after ourselves. We are the ones who are supposed to have an agreement which is iron-clad and watertight. There is nothing iron-clad and watertight about this agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I second the amendment. If one complies with the strict rules of debate under the Standing Orders, the discussion is as to why the matter should be dealt with at a later hour this day rather than at the next day of sitting. I think it is important to make that point. My argument as to why this matter should be dealt with at a later hour this day-in fact, I believe it should be dealt with almost immediately-is that it is possibly one of the most important matters to come before this Parliament. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his statement refers to the importance of these bombers flying over Australia and then landing on Australian soil. He says that it is important, and he is proud of the fact that he has an assurance that there will be no nuclear weapons in the bombers. But on page 3 of the statement, the Prime Minister makes this qualification-and I think this is essentially why we should be considering the matter and treating it with more urgency than the Government is doing:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government has a firm policy that aircraft carrying nuclear weapons will not be allowed to fly over or stage through Australia without its prior knowledge and agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that the Prime Minister said that such an operation must have Australia's prior knowledge and agreement. But if we adopt this agreement tonight-there is some suspicion on the part of the Opposition and especially of Senator Robertson as to whether we can accept the word of the Prime Minister-or if we leave the matter in abeyance, the Government will be able to come to an arrangement with America to allow bombers carrying nuclear weapons to land in Australia. The matter will not come back to the Parliament. If we had the right to say, 'Well, we do not want this agreement', or 'We want some amendments to the agreement', or if there were an assurance that the agreement was to come back to the Parliament and the Parliament could make a decision, that may be satisfactory. But, as has been suggested, this is an arrangement whereby Australia's agreement is an agreement through government, without the Opposition or the Parliament having a say as to whether nuclear weapons can be carried. </PARA>
<PARA> A motion has been moved to the effect that we discuss this matter at some future date. When a motion is moved that the matter be discussed at the next day of sitting, that does not mean that it will come on for debate on the next day of sitting. It will come on for debate whenever the Government wants it to be debated and that may be many weeks hence. But the Opposition is so suspicious of the situation that it thinks the matter should be resolved early in the piece. The importance of this agreement was stressed by the Prime Minister. He is obviously of the opinion that there should be an early resolution of the Parliament's endorsing the agreement. But the Government is leaving the matter in abeyance, without parliamentary endorsement for weeks, as an agreement between the Governments of America and Australia. God knows when the bombers will land here and want refuelling. We cannot ignore the appeal made by Senator Robertson about Darwin, the area in which he grew up. It has to be considered and it has to be considered quickly. Therefore, in all fairness, I appeal to the Senate to permit an early discussion of this matter. My suggestion is that it be discussed tonight. If the alternative is to go on to a Standing Orders debate, I suggest that we battle on without the amended Standing Orders until such time as they can be debated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry that there has been quite a misunderstanding on this matter. That was not my intention. The first thing is that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) put down a statement before the suspension of the sitting for dinner tonight. I deliberately chose to put down the statement after dinner so that the document, which had to be kept secret before then because it had to go before the Executive Council, could be made known and could be made available to this Senate. This was done with the full intention and understanding that this was an important matter and that it should be understood.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, there is a procedure here in this Senate, very well understood, with regard to major statements; that is, that the relevant Minister puts down the statement, the Leader of the Opposition then makes a statement and then, nine times out of ten, the debate is adjourned to a date to be fixed. Because Senator Robertson has a special interest in this matter there was an agreement that he should make a speech. The normal situation, though, would have been that the debate would have been adjourned. The Government meant no discourtesy to the Australian Democrats. I remind the Australian Democrats that today, at their request, we came to a special understanding. It is important that they understand that there are courtesies which we want to extend. In fact, in the corridor, before Senator Mason moved this amendment on behalf of the Australian Democrats, I said to the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Chipp: 'We will be adjourning this matter tonight for a debate subsequently'. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition senators-When?</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important that this be known. I am perfectly happy for the procedures of debate to take place. I thought that tonight we were extending the normal courtesies. I am sorry that this was misunderstood. I sought to pay a courtesy to Senator Chipp in what was, in truth, an informal message that we were going to adjourn the matter, but that there would be a debate on it. True, it would have been better had that been a formal show. I acknowledge that.</PARA></TALK.START>

But the aim of these kinds of debates is that the relevant Minister brings down the statement, the Leader of the Opposition speaks to it and then it is adjourned until another time. I said to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Button) that I was perfectly willing to list this matter for full debate in the next week of sitting. I am still perfectly willing to do that and there is no urgency to the situation in this regard. It is well to know that I have already said these things to the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>

If, indeed, there is a sense of urgency that this matter be debated, let us put aside General Business tomorrow night and debate it. If it is that urgent, let us do so. But let me say that we made these arrangements as the formal arrangements. I had hoped that they were not only appropriate but also courteous arrangements. If they have broken down insofar as the Australian Democrats are concerned, I regret that. If in the minds of honourable senators there is the question of urgency and they would prefer the matter to be debated this week rather than the next sitting week, we will make such arrangements. It is a matter for the leaders to decide. I suggest that we get on with tonight's business and we will make arrangements between the leaders to list the adjourned debate for the early future.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -When consideration of this matter was interrupted on 26 February, I was discussing the question whether Senate Estimates committees should take in camera evidence. There was some dispute whether the present provision was adequate or some other provision ought to be made. Senator Rae had enlightened the Committee of the Whole on some of the history relating to the taking of in camera evidence. I understand that he has a proposal to make. I would like to hear Senator Rae's proposal before I speak again.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following on the discussion which has taken place and in the light of the history of the desire expressed by this chamber and expressed on a number of occasions by various of the Estimates committees, I propose that we should endeavour to resolve the matter by having before the Senate for consideration a specific amendment to the Standing Orders which would permit the taking of evidence in camera by Estimates committees. It is for that reason that I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', and this Committee directs the Standing Orders Committee to prepare and present to the Senate during this session an amendment to the Standing Orders to enable Estimates committees to take evidence in camera subject to reporting to the Senate the fact that such evidence has been taken in camera and the reasons for the Committee's decision to take such evidence in camera'. </PARA>
<PARA>In the light of the discussion which has taken place, I do not think it is necessary for me at this stage to elaborate again on the reasons for moving such an amendment. I simply reiterate in very brief form that since 1972 this recommendation has been coming to this chamber, debated in this chamber, referred with approval to the Standing Orders Committee and has not yet been affirmatively resolved by an amendment to the Standing Orders. I have moved this amendment so that we can have from the Standing Orders Committee a clear recommendation for an amendment which could be debated in this chamber to finalise one way or other this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am afraid that I must oppose the amendment moved by Senator Rae because its adoption would mean an instruction to the Standing Orders Committee to bring down a report that Senate Estimates committees can take evidence in camera. The Standing Orders Committee pertinently has pointed out that Estimates committees carry out a function in place of the Committee of the Whole in which in camera evidence cannot be taken. Surely affairs relating to the expenditure of Commonwealth money should not be a secret matter. Whilst the taking of in camera evidence may suit Standing Committees, such practice should be permitted in hearings of the Estimates committees. Therefore, I am opposed to any procedure that would allow for secret evidence to be given to Estimates committees and which would have to be endorsed by the Senate after it is dealt with by the Committee of the Whole. We would have to make a decision on evidence that is available to Estimates committees but not to the Committee of the Whole. It is proposed to have an exclusive section of senators who hear secret evidence which justifies their decision. But when the Committee of the Whole comes to make its decisions, it has not the advantage of that in camera evidence. Surely money that is spent by the Commonwealth is a matter of public interest. Questions on how money is spent and the reasons for that expenditure should be detailed. I point out that the Standing Orders Committee has made the point that evidence in camera can be taken now if the Senate so approves. If there is a good reason for evidence to be taken in camera, let the Estimates committee report to and get the approval of the Senate. Let us not lay down a procedure whereby Estimates committees can at any time go into in camera sessions and take secret evidence. The practice would then become a formality. Those who are not members of the Estimates committee will never know what is going on before the committee. There is also the requirement that hearings of Estimates committees shall be open to the public and to the Press. It is now proposed in this amendment to exclude every right that was granted in the establishment of Estimates committees. It is now proposed to take away those rights by this amendment and to have secret sessions of Estimates committees which can make a decision without the knowledge of anyone else.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -When the Committee was considering this matter on 26 February, I spoke on it and I do not seek to prolong consideration tonight because there has been a good deal of discussion. I did oppose the notion that we ought to change the situation as it obtains at the moment on the taking of in camera evidence; and most of my reasons have already been detailed. I just briefly reiterate that I would want to be persuaded that the present provisions that enable the taking of in camera evidence are in some way defective because, in my experience, I am not so persuaded. However, it is possible that a valid case can be put. I would not object to the Standing Orders Committee looking at the possibility of drafting a standing order just to see what comes out of it and what are the implications of it. To take up Senator Cavanagh's point, we ought to treat the matter of in camera evidence very carefully because, as I said on that previous occasion, the only people who are excluded from private sessions of Estimates committees are the public including the Press. In fact the situation is that all honourable senators could attend to hear in camera evidence. It starts to approach very closely something like the Senate sitting in camera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make these comments to indicate to the Standing Orders Committee when it is looking at the matter-and I will not oppose this question going off to it to look at the possibility of drafting a standing order so that we can see what the implications of it are-that it ought to look very closely at the discussion that has taken place on this question and the sorts of objections that have been raised to the matter of enabling Estimates committees easily to sit in camera. I will support Senator Rae's amendment but I stress that I do so just to see the outcome, to see what are the criteria, and what are the grounds that could go into a standing order and whether we can get a workable situation or whether the result of an attempt to put this idea into a standing order would be to lessen the functions of the Senate and of the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My position is quite clear. I think I explained my position on 26 February when we were last debating the report of the Standing Orders Committee. I want to correct a statement made by Senator Lewis when we were debating Item 5 on 26 February. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I do so let me say that Senator McLaren raised the question of Senate Estimates committees not having staff made available to them. In fact, we are trying to arrange, as he would know, for staff to be made available to assist them. </PARA>
<PARA>I interjected:</PARA>
<PARA> You are trying to arrange it?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Lewis, in reply, said:</PARA>
<PARA> I do not think Senator McLaren was present at the last Estimates committee hearings. I think he was overseas at the time. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to correct that. I was not overseas at the time. I did not leave Australia last year. I attended hearings of the Estimates committees held in both the autumn session and the Budget session. I want to place on record the fact that I was quite happy with the previous staffing arrangements for Estimates Committee A, of which I was then a member and of which I still am a member. We were very well served by this staff. The staff was headed by Mr Peter Murdoch, who is now the Black Rod and who gave very great service to Estimates Committee A in the initial stages. However, we found it necessary during, I think, the last Budget session to second staff. I want to compliment the staff seconded. They had to work under a very great load. They came from the staff of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources. Mr Edwards and Mr Abbott did a good job, having been brought in at the last meeting to try to service Estimates Committee A. </PARA>
<PARA> My claim is that we ought to have a permanent staff. I think that one person has now been appointed to Estimates Committee A. If that is so, I support that appointment. During the hearings of that Estimates Committee last year we had to bring in the two staff members I have mentioned of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources. They already had a very heavy work load in servicing the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, of which I am also a member. I fully appreciate the work that those two members do. They had put upon them the extra burden of servicing Estimates Committee A. I do not think the job should have been given to them because it involved an extra work load. </PARA>
<PARA> Estimates committees need full time staff who can devote the whole of their time not only to looking at problems that arise at the time of Estimate committee hearings but also to looking at questions asked by members of the committees in years gone by, the answers given and the way members of the committee have been sidetracked by officers of the department who came before the committees. One of the problems we face when we seek to solicit information from public servants who come before Estimates committees is that we are told-I have complained about this on many occasions-that we should approach another Estimates committee to obtain the information we are seeking. As I have pointed out on many occasions, honourable senators can attend only one Estimates committee meeting at a time. It seems to me that the Government, in its wisdom and because it suits it, has split up the responsibilities of the departments that come before Estimates committees over a whole range of Estimates committees. It will be even worse this year because I understand that the proposal will be that there will be eight Estimates committees instead of six Estimates committees. An honourable senator who is pursuing one line of thought and trying to obtain information on it will be told that he should have raised that matter before another Estimates committee. Therefore, he is unable to obtain the information that he seeks. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said before, when we come back to the Committee of the Whole and we get too close to the bone we find the Government applying the gag and we never obtain information which the Senate ought to be given. As I said when I spoke in this debate on 26 February, there should be a one-line Budget so that we can have sufficient staff to enable us to run our own affairs in this place and so that the Parliament itself can examine the expenditure of public moneys. We should not be sidetracked by being told that we should go to another committee to obtain the information we require. I come back to the point that when we come back to the Committee of the Whole and we are getting too close to the bone, the Leader of the Government in the Senate stands up and places a time limit on the debate and the debate is gagged. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Standing Orders Committee will insist upon its recommendation that the Estimates committees should have a full time staff, not have staff seconded to them from standing committees. They should have a full time staff whose sole job it is to service the Estimates committees so that those committees can obtain the information sought. That expertise should be available to us not only during hearings but also at other times. Questions which we ask are often replied to in letters which are not incorporated in Hansard. As I said before, the only way such a letter will be incorporated in Hansard is for an honourable senator to stand up and read that letter into Hansard. Mr President is nodding his head. He gave an undertaking on the last occasion on which we discussed this matter that he would take some action to see that letters from Minister to senators in reply to questions asked at Estimates committee hearings or about Appropriation Bills are incorporated in the first Hansard published after we receive that information. If that happens I will be happy. But I will not be altogether happy until the Estimates committees have full time staff and the members of the Estimates committees have full access to that staff to explore the avenues in which they have an interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that there is a fundamental difference between the functions of Estimates committees and the legislative and general purpose standing committees. On the one hand we have the standing committees taking public evidence or evidence in camera on matters which have been referred to those committees for report ultimately to the Senate. On the other hand we have Estimates committees, which report ultimately to the Committee of the Whole. I am inclined to Senator Cavanagh' approach on this matter. Public moneys are involved. I do not think that an Estimates committee should seek, of its own volition, to take evidence in camera as it may not have the concurrence of the Senate as a whole to do so. As to the matter of public funding as it applies now, I believe that it would be anomalous for the Senate to be voting public moneys, moneys for public purposes, based upon the recommendations of committees which have taken their evidence in camera, evidence which might not be known to all senators.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to support the remarks that have been made by my colleague Senator Cavanagh and by Sir Condor Laucke. I want to set out briefly the history of the establishment of Estimates committees. During the time that Senator Murphy was Leader of the Opposition in the Senate he was a great proponent of the establishment of standing committees and when, by sheer weight of numbers, we were able to impress upon the Senate of the time that a number of Senate standing committees should be established, the then leader of the Government in the Senate, Sir Kenneth Anderson, decided that, in addition to the establishment of Senate standing committees, there should be established Senate Estimates committees for the purpose of scrutinising public expenditure. In order to get the Senate standing committees established, the Opposition agreed at the time to the establishment of the Senate Estimates committees.</PARA></TALK.START>

Indeed, I note that Australian Senate Practice by Odgers states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 20 September 1972 the Standing Orders Commitee recommended to the Senate that any decision that any Estimates Committee take in camera evidence should be made only by the Senate itself upon receiving a Special Report from the particular committee. In moving for the adoption of this recommendation, which was agreed to, it was pointed out that, if evidence were taken in camera, it may have only limited value because the evidence may not be known to the whole Senate, which has the responsibility-not the Estimates Committees-of passing appropriations. It was considered to be not consistent with the role of the Chamber in examining the Estimates for evidence to be taken in camera, except in extremely special circumstances. </PARA>

It is wrong to say that because only six senators will be present they cannot be trusted to make a judgment on the matter and that we will not trust them to take evidence in camera or to do it properly. They will report on the matter so that if an honourable senator does not like what they have done he will certainly have an opportunity to criticise the honourable senators concerned about it.

Honourable senators would advocate that the whole hearing be adjourned so that senators could go back to the Senate and ask the Senate for permission to take evidence in camera. With respect, that is quite stupid. That is a waste of the time of the Senate and of the committee. In fact, this suggested amendment by Senator Rae provides that honourable senators ought to have the right to take in camera evidence so that it can be taken at the time and then the situation reported to the Senate. I suggest that this is a perfectly sensible proposal and that only pettifogging reasons have been brought forward against it. It ought to be passed by this Committee. </PARA>

If any in camera evidence is needed the committee ought to come into the Senate. We should not try to hide any evidence because, as Senator Missen has said, perhaps we do not trust six members of the Estimates committee to take evidence in camera and then to report back to the Senate. Senator Missen says that we have only to believe what those six senators were told when the evidence was taken in camera, and accept that they believe that the evidence should be kept in confidence and should not be divulged to the rest of the Senate. There are 64 senators in this place. That means that 58 other senators might have a different point of view on some of the evidence that would have been given in camera and those honourable senators are not privy to that evidence. We have to take as gospel the information which those six senators bring back into this place. I am not prepared to vote for any motion which allows any six senators to take evidence in camera at Estimates committees. It is a different matter all together at standing committees, but at Estimates committees it is not.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Martin has asked for an example. Over the years, there has been considerable debate on this matter. I do not want to see it extended. However, I cannot let what is, in effect, the challenge go by without using an example which first gave rise to this matter coming before this chamber in 1972. It has also come before us on many occasions since. The example is that of a question which was asked by an honourable senator in relation to the activities of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, about the programs which it was purchasing, had purchased the previous year and was proposing to purchase for the current year in relation to sporting television. The question related to what the cost of a soccer program would be as opposed to the cost of a rugby program. Some honourable senators on the other side of the chamber may now realise who asked the question. Be that as it may, the honourable senator, I have no doubt, will recall it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The witnesses from the ABC said that they would prefer not to answer that question because the negotiations had not been concluded. Eventually, after an adjournment to try to overcome the impasse which had arisen, it became quite clear in discussion which took place in an unfortunate way out the back, as it were, that if the ABC were required to answer the question, it was likely to cost it many tens of thousands of dollars in the negotiations which were proceeding at that time. The honourable senator did not want the information on the record but rather wanted to know the relativities. </PARA>
<PARA> It may well have been that the question could have been phrased in another way. The witnesses from the ABC could then have answered it without any problem at all and everyone would have been happy. If the Committee had been able to deal with that matter in camera, had that facility been available, it would have been possible to have the matter clarified and then cleared up simply and readily in public. Everybody would have been satisfied as to what was the situation without commercial confidentiality being breached and without a situation arising in which one of the statutory authorities of the Commonwealth was disadvantaged to a significant extent in its commercial dealings in relation to the purchasing of rights for televising particular programs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may show it was not necessary but at the time the honourable senator who was asking the questions believed it was necessary. After some explanation, he understood that there was another way in which he could get the same information. The opportunity did not exist. In this case, the matter had to be resolved by way of private conversation out the back. It could have been done more formally under the proposition which is before the Senate tonight, that is, by the taking of in camera evidence which would have sorted the difficulty out. The Committee could then resume its public hearing and the matter could be cleared up readily and simply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The suggestion that public moneys are involved and, therefore, there cannot be any question of taking evidence in camera, is one of the less substantiated suggestions which I have heard made in the chamber in relation to the operation of Estimates committees. The corollary is that we prefer not to know anything than to have some members of the Committee able to know something and to report to the Senate, which can then take whatever steps it regards as appropriate to find out more information in relation to that matter if it were deemed appropriate. In no way is there a subterfuge taking place. I remind honourable senators that under Standing Order 36AB, sub-standing order 10, provision is made that every honourable senator may attend meetings of Estimates committees. Senator Grimes interjected at one stage with what I think was a perfectly legitimate interjection. He said: 'But how would they know that some evidence was to be taken in camera?' I imagine that the answer to that question is that they would be likely to be present while those estimates were being dealt with if they thought that there were matters of interest to them which required their attendance during the hearing of the proposed appropriations. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to anybody who is not familiar with the operations of an Estimates committee that its meeting is programmed and it goes from step to step in dealing with the proposed appropriations. An honourable senator monitoring what is happening in that committee knows when it is likely to reach a particular part of the appropriations. If the honourable senator is interested, he can be there and is entitled, under the Standing Orders, to participate. There is no secrecy. Every honourable senator can participate. The choice being put before the Senate tonight, on the basis of the argument which is opposing this amendment, is that we would rather know nothing than have the opportunity for every honourable senator to know something. That is the rather incredible proposition which I find being made repeatedly as a result of the Standing Orders Committee reports but never yet accepted by a majority of this chamber. In the eight or nine years in which this matter has come before the chamber, it has repeatedly approved that this would make the operation of the Estimates committees more effective and that it is no different from the Senate permitting a standing committee or a select committee to do this. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not accept the argument that it is correct for the Senate to be voting funds, when it does not have full information of the details and when, in fact, this amendment would enable all honourable senators to obtain full information if they wished to be present when the Committee takes the evidence in camera. The alternative is that no honourable senator obtains the information. That is a preposterous situation to be arguing. I find it quite surprising that some eminent people who put that view have not seen the total fallacy in the view which they have put. </PARA>

His motion gives an instruction to the Standing Orders Committee to bring down a recommendation for the alteration. We are committed to the alteration before it is considered. Senator Rae has given as an example a legitimate case where there may have been a need to take some evidence in camera. He mentioned that this happened in 1972 in relation to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I think he reported that the complaint came back to the Senate. The Senate adopted a recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee to get over that matter. The recommendation was that the committee seek leave of the Senate to take the evidence. So the complaint of Senator Rae has been overcome. He has accepted that now. He does not put his finger on one occasion when that has not worked. Senator Martin asks where this has not worked, but no one can say that it has not been tried.

I am not opposed to the Standing Orders Committee looking into the matter to see whether there is a better way to proceed. I am of the opinion that there should be some safeguards. The Estimates committee should not suddenly meet and then decide to take the evidence in camera. A dangerous precedent is being established here that will grow and grow. If Senator Rae is of the opinion that the present Standing Order does not work, I am not opposed to a motion asking the Standing Orders Committee to look into the matter again. Senator Rae's amendment reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 'and this Committee directs the Standing Orders Committee-</PARA>

<PARA>The question is whether the Committee of the Whole or the Senate agrees with the evidence being taken in that way. That is the position. This motion is designed to give power to the Committee to take evidence in camera without a reference to the Senate. This is complete executive control. Unless we can indicate that the existing Standing Order has not worked, I say that this motion should not be carried. If any senator wishes the Standing Orders Committee to consider whether there is a better procedure for taking evidence in camera than the present one, I would not oppose a motion to that effect. But by referring the matter to the Standing Orders Committee and asking for a recommendation whether it is in order for the Senate to give the Estimates committees the power to hear evidence in camera, we are simply agreeing to an Estimates committee being able to decide on the question of evidence. </PARA>

If a senator who is a member of another Estimates committee-and most senators are members of Estimates committees-and who has an interest in a particular area finds that in camera evidence has been taken while he or she has been on another committee, would that senator have access to that evidence even though he or she had not been present at the time it was given?

We ought to consider the situation as it is in 1981.

I ask Senator Cavanagh to read the amendment moved by Senator Rae and to consider that, if the Standing Orders Committee during this session suggested an amendment to the Senate, there is no question that the Senate would then give that amendment its consideration. It may amend or reject that amendment, but certainly, it would debate the amendment. I suggest to Senator Cavanagh that his suggestion that in some way or another the Senate would be bound to accept some amendment that it had not yet seen is not a proper argument. </PARA>

Would it be available to senators who were members of an Estimates committee but were not present when the evidence was given? The sort of thing that I had in mind in suggesting that we refer this matter in rather broad terms to the Standing Orders Committee was that the Standing Orders Committee would give consideration to the practicality and the implications of either making the transcript of evidence taken in camera available to all the senators who may attend-that is, the whole committee-or, alternatively, all those who are present at the time whether they are members of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would hope that the Standing Orders Committee, with this sort of direction and request from the chamber, would set about to consider this matter positively. That is something which for nine years the Standing Orders Committee has failed to do, notwithstanding the fact that this chamber has repeatedly referred this matter to it. The Standing Orders Committee has been induced over the years by what amounts to a minority attitude within this chamber to refuse to deal in detail with the question but rather to say that it objects to the principle. I am simply trying to achieve a situation in which the Standing Orders Committee will look at the detail.

<PARA> A matter that I do not think has been made adequately clear at this stage is that the concern expressed by Senator McLaren and others can be answered in a simple way. The latter part of my amendment ensures that before the Committee of the Whole considers the Estimates-this answers also the point made by other honourable senators-and the vote is passed, there is a report from the Estimates committee which draws the attention of the Committee of the Whole to the fact that some evidence relating to such and such a matter was taken in camera for a particular reason. That would leave the Committee of the Whole in a position in which it could then decide whether it wishes, in the Committee of the Whole procedure, to endeavour to obtain further information in relation to it. It is not a secret; it is known to those senators who were sufficiently interested to be present. It can then become a matter of debate in the Committee of the Whole. But practicality requires that when the matter arises-the Senate would not be sitting, a whole horde of public servants would be waiting to answer questions-the committee should proceed to take evidence in camera and report to the Committee of the Whole on that so that it would then know that some evidence had been taken in camera. I thought that the latter part of this amendment answered the concern expressed earlier in the debate by some honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to sub-item (ii) relating to staff of Estimates committees. I think that this is a most hopelessly disappointing recommendation-if it may be called a recommendation-from the Standing Orders Committee. It states that it does not intend to make any recommendation on the matter at this stage. The situation, as it pointed out and as honourable senators will know, is that the staff members who have served the Estimates committees in the last year or two have been taken away from the standing committees. As chairman of a standing committee, I know this is so because twice during the last year my committee has had its work disrupted by the removal of one research member of staff so that we have been unable to complete work that otherwise would have been done. To say that this part time experimental basis of staffing should continue in the absence of more permanent staffing arrangements is all together too complacent and unsatisfactory because, there is no doubt about it, we cannot afford to go ahead when certain staff ceilings are set up and when we are told, 'All right, you have to take the staff away from existing standing committees'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For many years, the standing committees of this Senate have produced reports and done work of value. If the committee work slows down and is not completed, I think we are ruining the basis of the success of the Senate of the 1970s. It is said that these staffing positions at the moment and in the future depend on staff ceilings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One can juggle people around from one place to another. I think that Senator Lewis is making the point that there may be room for staff to be moved from somewhere else; perhaps we could take some of the attendants away from the boxes and bring them in as research officers. I rather doubt that that could be done. The fact is that it is very unsatisfactory-as Senator Lewis would agree-just to pass this thing up and wait until something happens. The situation of staff ceilings has been examined in some of the committee proceedings going on at the present time. Doubt has been expressed-I expressed it also-about whether the staff ceilings imposed on the Senate office are lawful-whether it is necessary for the Senate to observe staff ceilings in this way. Perhaps that is a controversial view and would take some argument. Be that as it may, I say that I am not prepared to accept or to vote for a recommendation which states we will not do anything at the moment and that we will accept complacently a situation in which our committees will be deprived this year, as they were last year, of essential research staff for a period of three weeks or a month twice a year when the Senate is meeting. This would mean that in the middle of that period the work needing to be done would not be done. The reports which the Senate and its committees might produce would not be completed. For these reasons, amongst others, I suggest that we should not accept this item. I intend to vote against it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure that the Senate Standing Orders Committee can do anything about the staffing of Parliament House. However, I totally agree with Senator Missen's sentiments on this subject. We were told that the staff support for Estimates committees has been on a part time experimental basis and that this should continue. I think the proof of the experiment is whether it works. The support that part time staffing has given to Estimates committees has been valuable. That does not deny any of the difficulties that Senator Missen said this practice may put other committees into. I think it is deplorable that we are in a position of trying to make Parliament work through the committee system. It does not matter whether the committees be Senate standing committees, select committees, Senate Estimates committees or joint parliamentary committees. They are being set one against the other squabbling over how they should share staff, how much staff they should have, what rights the Senate staff has and what rights the House of Representatives staff has. Frankly, I think that the whole Parliament is being had on the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am interested to note that Senator Missen raised the point that it may not be in order for staff ceilings to be set in this area by the Public Service Board. I do not know whether it is legal but I think that it is outrageous that the Executive can tell us how much staff we may have in Parliament. The time has long since passed when this Parliament should have an appropriation to determine how many of which types of classifications of staff it should have-how many attendants and Hansard reporters it needs, how many committee staff and how many ancillary staff it needs. It is just outrageous that the Executive can say, 'You may have so many Hansard reporters-it may or may not be a satisfactory number-but you may not have further staff in the category that would provide support staff for parliamentary committees'. That is our business, not the business of Cabinet or the Public Service Board. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, I do not feel that the Standing Orders Committee can do very much about that situation. I note that there is a Senate Select Committee on Parliamentary Appropriations and Staffing. I was absent from this Parliament during the last sessional period; I assume that that select committee was set up in my absence. I am not au fait with all the details of what it is doing. I hope it is looking into the matter. </PARA>

I think that the Senate certainly should say very seriously that we ought to have a parliamentary appropriation and that it should be Parliament's business how that appropriation is divided.

I think that the next step is probably in the hands of the Parliament.

I am not happy with that, and neither are my colleagues on this side of the chamber. We have expressed that point of view. I say in all sincerity that if any Government senator is prepared to put the proposition that we have a one-line appropriation for the Parliament he or she will get the support of the Opposition.

I endorse what Senator Missen said with respect to the difficulties that are imposed on the standing committees of the Senate when staff have to be taken from the standing committees to service the Estimates committees. If we examine section 9 of the Public Service Act, we will find that the Presiding Officers have the right to appoint staff for the Parliament. I would like to see that provision tested. I know that the President very commendably has endeavoured to attract sufficient staff to service the Estimates committees but he is always confronted with the objection concerning staff ceilings. I think that is unacceptable to the Senate. I am sure that the Presiding Officers need the support of the Parliament to test that section of the Public Service Act.</PARA></TALK.START>

I like to think that later in this session the select committee that has been appointed to deal with this matter will come forward with some more positive propositions which will attract the total support of the Senate and, I am sure, reinforce the purpose of the Presiding Officers in this Parliament to assist, where they can, in a far more effective manner with respect to the question we are discussing at present. I suggest that it would be interesting to test that section of the Public Service Act in this way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make only a few remarks on this subject and to move an amendment in terms of the way I think it would be useful to deal with this section of the report. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion add, 'but that consideration on any matters relating to the staffing of committees of the Senate arising from the Standing Orders report be deferred until the Senate has received the report of the Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the Standing Orders Committee, as Senator Martin has said, is not really in a position to make detailed recommendations about the staffing of Estimates committees or indeed of any of the Senate's committees. But, we were simply to note the section of the Standing Orders Committee's report. It would appear, I think, that the Senate had noted, and accepted from its Standing Orders Committee, a report which says that the Committee does not make any firm recommendation on the matter. I believe the desire of the Senate in establishing the Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing was that the Senate would not want to make decisions, whether by way of positive decisions, by way of noting recommendations or by way of noting what is here a non-recommendation, prior to the date when it received and had the chance to consider the report of the Committee that the Senate established. I think quite clearly the Standing Orders Committee is not in a position to make those recommendations. The Select Committee was established for that specific purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> To put on the record a comment simply that the Standing Orders Committee, having looked at the question, was not in a position to make any recommendations would not advance the cause that all honourable senators are united on of seeing a greater degree of control over the Senate's business, including the Senate's committee responsibilities, exercised by the Senate itself. Rather than simply noting a report that says that no recommendation can be made, we should move to a position of saying that we defer consideration of any matters arising from this report on the question of staffing of Senate committees until such time as we have received the report of the Committee which the Senate specifically established to consider that very question. I think that would obviate the need for excessive debate on this item. We should simply record no decision until our own expert committee on the matter has reported and the Senate has had a chance to examine the recommendations of that committee. </PARA>

<PARA> At end of motion add 'and this Committee requests the Standing Orders Committee to prepare and present to the Senate during this Session an amendment to the Standing Orders to enable House of Representatives Ministers to appear before and give evidence to Senate Estimates Committees'. </PARA>
<PARA>The report of the Standing Orders Committee refers to the suggestion that House of Representatives Ministers should appear before the Senate Estimates committees to give evidence in the same way that Senate Ministers do. The report notes that there are no constitutional or procedural barriers to House of Representatives Ministers appearing before Senate committees, including Estimates committees. The report then raises a number of difficulties with the proposal. The purpose of my moving an amendment to the motion is to enable the Committee of the Whole to indicate its opinion on the subject of House of Representatives Ministers appearing before Senate Estimates committees and, by voting in favour of my amendment, to indicate to the Standing Orders Committee that it wishes that Committee to proceed with whatever measures are necessary in relation to the Standing Orders to enable this procedure to take place. The issue is a serious and a basic one. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to give my opinion on some of the points raised in the report of the Standing Orders Committee and also to give my opinion on the principle of House of Representatives Ministers appearing before Senate Estimates committees. I have to say, with respect, that I do not consider the difficulties raised in paragraph 20 of the report of the Standing Orders Committee to be substantial ones. I do not want to appear to be unkind to House of Representatives Ministers or not understanding of their difficulties. However, I do not feel that the practical difficulties referred to by the Standing Orders Committee are insuperable barriers. In fact, I do not consider them to be substantial barriers. The question of the difficulty of arranging times of meeting to suit House of Representative Ministers who have commitments in that House is, I think, not a very difficult one. We have had until recently only five Senate Ministers who have had to spread themselves over six Estimates committees. That has created difficulties because on that sixth committee where there was not a Minister we had to bring in a series of Ministers who were already appearing before other Estimates committees. There were some practical difficulties. It worked but it had to be worked at hard to make it work. If we had the situation of being able to call all of the Ministers-25, 26 or however many-before Estimates committees, however many of them there may be, and one does not envisage a large increase in their number, it should be possible to arrange some timetable to meet the problem. The Senate Ministers carry a far heavier load, I believe, in relation to timetabling for the chamber than do House of Representatives Ministers. Again, I do not want to appear to sound too cavalier about the responsibilities of House of Representatives Ministers but that House does have House duty-the requirement to sit in the House-spread among 20 people, and those Ministers do not carry a heavy representational load. Only a small number of Senate Ministers have to be represented in the House of Representatives, so that House of Representatives Ministers present their own Bills and very few others. They are not tied to the chamber as much as Senate Ministers are. I do not consider that it would be so difficult to arrange the timetabling of Estimates committees and indeed of the commitments of House of Representatives Ministers that it could not be handled. I believe it could be handled because I think our Senate Ministers showed that they handled a far more difficult proposition in relation to timetabling when we were in the situation of having only five Ministers with six committees. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point raised by the report of the Standing Orders Committee relates to the difficulty of predicting when particular departments will be examined by the Estimates committees. That difficulty, I think, has already been covered in my reference to Estimates Committee F and the problems it had when we were a Minister short in relation to the number of committees. It is not possible to predict exactly when particular departments will be examined. Nevertheless, Senate Ministers have seen their responsibility to the Senate and to Estimates committees and have made the adjustments necessary. I think the Senate is very grateful for the fact that they have done that. I would not think that the difficulty is too much for House of Representatives Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point raised in the report of the Standing Orders Committee relates to the difficulty of predicting in advance whether questions to be asked during the hearings are such as to require the attention of the Minister concerned. I am afraid the point of that objection pretty well goes over my head because we can have a situation in which a Senate Minister can be answering questions in relation to his or her portfolio and the Ministers are there whether they or their officers are answering the questions. Our Ministers have never required and we have never required that they sit before the committees only on those instances when they personally are answering questions. I think the position is to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA> At present we have a number of Ministers who can answer questions in relation to their own portfolios and on occasions they will refer to departmental advisers questions asked of them by senators. That applies even in relation to their own portfolio. However, what happens when we move into an examination of the estimates of those departments for which the Minister is only representing and it is not his own department is something quite unsatisfactory both for the Minister and for the Estimates committees. It is not often that a Minister can answer questions under those circumstances and certainly not questions relating to detail. Ministers can answer questions relating to policy. We really are in a situation in which once we move beyond a Minister's own portfolio we can examine only the public servants. It is quite satisfactory that we examine public servants. But I do not think it is entirely satisfactory that we do not examine the Minister as well. We are unable to ask questions in certain areas where it is appropriate that the Minister is the one who should be answering in relation to his own responsibilities. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> If questions arise requiring answers from House of Representatives Ministers, it is a simple and convenient practice for written answers to be provided. </PARA>
<PARA>In my opinion that is not a satisfactory arrangement. I am sure that all honourable senators who have sat on Estimates committees have been in the position where they have agreed to information being provided in a written form subsequent to the committee meeting and it has not come in a satisfactory form. The answer has come after the committee has finished its deliberations and is about to report to the Senate and we are about to consider Estimates and Estimates committees reports in the Senate. It is too late then. We are not in a better position then if we wish to point out that the written answers have not given us all the information that we would have sought or, if they have given us the information, that there are other issues which we would like to pursue as they arise from that answer. It is too late to pursue it in the Senate in the way in which it should be pursued. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Minister is in no superior position. He can only turn to his departmental advisers here when we are in the Senate chamber and seek further advice. He is certainly in no superior position. I will not accept that it is a simple and convenient practice for written answers to be provided. I will go on record and say that frequently I have been dissatisfied with the answers when they have come but they have come too late for me to do anything about it through the Estimates committee's procedure. The proposal that the Committee suggests raises large questions which go to the fundamental of the bicameral system. No one is suggesting-I am certainly not-that House of Representatives Ministers should come to this Chamber to answer questions and to present legislation. I think, on the whole, we proceed satisfactorily in those matters. I think the Estimates committees are a separate point. I think, from the point of Government Ministers being able to present evidence in relation to their own departments, that it should be more satisfactory for those Ministers to be able to do it themselves rather than have to depend on others to answer questions directly relating to their portfolio. I am not suggesting for one minute that the Senate Ministers representing House of Representatives Ministers do not do their job adequately or do not attempt to do it adequately. I am saying that I do not think it is satisfactory from the point of view of the Ministers or of the departments concerned or from the point of view of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I consider it fundamental to the improved operations of Estimates committees that they receive evidence from House of Representatives Ministers. At present, House of Representatives Ministers give evidence to Senate standing committees. They may give it under very particular circumstances. It may be, for example, in camera. It is not as though there is no precedent for House of Representatives Ministers appearing before Senate committees. They do appear before Senate standing committees. There is not a precedent for their appearing before Estimates committees. The Standing Orders Committee report points out that there are no constitutional or procedural barriers. I think we should move to get procedures initiated which would enable them to come before Senate Estimates committees. </PARA>

I think there is a substantial point which goes to the arrangement and operation of a bicameral parliament and which, in fact, I think can be resolved at this stage by noting the recommendations that the Standing Orders Committee makes. We do not need to go to the stage of requesting the Standing Orders Committee now to prepare a Standing Order which, in its own turn, would therefore come back to the chamber for debate and which would raise the whole matter again. I think we can grapple at least with some of the issues that arise by Senator Martin's moving this amendment and, at least, start to examine them. I think the Standing Orders Committee is quite right to say that there are no consitutional barriers to the appearance of Ministers who are members of the House of Representatives before Senate committees.

<PARA> I have no doubt that there would be problems with this proposal in a number of areas. I envisage for instance the way in which one would deal with the Senate calling the Prime Minister before one of its Estimates committees in order to examine the estimates of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. I think the way in which that sort of procedure would develop would, in fact, be the first step in the total ruination of the process of Senate Estimates committees. I believe that the procedures that we have been following, imperfect as they may be, have strengthened the Senate's oversight and scrutiny of the estimates of government departments. I think that the idea of provoking what undoubtedly would be a confrontation when, from time to time, Ministers in the House of Representatives decide that they are responsible to the House of Representatives and are unable to appear before Senate Estimates committees will lead us into some difficulty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak tonight at the request of a number of electors in the Federal electorate of Lowe for which I happen to be the duty senator. I am prompted to speak by Mr Michael Maher, the New South Wales State member for Drummoyne. My concern is at the Commonwealth Government's control or lack of control over foreign investment, particularly in the real estate field. I refer to the Birkenhead Point shopping complex of which both the senatorial Ministers from New South Wales would be aware. It is a big shopping centre. It has been the scene of a sort of octopus operation by a real estate firm known as Kingsgate Investments Pty Ltd. The firm operates from Singapore. It originally took over the Hyatt Kingsgate Hotel at Kings Cross. At that complex there is a dispute between certain small shopkeepers in an arcade over whether they will be closed down. I think the original buyers visualised that there would be more high-density housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not cavil about the need for more housing for the inner city area. That is not at stake. I am concerned about the people in the Lowe electorate. They are very adequately represented by the State member, Mr Maher, who is eternally vigilant on these sorts of matters. He telephoned me this evening to point out that a considerable number of small shopkeepers within the Birkenhead Point complexes are concerned about this matter. I understand that the people in this area, which is like a lot of other metropolitan Sydney shopping complexes such as the Westfield shoppingtowns and others, have been enticed to go into this field of merchandising. Now they find that the overseas operators who masquerade under the name of Kingsgate Investments Pty Ltd are threatening their livelihoods. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not the time of night to have a long discourse on the pros and cons of the influx of foreign capital. It certainly has a place in any country but the ground rules have to be very effective. I will ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Peter Baume, for permission to have incorporated in Hansard an article on the Hyatt Kingsgate project by Hazel Pillemer, property reporter for the Sydney Morning Herald, which appeared in the that newspaper on 2 January 1981. While the Minister is perusing that document, I simply say that I am asking whether there can be some joint consultation with the New South Wales State Government and appropriate local government people so that we do not get a sudden suppression of this sort of small business operation in big shopping complexes. The Minister is indicating that he approves of the extract from the Sydney Morning Herald being incorporated in Hansard-</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The article read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>HYATT KINGSGATE SALE REFLECTS LOCAL APATHY</PARA>
<PARA>By Hazel Pillemer, Property Reporter</PARA>
<PARA> The recently completed sale of the Hyatt Kingsgate hotel complex in Kings Cross to a Singapore-based company shows how overseas interests are more willing than Australians to take on the risks of hotel investment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hyatt Kingsgate is the third major hotel to be sold to overseas interests in the past year. </PARA>
<PARA> The hotel complex was sold on June 14 for $25 1/2m, but settlement only took place on December 22. </PARA>
<PARA> The complex was sold to Tesela Pty Ltd, a shell company-which is in the process of having its name changed to Kingsgate Investments Pty Limited-whose principals are wealthy real estate developers and investors Mr Ho Whye Chung and Mr Ho Sim Guan. </PARA>
<PARA> They are resident in Singapore but operate out of Hong Kong and have substantial property investments throughout South-East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA> This is believed to be their first Australian-and their first hotel-venture. </PARA>
<PARA> The property was formerly owned by Kingsgate Property Management Services Pty Limited, which was controlled by Tinnabruich Pty Limited, the State Superannuation Board, and Wardley Australia Limited. </PARA>
<PARA> Tinnabruich is an investment consortium which includes the Rothschild group and Australian and South African interests. </PARA>
<PARA> Wardley Australia Limited is the merchant banking arm in Australia of Wardley Limited, which is the merchant banking arm of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hyatt Kingsgate hotel complex was developed by the South African based Summit organisation which collapsed in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> It was then taken over by the various parties in a financial reconstruction. </PARA>
<PARA> The real estate agents and property consultants Jones Lang Wootton were responsible for introducing the purchasers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is understood that the $25 1/2m was sufficient to repay the various contributions made by the three vendor partners, but that there was no material profit made. </PARA>
<PARA> As such it appears that the hotel and the shopping arcade earned only enough to cover the carrying and other costs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is believed that the Foreign Investment Review Board required a sale of about 49 per cent of the equity in the hotel within 10 years to Australian interests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I return to my summing up. I simply seek a tripartite conference between the Federal Government, the State Government-in this case the New South Wales Government-and local government authorities to ensure that, whilst some foreign capital is necessary in many ways, it is not to be used as a steam-roller approach in the case of the Birkenhead Point shopping complex so that these shopkeepers go to the wall. Whilst there may be some value to the economy in the initial influx of capital, if 200 shopkeepers go to the wall they will add considerably to the unemployment statistics. On that basis I ask the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) to take up this matter urgently. Perhaps by the middle of next week we will be able to give some indication to these people of Birkenhead Point that their livelihoods are not on the block.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise tonight a matter which demonstrates the difficulties that can arise with too rigid an application of one section of the Social Services Act. I ask the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) to look into not only this case but also other cases which seem to bedevil the administration of social security in this country. The case to which I wish to refer involves a Tasmanian mother who has suffered unconscionably as a result of a very rigid approach by the Department of Social Security to her eligibility to a widow's pension. The woman, Mrs Ferguson, separated from her husband in 1956 and later divorced him. A year later she took in a male boarder who had been working for a relative and who had been living in less comfort and at much greater cost in a boarding house. At that time she valued the protection he gave to her. Later she fostered two of his children who had been under the care of the Social Welfare Department in Tasmania since his marriage had failed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have read the very lengthy file, which includes a sworn statement from Mrs Ferguson, correspondence from the Department of Social Security and the Australian Legal Aid Office and a very cogently argued case from Mr Michael Longbottom, her solicitor, from which I will quote later. I have seen nothing in all this material which presents Mrs Ferguson as anything other than a very caring woman, and one who, having been in trouble herself, understands only too well the value of stretching out the hand of help to people in need. At other times she has assisted another pensioner who had nowhere to go; she has offered to care for children who lost their homes in the 1967 Hobart bushfires. Once she looked after nine children belonging to a neighbour who had been in hospital. It would seem to me that her motivation has been charitable and Christian throughout. </PARA>

I understand that it is the subject of a formal appeal before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I have no wish to hinder Senator Grimes in any way. Given that the matter is before a tribunal of this sort, I just query whether the detail should be gone into. I have not looked at the authorities to see the extent to which one could consider the matter in the same way as one would consider a matter if it were before a court. I have absolutely no doubt about the bona fides of Senator Grimes in putting this matter before me and seeking my consideration of it. I merely raise this point because I have only just had a look at the facts-or such facts as are available to me at this stage. I ask him to consider the fact that the matter is before a tribunal.

A colleague of mine and I have consulted with Mrs Ferguson's solicitor, who knows of the procedure being followed here tonight. As I am not a lawyer, I do not know whether the sub judice rule-which I suppose is what the Minister is talking about-applies to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in this way. It seems to me that there are two problems in this case: Firstly, the lady is without support and it seems to us that the only support that she is likely to get in the meantime is from the Department of Social Security; and, secondly, appeals before this Tribunal are subject to delay and the appeal in question has been subjected to considerable delay.

I would be happy to examine that matter tomorrow morning and, on that basis, Senator Grimes might then wish to take the matter up again on the adjournment. I do not raise this out of a sense of technicality. As far as I am concerned, it is without precedent in the sense that I have not had to deal with a similar matter in the same way. I would be happy to give the matter urgent consideration in collaboration with Senator Grimes to see what is the most appropriate course.

Mrs Ferguson has, in fact, had a special benefit removed and refused. We are in a difficult situation if the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which was set up to assist people in circumstances like this and set up as a form of appeal, is going to be used in this way to prevent honourable senators from raising cases like this in the Senate on the adjournment or at any other time.</PARA></TALK.START>

I pay a tribute to two extremely kind and cheerful members of the farming community in South Gippsland in Victoria. The two men concerned are Mr Ken Price and Barry Dakin of Glen Forbes. I made their acquaintance on Monday afternoon last. The south Gippsland highway in Victoria was at a standstill. I was expected at a dinner in Melbourne. I attempted a detour through the lovely country of South Gippsland. I was a little too anxious to get home and not observant enough on a strange road. I went round a bend too wide and slipped over the edge of a steep drop.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A very kind passing motorist offered to find help and within minutes Mr Dakin and his tractor arrived and, at the same time, Mr Price pulled up. They did not even hesitate. They did not ask or consider whether it was their business to help me, whether they should do it or who I was. They came to help. Mr Price went off to get his large truck and because of the efforts of the two of them my car was back on the road ready and able to proceed within minutes. Neither of the men would accept any payment. They were both as courteous, as helpful and as cheerful as they could be. They were a tonic to meet. </PARA>
<PARA> When I offered to pay, Mr Barry Dakin said: 'Give the farmers a go in parliament instead'. I think the community generally can take a lesson from two such unselfish, cheerful and helpful people. I wanted to put my thanks on record. I will not forget their generosity. When the farmers' situation is brought before this House I will always remember the spirit with which they came to my assistance. From now on I will be even more conscious of the need to give the farmers a go. I have kept faith with my two farmers of South Gippsland. I am on record as saying I will give the farmers a go. </PARA>

I will refer briefly to Senator Melzer's very nice speech and to the tribute she has paid to Mr Dakin and Mr Price for the help they gave her earlier this week. I am reminded of an incident that occurred when I was at the Singleton Army Camp as a captain in the Citizen Military Forces. The weather at that time was very hot and as a medical officer I made a decision that there was an urgent need to inspect the local water supply which was the Hunter River. We tried to cross the Hunter River in a jeep at what was called a low level bridge. The only trouble was the bridge did not exist. We had a jeep in the middle of the Hunter River and we were not quite sure what to do. I must say that farmers can be very helpful when they bring their tractors down and pull vehicles and people out of tight spots. So I too can look on experiences like that. Of course, we did not have to report the incident to any officers because the jeep started straight away when it was pulled from the river.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 3 December 1980:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Did the judgment brought down in Redy v. Redy give the father custody of his children because they were residing with their mother in a refuge and this accommodation was deemed unsatisfactory by the Judge because of its temporary nature; if so, can the Minister assure women who are residing in refuges or who may wish to reside in refuges in the future that they will not lose custody of their children because of the obviously temporary nature of refuges.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having regard to s. 121 of the Family Law Act, which prevents the publication of details of proceedings under the Act, and the purpose of that section to protect the privacy of individuals, I do not propose to provide in this answer the case details sought by the question.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the second part of the question, the Family Law Act requires a court hearing proceedings for the custody or guardianship of, or access to, a child to regard the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration. In custody proceedings in which the mother of the child is temporarily resident in a refuge, the significance of this fact would depend upon the effect the court thought it had on the welfare of the child in all the circumstances of the particular case.</PARA>
