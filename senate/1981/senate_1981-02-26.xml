<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that the construction of a uranium enrichment plant in North Queensland and the mining of uranium on the Herveys Range area should not be proceeded with on the following grounds.</PARA>

<TITLE>Senate Elections: Abolition of Compulsory Preferential Voting</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That on the 10th December 1948, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted and proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which declares that, 'Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration. . . .' (Article 2) that 'Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives . . . The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or equivalent free voting procedures.' (Article 21 (1) and (3).)</PARA>
<PARA> Elections for Senators meet all requirements except one. Senators are elected periodically, by secret ballot, with universal franchise, and the quota-preferential method of proportional representation ensures that the vote values within states are equal as nearly as can be.</PARA>
<PARA> However the provision of the Electoral Act that compels voters to show preferences for ALL candidates on the ballot paper interferes with the free expression of the will of the voters, and is unjust.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia, as a Member State of the United Nations, is pledged to achieve observance of Human Rights and Freedoms.</PARA>
<PARA> We, the undersigned citizens of Australia, therefore humbly pray that the Senate will fulfil the pledge of a Member State of the United Nations and take steps to remove the compulsion from the Electoral Act in order to allow freedom of expression for everyone who has the right to vote for Senators.</PARA>

<TITLE>Plant Breeders' Rights</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> We, the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth, do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Note that legislation establishing plant breeders' rights in other countries has had serious adverse effects, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> a. Virtual monopoly control of seed production has passed into the hands of a few large international corporations seeking to profit from the exclusive rights over plant genetic materials created by such legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> b. The varieties of seeds available have been restricted mainly to hybrids which will not reproduce truly and will not grow without the aid of artificial fertilizers and pesticides, thus maximising corporate profits without regard for the interests of growers and consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> c. The genetic diversity of crops has been eroded, rendering them vulnerable to disease and other environmental threats.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Recognise that maintenance of the genetic diversity of plant varieties is crucial to the continued well-being of the Australian Nation, and take all necessary steps to preserve and promote such genetic diversity as a public resource and to prevent exclusive control over plant genetic materials from falling into private hands.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Defend the vital interests of Australian farmers and gardeners, independent Australian seed companies and their employees, and consumers of Australian farm and garden produce, by rejecting any proposal to legislate for the establishment of plant breeders' rights in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Finance to the question answered two days ago by Senator Chaney when he said that the children's services budget was overcommitted by $7m, that he was investigating and that as a result there would be considerable delays in the approval of new commitments. Has the Minister drawn the attention of her colleague to the proper practices that should be followed in such departmental accounting?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I recall the question raised, I think by Senator McLaren, with regard to the child care program. The two departments, the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Security, have been examining the child care program with regard to the funds which may be required in the Additional Estimates. There seems to be some confusion between what might be commitments and what might be expenditure. My Department is interested in expenditure under the program and I am advised that that is running fairly close to what would be assumed to be the expenditure at this time of the year. There are always forward commitments in the child care program. Indeed, it takes many years for many approvals finally to be operative and to provide the services to those for whom they are intended. So there is some discussion, I would assume, in the Department of Social Security with regard to its commitments under the program. There has been an examination with regard to expenditure, and I believe that is almost concluded. If there are re- quirements to maintain the centres necessitating additional expenditure in the Additional Estimates, that will be dealt with in the normal manner. As far as the future of the program is concerned, those commitments would need to be looked at before any new approvals could be considered, particularly in the forthcoming Budget context.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Prime Minister to an address given by Justice Elizabeth Evatt in the National Press Club on 24 September 1980 and, in particular, to her comments regarding the Royal Commission on Human Relationships. In view of Justice Evatt's comments on the time which has elapsed since the commissioners presented their report to the Governor-General, I ask the Minister: Firstly, why has there been no official response by the Government to the report of the Royal Commission on Human Relationships; and, secondly, what proposal has been made by the interdepartmental committee set up in 1978 to consider the report? Does the Minister agree that the matters dealt with in the report remain important issues for our society? Does the Minister also agree with Justice Evatt's claim that 'it is the concern of governments to develop effective social policies, not only because these may improve the quality of life, but also because Government and the community often have to deal with the consequences of the breakdown of relationships and the lack of proper social planning'? If so, will the Minister inform the Senate when we can expect to know which of the Royal Commission recommendations are accepted and which will be implemented?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Royal Commission on Human Relationships which was presented to the Government in 1977 dealt with a very wide range of issues which impact on today's society. The matters considered by the Royal Commission were complex. The recommendations relate to many areas which are the responsibility of the Commonwealth, of the States and, indeed, of individuals themselves. As honourable senators will know, some of the report's recommendations are considered to be controversial. In accordance with usual practice, the States' views were sought on the recommendations. Not all States have as yet responded. The Government has, of course, continued to be active in the broad areas of policy covered by the report. We have a record second to none in supporting the family and providing assistance for those most in need. Reports such as that of the Royal Commission and a wide range of other reports which the Government has commissioned are an important input in developing and furthering our policies in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>

Do the members of the Committee also complain that the Government's decision to curtail the inquiry prevented public examination of the submissions by Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia? Do these comments and others in the report tend to bear out the suspicion that the inquiry, begun as a pre-election promise, was ended to prevent exposure of the way in which Ansett Airlines is dictating aviation policy in this country?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand from the Minister for Primary Industry that there are no major problems associated with the eradication of bovine brucellosis. Some difficulties have been experienced in drought areas, but the overall effect on the program will be minor. The problem of residual low-level bovine tuberculosis infection in the more remote northern cattle properties continues and will continue until such time as all cattle can be mustered regularly for testing. The Minister advises me that the State and Northern Territory departments responsible for campaign operations all advise that properties under Aboriginal ownership pose no special problems and that co-operation has been equivalent to that on other properties. I think it is often misunderstood and thought that these properties are not subject to the normal requirements to which other properties are subject.

As well as looking at the activities and performance of government departments and statutory authorities, does the Committee intend scrutinising in any way the administrative arrangements of the Parliament?

If it has not I will direct his comments to the Prime Minister. I am aware that there is a lot of speculation about the Committee in the Press. That is inevitable with the work of any committee. Without attempting to be authoritative, I can say that basically the work of the Committee is to see whether revenue savings can be effected by bringing about a more sensible rationalisation of work done without in any way causing a deterioration in efficiency but, indeed, with improvements in efficiency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot answer authoritatively the question as to whether the Committee has any responsibility to make recommendations following its scrutinising of administrative arrangements.

Speaking as a member of the high-powered Estimates Committee C, I inform the Senate that we have been regaled with reports regarding the top level efficiency of our animal quarantine section. I do not disagree with that, but I wonder, in the light of the recent alarm about a suspected outbreak of foot and mouth disease in New Zealand, whether we should be satisfied that the operations of the animal quarantine section have been adequate and whether there are any limitations or faults due to a lack of early advice from the New Zealand Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If that is within the ambit of the question, I can advise that what happened recently indicates the seriousness with which the Government regards any suspected outbreak of a disease which could be of importance to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At 11.30 a.m. on 12 February reports of a suspected vesicular disease outbreak in New Zealand were confirmed with New Zealand veterinary authorities. They advised then that 28 pigs on an 850-animal piggery had displayed clinical signs of vesicular disease; the affected animals had been destroyed and samples had been sent for diagnosis to the world reference laboratory at Pirbright in the United Kingdom; the remaining animals were being destroyed and all appropriate disease control measures had been implemented. Immediate action was taken by Australian quarantine authorities to implement precautionary measures to prevent the possible spread of any disease to this country. I think that is the point which interested the honourable senator.</PARA>
<PARA> These measures included the following: An immediate halt to the importation of live animals other than cats and dogs and of all relevant animal products from New Zealand; an increase in passenger and baggage screening for incoming flights from New Zealand to the same level as for arrivals from foot and mouth disease countries; and the quarantining on arrival of all relevant animal products in transit between the two countries. In the event the ensuing tests were negative, and we were able to call off these procedures.</PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the procedures which are in place are quite complex. They are designed to protect this country, as far as we can, from the importation of any exotic diseases. If there are particular matters in relation to the procedures which the honourable senator still requires I will be glad to get them from the Minister.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; As Senator Knight stated in his question, there has been an announcement that a gulf co-operation council is to be established. The Minister for Foreign Affairs advises that this council is to promote co-ordination and co-operation in economic, social, cultural and other matters. The Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister said that it had been agreed to establish a secretariat and that a regular program of high level meetings had been formulated. He said that security had not been discussed at the meeting of 4 February and that it would be only one of a large number of possible fields for co-operation. Areas for co-operation which have been mentioned as prospects for early discussion include standardisation of educational qualifications and an avoidance of duplicating economic efforts. Details of a regular schedule of meetings are to be worked out at a meeting on 8 March.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All I am saying is that I have not seen the newspaper but I know of the story. I remind the honourable senator that on 31 July 1980 Mr Everingham sought funds from the Commonwealth totalling $120m over five years for a program of improvements to environmental health facilities at Aboriginal communities and later he put forward a revised estimate of $154.1m as the amount he would need. The Chief Minister's main arguments to support the requests were twofold: Firstly, that improvements to environmental health in Aboriginal communities were sorely needed and, secondly, that when the Commonwealth transferred responsibility to the Northern Territory Government the Commonwealth offered insufficient ongoing finance to meet the backlog in environmental health needs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree that Aboriginal needs are substantial and acute. The Commonwealth has already made a commitment of $50m over five years to help improve environmental health, and that is a practical example of the Commonwealth's commitment to do more in this area. I do not agree that the Northern Territory is being poorly treated financially or that it is necessary for it to make the request it has made. The relatively high per capita costs of providing services to Aboriginals were taken into account and were reflected in the level of general purpose funding agreed to at the time of self-government. Despite the transfer to the Northern Territory of financial responsibility for several major programs and although the Northern Territory contains only 15 per cent of the total Aboriginal population of Australia, 24 per cent of the grants made available by my Department in 1980-81 were made to the Northern Territory Government, and the Aboriginal organisations in the Northern Territory will receive that money. I am saying that a small percentage of the Aboriginal population got a larger percentage of the grants because of special need. I suppose the answer is that whilst we sympathise with Mr Everingham we ask him to look to his own set of priorities within his own budgeting to determine how he spends States grants money.</PARA>

I refer to a report that there is employment discrimination in Australian universities in that half of all academics holding the position of lecturer or above either are foreign born or have overseas qualifications, that discrimination against women, Australian or not, is even greater and that the proportion of women academics ranges from less than 7 per cent at the University of Tasmania to 24 per cent at Macquarie University. I ask: Will the Government consider introducing detailed regulations to control the percentages of Australians in general and women in particular who must be given academic appointments in Australian universities in an endeavour to give academics some feeling of the sorts of constrictions which have been imposed on Australian industry and enterprise by a free-ranging bureaucracy, or will the Government leave it to the good sense of the universities to determine their own appointments?

I accept that he has a basic source for those figures and I would be very interested if he would let me have them. Of course I will direct the whole substance of his question to the Minister for Education whose direct responsibility this matter is. In general the Government and governments of all political faiths have accepted that universities and colleges should be autonomous in the discharge of their functions, specifically in order to give them what is called academic freedom. The appointment of academics to their staffs would, I think, be regarded as such. Nevertheless, if there is an apparent discrimination there are various ways in which that can be, firstly, exposed and, secondly, rectified while maintaining that academic freedom. For example, the matter could be drawn to the attention of the Tertiary Education Commission which is a statutory body and which, if it were to study the matter, might wish to draw attention to it or to make comment to the individual institutions on that basis. So there are a number of ways in which a government could act, assuming it thought it meritorious to do so. But, as it is basically a matter for the Minister for Education, I will make sure that Mr Fife peruses the question and gives consideration to it.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Intelsat IV international communications satellite is being used to bring programs to 52 of these remote communities. The remainder will receive programs relayed by more conventional terrestial microwave links. Where Intelsat IV is used areas are served by programs originating in either Perth or Sydney ABC studios. Remote locations in Western Australia receiving satellite-fed programs will receive ABC programs from Perth.

I am therefore unable to answer the question as to why certain States should have a higher prison population than other States. I am aware that in all States there is an over-representation of Aboriginals in the prison population. They are over-represented according to their representation in the general population. Since I am aware that that situation exists across Australia I imagine that that is not the entire answer for the differences which the honourable senator may have observed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can provide some information in answer to Senator Hamer's question although I will have to refer other aspects of it to the Minister for Defence. It is a fact that investigations are under way for a site in north-western Australia suitable for development as a patrol boat base should one be required in the area. The Government initiated negotiations with the Western Australian Government in 1979 to identify such a site. A working group is carrying out further study to examine the current suitability of various sites. For obvious reasons I do not think that I should identify them.</PARA></TALK.START>

Further to the matters already undertaken to be referred to the Minister, I ask: Firstly, is not the Government clearly in a position forthrightly to deny the alleged discrimination against Australians and against women? Rather, is it not true that universities can, should and do appoint the best people available for the work to be done and that this is increasingly meaning that more Australians and more women in recent years are being appointed?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With regard to the last part of the honourable senator's question I repeat that the Government is very conscious of the need to preserve academic freedom and that all those matters which impinge upon the right to academic freedom are very rightly those of the senates or councils of the institutions concerned. The Government has been absolutely meticulous in this regard. When Senator Lewis asked his question I was not in any position to test whether the figures that he supplied were accurate. Let me simply say that as a former Minister for Education they somewhat surprised me but I was not in a position to affirm or deny them.</PARA></TALK.START>

Honourable senators will be relieved to know that things are proceeding in a very positive and helpful manner in that area.

<PARA> I am advised that the fungi cause dieback at the cane tips and reduce seed formation and allow other vegetation to invade thickets. This work has been going on since 1977 and is being carried out at the CSIRO laboratory in France where a suitable strain of fungi is being tested for effectiveness as well as specificity to blackberry. Recent reports suggest that several useful strains have been selected. Mr President, I find at this late point that this matter is actually the responsibility of the Minister for Science and Technology.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicated to Senator Bishop earlier today that I might be able to get some information on the question of the charging of fees by nursing home proprietors when patients are absent. There is some information which I can give to the honourable senator. Commonwealth nursing home benefits are not payable during a patient's absence from a nursing home. That policy was announced in 1973 by the then Minister for Social Security, Mr Hayden, and has continued to apply. All proprietors were made aware of the policy in 1973 and again in 1977.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since 1973 proprietors have been able to charge a bed retention fee during a patient's absence from a nursing home where the patient requests that the bed be retained. The fee is determined by the proprietor but is not allowed to exceed the approved day fee. Proprietors are held responsible for advising a patient of the fee if he or she wishes to have the bed retained.</PARA>
<PARA> Representations have been received from a number of patients, both insured and uninsured, who have been asked by proprietors to repay amounts which the proprietor incorrectly claimed as Commonwealth and fund benefits in respect of periods when the patient was absent from the nursing home. I think this is the area where some of the trouble has arisen. It would appear from the number of days and amounts involved that the patients may not have been advised by the proprietor that benefits were not payable during periods of absence. The amounts of Commonwealth benefit involved have been recovered. Recovery of fund benefits is a matter between the proprietor and the fund.</PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of matters of concern here, including the position of nursing home patients who may be required to enter a public hospital, say, for treatment of an acute illness. In view of all these matters the Department of Health is reviewing the position with a view to setting out a number of options for ministerial considerations.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This is perhaps an appropriate time to take stock of the way in which this Government has effectively withdrawn funding from much needed projects in the areas of urban and regional development. The sharp decline of support by the Federal Government for urban and regional development is one indicator of the difficulties being faced in country areas, and particularly in areas at the forefront of the resources boom, as was mentioned yesterday during the matter of public importance debate in the Senate. It is instructive to measure the way in which this Government has retreated from the area of funding and the provision of financial assistance generally to places such as Albury-Wodonga. </PARA>
<PARA> At constant prices, Federal expenditure on urban and regional development in 1974-75 was $205m; this year it is just $65m. Expenditure on decentralisation assistance has been cut by 70 per cent. This year's allocation is down 16 per cent on 1979-80. Of the money spent on decentralisation, figures for housing, which is one of the areas of most concern in regional centres, confirm this trend. In real terms, Federal spending on housing this financial year is one-third of the amount allocated six years ago, in spite of a burgeoning housing problem. Real net payments to the States for housing have fallen from $515m in 1974-75 to $76m in the current year. Victoria, for instance, is receiving now only one-seventh of the amount it was allocated seven years ago. These are brief examples of the way in which regional areas have been deprived by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate, while we are alluding to the Albury-Wodonga growth area, to reflect on the shoddy way in which this Government broke all its promises about another growth centre, that is, the growth centre of Bathurst-Orange. Initially Bathurst-Orange was the brainchild of the New South Wales Country Party. However, the Whitlam Government accepted that it warranted Federal assistance and during the 1975 election campaign members of this Government indicated that this assistance would continue. This promise became just one of a long list of undertakings that were promptly broken when this Government took office. Virtually since 1976 Bathurst-Orange which is in the large Federal electorate of Calare, has been carried solely by the New South Wales Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Country people are entitled to look soberly at matters such as broken promises about growth centres, decentralisation, which has always been strong in conservative rhetoric in this country, and urban and regional development. Country people cannot be blamed for concluding that this Government has no interest in breaking down the inequalities that exist and flourish in country areas as compared with the cities. It is encouraging to note, however, that in connection with Albury-Wodonga steady growth is still taking place. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, as you will be aware, the Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations has been taking a particular interest in the affairs of the Australian Wheat Board since the late presentation of the Board's 1977 financial statements. The Senate referred to this Committee the Board's 1978 interim annual report on 13 September 1979. Since then the Committee has reported on several occasions to the Senate on the situation in relation to the Wheat Board's financial statements. The Board's financial statements have been consistently late in their presentation to the Parliament and the statements for 1977 and 1978 were heavily qualified by the Auditor-General who concluded that the statements were not based on proper accounts and records and did not show fairly the financial transactions of the Board for those years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 23 February 1981 I was informed that the Board's financial statements for 1979 had been provided to the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon). The statements have been tabled in both Houses. The Committee will now examine these statements. I informed the Senate on 5 December 1980 that we proposed to meet again with representatives of the Board to obtain information about the changes which have now been made to their accounting systems and management structure and those which are planned to be implemented later. The Committee will be better informed to do this after a perusal of the 1979 statements and discussions with the Board's representatives. I will continue to keep the Senate informed of developments. </PARA>
<PARA> I take the opportunity also to refer to the fact that there is another late report, the report in relation to the Canberra College of Advanced Education about which the Committee has previously reported to the Senate and I therefore do not wish to say anything further about that at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to make only a very brief statement. I have read through the report which makes it evident that the development of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is at a formative stage, and this leads me to float an idea for consideration which could make the Great Barrier Reef a more valuable and significant tourist attraction in world terms, a revenue earner of great potential for Australia and an asset of some value to our own people. In a number of visits to the reef area I have been struck by the lack of a suitable underwater facility of suitable potential for viewing the authentic reef. There are underwater observatories at Hook Island and Green Island, and perhaps elsewhere. I do not denigrate the efforts of private enterprise in establishing those observatories but it is a fact that many overseas visitors to the area are disappointed with them. I recall a conversation I had at Shute Harbour with a group of American tourists who were quite acid in their comments. They said: 'We came here to see your reef and we could not see it at all. We are not going to recommend that anybody else ever come here'. I suggest that that is a bad situation. </PARA>
<PARA> These facilities do not really meet the expectations of people who come all this way to see the reef. That is what they want to do-see the reef. These present facilities are less than adequate because the cost of creating a really good facility in a suitable place which would disturb the environment as little as possible and which would provide really comprehensive viewing would be very expensive and certainly run into many millions of dollars. However, I would forecast that its appeal over the years would be so great that it would prove to be an excellent investment for this country from a money point of view alone. Beyond that, it would seem appropriate that Australia should be planning a permanent asset of great national significance for the 1988 Bicentenary which will outlast the dancing and the fireworks. I do not really see the new and permanent Parliament House in that light. The really important tourist potential of Australia in world terms, the thing that everybody knows is in Australia, apart from kangaroos, is the Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that we have a certain duty to develop it discreetly so that people can come to it from all over the world and genuinely appreciate it. I have spoken to some of the people in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority about this proposal and, generally, they see nothing against it. They make the point that if we want to see the reef properly we really need a viewing area at three levels. Perhaps we could have the viewing area built down the side of a bank so that we could see the reef at three separate levels, not just from the surface. We need a concrete structure of a very permanent nature, inconspicuous from sea level, taking genuine account of minimum disturbance of the environment and offering room for many people to have a wide range of viewing. I believe this would attract people from all over the world. I merely wanted to make that point. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This report is otherwise known as the Jamison report. The Commission of Inquiry was set up by State and Federal governments as a means of bringing some rationality into the funding and functioning of the hospital systems in Australia. As such, one cannot complain about the introduction of such an important inquiry. My first point is that the report has been tabled in this Parliament after having been widely discussed in the Press and by interested parties in the medical profession, the hospital business and the paramedical professions in this country. It was clearly leaked to the Press before the Opposition or anyone else in the Parliament had access to it. It was obviously made available to a selected and privileged group of interested parties as was evidenced by their detailed statements and comments on this report when the first Press reports appeared. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the comment on this report as I have on other reports presented in this Parliament that only after these Press reports and after Opposition protests were made were copies made available to members of this Parliament, particularly back bench members on either side. We have seen this practice with many important reports such as this one, the glaring example being the report of the Royal Commission on Human Relationships which was spoken about this morning. It is a discourteous practice. It makes a travesty of the parliamentary system and, quite frankly, it makes those of us on this side of the chamber consider whether we should have any regard for the conventions and regulations of parliamentary procedure when it seems that the Government considers that it can disregard these conventions, regulations and procedures at will. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an important report because what we all need and seek in this country, I believe, is a national health scheme and, specifically in this case, a national hospitals policy, a policy which provides hospital care, which is accessible to those who need it and which provides a wide range of services for those who are ill when and where they are ill. Of course, economy and containment of hospital costs are important but not of such importance that they should interfere with these principles and not to the exclusion of needs of individuals in this community. We will achieve such a policy only if we rationally look at the system and in this regard the report is significant.</PARA>
<PARA> The commissioners certainly had limited terms of reference. They certainly had a limited time to look at such a vast area. But one can breathe a sigh of relief that nowhere in the report do they indulge in the nonsensical and inaccurate rhetoric that we hear from some Government members and some medical professionals in this country stating that the introduction of Medibank was the cause of the rapidly increasing health costs in this country. It is worth while pointing out, I believe, that health costs and hospital costs were a concern of governments in this country in the late 1960s and that the then Mr John Gorton, the Liberal-National Country Party Prime Minister of this country, instituted the Nimmo inquiry because at that time, in 1968, there was considerable concern about increasing health costs. That inquiry was the basis of future planning from then until now. That inquiry was the inquiry which pointed out the health problems and the problems facing hospitals in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also a fact that the most rapid period of increase in health costs in this country preceded the introduction of Medibank in July 1975. To blame Medibank and to blame a universal health insurance scheme or the hospital schemes which are associated with it, for such increases is nonsense. The fact that this report does not indulge in that sort of nonsense is, at least, a help to us all, I believe, in taking a rational look at the system. The report, in volume 1 on page 47, draws attention to the present situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent changes to the health insurance system have done little to improve the health system. </PARA>
<PARA>One would have thought that this was a masterly understatement of the situation which has occurred as a result of the annual and, sometimes, biannual changes to the health insurance system which have occurred since December 1975. As the Opposition's health spokesman in the Senate I have had to debate repeated amendments to the legislation which have made contradictory and confusing changes to the system. The only people who have suffered have been the patients in the community, particularly the poor and patients on low incomes in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, however, in the view of the Opposition and in the view of some of those people involved in health planning and health delivery in this country, the report does not give a satisfactory blueprint for the future. Like so many reports of this type, it raises as many questions as answers. But the danger in such reports lies in the fact that the Government, in its zeal for cost cutting, may selectively pick out those proposals which result in reduction in government expenditure and ignore concurrent recommendations which would, in fact, improve hospital and health care in the community. The Australian Medical Association for instance, through its spokesman, Dr Lionel Wilson, has described the report as lacking a coherent plan. The Australian Hospitals Association has been disturbed at what it sees as a lack of a consistent theme in the report. But one theme in the report, and a theme which I may add is common to other reports in the health and welfare field in this country which have been presented to this Parliament, is the need for rational planning. An associated theme which runs through the report is the reason for the difficulties which face us in planning a rational health and hospital system. First of all, planning is hampered, as it is throughout the health and welfare field, by a lack of information, by a deplorable lack of statistics which we can use for planning building, for planning facilities, for developing the manpower necessary, and by a lack of statistics and a lack of information which makes even the distribution of available funds under the present system a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The AMA echoed the sentiments of the report. Dr Wilson stated:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no rational information system allowing meaningful comparisons of the efficiency and effectiveness of health care delivery in the various States. Without such a system allocation of money will continue to be arbitrary. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the problem: Allocation of funds in this very large area of government expenditure is arbitrary. It can be nothing else but arbitrary because of the lack of statistics and the lack of knowledge which we have of the system that we are allegedly trying to set up and control. Therefore, we can only welcome the report's call for the need for the proper collection of statistics and the proper assessment and collection of information in general. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we must also, because of the difficulties faced in planning, be wary of recommendations which call for radical changes to the training of personnel where a long lead time is involved. Many of us are aware that, as a result of cuts in nurses' training some four or five years ago because of what seemed to be a gross oversupply, in some States we now have a shortage of nurses. Many of us in this place-I believe I expressed it in this place some four or five years ago-have expressed the concern of a number of cardiac surgeons and cardiac units in this country who suggested that if we proceeded the way we were we would have an oversupply. As a result of one new procedure developed recently we now have, certainly in Victoria, a shortage of cardiac surgeons and patients are suffering as a result. Similarly, an uncritical acceptance of the present harsh immigration restrictions on doctors may be rational so far as most Australians are concerned, but it will not be welcomed by isolated areas which are largely dependent on immigrant doctors. The Australian Hospitals Association and the report itself point out the difficulties because of restrictions on the number of doctors in training. These recommendations are based on, what is, at the least, dubious evidence and, at times, non-existent evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Some recommendations of the report are contradictory and at times, I must say, surprising. There is a general theme throughout the report encouraging patients into private insurance and private medicine which we do not believe is desirable. We can find no evidence to back such recommendations in the report. At the same time, however, the report recommends the cessation of private practice by salaried practitioners. It makes the welcome, but surprising, recommendation 139. This states:</PARA>
<PARA> Consideration be given to the wisdom of continuing to use subsidised privately owned for profit organisations for the care of the aged, or mentally and/or physically handicapped people. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a practice which has been questioned by Opposition members for many, many years. It is a recommendation, which I must say, stands in isolation to other recommendations in the report. One wonders how the inquiry made the other recommendations when this recommendation is quite contrary to the usual run. The report recommends also means to prop up private funds and private hospitals. But, as my colleague in another place, Dr Blewett, has pointed out, while the report recognises that public bed numbers have been held in recent years-in fact, in some hospitals, public bed numbers have been reduced-at the same time, private bed numbers, being not controlled, have increased. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many, particularly in recent years, have been owned by multinationals. As a result of this uncontrolled increase, there are empty private beds. The Jamison solution to this problem is to introduce subsidies and incentives to fill these private beds. In other words, we will use public funds to cover the planning mistakes of private enterprises and, as Senator Chipp says, frequently enterprises which are not Australian and frequently enterprises which are, in fact, fronts for organisations whose main aim is to sell hospital equipment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe it is difficult to come to grips with the Jamison report because of its inconsistencies and, in some cases, its vagueness on some of the important issues. On the positive side, it certainly gives a clear recognition of the Commonwealth's responsibilities for funding, for monitoring and for the setting of standards in some areas. As I said before, we welcome the omission of the expected recommendation which was widely touted in the Press that public hospital beds should be means tested. Of course, this may be because of the apparent refusal of State health Ministers to reintroduce such means testing. Such an arrangement would call into status the question of a wide range of benefits outside the health area and would cause great difficulties in administration. </PARA>
<PARA> The report, at one stage, suggests a new way of collecting money for patients in public hospitals, that of taxing the underlying benefits which people receive in kind. We oppose this as, I believe, most people in the community do, on the grounds that such taxing, of course, would be inequitable, would disadvantage the ill and would advantage tax avoiders, but it would also be an administrative nightmare, as the report admits. It is also one of the many proposals that are designed to force people back into the private health insurance funds. Other proposals are designed to do this too. Recommendation 22 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Payment of medical benefits be limited to the insured. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 23 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The uninsured to be able to obtain Commonwealth benefits by contributing for those benefits in relation to medical and hospital costs only . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 29 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Health insurance premiums be structured so as to allow a discount for those who take both forms of cover . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 30 states:</PARA>
<PARA> A charge be raised for non-urgent outpatient attendances. </PARA>
<PARA>Some of the proposals have been designed to benefit both the private funds and the private hospitals. Recommendation 50, for example, advocates additional direct bed-day subsidies to be paid on a confidential basis on direct claims from the hospitals. This is a procedure in which I would have little or no confidence at all. Recommendation 51 advocates the right to admit pensioners and veterans to private hospitals at private hospital prices, which is an expensive way of treating people who are adequately treated now in the public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> We support some recommendations of the report namely those we believe would result in real savings. We support the recommendation to phase out the right of private practice for salaried specialists and the surprising recommendation questioning the wisdom of continuing to use public funds to subsidise privately-owned profit-making homes for the aged and handicapped, et cetera. Many recommendations deal with accountability, accreditation and improvement in hospital efficiency. Some will cost money in the short term; many of them will have long term beneficial effects. There are many recommendations on cost sharing and funding allocations to the States which are just too inexact and too complicated for anyone to argue without a careful discussion with the States and careful consideration of the long term effects. </PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned that the whole direction of the report is to force people back into private funds. Although the report states that provision must be made for the disadvantaged in a way which is easily understood, this is contradicted in other recommendations such as the recommendation that benefits go only to the insured, the proposal to tax benefits in kind and the proposal that increased charges be levied for out-patients. These would put people in specifically low income families in financial hardship by making private fund membership almost compulsory. There is no definition of disadvantaged, there is no elaboration of safeguards in such a system, which I suggest is a considerable omission. I believe we need a national approach. We need equality of opportunity and access to hospitals for all Australians. We need funding based on the ability to pay; that is a system I believe that is probably best funded from taxation or a levy on taxation. We do not need a rigid centralised system obsessed with economic factors. We do not need to be guided by the special pleading of specialist medical groups, private funds or hospital proprietors, be they Australian or multinationals, whose interests are not necessarily those of the patients or those of the public. We need information and, on that basis, we need proper planning. The Jamison report does not give us the answers we need, but that is not all the fault of the commissioners. In future we must be sure that they have proper terms of reference and that they have the information they need to make decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, what we certainly do not need is the erratic, incoherent policy changes of previous years. I fear that in view of the events of previous years this will be much too much to expect. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I listened with great interest to the remarks of Senator Grimes and essentially I agree with most of them. I compliment him on putting such a critique together with little time and with little preparatory debate. I make the simple plea for either the Whips or the leaders of the parties in this place to get together and agree on a more sensible way of arguing business in the Senate. For the three days and nights of this week we are engaged in arguing the Address-in-Reply. The Address-in-Reply debate is important. Honourable senators have the opportunity of speaking on any subject they choose. But I would have thought that that debate would pale into insignificance when compared with two of the papers tabled this morning-items 12 and 13 on the circulated list. As Senator Grimes has mentioned, this will probably be the only opportunity the Senate will have to debate the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals. This report is incredibly significant to the whole health scheme. Its recommendations if implemented will cost taxpayers billions of dollars over the next three years. They will affect the health of human beings, particularly those on lower incomes and pensions. Yet, what attention do we give to it? We have allowed one speech, albeit a good one, by Senator Grimes. Only a few honourable senators get the call to speak on the presentation of papers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other important paper is item 13, which is the report of the Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares. This covers a matter about which a committee has gone out of its way to castigate a government department, castigate a bureau and deeply criticise Ansett Airlines of Australia. This report also is submerged in a list of papers that is brought before us this morning and there will probably be only a very desultory debate on it. These two items are mixed up with earth shattering affairs such as the 1979-80 report of the Australian Honey Board. No doubt that is a very important document to bees in this country and to apiarists and one or two others, but it is hardly in the same league as the two that I have mentioned. Also on the list are 1979-80 reports of the Canberra College of Advanced Education and the Australian Egg Board. </PARA>
<PARA> For goodness sake, this is not the way the Senate should be debating such important issues. I am mildly critical of my friend, Senator Button, and Senator Carrick and the Whips for not organising the business paper of the Senate in such a way as to enable the Senate to have a reasonable, sensible, sensitive debate on the two very important items I have mentioned. I plead with those people I have mentioned, people of good will who have the interests of the Senate at heart. In future they should devise a better system so that incred- ibly important matters can be debated properly in this chamber and not submerged with matters as earth shattering as the 1979 report of the Australian Honey Board. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-As a Government back bencher I am somewhat sympathetic to those remarks of Senator Chipp which noted the very high importance of the report of the Jamison Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals that has been tabled in the Senate. I note the remarks of Senator Grimes in responding on behalf of the Opposition to the tabling of the report. I am also quick to acknowledge, despite Senator Chipp's remarks, that the report has been exercising the minds of honourable senators and members in this Parliament in their discussions and in their party groups for hours, days and weeks. This consideration will eventually lead to the Government responding to the Jamison report and to a parliamentary debate in this chamber and in the other place on the Government's response to the Jamison report. To the extent that Senator Chipp says that this is one of the most significant reports to be tabled here this year, it does seem inadequate that a full debate does not take place when the report is presented. I believe it is proper that the debate should take place when the Government responds to the Jamison report, when we have before us a distinct package of proposals to be implemented by way of legislation or in other ways. With all due respect to Senator Chipp and the Australian Democrats, I believe that Senator Chipp's remarks are an indication of the lesser ability of a small party to come to grips with a major report which will lead to government action. I do not know how much time can be spent by two members in one party to come to terms with a massive report which needs responsible government action and a responsible Opposition response. I believe that this reveals the inevitable inadequacy of a minority party which is unable to cope with a report of the dimensions of the Jamison report. I believe that debate on this report is best made at the time of the Government's response to it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I do not want to speak to the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals but to discuss some of the matters that have been raised in this debate. I think Senator Chipp, even though a member of a small party, has a full right to give the report long and serious debate if he so desires. He has the same right as any other honourable senator. He has complained that the opportunity is not available for him to discuss the report. He suggests that the leaders of the parties represented in the Senate should get together and work out some plan. I am opposed to parties being run by individuals whether they be party leaders or anyone else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the Senate Standing Orders Committee should try to regulate and develop some system. The Committees should obtain the opinion of the Senate and write it into the Standing Orders. In that way any plan would not be the responsibility of any individual but would result from Senate formulation. I think all honourable senators would agree that the Jamison report needs a great deal of discussion. It needs so much discussion that one honourable senator or one small party cannot handle all the issues. This fact shows the vital importance of the report. I think we should be given time to examine it. Senator Grimes sought leave to continue his remarks which means that this matter is placed on the General Business section of the Notice Paper and comes up for discussion later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the point, Senator Chipp. The fact of the matter is that it will not come up for discussion because the Notice Paper is the burial ground of all reports which the Government does not want discussed. This shows that the Senate is run by the Government. It should not be run by the Government; it should be run by honourable senators who are elected by the people. The Address-in-Reply debate, which gives honourable senators a chance to ventilate grievances, will be brought on later only because the Government has no General Business to place before the Senate. The Government says that we can carry on with that debate. The discussion could be stopped immediately if all honourable senators refused to speak on the Address-in-Reply debate. The question could then be put. But that does not suit all honourable senators. Even if one party agreed to support the move the other would not. It has been agreed that we go on with this useless Address-in-Reply debate because the Government has decided to prolong the debate for the sole purpose of allowing it to get ready to bring down some legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The whole process is controlled by the Government. It should not depend on the intelligence or the wit of the members of the Standing Orders Committee to look into the question of the grievances that have been ventilated. I think that more time should be given to items of General Business and that we have such discussions more often. Nothing in Standing Orders states that General Business can be discussed only on Thursday night. A motion is usually moved on Thursday night that General Business take precedence over Government Business. General Business could be discussed Tuesday or Wednesday morning if the majority of honourable senators were willing. We ought to have some method of evaluating these issues. Anything as important as hospital costs should be brought up for discussion at a convenient time when everyone has considered the relevant report. Such items should not be restricted to General Business debates which never come up anyway. The Senate should take the running of business out of the hands of the Government and should run this chamber as it was meant to be run. It is not a government institution. It is the task of elected senators to run the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Chipp has already adverted to the enormous issues of great importance and urgency which are contained in the heavy volumes of the report of the Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares chaired by Mr Holcroft. It is not, I think, competent for any party, whether big or small-unless it be composed of geniuses-to debate immediately the issues arising from the report. Some important issues of government arise from the report, and it is with those that I will deal very briefly. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators should be gravely dis- turbed at the course of events that has led to the early conclusion of this very important inquiry and to the tabling of the report. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is on record as saying that the Government has difficulty in getting competent, highly trained and qualified people to conduct inquiries of this kind on behalf of the Government. On this occasion the Government was able to persuade three men-two of them from the business community and one an academic-of great competence to devote their time to an exhaustive inquiry into domestic air fares in Australia. I refer to Mr Warwick Holcroft, chief executive of one of our largest companies, Dr Harold Bell of the AMP Society and Professor Warren Hogan of Sydney University. When honourable senators finally are able to read the report they will note-they will not have to read very much to pick up this-that Mr Holcroft, Dr Bell and Professor Hogan complained in the strongest terms at the way in which they have been treated by the Government. In a letter to the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) they stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We submit the Report of the Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares. We do so with considerable misgivings. It is a matter for regret that the decision of the Government taken on 26 November 1980 for this Inquiry to report on its investigations by 31 January 1981 caused us to cancel public hearings scheduled for Queensland, South Australia and Victoria and precluded further desirable public examination of the submissions of the two major domestic airlines. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for this Government's commitment to the notion of public inquiry and to the notion of receiving the views of the people and of the consumers. These are very strong words from the three members of the inquiry. Later in the letter they refer to the attitude of the Department of Transport and state:</PARA>
<PARA> As the Department of Transport is the regulatory authority for domestic air fares determination in Australia we also found it quite unhelpful that its submission was not received until 10 December, that is, some two weeks after the Government had already moved to curtail the Inquiry. This made it impracticable to examine the Department in public hearing. Nor was any written submission received from the Bureau of Transport Economics. </PARA>
<PARA>The members of the inquiry quite properly complained that on 9 September last year, while the inquiry was under way, they learned through the Press, the newspapers, that the Government was to negotiate a new 10-year two-airline agreement. This occurrence, say the members of the inquiry, caused them to feel 'misplaced'. That is the understatement of the century. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is perhaps putting too fine a point on it. In addition to all the other obvious capabilities and virtues of the members of this committee of inquiry, they are courteous in the extreme in describing themselves as feeling 'misplaced'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Briefly, the inquiry's report is a scathing condemnation of the Government's cavalier treatment of a subject that is of great seriousness for thousands and thousands of Australians. After the Government's treatment of this inquiry there can be no confidence that it will take seriously any of the recommendations made by the inquiry itself. One wonders whether that means that Ansett Airlines of Australia will continue to dictate airline policy in this country. I ask that by way of a rhetorical question to which I am not able to give an answer immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> There are very serious questions about the way in which the Government tolerates Ansett's involvement in non-airline activities and the extent to which that involvement affects the scale of domestic air fares in Australia. There are serious questions about the refusal to utilise 2,000 empty Qantas seats each week between Perth and the eastern States. Western Australians are being discriminated against not only in the failure to use this space capacity but also in the scale of fares between Perth and the east. We are entitled to know from the Government why it has effectively rubber stamped proposals for air fare increases in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some other important points which emerge from the report and which can be briefly raised. Why was the inquiry effectively pre-empted by the Minister for Transport in signing this new two-airline agreement before the inquiry which was designed to obtain the views of the travelling Australian public and of experts in relation to the operations of the airline industry in this country was completed? The inquiry was in fact wound up by the Government. Why was there such haste in the completion of the inquiry before there could be a proper public examination of the submissions by Ansett and Trans-Australia Airlines, the two major domestic airlines? How does the Government expect to coerce people with suitable qualifications-outstanding qualifications in this case-to take part in public inquiries after the treatment meted out to Mr Holcroft, Dr Bell and Professor Hogan? Furthermore, the most important question of all is: What action is to be taken by the Minister for Transport in relation to the conduct of the Department of Transport in the way in which it treated this inquiry? Of course, the ultimate question to be asked is: Does the Minister for Transport accept responsibility for the conduct of his Department, as he ought to do? I ask a question which has become ridiculous in the context of this Government: Does the Minister for Transport in this circumstance intend to follow the great Westminster tradition and resign because of the total failure of his Department to co-operate with an important inquiry of this kind? I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to make a few remarks in relation to the report of the Holcroft Committee of Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares, to direct attention to some matters which I believe are of very great significance to this chamber in a consideration of the likely impact of the recommendations which have been made, including some of the shortcomings forced upon the members of that inquiry as a result of the curtailment of the time and the effect of that, and to ask whether some consideration should not be given to a further inquiry so that some of the areas left undone can be covered. One of the principal factors which the inquiry discovered and which is no surprise to anybody familiar with the operation of transport in Australia and in other countries is that in relation to air transport, as in relation to ground and sea transport, forms of cross-subsidisation have been taking place. That is not novel, but it is something which the inquiry quite legitimately pointed out has been taking place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The inquiry raised the whole question of the fare formula and structure and asked whether they should be approached simply from the point of view of a direct cost for service or whether there is room for consideration of philosophies which relate to social welfare, such as concessions for pensions or for other sectors of the community. It raised the question of compensation to areas of Australia, including in particular Tasmania which is not provided with as much expenditure in relation to road and rail services. The inquiry asked whether there should be some compensation for that State in consideration of the only practical available means of transport to it for the largest percentage of the population. There are considerations of national development and whether some areas of Australia should not receive some form of cross-subsidisation in the interests of national development. There is the overall question of whether equalisation should apply and the extent to which it should apply. </PARA>
<PARA> We find that unfortunately there has been no full investigation of the cost structures of the airlines. There are suggestions that the cost structures of the major Australian domestic airlines do not compare favourably with those of similar airlines in other countries, particularly the United States. Whether or not that is a fact, it is something which I believe would be of greater significance for future domestic airline policy. It is unfortunate that the inquiry was not able to complete its investigation in that respect. At the moment we are without any real information as to the cost structures of the airlines and, therefore, as to the reasonableness or otherwise of the submissions which they make for fares and fare increases. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also confronted with debating a two-airline agreement which has been negotiated and signed when we have not at this stage before us a report from the Australian National Airlines Commission in relation to the operation of one of the two major domestic airlines. As in previous years, and through no fault of TAA itself, that report is very last in being presented to the Parliament. The annual report of TAA for the financial year ended 30 June last year is still not available. In previous years TAA's reports have been presented at any time between May and November of the year following the completion of the previous financial year, having made their way through the morass, it appears, of the Department of Transport and of the Executive Government. I emphasise that I say that not critically of TAA because I am informed, and believe, that TAA has been able to get its financial statements prepared and presented to the sections of government quite early after the completion of the financial year and certainly by October. It is unfortunate, when people are expected to consider questions to do with the operations of our domestic airlines, that information is either not available or is presented to the Parliament in a very tardy way. Many other matters could be referred to, but in taking up what Senator Button referred to in relation to the Holcroft inquiry I wanted to add those further matters at this stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I listened with interest to what Senator Rae has just said and was very disappointed that he did not join with Senator Button in condemning the Government on this extraordinary action because Senator Rae of all senators has been the senator who has stood out in criticising the Government for-and Senator Button has properly described them as such in this instance-cavalier actions of the worst kind. I find it quite extraordinary that Senator Rae and other Government senators are not similarly outraged at this action. I am a little surprised also that the Opposition in the House of Representatives has not already launched a censure motion of the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) because I would have thought that if ever there were prima facie grounds for a motion of censure on a Minister they exist in this circumstance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are prima facie grounds for censure on not only one aspect but two. If the Westminster system of responsibility still means anything in this place-and I doubt very much that it does-we have a Minister for Transport who could be accused or whose Department could be accused of either gross incompetence or gross disobedience of a Government's request in that the Department did not produce evidence for this committee in the time scale which would have allowed its evidence to be considered and cross-examined. The Minister must have known that. The Minister, if he is a competent Minister, must have asked his departmental head when the report was going to the committee. He must have received some answers. The fact is that the committee did not receive the information. But I would have thought that the second ground would have provided even stronger ground for censure of a Minister in that, as Senator Button said, either the Minister or the Government asked three highly capable, busy Australian citizens of some distinction to serve Australia on a very difficult, exhausting and exhaustive exercise, namely, inquiring into domestic air fares, yet those people learnt by reading in the Press or from Ansett Airlines of Australia the fact that in the course of the committee's inquiry an agreement had been signed for the next 10 years. I find it incomprehensible that a responsible Minister would allow such a situation to occur. The lack of courtesy is obvious. Under the Westminster system, however, lack of courtesy is not grounds for censure of a Minister. But surely to double-cross a committee which one has appointed with one's own hand is. As Senator Button said, it strikes at the very confidence that Australians of distinction will have in the committee system when they are asked to serve. I do not know that the Government recognises how high feeling is running in Western Australia over this issue. Senator Rae has referred to how high feeling is running in his State of Tasmania, and I can support him in that. The feeling in Western Australia is such among all political parties that agreement has been reached that Western Australians have been done a gross disservice by our current domestic airline system and that Ansett has been able to call the tune too often. I repeat that this is a matter on which I would like to have seen a full-scale debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have liked the committee to have examined a proposition which I put forward recently, namely, that there be an amalgamation of Qantas Airways Ltd and Trans-Australia Airlines. Surely it is an absurdity of museum proportions that a nation of 14.5 million people has two statutory corporations to run two separate airlines for the people-Qantas and TAA-both with their general managers and their hierarchy and each with a different maintenance section, a different catering section, a different publicity section, a different accounting section and a different pay section. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet Australia is running two government-owned airlines. But there has been no response to that suggestion that amalgamation be contemplated. It would appear that this committee will have its deliberations cut short. A two-airline agreement has been signed obviously without any reference to what this committee discovered or was about to recommend and without taking into account any suggestions about the amalgamation of TAA with Qantas which, God knows, needs some sort of help, if not in the form of amalgamation then in some other way in terms of its administration and industrial relations. That fact will be disregarded. I join other honourable senators in being critical of the Government and of the Minister for Transport in particular in this regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I do not go to the extent of supporting the extravagant criticism of the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) that the Opposition spokesman, Senator Button, and Senator Chipp have entered into today. Clearly, as the report was tabled only today there has not been sufficient opportunity to assess the immediate superficial judgments being made by some honourable senators on what appears to be in the report and the grave charge that has been made that the Minister for Transport should resign. So I will not enter into the debate on that question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, it has been clearly stated by those honourable senators who preceded me in taking note of this report, and in questions to Ministers put from both sides of the chamber today, that a prima facie case had been established that inadequate information was available to this very important inquiry that had been carried out and that public meetings were curtailed, not least in South Australia, and in other Australian capitals. It is also clear that submissions from the two major domestic airlines-Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans-Australia Airlines-were not able to be examined by this committee. While there are these inadequacies of information-and they appear to be clearly set out in the report-and insofar as this Senate is to make any decisions about the matters raised in the report, I believe it is competent for this Senate to conduct its own inquiry into these further matters. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, there is set up already a select committee on passenger fares between Tasmania and the mainland. Perhaps it would be competent for the terms of reference of that select committee to be widened or for another select committee of the Senate to take up matters which, on further consideration of the report, and I repeat that it was tabled only today, may be seen to be important for this Senate to be informed about. The question of whether such a reference from this Senate ought to be given to a number of us to inquire into the question of any inadequacies of information which have been alluded to in this debate today I think is a matter for us to take up in discussions in the coming days. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -by leave-I commend both the report of the Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares and the members of the committee. I believe what the members have achieved in a brief period is very commendable. As the report was tabled only yesterday there has been insufficient time to peruse it fully. I represent people from the outback who will find much of interest in the report. I regret that the time for taking evidence was curtailed because I know many people in the outback would have liked to have given evidence. However, I am very interested in the fact that the committee has looked at the flag-fall element and the cost-distance relationships. This aspect of the report can have a tremendous advantage to people of the Territory and of the outback of Western Australia who have felt that the cost structure of air fares is out of kilter with the cost of air fares in the eastern States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has always been the contention of many people that the flag-fall element of the cost in the air fare structure should be increased to bring about a situation in which the cost per kilometre could be reduced. This would give the people of the outback a much fairer go. I believe it could reduce air fares for those people who travel a very long distance. I should like further debate on this report at another time. I, along with other speakers, think the work on this aspect of the air fare inquiry has just commenced. The inquiry has done a very good job. I should like to see, at some time in the future, a similar inquiry which would continue to generate more debate and would provide more information for the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will apply to complaints in respect of members of the Australian Federal Police; its purpose, to use the words of the Law Reform Commission in its first report on complaints against police, 'is to establish a system which permits just and thorough investigation of complaints against police, while at the same time upholding morale and discipline in the difficult work police have to do'. Establishment of such a system is clearly one of the most effective ways of maintaining and improving good relations between members of the public and a police force and the respect in which that force is generally held. </PARA>
<PARA> In large measure, the Bill implements the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its supplementary report on complaints against police furnished in April 1978 at the request of Attorney-General Ellicott. Thus, the Bill recognises the need identified by the Commission for certain elements of independence in the receipt, handling, investigation and determination of complaints against police. The first of these elements is use of the Ombudsman as 'neutral territory' for the receipt of complaints, as the investigator of last resort and as public guardian to ensure that adequate and proper steps are taken in relation to complaints. The second element is establishment by statute of a special unit of the Police Force titled the 'Internal Investigation Division' with a specialised and independent function of investigating complaints by members of the public against police. Investigation of complaints against police will normally be carried out by this unit. I mention that a unit of this nature has already been established by the Commissioner by administrative action. The third element of independence will be the establishment of a police disciplinary tribunal whose president will be a judge to hear charges against police officers of breaches of the disciplinary code. However, as recommended by the Commission, criminal charges against police will continue to be dealt with in the ordinary criminal courts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill lays down detailed procedures for the handling of complaints against police directed to ensuring that any complaint is thoroughly and effectively investigated. I now describe these procedures:</PARA>
<PARA> A complaint by a member of the public as to police conduct may be made to a police officer or to the Ombudsman; where made to a police officer, the Ombudsman must be notified. </PARA>
<PARA> Complaints as to practices and procedures of the Force will ordinarily be investigated by the Ombudsman. </PARA>
<PARA> Other complaints as to the police, that is to say, complaints as to conduct of individual officers, will be investigated initially by the Internal Investigation Division previously mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Ombudsman is dissatisfied with the report of the Investigation Division on a complaint, he may ask for a further investigation by the Investigation Division or he may carry out an investigation by his own office.</PARA>
<PARA> In special circumstances, the Commissioner and the Ombudsman may agree that either the Ombudsman or a person outside the Investigation Division should make the initial investigation of a complaint; if the Ombudsman and the Commissioner cannot agree on this matter, the Minister shall decide. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister may, on his own initiative, establish a special inquiry into any matter relating to the Force. </PARA>
<PARA> After considering the report of the Investigation Division or the report of his own investigation, the Ombudsman may recommend that criminal or disciplinary charges should be brought against a member; if the Commissioner does not agree with the recommendation, the matter shall be referred to the Attorney-General, who shall decide what charges, if any, should be brought. </PARA>
<PARA> Criminal charges against a police officer will be brought in the ordinary courts; disciplinary charges originating from a complaint from a member of the public will be dealt with by the Federal Police Disciplinary Tribunal to be established under the legislation; other disciplinary charges will also be heard by the Tribunal if the member so requests or the Commissioner so determines. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal will be constituted by a judge of the Federal Court or Supreme Court of a State or Territory or magistrate or legal practitioner. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Tribunal is constituted by a judge, it will determine guilt and punishment. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Tribunal is not constituted by a judge, it will determine guilt and refer the question of punishment to the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be an appeal to the Tribunal constituted by a judge from a penalty imposed by the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General may appeal to the Tribunal from a decision of the Commissioner as to penalty on the grounds that the penalty imposed is inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be an appeal to the Federal Court on a question of law, which is defined to include a question whether there is sufficient evidence to justify a finding of fact. </PARA>
<PARA> A police officer may be required by a person proposing to complain to furnish his name and place of duty. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy President, on the details of the scheme, there were extensive consultations within Government and with the Ombudsman and the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. The Law Reform Commission proposals were made before the establishment of the Australian Federal Police and this development in itself made necessary some variation of the Commission's proposals. As a result of the consultations, the Bill incorporates a number of variations in detail from the Commission's recommendations. These variations will, in the Government's view, improve the general effectiveness of the proposed system while in no way detracting from the objectives identified by the Commission. Dealing with the first of these variations, the Commission contemplated that the Ombudsman would retain his existing jurisdiction under the Ombudsman Act 1976 in relation to the police force in parallel with the new jurisdiction to be given to him under the proposed legislation. The Government, however, concluded that such an arrangement could produce uncertainty and confusion and it would be preferable for the relevant provisions of the Ombudsman Act to be incorporated in the new legislation so that the Ombudsman's role in relation to complaints against police will be dealt with in the one Act. However, whilst the variations should produce greater convenience and certainty, the end result will be substantially the same as that intended by the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The second variation concerns the Commission's recommendation that the Ombudsman would be empowered to conduct his own investigations in certain limited cases. As I have explained, the Bill will empower the Ombudsman in all cases to conduct his own investigation if dissatisfied with the Investigation Division's report. Further, the Ombudsman will conduct the initial investigation when the complaint is as to the practices and procedures of the force. Additionally, in special cases, when the Ombudsman and Commissioner so agree or the Minister determines, the Ombudsman may conduct the initial investigation. Thus, in total result, the Ombudsman will be given an effective and meaningful role in investigation of complaints against police. Pending the introduction of legislation, the Commissioner and the Ombudsman have, by administrative steps, put into effect arrangements similar in effect to these provisions of the Bill and I understand that these arrangements are operating effectively and satisfactorily. </PARA>
<PARA> The next variation concerns the Commission's recommendation that 'in extreme circumstances' the Ombudsman should be in a position to ensure that a charge is laid against a police officer by making a formal recommendation to such effect. On consideration of this proposal, the Government concluded that a more effective arrangement would be to provide that, following an appropriate investigation, the Ombudsman may recommend to the Commissioner what charges, if any, should be laid against a police officer and confer with the Commissioner on this matter. Failing agreement between the Ombudsman and the Commissioner, the matter will be referred to the Attorney-General, who will decide what action, if any, should be taken as regards charging the police officer. A further variation concerns the Commission's recommendations that provision should be made for conciliation by the Ombudsman but not only by the Commissioner. The Government considered that it would be appropriate to provide for conciliation by the Commissioner as well as the Ombudsman, subject to appropriate safeguards such as notification to the Ombudsman, who may require the complaint to be investigated in spite of the Commissioner's conciliation action. </PARA>
<PARA> In dealing with the jurisdiction of the proposed Disciplinary Tribunal, the Commission recommended that the Tribunal should in all cases determine the penalty as well as the guilt of the defendant. Recognising the need for the Commissioner to be, and to be seen to be, the source of discipline within the force, the Government concluded, as I have explained, that the Tribunal, when constituted by other than a judge should determine only guilt, the penalty being remitted to the Commissioner for determination. However, when the Tribunal is constituted by a judge, the Bill provides that it should determine both guilt and penalty. Further, the Attorney-General may appeal to the Disciplinary Tribunal if he is of the opinion that the punishment imposed by the Commissioner is inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission recommended provision of a right of appeal to the Federal Court on questions of law from decisions of the Disciplinary Tribunal. The Bill makes it clear that this right of appeal extends to questions whether there is sufficient evidence to justify a finding of fact by the Tribunal. The final variation from the Commission's recommendations that I shall mention at this stage concerns the Commission's recommendations that the complainant might, with leave of the Tribunal, participate as a party in the hearing. Under the Bill, the complainant may be a witness in proceedings against the police officer and would participate in the proceedings in that capacity but, because the Government concluded that addition of a third party to disciplinary proceedings against a police officer would be an undesirable complication, more likely to create practical difficulties and extend hearing time than assist in the achieving of justice, it did not follow the Commission's recommendation that the complainant might be joined as a party. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill should be regarded as in no way a reflection on the Australian Federal Police or its members who, with the fewest possible exceptions, perform their difficult tasks with honesty, zeal and devotion to duty. However, for the reasons I have explained, it is necessary that an effective and just system of investigating complaints by members of the public against police officers should be established. This Bill will establish such a system and the minor variations from the Commission's proposals that I have indicated in no way detract from the great credit due to the Commission for its evolution of the basic concept on which this Bill is constructed. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill complements the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Bill 1981 in that it implements further important recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission in its supplementary report on complaints against police. The first was a recommendation for removal of the long-standing anomaly in relation to the vicarious responsibility of the Commonwealth for the acts of police officers. For many years the Commonwealth has been vicariously responsible for the wrongful acts of its officers, servants or agents but, except in the circumstances covered by the Commonwealth Motor Vehicles (Liability) Act 1959, the Commonwealth has not been so responsible for the acts of police officers in the course of their duties. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no sufficient reason why a police officer should, in this regard, be placed in a different position to that of any other officer of the Commonwealth. Accordingly, the Government was glad to accept the Commission's recommendation in this regard and the Bill will make the Commonwealth liable for civil wrongs committed by police officers in the performance of their duties. The result will be more satisfactory, not only from the point of view of the citizen claiming damages, but also the police officer in question. </PARA>
<PARA> The Law Reform Commission pointed out that absence of identification numbers in the dress of uniformed police reduced the capacity of a complainant to make a meaningful complaint. To remedy this, the Commission recommended imposition of a requirement for members of certain ranks of the police force to wear identification numbers. The Bill implements this recommendation. The Bill thus plays an important part in the general implementation of the recommendations of the Commission and I commend it to the Senate. </PARA>

I note that the Standing Orders Committee has made no specific recommendation in respect of this item so it appears that we will carry on in the way in which we have carried on in the past, particularly in 1980 when Government members gave to Ministers prepared questions which were passed on to the departments. The Ministers were then asked questions under the guise of questions without notice, taking up some considerable time of honourable senators on this side of the House. I have carried out some research, with the help of the Records Office staff, and have been able to obtain copies of some of these questions. I will refer to them this afternoon. I found that on 22 May of last year Senator Jessop raised a question in respect of the long running saga of the provision of television services to the west coast of South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry that my colleague got a little confused. He is looking at the Standing Orders Committee report. I am referring to the business sheet which is before us. We have before us a motion that we deal with Item 1, Question Time. I am directing my remarks to that item. On 22 May Senator Jessop raised a question which purported to be a question without notice but which was a question on notice-a Dorothy Dixer, as the saying is. It concerned the long running saga of the unfulfilled promises of the provision of television services for the west coast of South Australia. That saga reared its head in this place yesterday and again today. On 22 May when Senator Jessop asked a question about television for the west coast of South Australia the Minister conveniently had the reply off pat. After I asked that the document quoted from by the Minister be tabled I had a look at it and found on it the words 'Question without notice, Senator Jessop, television services to Eyre Peninsula'. The answer was all typed out. As I have said in this Parliament on many occasions when I have asked for a document to be tabled, Ministers cannot type the answer at the same time as they are giving it. That was conclusive proof on that occasion that Question Time was being aborted by members on the other side giving prearranged questions to the Minister involved and the Minister getting an answer from the department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 20 August 1980 Senator Walters used the same device and directed a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment. The answer was all typed out exactly as it appeared in the Hansard, as we on this side found out when we saw the paper, after it had been tabled, from which the Minister quoted. Again, on 10 September Senator Teague put a question to Senator Chaney. The position was the same. The question and the answer were all typed out on the same sheet of paper and the Minister was able to give a comprehensive answer to a member from his own side. Yet on many occasions when members on this side of the chamber have risen with questions which are of concern to both themselves and their constituents we have been unable to get answers or the Minister has waffled on and given us a lecture about something which is not connected with the questions at all. The Leader of the Government, Senator Carrick, often gives us a lecture on the ills that befell the country under the Whitlam Labor Government during the three years we were in office. A Minister may ask that the question be put on notice. Once a question goes on notice we might have to wait many months before we get a reply. My colleague, Senator McIntosh, showed me yesterday an answer to a question that he got and of which he had given notice nearly 12 months ago. He got the reply only yesterday whereas Government supporters can signify what they want to get an answer to, particularly if it has some political kudos in it, and an answer is given to them on the day they ask for it. </PARA>
<PARA> On 10 September when I asked Senator Chaney to table the document from which he quoted he said: 'I will think about it'. Later I rose when Senator Durack, I think it was, was giving an answer to raise a point of order under Standing Order 363 about the document I had asked to be tabled. Senator Chaney intervened and said: 'I will table it if Senator McLaren will give me a minute'. That document was then tabled. That is not the only such occasion. I have given only a few examples. I know that my colleague Senator Georges has risen on many occasions to request that a document quoted from by a Minister be tabled. So the proof is there, as Senator Georges pointed out in the speech he made during one altercation in this place over this very matter, that we on this side of the chamber are at a distinct disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a little disappointed that the Standing Orders Committee has not made a definite recommendation and an undertaking that it will rectify the Standing Orders so that Government supporters cannot take advantage of Question Time by having Ministers give answers to prepared questions to the disadvantage of members on the Opposition side. I hope in view of what I have revealed in this place that the Standing Orders Committee will be having another look at this matter before it brings in its next report. After all, we are elected to this place to do a job and neither side should get an unfair advantage over the other. I think we are all capable of looking after ourselves when it comes to a debate in this place. But members of the Opposition, as I have said, are put at a distinct disadvantage under this practice of giving typed questions to Ministers who send them off to the department concerned to get an answer. In respect of the question asked by Senator Teague, I note that typed on the bottom of the sheet of paper which was tabled were the words 'Postal and Telecommunications Department, Canberra, 10 December'. So that is where that answer came from. The question had been over to the Department for the answer to be prepared. </PARA>

He did put it on notice and it took him about 11 months to get an answer. If any members on this side of the chamber are doing what I am complaining about perhaps after they have listened to or read my speech today will have another think.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The rights of members I am very concerned with. Let me say that the one item on which I probably feel a little sympathy with the Committee is the one about the giving of notice of a question. I have listened to the nonsense which Senator McLaren has just been uttering. He has suggested that members on one side of the chamber are taking advantage of other members by giving some information to Ministers on some specifics about which a member wants an answer. It may concern an area on which one cannot expect the Minister to answer because, as he represents a Minister from another place, he is unlikely to be able to provide a sensible answer if he is not given some information beforehand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sentor McLaren-That is the very thing I was complaining about. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know you are complaining about it and I am praising it. We are completely at daggers drawn on this. I often give to Ministers some notice of the material that I want answered. It is not their Dorothy Dixer. No, it is a question I want answered because it is a subject on which I believe specific information should be made available to the public. For example, I asked a question this week in which there was a reference to a letter which had been written relating to some behaviour in Queensland. Of course I had given the Minister a copy of that letter before I asked the question. I did not want the Minister to tell me that he had not seen it. He probably would not otherwise have seen it. I wanted him to see it and to be specifically directing his mind to the question and to the problem that I had. In that way I got a responsive answer. Senator McLaren knows as well as I do that a number of sensible senators on his side of the chamber also have given information to Ministers on questions that they wanted answered. Senator Mulvihill is a noted and excellent example of that practice, particularly in the environmental field. Quite often he gets responsive answers from Ministers. The Ministers would not have had the information available if they had not been forewarned in some respect. So far as this item is concerned, I think the Standing Orders Committee is somewhat naive in its report in saying that informal information can be given. I do not know how far that comment is meant to go. Perhaps it means that a member may just whisper in a Minister's ear that a question will be asked on environment or something of that nature. That is not good enough. One has to be more specific than that. Senator McLaren has pointed out the folly of the course that he has pursued because he said that when a question is put on notice-and this may be true-it takes months and months before an answer is received.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have given him no notice. Perhaps he knows nothing about the matter. He might be representing someone else. Of course he then directs a senator to put the question on notice. If an honourable senator has the sense to give some foreknowledge of the area about which he is going to ask, he might receive an answer on a subject which has immediacy and public interest. The honourable senator might achieve some result from that procedure. I would suggest that of course the Standing Orders Committee is correct in not wanting to change the Standing Orders. Perhaps the Committee is a little naive in its reaction but, by and large, it is right because, in fact, surely we want Question Time to be much more informative. We want the Ministers who might have only a couple of portfolios but who might represent many other Ministers to be able to give information that is useful to the public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to sub-item (ii) of this report because that is the part about which I am particularly concerned. I am referring to item 1 (ii) which is headed 'Supplementary Questions on Deferred Answers'. This is a matter I raised and about which I wrote to the Standing Orders Committee. It concerns a Minister giving a further and perhaps informed answer at the end of Question Time. At that time one is not entitled to ask a supplementary question. The report suggests that honourable senators can ask supplementary questions by leave. Of course they can do it by leave if they can get leave or they can ask the question on a subsequent day. If, in fact, the material comes forward at the end of Question Time, we all know that the public interest, the Press interest and so forth, is in the statement that is made then. However, an honourable senator is not able to follow up the matter then. </PARA>
<PARA> If a somewhat considered answer is given by the Minister at the end of Question Time, an honourable senator is not in the same situation as he would be in if he asked that question and got an answer earlier in Question Time. Of course, he then could ask a supplementary question. Because the information is given at the end of Question Time, an honourable senator cannot ask a supplementary question. To my thinking that is absolute nonsense. Why should it matter when the answer is given or whether the Minister chooses not to answer the question in the first place but wants to check his facts and answer it later? Why should honourable senators be denied the opportunity of asking a supplementary question?</PARA>
<PARA> Supplementary questions are important in making this place intelligible and useful. They are important in enabling us to check the material and to point out the places where Ministers have not-whether by accident or by design-answered part of the question. It should be possible to do so. I regret to say that the Standing Orders Committee has passed up an opportunity. It states that one can ask for leave or one can ask the question on a subsequent day. It fails to recognise the value of being able to ask supplementary questions when the further information is given. I regret very much its answer to this matter. Therefore, I shall vote against noting this item. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall speak to item 1 (ii)-'Supplementary Questions on Deferred Answers'. I take up that item firstly because Senator Missen has put a case that honourable senators should be able to ask supplementary questions on deferred answers. However, I believe the report of the Senate Standing Orders Committee points to a way in which honourable senators can seek leave to ask a supplementary question. Possibly Senator Missen would like the automatic right of asking a supplementary question about an answer which has been deferred. However, leave would very seldom be refused in this place if an honourable senator were to seek leave to ask a supplementary question at that stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a further means of which an honourable senator may avail himself, and that is to seek leave to make a statement on the answer that was just given. He cannot do that during Question Time, but he can do that after Question Time is completed and Ministers are giving answers to questions asked previously. So really there is flexibility in that area. There is the ability of the honourable senator to have an added right and to take advantage of that right by seeking leave to make a statement on the answer. Perhaps that would be of even greater use than asking a supplementary question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know you can do that now and I would say that that would possibly be sufficient. However, I would agree with Senator Missen that if we could have an automatic right to ask a supplementary question to a deferred answer, that may be of some assistance. I would be prepared to support the idea if other honourable senators feel strongly about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer now to item 1 (i)-'Giving Notice of Questions'. We are considering a matter of degree. Senator McLaren has taken a view that it ought not to happen. Senator Missen says it is an advisable practice and that it is an advantage to the Minister to have some foreknowledge of the question. Generally speaking, Government members do give some indication to the Minister that they are going to ask a question. They might say: 'Look, I will be asking a question on Noonkanbah in some general terms'. I do not think there is anything wrong with Government senators saying that to the Minister, at least to free the Minister from the tensions of the unexpected. However, from the Opposition side it is not wise for any honourable senator to give prior notice to Ministers. The Opposition is not here to improve the performance of Ministers. The Opposition is here to seek to disadvantage, and often does disadvantage, a Minister and Ministers are aware of that. I do not think it is wise or desirable for honourable senators from the Opposition side to give prior notice even in the most general terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLaren has to be listened to when he brings forward examples of questions being given to a Minister in sufficient time for that Minister to get a prepared answer from the relevant department. That question really becomes a question on notice and should be treated as such, particularly if the question seeks a detailed answer. In many cases a question has been asked by an honourable senator on the Government side and a lengthy answer with much information is given which should not be given during Question Time which is for the asking of questions without notice. The question really should be placed on notice. That is the type of question to which I think Senator McLaren is objecting. He is objecting to that practice which, on one occasion, was abused to the extent of one senator being responsible for not only posing the question but also for giving the information for the answer. That is really abusing the system and that is what Senator McLaren is pointing at. He objects to prior notice of questions being given in such a way that great detail is given in the answer. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition often suspects that the reason it has been asked in a lengthy form and answered in an extra lengthy way is to take up time. If that device is used to take up time, of course, the Opposition is seriously disadvantaged, particularly when one considers sub-item (iii), regarding the Government always asking for further questions to be placed on notice after one hour has lapsed. That means that if the Government wants to do so and if the Whips intend to, Government senators can give prior notice of a whole series of questions with the answers prepared and put them in the hands of Ministers to bat out time. I do not think that is of advantage to anyone in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the Standing Orders Committee may take a look at some way in which a question can be placed on notice so that that question can be asked or answered after Question Time. I am suggesting that there ought to be some provision by which, if a senator believes a question to be very important but it requires a detailed or researched answer from the Minister's staff, that question is placed on notice for answer that day. That would obviate these rather lengthy prepared questions and answers being read out which takes up most of Question Time which is for the asking of questions without notice. </PARA>

It could need to be researched or perhaps referred back to the Department of Foreign Affairs, for example, for the supply of an answer. There should be some means whereby we can place questions on notice and have an answer supplied that day. If the facility is also then given for a supplementary question to be asked on that deferred answer then perhaps we could, in some way, prevent the misuse of Question Time by Ministers having prepared questions and prepared answers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While I am on my feet I want to talk about item 1(iii). I have objected strongly to anyone in the Senate taking over the right of the Senate to determine any matter. It is the practice for senators to seek leave. It does not matter who happens to be seeking to do something; he must have the leave of the Senate. The practice in this place is that the Leader of the Government stands up and says: 'I ask that all further questions be placed on notice'. He does not seek leave to bring that about. My view about that has always been that the Leader of the Government should ask for leave to place all further questions on notice. If that leave is refused then, of course, Ministers can simply suggest that every other question that is asked of them be placed on notice. The point I am trying to make is that nothing should be done here by anyone, and especially by a member of the Executive, without first obtaining leave of the Senate. I suggest that we devise some means whereby the Leader of the Government should seek leave of the Senate for all further questions to be placed on notice. If he is refused leave then the obvious device for Ministers is to have all further questions placed on notice. That right of the Senate to determine its business should not be taken away from it. I believe that in the instance I gave it has been taken away. I will continue to object to such practices. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to deal with item 1, sub-items (i), (ii) and (iii) of the Standing Orders Committee fifth report for the 59th session. Are we all being honest when we say that the purpose of our questions is to obtain information? Since I became a senator I have fought very hard against recommendations of the Standing Orders Committee. During my time as a senator, the Committee has done nothing but bring down reports aimed at taking away the rights and the freedoms of individual members of this Parliament. I have continually opposed such reports. In fact, I have welcomed reports which have proposed no change. On those occasions our rights have been preserved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The issue of Question Time is a very complicated one. I strongly support Standing Orders 99 and 100. They are adequate for proper administration of Question Time. What I am about to say may be misinterpreted by men for whom I have great admiration, but Standing Orders, whatever they may say, are ineffective if they are not interpreted and policed as it was intended that they should be when they were implemented. Some members of my party think I have a good knowledge of the Standing Orders. However, I find that I do not. Although I do not think I am stupid in my understanding of the Standing Orders, on occasions when I have raised a point of order on what I have considered a breach of the Standing Orders it has not been upheld. So obviously I am an idiot and I was wrong in my belief that the Standing Orders had been breached. Therefore, if we feel we will solve anything by altering the Standing Orders we have a responsibility to ensure that the new Standing Orders are rigidly enforced-and it is the President who should enforce them. I accept that when Question Time has been broadcast it has never been a time used to seek information. If Government members had to seek information from their Ministers at Question Time they might show a lack of confidence in their Government and their Ministers. They know that they can get the information they seek directly from a Minister or his Department. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is it in the public interest? We had a question the other day about what Mr Bannon said and whether it represented a change in Labor's policy in South Australia. Did the honourable senator who asked the question endeavour to obtain information to serve the people who elected him or did he want the Minister to say that Bannon was a renegade from the Labor Party who was trying to twist the wrist of the Labor Party? The reason for such questions is obvious. Many members are frustrated at times by an inability to put questions. They may feel that they have been overlooked or that someone else is getting preference. There is not sufficient time for answers to be given to all the questions honourable senators may wish to ask.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the Standing Orders Committee has erred greatly. It has not gone into the detail of what has happened in past years. I have read in its report that from 1967 to 1973, for some six years, there was no time limit on Question Time. My recollection of that time is that most days Question Time finished within an hour. So, limiting Question Time will not necessarily shorten Question Time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I will tell the honourable senator what happened. It is true that some days Question Time lasted an hour and a half but everyone who wanted to ask a question asked it and asked it as many times as he desired. In this way many questions were asked in one day. However, it was rare that Question Time lasted longer than an hour. Many times-I remember the times-Question Time finished in 20 minutes. Question Time was accepted as a procedure for the Opposition to get its propaganda over to the nation. It was a time for grievances, a time to embarrass a Minister or a time to get some point over to the public about a Minister's neglect. Everybody was satisfied to give the Opposition this time for airing grievances and for publicity reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1973 that was altered. At that time the great reformer, Senator Murphy, was the Leader of the Government in the Senate. He got the idea that some limitation must be placed on Question Time. He proposed a limit of one hour. The Chairman of the Committee upheld his right to limit Question Time. He asked: 'Why should our Ministers be shot at for an hour during Question Time? Why can't we take up at least half of that time in putting our propaganda over the air? It then became the practice not for members to give questions to Ministers for Ministers to prepare answers but for Ministers to write out questions and answers and give the questions to members to ask. That practice is still going on today. I give Senator Missen some credit. I think he asks questions, as do others, to show his concern for human rights and his concern for law reform. The practice is designed to limit the obligation of Ministers to answer the criticisms which are forthcoming if there is a barrage of questions from the Opposition from time to time. With no limitation on Question Time, the Opposition had the say, but there was no advantage in Government senators asking questions unless they wanted information. The only time a Government senator asked a question was when he wanted information. Of course, he then asked it. Very few Government senators wanted information that they could not get by approaching the Minister in the lobby, so they did not ask their questions at Question Time. This caused a reduction in the length of Question Time. Everyone was happy and satisfied with Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to supplementary questions and deferred answers. I think that serious consideration should be given to whether supplementary questions should be permitted to be asked at all. The practice of asking supplementary questions was introduced only in the time that Sir Magnus Cormack was President. Although the practice had some advantages no one in the chamber can say that it has not been abused. </PARA>

When a supplementary question is asked it can be entirely different from the one asked originally. It was intended that if insufficient information were given in the Minister's answer to the first question one could ask for elaboration. Now a supplementary question takes this form: 'Do I take it from the Minister's answer that he means so and so?' Where does one go? This is such a waste of time, such an abuse of the practice of asking supplementary questions, that I think all honourable senators should be forced, if they want to use further propaganda in questions, to raise their supplementary question the next day rather than get the opportunity to ask their question at that time and take the time of back benchers.</PARA></TALK.START>

It seems to me if that device were provided it would avoid many of the difficulties that have been complained of by honourable senators and would certainly remove completely any suggestion that Question Time was being padded out with prepared answers. It seems to me that additional time should be set aside for prepared answers. After all, the length of that additional time would be pretty much at the discretion of the Government. The Government would decide the length of those answers. If the Government wished to devote a lengthy period to such answers that would take from the time in which honourable senators might be engaged in other business of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is re-examining the problems that existed in 1979, which continued right through to 1980 and which to some extent may continue through 1981. We are dealing with a problem which I think we can say probably affects the Opposition more than it does the government. It is a question then of establishing the parameters by which Question Time should operate. Is the purpose of Question Time solely to seek information? Is not the purpose of Question Time also to test the capacity of Ministers and the Government? It seems to me that other considerations have allowed Question Time to be developed in the Westminster system. As I understand it, at the time of its commencement the Westminster system was largely designed to provide for all members to put the Government or the Executive in a situation where their actions had to be defended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that we have seen evolve in Western-style democracies a system of rigid party development. So with the evolution of time a system has developed where the rights of honourable senators and members in the other place have changed somewhat, to the point where now the original concept no longer operates-that is, all members putting members of the Executive on their mettle, testing them in respect of their knowledge and capacities properly to fulfil their public functions. I suppose because of the way in which our party systems operate it is understandable that Government members would be seeking to do nothing that would embarrass their own Government, whereas the Opposition would do everything it could to establish either the veracity or the capacity of the Ministers on the other side of the House. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator GIETZELT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that some Government members-I pay tribute to them from time to time; some of them are present in the chamber-still test Ministers by putting forward questions because they really want information. But it must surely be conceded by Government members that we have seen develop a system to which we object and one which has been abused. I certainly would have no objection if Government senators were to say-my colleague Senator Georges has indicated this-that they propose to ask a question in respect of Aboriginals at Noonkanbah, Arnhem Land or whatever you like. I think that is fair enough. If they were to say to a Minister: 'We propose to ask you a question specifically about A, B and C in respect of those matters', it is no longer a matter of asking questions without notice. It is establishing an undue influence and creating an unfair situation so far as the Opposition is concerned because it has the effect of arming the Government with another means by which it can defend its political position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When Opposition senators ask Ministers questions for the purpose of testing the Government, testing a Minister, of course we find time and again that the Minister gives us brief and unsatisfactory answers which do not in any way meet the requirements of giving information. I grant that on some occasions that happens because the Minister does not have intimate knowledge of the matter, particularly when it is concerned with an area in relation to which he only represents the Minister. Subsequent to such an answer being given we see a Government senator asking a question which clearly would come within the same category as the previous question-that is to say, it seeks information which is not readily available to the Minister insofar as it deals with an area in relation to which the Minister only represents the responsible Minister-but in respect of which the Minister has information because he has been well and truly briefed in respect of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1979 we saw continued abuse of the system whereby one or two fairly newly appointed Ministers-I do not want to make an issue of this because honourable senators will concede that I am not interested in personalities-were asked technical questions and would then speak for five minutes, obviously from a prepared brief. Of course, that practice led the Opposition to raise an objection and to have this matter referred to the Standing Orders Committee. We really need some refinement. Perhaps it should be the refinement suggested by Senator Mason or perhaps it should be left for the President to establish whether a senator has indicated to the Minister that he intends to raise a certain subject matter or has asked a detailed question for which an answer has already been provided by the Department. This practice negates the whole principle of questions without notice. I think we have seen a continuation of it although I must admit that in the brief life of this new Parliament practically every Minister has attempted to give me some sort of answer to the questions I have asked. </PARA>
<PARA> I found during 1979-80 that when I asked a question without notice not only to seek information but also to test the capacity of a Minister I was just getting a twenty-word reply, and that was the end of the matter. I would then get a written reply three or four months later which would have completely lost its relevance. I find the way in which the Standing Orders Committee has dealt with this matter unsatisfactory as indeed other honourable senators from both sides of the House have suggested. Committee members have thought: 'The problem is there. It has probably been with us for a long time. It is too hard to work out a refinement so we will just maintain the status quo'. I do not think that is a particularly satisfactory way to handle the problem. I think we ought to say to the Ministers on the present front bench: 'We want much shorter answers to questions, particularly those asked by Government senators. We want less provocative answers than were given in the previous Parliament and we look forward to you really giving the sort of information that defends the Government's actions'. I think that is fair enough. We certainly do not look forward to a continuation of the attitude that existed in the previous Parliament when sometimes a Minister would take five minutes in which to attack everything from A to Z in the Australian Labor Party from one part of the continent to another. That is really not what Question Time is about. The preamble to the Notice of Question paper-this relates to what Senator Cavanagh said-states:</PARA>
<PARA> Questions addressed to a Minister should relate to the public affairs with which he is officially connected, to proceedings pending in Parliament, or to any matter of administration for which the Minister is responsible. </PARA>
<PARA>I think honourable senators will agree with me that we have seen time and again that this has been offended against. This has happened, as Senator Cavanagh stated, in respect to Mr Bannon. In no way could the question asked in respect of Mr Bannon be said to have anything to do with public affairs with which the Minister is connected or with any matters pending in Parliament or any matters of administration for which the Minister is responsible. Yet, that question was permitted to be answered. We really must look toward a better way to proceed with questions without notice. </PARA>
<PARA> I also take up the point of Question Time itself, a matter which Senator Georges raised. One hour has crept in as the maximum period for Question Time. I do not know what is so magical about one hour, or even half an hour for that matter. Once we had 60 members in the Senate but now we have 64. If we just talk about the mathematics of the situation we could argue that the time should be stretched. Question Time is an important issue. Every time there is some matter of controversy in the community members of the public at large say, 'Ask a question', and they believe that I will get an answer. I have this raised with me every week of my political life. I am sure every honourable senator has had the same experience. I have to point out that, of course, it depends upon the Minister. If the Government does not want to answer such a question it will not do so. Certainly, it is the Opposition's experience to get unsatisfactory answers to questions. Yet the public at large really believes that we have been putting the Minister on his mettle and that the question has been asked because it is vexed and controversial. It is a question that the public wants an answer to. But subterfuge is resorted to by the Minister because he or she is on the spot and the honourable senator asking the question gets a cursory answer that does not in any way satisfy himself or the person or group outside which asked him to pose that question. </PARA>
<PARA> I concede that this probably happened in the period in which the Whitlam Government was in office; but if that was one of our misdemeanours we probably had good masters. Certainly I saw what I am now complaining about happen from the moment that I came into the Parliament. If we really want to have Question Time for the purpose for which it was originally established in the Westminster system we ought to look at the matter in a much more objective way and not in a way that everything on one side is right and everything on the other side is wrong. From time to time I have heard Government senators expressing their concern about the role of the Executive. I know, of course, that if an honourable senator on the Government side does anything that might embarrass his government he is in all sorts of trouble. </PARA>

It has been a long established practice for honourable senators to give Ministers informal advice of their questions prior to Questions Time on the subjects they propose to ask questions.

That means that if this report were accepted there would be a capacity in this chamber clearly to prevent that happening in the future. I would have thought that was as much as Senator McLaren would have hoped to get from the Standing Orders Committee in relation to that aspect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to acknowledge the problems which have been raised by a number of other honourable senators. I think Question Time is far from being as satisfactory as it should be. It is an important aspect of the operation of responsible government. It is an important aspect of the accountability of the executive government of the day to the whole of the Parliament-not to one side or the other but to the whole of the Parliament and to the people. I believe there is a clear public interest to be served in ensuring that questions are answered, are answered promptly and are answered publicly and that the information is available to all and is not limited to one side of the Parliament or to one section of the community. Otherwise responsible government, as a concept and as a practice, becomes a farce. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of aspects about the operation of Question Time concern me because they do not follow the criteria that I have just suggested. I have suggested that one practice should be changed, but I have not had much success. So let me bring it up again. It is not uncommon for an honourable senator to ask a question without notice and for the Minister then to say: 'I have not got the information but I will get it and let the honourable senator have it as soon as possible'. The honourable senator receives a letter a week, a month or a couple of months later. That letter is posted to the honourable senator privately. It never appears in Hansard. There would be a whole performance to go through to get it into Hansard, but it is an answer to a question which is publicly asked as part of this responsible government accountability process. I believe that is one of the things we can change and ought to change. The process should be that, whilst as a matter of courtesy the answer is posted direct to the honourable senator, it ought also to be processed through the clerks for tabling and incorporated in Hansard. That is just one aspect. </PARA>
<PARA> Another procedure that I suggest could improve the whole operation of Question Time quite considerably is a change to the absurd-I use that word quite deliberately-and in many cases disgraceful delay that takes place between the placing of a question on notice and the answer being given. It is quite inexcusable in most circumstances. I know that some honourable senators perhaps ask for information which could be better obtained in other ways and that that perhaps overloads the Notice Paper with matters which are not really part of the accountability process or which need not be put on the public record. Perhaps there is some sympathy to be given to the Executive when there is some overloading with unnecessary questions, but there can be no excuse for the fact that the average question takes so long to be answered. They are sometimes answered in what can be described only as an entirely unsatisfactory way, but if after such a delay an honourable senator tries to follow up with a further question to get a satisfactory answer he can find that it takes two years from the time he first asked the question until he gets the final information. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Mulvihill suggests another approach. He can only be regarded as the Senate's qualified expert to give that suggestion to us. I believe that if the Government is concerned at all about needing to limit the length of Question Time so that it can get its business through, it ought to respond to the interests of this chamber by saying: 'We will be a lot more efficient in answering questions that have been put on notice so that we can more readily tell honourable senators that if they put a question on notice they will get an answer very quickly'. It may be that one should even consider the introduction of a new process. I listened to Senator Mason's suggestion for a third category of questions. I would like to suggest another one for consideration; that is, when a Minister is asked a question in a representative capacity the question should be placed on notice automatically. It can be asked in the chamber and then automatically go on notice for answer within two sitting days. That happens in other parliaments of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In some parliaments questions are asked and responses are given within one, two or a limited number of sitting days. That would quite considerably relieve the pressure on Question Time when we could expect Ministers to give answers directly available to them in reply to questions concerning their own ministerial responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Question Time is far more likely to be effective as a system of ministerial responsibility and accountability if the answers given to questions asked of Ministers in a representative capacity are given by the Minister who is actually responsible and not by the one in a representative capacity. The danger that exists is that if an honourable senator puts a question on notice he can forget it very often for 3, 6 or 12 months. I believe that rather than complaining about the mere fact that Question Time gets overcrowded we should look at limiting the time for ministerial replies to questions on notice as one of the possible ways of relieving the pressure on Question Time. That is just one of a number of suggestions of things which I believe could be done. I believe Senator Cavanagh's recollection of the practice at Question Time between 1967 and 1973 is one on which he could reflect. Whilst on some occasions there may have been relatively short Question Times, the average length was about one hour and eight minutes to one hour and 15 minutes until Question Time was brought back to an hour in 1973. </PARA>

It will not be done because when we look at Standing Order 101 we see that it states in part:</PARA>
<PARA> Notice of Question shall be given by a Senator delivering the same at the Table, fairly written . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is left to the good sense of honourable senators to do that. I think I have proved here today that written notices of questions are given to Ministers. I am reminded in particular of a written question from Senator Walters. The answer to that question was on the same sheet of paper which was tabled at my request. So I say to Senator Rae that the recommendations need to be stronger if we are to get away from this practice that is being adopted by honourable senators opposite of giving written questions to Ministers and Ministers then coming into this chamber with prepared answers. Senator Missen said that what I said was all nonsense. He completely gave the game away by way of interjection to another honourable senator about this matter of giving notice when he said that it was all in the public interest. He admitted that the only reason for his giving a written or a verbal question to a Minister was to get some publicity for the answer he received in this chamber. That is the very thing that senators on this side of the chamber are complaining about. We have matters of public interest to raise too, just as Government senators do. Whereas Government members can forewarn a Minister of a question and get an answer which they are able to use to political advantage, members of the Opposition do not get an answer so they are at a disadvantage. If honourable senators take the time to read what I have said, they will see that the whole thrust of my argument is that the practice they are adopting-it has gone on for a long time; in fact, ever since 1975 or early 1976-is that the back bench members on the Government side get the kudos for getting answers when they do not really need to come into this chamber and ask questions in the public interest because they have easy access to the Minister and can go to the Department, no matter how curly the question is, and get an answer. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Cavanagh spoke about the curtailing of Question Time to one hour. I think he was right in his remarks. I think it was Senator Georges who said that the Leader of the Government in the Senate should seek leave for further questions to be placed on the Notice Paper. If one is sharp in this place sometimes one can catch the Leader of the Government in the Senate out. I recall one occasion last year when the Leader of the Government was not quite on the ball and he moved that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. I jumped to my feet in an attempt to debate the motion but he quickly retreated. I was not quite happy that he was able to do that because he had moved a motion and I felt that I was entitled to speak to it. However, I was not allowed to do so and I think either Senator Georges' or Senator Cavanagh's proposition that the Leader of the Government seek leave to have further questions placed on notice is a good one and ought to be incorporated in the Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter that Senator Rae raised was one which I raised with the President last year-I am still waiting for some action to be taken on it-and that is, the written replies we get to questions. I have a whole heap of them. They are written replies to questions which I asked during the debate on the Appropriation Bills and which have never appeared in Hansard. We get these written replies in the mail during the recess and the only way in which we can get those answers on the public record is to take up the time of the Senate on the first reading of a money Bill, to read them into the Hansard record during the adjournment debate at night or to get permission to incorporate them in Hansard. Senator Rae suggested that action ought to be taken and I am pleased that he and I are on the same wavelength in this regard because on so many occasions we are on the opposite wavelength. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to prepared questions and the lengthy answers that are given I recall one instance here in 1978 involving an answer from former Senator Webster. I think he is on record as giving the longest-winded answers to any questions, no matter what side of the chamber they came from. He was also well known for farming out questions for senators on his own side of the chamber to ask. On this occasion when Senator Brown was in this chamber he spent some time devising a name for an insect and he then asked Senator Webster about the habits of that insect. On 12 April, Senator Brown asked, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> Is the Minister aware of a recent report about a pest by the name of servan'i grapier which entomologists uniquely describe as a gum leaf, grass root eating grub, capable of devastating vegetable crops and pastures if protective measures are not taken?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Webster, in a prompt reply, and it was a long one, said in part:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I find myself in a very difficult situation. I do not seek your help in this matter but you have heard the points of order raised . . . that questions posed to me on scientific matters are too long and that the answers I attempt to give to those questions are too long. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Brown's question was not very long-winded, but Senator Webster went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I have several pages of information on this matter. It has taken some time for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation to investigate the problems in relation to this important matter. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators on this side of the chamber thought Senator Brown had served up a Dorothy Dixer to Senator Webster because of the answer given by Senator Webster. On the next day, that is, 13 April-I give Senator Webster some credit for his expediency-Senator Webster came into this chamber and gave further information on servan'i grapier. He said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA>Following a question asked of me yesterday by Senator Brown relating to a particular species of bug, I have been advised by my scientific advisers, after an investigation of the matter raised in his question, as recorded in Hansard, that they are unable to identify any pest species with a name like the one Senator Brown committed to Hansard . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So there we are. Senator Webster said that he had pages and pages of detail about that grub; yet the next day he came into this chamber and said that, after investigation by his Department or by the Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation, or whatever, the grub did not exist. Of course it did not exist because it took Senator Brown several hours the night before he asked the question to make up the name of the bug. That is how the time of the Senate was taken up and and that was the type of thing we had to put up with, with Ministers purporting that they had full knowledge and trying to big-note themselves in their electorate. This is what is going on now with these questions we are complaining about. They are served up to Ministers in written form and the Minister is able to come in to the chamber with an answer. Everyone then thinks 'My word, he is a capable Minister', just like they used to think Senator Webster was. Ministers get the answer off pat and can tell the world at large the answer to every problem. Of course we on this side of the chamber are completely disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter I want to raise on this item in the Standing Orders Committee report concerns the time taken in the giving and answering of questions without notice. This matter was raised last year and the President put down a statement on 23 May last year in which he gave some figures on the time taken in asking questions and the time taken in answering them. But the times are correlated so that one cannot dissect the time taken to ask the question and the time taken to answer a question. It would appear from the dates specified in the schedule that the President put down that members of the Oppostion get far more opportunity to ask questions and to get answers than do members of the Government. The first list was for the period from 19 February 1980 to 28 February 1980, a period of six days; while the next period was from 21 May to 25 May, another period of six days. If we try to take an analysis whereby members on the Government side and members on the Opposition side ask the same number of questions, the results are very revealing. We find that on 21 February last year Government members asked 12 questions and the time taken in asking those questions and the time taken in answering them was 29 minutes. On the same day members of the Opposition asked 12 questions and the time taken to answer them was 21 minutes. So Government members had an advantage of 8 minutes over senators on the Opposition side. The only other day which I can find where we had an equal number of questions was 27 February. On that day 17 questions were asked by Government members and the time taken in asking and answering them was 32 minutes 10 seconds; while for the 17 questions asked by members of the Opposition, not taking into account the Australian Democrats, the time taken was 23 minutes 20 seconds. There is written proof. If honourable senators could go through that in detail they might find that what we have been complaining about is quite legitimate. </PARA>
<PARA> We can see clearly that when the same number of questions have been asked by each side the time given to the government senators has been greater-in one instance, eight minutes more and on another day about nine minutes more. So government senators have an advantage over the Opposition on just about every occasion. That is something about which we are complaining. Of course, the President has no jurisdiction in regard to many of these matters. A person on the other side asks a long question and the Minister gives a long detailed answer, which Opposition senators have often complained about. A good part of the answer is not pertinent to the question but the opportunity is taken by Ministers, particularly by Senator Carrick, to make a political speech. He has not started that practice this year because we have not got into full momentum, but I expect it to happen as time goes on and as Senator Carrick starts to get tired and we start to embarrass him. He will then trot out the old rhetoric about it being the fault of the Whitlam Government, and then go on and on. His answers often have nothing to do with the question which, in the public interest, Opposition senators try to put. I hope that the Standing Orders Committee in its next report makes some worthwhile recommendations or gives directions to the Senate to take certain action, instead of just saying, as Senator Rae pointed out, that written questions ought to be put on notice. I would rather see a direction from the Standing Orders Committee to the Senate that certain things should be done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address some remarks to this problem of the Senate's Question Time, the problem of giving notice of questions. What is being attempted in giving notice of questions is to make Question Time more effective than it can be without notice being given. I think it is quite clear that Ministers frequently do and must have notice of questions because of the present nature of Question Time. This raises the issue of whether our present Question Time is an appropriate method of getting information from the Executive into the public domain. I submit that it is not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not appropriate for three reasons. Firstly, of course, three-quarters of the Ministers whom one wishes to question are not, under our present system, available for direct questioning by senators. Secondly, although it is better than it is in the House of Representatives, our procedure of supplementary questioning is quite inadequate. One supplementary question is normally allowed but the procedure does not really permit the pursuit of an issue until a satisfactory answer is produced. Thirdly, if it is a complex issue, it is unreasonable to expect the Minister to have all the matters in his mind. If, on the other hand, the question is put on the Notice Paper, as is suggested by paragraph 5 of the Standing Orders Committee report, months will normally pass-in some cases years-before one gets an answer to the issue which one raised. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to see the Standing Orders Committee look closely at the procedure used by the British House of Commons to see whether this would not be a better method for us to adopt at Question Time. If one used the British House of Commons procedure, the process here would be this: Notice would be given of questions to which an honourable senator wanted oral answers from a Minister. The Minister would have a short period-a few days at most-in which to consider his answer. He would publicly give his answer to the Senate and then supplementary questions would be permitted until, in the opinion of the President, that subject had been exhausted. Fewer questions would be asked, of course, but they would be pursued in more detail. As the question is printed on the Notice Paper it would not be necessary to go through the questions. The number of the question on the Notice Paper should just need to be referred to and the Minister could give his prepared answer, and that subject would then be pursued in detail through supplementary questions until that topic was exhausted. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They may be, but the key to the way in which the system works is that it is by means of the supplementary questions that the issue is really investigated and answers have to be forthcoming from the Minister. I further suggest, and this is touched on elsewhere in the Standing Orders Committee report, that Question Time is of very little value until we can arrange for the Ministers of the House of Representatives, who are supposed to be responsible to both Houses of Parliament, to be available for questioning by senators. I urge that the Standing Orders Committee have a really thorough look at what we are trying to achieve from our Question Time and how best we can achieve it. I think a modification of the British House of Commons procedure would work very much better than the procedure we have at present.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My intrusion into this debate will be brief. Senator Cavanagh put his finger on the pulse earlier when he spoke about the length of Question Time. I balance that against the emergence of the supplementary question. I think what Senator Hamer said about the introduction of the British House of Commons practice has a lot of merit. We realise, of course, that some weeks we may be faced with some burning issue and other matters may have to be put aside. Supplementary questions reduce the number of questions but obviously they have a valuable role. The answer to the original question may get to the brink of the matter, and a follow-up question can wrap up the subject at that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is another point which I think is significant. Senator Rae, who usually chairs an Estimates Committee, would know the value of questioning a Minister. For a couple of years now Senator Bishop and Senator Tate have probed matters relating to employment retraining methods and apprenticeship intakes. Even if the Minister for Industrial Relations were present at the Estimates Committee, I would not expect him to have available a string of figures in regard to those matters. However, unless honourable senators have the relevant information they cannot apply a litmus test, as it were, to determine the effectiveness of the Government's programs. Some of the load could be taken away from Question Time by having on-going Estimates committees. Each year Estimates committees deal with Supplementary Estimates and normal Estimates. Each senator usually has a particular interest in two or three areas. An honourable senator may also have a pipeline to some organisations which expects him to probe matters and to get prompt responses. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Estimates committees could be expanded and have on-going hearings. I say that for a particular reason. Say the Government made a decision to accept political refugees from a number of countries. There would be a justifiable howl about the importance of the family reunion policy and the acceptance of immigrants according to job categories. An honourable senator may ask a question in the Senate and the answer may be given a couple of weeks later. When Estimates or Supplementary Estimates are before Estimates committees one can get excellent responses if one has done one's homework. I have proved this in relation to my two areas of particular interest. As Senator Bishop could testify, answers given to questions on industrial relations, for example, can be indexed and sent to the Australian Council of Trade Unions or to the National Labour Consultative Council. They give a feedback and there is a top level debate or further questions are asked. But success hinges on the responses to Estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA> In the immigration area there is some concern amongst Latin Americans as to whether they are treated as well as South East Asians are treated. A string of questions may be directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration. The United States Congress-I know the United States has a slightly different form of government-has full Senate inquiries into such matters. People testify, and answers are given. If there were Estimates committees there would be fewer questions from me at Question Time about immigration or industrial relations and more opportunity for honourable senators to ask questions on other topics. I throw that innovation in for consideration. Senator Hamer suggested that we should adopt the House of Commons format for Question Time. I believe the expansion of the Estimates committees into an on-going operation would be equally valuable. At least the two areas that I mentioned, industrial relations and ethnic affairs, would be taken out of the Senate at large. With the Minister and his specialist advisers present answers could be obtained. That is my addendum to all the suggestions that have been made about improving Question Time. </PARA>

I think it is quite clear that we may have different views as to what the solution might be, but we are not at all satisfied with the questioning process and the way in which it works. From Senator Mason, Senator Georges, Senator Rae, Senator Hamer, Senator Mulvihill and a number of other senators have come suggestions which I think need a lot more consideration and ought to be considered as possibilities for improving the process in the work that we are doing. The motion before the Senate is that the Senate note the item. I said that I was going to oppose it. I do not know what use there would be in just noting the item.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendment proposed by Senator Missen. I think enough has been said today at least to warrant further consideration. I was particularly impressed by Senator Rae's contribution. Like him, I am not concerned about the someone who wants information giving a Minister prior knowledge of a question to allow him to provide an answer. I am concerned about a Minister supplying the question and the answer. It is done. This practice was introduced by then Senator Murphy, now Mr Justice Murphy, and it still goes on. I am indebted to Senator McLaren for giving me a copy of a question which he had tabled and which was asked by Senator Walters on 20 August 1980. She asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>My question . . . is in two parts. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Walters wanted publicity to be given to the fact that the Commonwealth was financing the functions of the International Cultural Corporation of Australia Ltd. She wanted a big statement from the Government that it was funding that Corporation. Of course, the question and the answer are printed on the one sheet of paper. Obviously, the Minister wanted to attract publicity by telling the world that the Commonwealth was funding the International Cultural Corporation. The answer which appeared on the same page as the question consisted of 6 paragraphs to explain that in effect the Commonwealth was funding the International Cultural Corporation. One takes the view that such a question should have been put on notice. </PARA>
<PARA> Questions asked during Question Time are supposed to be questions without notice. Because of my misinterpretation of the Standing Orders I thought that the question should have been put on notice. When I raised the matter with Senator McLaren I found I was wrong. The question did not call for details and should not have been put on notice. I liked Senator Rae's suggestion that there should be an arrangement for the automatic incorporation in Hansard of questions answered by correspondence. I disagree that the solution is to ask questions in the adjournment debate. If we were to ask a series of questions in an adjournment debate we would wait a lot longer to receive an answer, if we ever got it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Rae also suggested that questions on notice should be answered within two sitting days. Whilst that may be too short a period I think there should be a requirement that in the event of a Minister's failing to supply an answer within a reasonable period he provide a reason to the Senate for not having done so. I have suggested that the Committee should consider this matter further. Senator Rae disagrees with me as to the length of Question Time prior to our placing a time limit on it. I may be wrong. I suggest that the Committee should find out what the length of Question Time was and what time we are saving now in Question Time in trying to get on the record as much propaganda as we can for and against the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I think many good suggestions have been made. Obviously, there are complaints about the present system. I think the Committee should look at the matter and consider the suggestions that have been made-Senator Hamer's suggestion may be worth taking up, although I do not like it-to see whether we can improve the system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was initially tempted to expostulate a little about these Bills being brought on for debate so early in the session. They were introduced into the Senate only yesterday. But I must concede that my anguish in this respect was somewhat tempered by the recollection that this Parliament as a whole has in fact had notice of these measures since August 1980. Indeed, the real complaint in respect of these Bills is the lugubrious slowness of the whole process of bringing them to fruition. I will refer again to that aspect in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition does not oppose these Bills. They are all directed to amending, largely as to various machinery matters, a package of legislation which was passed early in 1980 as part of the national co-operative companies and securities scheme. That is not, however, to say that the Opposition is any happier with the legislative approach embodied in this scheme than it was when the co-operative arrangements were first mooted. Our attitude is embodied in our proposed amendment to the motion 'That the Bill be now read a second time', which amendment has been circulated to honourable senators. I move:</PARA>
<PARA>At end of motion, add ', but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) expresses its concern at the Government's abdication of its responsibility to make national laws for corporations and the securities industry pursuant to the Commonwealth's own constitutional powers, and in accordance with the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange in 1974 (the Rae Report);</PARA>
<PARA> (b) notes that the legislative scheme places uniformity before reform, and creates both the danger and the likelihood that lowest common denominator standards will prevail;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) expresses its concern at the lack of effective accountability of the National Companies and Securities Commission, to either the Government or the Parliament of the Commonwealth, or to any other single elected government or parliament;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) notes that amendments to close loopholes in company law are continually necessary, but while acknowledging that pursuant to the Formal Agreement, any proposed amendment may need to be the subject of consultation with the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities before final acceptance by the Government, nonetheless insists upon this Parliament's right to properly scrutinise and amend all legislation put before it by the Executive; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) calls upon the Government in the event of the breakdown for any reason of the scheme embodied in the Bills, to proceed immediately to the introduction of Commonwealth legislation for the national regulation of the acquisition of shares.'. </PARA>
<PARA>The speech that I made in respect of the National Companies and Securities Commission Bill on 19 November 1979 amounted to a very detailed discussion of the implications of the amendment involved and the reason for our moving it in the terms in which we did. For that reason I will not repeat on this occasion all the detail of the Opposition's argument. Nonetheless, we cannot repeat too often the basic points that are in issue with this whole package of companies and securities legislation. The first paragraph of the Opposition's amendment states that the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) expresses its concern at the Government's abdication of its responsibility to make national laws for corporations and the securities industry pursuant to the Commonwealth's own constitutional powers, and in accordance with the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange in 1974 (the Rae Report);</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that the Commonwealth has the constitutional power under section 51(xx) of the Constitution and a miscellany of other provisions to enact unilaterally the kind of legislation which is in issue here. Furthermore, there is no doubt that that power should be exercised as was the conclusion of the Senate Standing Committee on Securities and Exchange chaired by Senator Rae in 1974. Nothing has changed since the bringing down of the Rae Committee report to alter that situation. The States of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia got together in the early 1970s to form the interstate Corporate Affairs Commission, as their own co-operative arrangement, to ward off the anticipated onslaught of Commonwealth unilateral legislation in the exercise of the Commonwealth's own powers. The result of that co-operative endeavour at the State level has been such that the States in question have been able to achieve neither compete uniformity nor efficiency in the pursuit of commercial and corporate integrity in the company law and securities areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Negri River affair, to which I referred in giving a notice of motion today and which will be the subject of further debate in this place next week, indicates that highly questionable practices with respect to the flotation of mining or exploration companies are alive and well as a phenomenon in this community. The matter does raise squarely all over again the spectres of the Poseidon, Minsec and Tasminex companies. If anything, the need for national overriding legislation allowing no opportunity for the development of idiosyncratic, local course rules at the expense of the national interest is even more apparent than it was in the early 1970s. I am referring to the phenomenon with which we have all become familiar, regrettably, in the last few months; that is, the extraordinary performance of Queensland in its endeavours, which can only be described as bizarre, to ward off the acquisition by interstate corporations of companies owned and managed by Queenslanders. I refer in particular to the affairs of companies such as Evans-Deakin Industries Limited and Walkers Limited. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Limited, within the context of the Thiess Bros. Pty Ltd takeover, was an even more spectacular example, as I am reminded by Senator Rae. I am not sure whether Senator Rae will agree with my next point that if these were to be regarded as genuine exercises in socialism representing a desire by the Queensland Government to bring into public ownership enterprises hitherto devoted to private profit, then this kind of exercise might, in our view, be defensible. It is clear, however, that they represent no more than a demonstration of that unlovely and Deep North phenomenon of xenophobia, reinforced in this instance by the personal paranoia of the Premier, about which Mr John Hodges spoke so eloquently in the other place earlier this week. The second paragraph of the amendment to the motion for the second reading states that the Senate:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (b) notes that the legislative scheme places uniformity before reform, and creates both the danger and the likelihood that lowest common denominator standards will prevail;</PARA>
<PARA>This is the basic problem in the corporations and securities scheme of co-operative legislation with which we have again been presented, especially at this establishment stage when unanimity is the requirement in the putting together of these packages of legislation as distinct from the majority of the members of the Ministerial Council which would be the requirement for subsequent amendments. The requirement of unanimity at this initial packaging stage is one of the things, perhaps the most obvious thing, that has resulted in the grindingly slow pace of the changes which have been occurring up to now. Putting it the other way around, the slowness of the implementation of this scheme is the best evidence of the validity of the concern that is embodied in this paragraph of the Opposition's amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be recalled that this so-called co-operative exercise was set in train initially after the Fraser Government came to power. The Fraser Government abandoned Labor's national scheme, the Commonwealth scheme, which was embodied in our attempted legislation in 1974 and 1975. The co-operative scheme thus set in train by the Fraser Government culminated initially in the Maroochydore agreement of December 1978. It was not until May 1980 that we reached the first stage of the actual implementation of the Maroochydore agreement, with the proclamation coming into effect of the National Companies and Securities Commission legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Commission is exercising various administrative functions and is gearing itself up for future activity, getting on for a year later it is still exercising no substantive functions under legislation because none of the other legislation, including the Securities Industry Act 1980 and the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Act 1980, is in effect because, amongst other things, the States, whose complementary legislation is necessary to the bringing of them into effect on a national basis, has not yet been passed. It will not be the case that all this legislation is in effect, with the NCSC actually having something to do, until the Companies Bill itself-that huge keystone of the arch constituted by the scheme-is finally lowered into place, whenever that might prove to be. The date of 1 January is the deadline being set. The trouble is that the years keep changing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is evident that there is very little significant reform or change embodied in the newly packaged legislation which has either been passed so far or of which advance notice has been given. It is true that getting real uniformity is in itself something of a reform, but the current state of corporate play-if I can put it in those terms-and the operation of securities industries, suggests that the process of reform in a legislative and regulatory sense still has a very long way to go. Even when that process of reform is accomplished in some visible and effective way, the worst feature of this scheme will remain. The problem is that when that stage is reached there is no guarantee whatsoever that the national scheme will be able to hold the line against those outbursts of parochial adventurism of the kind with which we have become all too familiar. The third paragraph of the Opposition's amendment seeks to add another dimension to our concern about the way in which this whole scheme is proceeding. The paragraph states that the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> (c) expresses its concern at the lack of effective accountability of the National Companies and Securities Commission, to either the Government or the Parliament of the Commonwealth, or to any other single elected government or parliament;</PARA>
<PARA>That is a point that cannot be repeated too often. We have had enough trouble with the Commonwealth's own statutory authorities in ensuring the kind of accountability that is necessary in the public interest. Senator Rae for one will not need any reminding about the affairs of the Australian Wheat Board or the Australian Dairy Corporation in this respect. It is infinitely more difficult to ensure any kind of reasonable accountability of statutory authorities of this kind in the public interest when multiplicity of governments are involved. It becomes impossible under those circumstances to sheet home the blame for maladministration or anything else to any one of them. Passing the buck becomes an administrative art form in that situation. So much is openly acknowledged and articulated by all those participating in the creation of this legislative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer, as I have in the past, once again to paragraph 38 (1) of the Maroochydore Agreement which makes this problem graphically clear. The paragraph reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The policy direction and general control over the administration of company law and the regulation of the securities industry throughout Australia by the Ministerial Council and by the Commission in accordance with this Agreement shall . . . be exercised to the exclusion of . . . Ministerial direction and control by the responsible Minister of the Commonwealth or of the State. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the only direct line of responsibility is to the Ministerial Council as a whole. No single governmental component of that Council is answerable to any government of any parliament in this nation. It is an inherent characteristic, I suppose, of co-operative schemes of this kind, but it does not make them any easier to live with and the problems that these kinds of arrangements store up are fine while the weather is fine but much less so when the weather becomes stormy. Problems of accountability or maladministration do rear their heads, as unfortunately they do from time to time, and it is under those circumstances that one becomes aware of the inherent structural weakness in this kind of Rube Goldberg device of co-operative federalism that is embodied in these arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (d) of the Opposition's amendment raises yet another fundamental problem with legislative arrangements of this kind. The paragraph states that the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> (d) notes that amendments to close loopholes in company law are continually necessary, but while acknowledging that pursuant to the Formal Agreement, any proposed amendment may need to be the subject of consultation with the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities before final acceptance by the Government, nonetheless insists upon this Parliament's right to properly scrutinise and amend all legislation put before it by the Executive; . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That embodies the proposition that with a cry of pain so far as this Parliament is concerned that, however much detailed scrutiny and attention we may give to the Bills which come forward now and in the future as part of this scheme in the form of amendments and identify faults or flaws which we as a parliament want to correct as the subject of a reasoned amendment, our hands are tied because the very nature of the legislative process in a co-operative arrangement of this kind is that the Parliament is presented with these Bills on a take-it or leave-it basis. The most one can do is to make something in the nature of a parliamentary recommendation to the Ministerial Council which may or may not be taken into account when the next round of amending legislation is in fact being put together. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no opportunity, given the very nature of the legislative process involved here where at the present time the Bills themselves must be the subject of prior unanimous agreement by the Ministerial Council, for flaws which do come to notice while a Bill in question is going through this Parliament or the complementary legislation is going through another parliament and consistent with the obligations into which the Commonwealth has entered, to get agreement through the Ministerial Council for the terms of this legislation. There is no opportunity for amendments to be properly dealt with. That does represent a complete abdication not in this instance of national legislative authority but of any legislative authority. We are simply not behaving like a parliament. What is, all too unfortunately, normally something of a charade becomes a total and unmitigated charade as a legislative process when we are confronted with Bills of this kind. It is hard enough normally to get governments to accept amendments, but in this sort of situation it is absolutely impossible. </PARA>
<PARA> This issue is not one of immediate significance with the present small package of amending Bills because the contents of each of the Bills, looked at in isolation, is, as far as the Opposition is concerned, generally acceptable. But it is a problem which we will certainly, as a legislature, as a parliament, strike acutely with the Companies Bill to be introduced later this year. I make this point and utter this cry of legislative pain not simply on behalf of the Opposition but on behalf of all members of this Parliament, on the Government side as well as on our side, who are equally impotent when confronted by an agreed package with a ribbon around it of the kind that is constituted by these Bills coming forward from the Ministerial Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point which speaks for itself and does not need any gloss is contained in paragraph (e) of the Opposition's amendment which states that the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> (e) calls upon the Government in the event of the breakdown for any reason of the scheme embodied in the Bills, to proceed immediately to the introduction of Commonwealth legislation for the national regulation of the acquisition of shares;</PARA>
<PARA>We on the Opposition side certainly hope that the Commonwealth will continue to acknowledge the existence of a relevant batch of constitutional powers in this area and will continue to make it clear to those States which may be tempted to be somewhat less than co-operative in their willingness to achieve genuine reform in this area that the Commonwealth will move in with unilateral legislation to control this important area if genuine momentum is not in fact sustained in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn more briefly to the Bills before us; let me note their content and the Opposition's reaction to them. The first in the package of four Bills is the National Companies and Securities Commission Amendment Bill. It is primarily aimed at facilitating the administration of the National Companies and Securities Commission in various non-controversial ways and, further, in making arrangements for the establishment of a secretariat for the Ministerial Council. I make only one comment in respect of this Bill, and that is that it is an interesting but as yet somewhat unresolved question as to whether the Council on the one hand and the Commission on the other hand will become, by virtue of their location in separate cities with separate administrative and policy-making apparatus attached to each of them-that separation being the product of political settlement that was recently reached-co-operative organisations working in genuine harmony for the improvement of the substance and practice of companies and securities law in this country or whether, more unfortunately, they will become rival organisations operating with a tension between them that is somewhat less than creative. One hopes that the former option will be the one that proves to eventuate. But it is a matter of some concern to anyone concerned with the effective administration of companies and securities law in this country that there is a potential for unconstructive rivalry between the two essential elements in the new machinery. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Bill in the package is the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Amendment Bill. This Bill contains a number of amendments-some of then of genuine substantive significance-to the legislative takeover code embodied in the parent Act. May I say that the most pleasing of the amendments contained in this Bill from the Opposition's point of view is clause 18 which amends the Schedule to the parent Act and which requires offerors to make, under Part A or under Part C, the on-market statements, a declaration of intentions in respect of the continuation or otherwise of the business of the target company such as major changes that are anticipated in respect of the operations of that company and in particular the redeployment of its fixed assets, if any is contemplated, and further, and crucially important, the intentions in respect of the future employment of the present employees of the target company. There are United Kingdom and the United States precedents for this kind of required declaration but the insertion of the provisions in the Bill is a tribute to the persistence, among others, of Mr Jacobi, the Labor Party member for Hawker, and Mr Chris Hurford, the Labor front bench member representing the division of Adelaide. It is very pleasing to the Opposition that the Government-and, indeed, the Ministerial Council-has picked up this proposal and embodied it in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other important changes worth mentioning very much in passing. Clause 7, which was introduced, one notices, against the opposition of the brokers, extends the prohibition against crossings, that is, transactions whereby the same broker acts for buyers as well as sellers, and extends that prohibition to on-market takeover offers. Clause 8 of the Bill requires the NCSC's consent to expert reports in relation to profit forecasts and asset valuations being included in Part B statements. They are both important and substantive matters and ones which the Opposition again very much welcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> The third Bill in the sequence is the Securities Industry Amendment Bill. Most of the provisions in this Bill are designed to bring the enforcement provisions of the parent Securities Industry Act into line with present and proposed new company law provisions of a similar kind. To that extent they are uncontroversial and again they are welcomed by the Opposition. That is not to say that we should necessarily regard these provisions as being the last word on the enforcement subject. There may well be room for going further in some respects, but certainly there is no opposition to these proposals as they presently stand. We notice in particular that some powers are extended by this Bill. In this respect I note especially clause 10, which confers power on the NCSC to require quick disclosures of key items of information to enable the Commission to operate quickly, efficiently and effectively in relation to various kinds of suspect market activity, especially with respect to takeovers. We welcome this additional flexibility which is provided by these provisions and the acknowledgment of the real commercial world that is inherent in them. </PARA>
<PARA> I make a further point about this Bill which is not quite so approving. That is that there is quite a deal of what can be described only as legal nonsense cluttering up the Bill unnecessarily-notionally for clarification purposes but in reality clearly being inserted only to soothe the neuroses of various lobby groups and critics. I refer especially to clause 5 of the Bill, which in orotund terms states that production of books shall be required only for the purposes of the legislation of the scheme. That is manifestly a redundant provision as it is inconceivable that any court would regard the authorities as being entitled to require the production of books for any other purpose than that related to the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> In clause 9 it is provided with due gravity that legal practitioners shall be required to disclose a relevant person's name and address only if the practitioner in question knows that person's name and address. One is delighted to see the tenderness of legislative concern for the legal profession but as a practical matter it is inconceivable that any such prosecution would be launched if there was not very good grounds for believing that there was, in fact, knowledge by the practitioner of the name and address of the person in question. </PARA>
<PARA> In clause 6 there is an absolutely extraordinary amendment, one I have never seen the likes of in the time that I have been following these matters. It is something that can be described only as a nutty exercise in pedantry. I refer to the clause 6 provision which includes an amendment designed solely to correct a spelling error in the original printing of the Bill in what is a spectacularly obvious typographical error. The word 'aircraft' is shown as 'airtcraft' with a 't' instead of a hypen at the end of the line. Again, the time and energy of the draftsman-not to mention the Ministerial Council-seem to have been spent in correcting what is manifestly a typographical error of the most trivial and unconfusing kind. </PARA>
<PARA> I note also, incidentally, another one of these nonsensical provisions in clause 6 of the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Amendment Bill, in which it is again gravely provided that it is not necessary for an offeror holding shares in a target company to dispatch a takeover offer to himself. The prospect of any offeror, under those circumstances, being prosecuted for a breach of that provision staggers the imagination. Why it has been put in to soothe, as I have said, the neuroses of some strident critic, one can only hazard a guess. The Opposition and I regard it as rather a foolish legislative exercise to be pandering to neuroses in such a way as to become as literally foolish as legislators appear to be when they are putting their names to these kinds of legislative provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> There may be a whole new pattern of draftsmanship at work in the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, but I have not been aware in the past of this kind of over-exaggerated care in not offending anybody and stating the obvious in capital letters. It does tend to bring a little degree of disrepute to the legislative process on which some of us are spending a good deal of our time trying to bring it into repute and make it more intelligible and commonsensical to the layman. Those points are made simply in passing. They are clearly of no substantive significance. They simply go to matters of style. </PARA>
<PARA> The final Bill in the package is the Companies and Securities (Interpretation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Amendment Bill. The amendments to this Bill simply extend some of the interpretative provisions of the parent Bill. Here again most of the provisions seem to be included simply for the purpose of clarification rather than introducing substantive changes in their own right. Probably the most important group of provisions are those identifying with a good deal more precision than was the case in the original Bill which offences are indictable, which offences on the other hand are summary and which kinds of offences are triable by either procedure. It also limits the sentences which can be passed in the context of someone being pursued before a court of summary jurisdiction in respect of an offence which is inherently triable-the notion here being to preserve the rights already enjoyed under existing State company law by those persons who are triable on indictment as that law now stands. These are technical points and I make no judgmental comment about them at this stage because none of these matters are inherently controversial. </PARA>
<PARA> I do make the point that this kind of provision raises indirectly the very difficult question, with which I believe the Parliament ought to come to grips at some stage, of whether jury trial, that is, the two-stage indictment process of initial committal proceedings followed by a trial before a judge and jury-a familiar vehicle for serious offences-is really ever appropriate for complex corporate crimes of the kind involving a mass of sophisticated and very detailed documentary evidence. It is a matter which causes a great deal of controversy and argument within and around the legal profession. It is not a matter that is in any way dealt with squarely by this piece of legislation. But I am beginning to form the view that it is a matter that will have to be very seriously tackled with a view perhaps to considering the possibility of the replacement of jurors by assessors where matters of very intricate corporate fraud or corporate crime are involved. It is a matter on which opinions differ and on which reasonable men and women can differ but I simply foreshadow it as a matter which demands some attention. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I repeat that whilst the Opposition does not oppose these Bills we have very serious continuing reservations about the whole legislative scheme on which the Government is here embarked. We are, whether we like it or not or whether some State Premiers like it or not, one nation. Certainly one of the most centrally important elements in our national life, whether socialists like it or not, is the operation of the private corporate sector and the securities market. The only appropriate way of regulating that sector and that securities industry activity is by national legislation undertaken by the Commonwealth in the courageous, forward-looking exercise of its own undoubted constitutional power. Until we have that, the kind of co-operative legislative scheme that is embodied here and continued here will continue to be the less than satisfactory product of very slow and very hard-won compromise. What is more and what ultimately seems to me to be the greatest worry of all is that it will always be capable of being undermined by the kind of narrow-minded, self-interested State chauvinism which has become all too unfortunately familiar in the life of this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with a package of what are substantially fine-tuned, if one is generous in the use of the word 'fine', amendments to the overall legislative scheme rather than matters of great substance or innovation. For the reasons that I supported the introduction of the National Companies and Securities Commission legislation and the other legislation which has been before the Senate, I support these Bills but do so with qualifications. I take the opportunity to indicate that this package of four Bills has been considered in detail by a Government members companies and securities matters committee. Whilst I do not propose to deal in detail with a whole lot of matters that were raised and considered by that committee, I indicate that there were matters about which people felt that there were questions and potential inadequacies. But for reasons which I will elaborate on in a moment, I do not regard it as appropriate at this stage to raise those matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to what I see as the overall principal purpose which we are endeavouring to serve. I want to quote from a paper given by Mr Paul Espie, the managing director of BA Australia Ltd to a Financial Times Conference last October. The subject of his speech was 'Australia-The Attractions for Future Investment'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> A primary objective of the financial system should be the efficient allocation of financial resources. </PARA>
<PARA> This implies that funds be able to flow freely between savers and borrowers without institutional impediments and that funds be allocated on the basis of price. When some interest rates are not permitted to move freely to reflect market priorities or perceived risks, and where institutional arrangements distort the free flow of funds between borrowers and savers, the financial system is less than efficient and imposes costs on the community, either directly or indirectly through the mis-allocation of real resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Hitherto the capital market has tended to be segmented with different groups of financial intermediaries operating under separate conditions and regulations. Whilst in many instances they participate in similar markets, the competition between groups of financial intermediaries has been either prevented or is inequitable. </PARA>
<PARA> A more freely competitive environment will ensure that the financial markets respond to changing needs, develop efficiently and operate at lower cost. </PARA>
<PARA>I think these are some of the things which ought to be at the forefront of the consideration given to this package of Bills, the package of Bills which has previously been before the chamber and the ones which will undoubtedly come to the chamber. The need is to have financial markets which can respond to changing needs which can develop efficiently and which can operate at a minimum cost for the function being served. I add one further thing that Mr Espie did not dwell upon and that is that they ought to operate fairly as well as efficiently to ensure that people who wish to participate are not misled and have the appropriate amount of information available to them. I am not saying that Mr Espie was unaware of that because he does refer to it in a later stage of his paper. He did not refer to it in the part I read. The point is that we can lose sight of the main purpose in the morass of detail which seems to have been built up around what was originally quite a simple concept.</PARA>
<PARA> I regard it as unfortunate and a matter for comment at this stage-I am speaking of the general rather than the particular detail of these Bills-that we seem to be heading for ever into more and more detailed regulation towards the stage where the free, open, fair and efficient operation of our capital markets becomes less and less likely and where people become more and more bound down by regulation and less and less clear on what are the opportunities and the obligations. It is unfortunate that the inquiry into the Australian financial system could not be a little further advanced at the time we consider aspects of the National Companies and Securities Commission legislation because I think the two things are interrelated to a substantial extent. It is foolish, as Mr Espie says, for us to look at the operation of some of the intermediaries in the market without looking at the operation of others. It is foolish for us to be looking at some aspects of the impacts on the financial system and regulating those while permitting to operate in either an unregulated way or a way in which information is not available others in relation to which there is not full accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> In those respects I refer to the huge differences that exist between the impact on the financial markets of Australia created as a result of the activities of the Loan Council, of the governments making up the Loan Council, the huge impacts of the activities of statutory authorities of both the Commonwealth and State in funding at incredible gearing ratios-they enjoy government guarantee and are therefore able to operate on a gearing ratio which would not be available to any other sector of the community-the distortions that this creates and the lack of published knowledge in relation to that in comparison with the knowledge which is sought and enforced, particularly as a result of the legislative package which we have before us and that to which it relates, from other sectors of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make the point today that whilst we are happily looking at enforcing a system which we believe and hope will improve the standard of performance of a part of the operation of the total financial system, we should not forget the existence of the others and the need to interrelate the lot from the point of view of regulation and information. I think it would probably be reasonably well known to honourable senators that my views as to regulation are that it is far better to be able to have enforced disclosure than it is to have 50,000 penalties for breaches of a great hoard of rules which more often than not are unenforceable and unlikely to be enforced anyway. If they are enforced it takes so long and the enforcement occurs so long after the event that the effect of it is only one of punishment for breach rather than for something which moves towards the more efficient and equitable operation of the market. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been asked not to speak long this afternoon. I am prepared to adhere to that request. I was sorry that when the major Bills came on for debate previously-these are only amending Bills-I did not have the opportunity to speak at all. I suppose I can only say that things have improved. I understand that there is a need to try to get this legislation through this afternoon. I support that need. That is one of the points I want to make. As Senator Evans said, this whole proposal reached the stage in 1974 of a general consensus on the need for a national approach. It was unfortunate that there were differences of opinion about how to go about it and perhaps a little extremism in what was proposed by the then Government. This led to delays which in turn led to the creation of the situation which was outlined by Senator Evans of some five years of negotiations between the Commonwealth and the States. I am afraid that causes me to diminish somewhat the degree of sanguine expectation which I have as to the speed with which the whole system will be able to react in what is an extremely fast moving area of economic activity. I hope, however, that we shall be able to continue. This course has been set upon. Whilst having a different preference as to how we ought to have gone about it, I see it as desirable that we go down this track now that we are on it and part of the way down, to get it to the stage of full implementation as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> It is with that enthusiasm that I return to what I said a moment ago. I do not wish to do anything to delay the passage of these Bills at all, but rather to encourage in every possible way their being carried into effect as soon as possible. I take the opportunity to compliment the Commissioners of the National Companies and Securities Commission, particularly the full time Commissioners, Mr Masel, Mr Coleman and Mr Greenwood, on the work that has been done so far in a number of respects in establishing and making ready the National Companies and Securities Commission for the role which is intended for it when we and the Parliaments of the States get round to giving them the legislative machinery to enable them to act. In my view, the sooner that takes place the better. I believe that they have done an excellent job, particularly from a public education point of view, of moving through the interested community ensuring that the hopes, aspirations and the principles which may be expected to apply and the objectives being sought by the Commission are understood widely by the community. I think that that is a most encouraging sign. </PARA>
<PARA> What is not encouraging is the inordinate delay that seems to take place where the co-operative federalism approach is adopted for something which, beyond any shadow of doubt, in my view-here I totally agree with Senator Evans-is a Commonwealth responsibility for which the Commonwealth should have assumed and asserted the responsibility from 1901. It took from 1908 to 1971, I think it was, for that to be clarified by the High Court, which went off the rails somewhat in 1908. It eventually got it back on the rails in the Rocla pipes case in 1971. Since 1971, when the matter was put beyond any real doubt-if any doubt really existed-by the High Court there has been no excuse for the ambivalence of attitude adopted. It has been claimed that co-operative federalism is necessary in this case because of some problems in constitutional law. I believe that the real problems are far more the problems of ensuring that there is co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States in enforcement and in investigation in relation to the whole area. As there were threats of a failure to co-operate by some of the States and perhaps a lower degree of enthusiasm likely for co-operation by all of the States if they were not involved, the government of the day took the decision to adopt the co-operative federalist approach. That decision has been taken and I do not see the slightest advantage for us today to go back and say: 'It would have been better to do it the other way and, therefore, it would be better to start reviewing how it has been done'. The view I would like to adopt is: Let us try to make this work and let us get on with it as soon as we can. I again refer to the comments which I made when the National Companies and Securities Commission Bill was being debated in November 1979. I do not resile from these views at all. I restate them. I said:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe the only difference which has occurred since the change of government in 1975 is that a different approach has been adopted which I find-I will refer to this aspect in a moment-less than the most desirable. However, it is a perfectly justifiable approach. The stance taken is to see whether the federalist approach will work. If that cannot work the Government can turn to legislating in the way Senator Evans suggested; that is, the Commonwealth going it alone. This legislation is a challenge to federalism.</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat and emphasise that today. It is a challenge to federalism. If it cannot be made to work more expeditiously than it has so far, the co-operative federalism approach is damning itself. I continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It is my firm belief that there is no real doubt that the Commonwealth has the power and the duty in this area. If the federalist approach does not work, if there is obstructionism from the States, it will be the responsibility of whatever government is in power in Canberra to ensure that this national approach is adopted. If necessary, it will have to go it alone. That is the challenge of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not resile from those views. I add: Let us get on with getting them implemented as soon as we can so that we can see whether the scheme works. In conclusion, I raise one other matter; that is, the decision by the Government to exempt the stockbrokers from the area being examined by the Trade Practices Commission. The basis for that decision was apparently that the National Companies and Securities Commission would have a similar role. It seems to me that it is a further example of the problems that arise where one section of the total number of involved sections in our financial system is subjected to one form of regulation and another section is subjected to a completely different form of regulation. However, that has been decided upon. Perhaps it is not appropriate today to question it. It is appropriate to point out how essential it is to the development of Australia and the average person's opportunity to participate in the anticipated resources boom. </PARA>
<PARA> There is much evidence to indicate that this is well and truly under way already. Unless brokerage charges can be kept at a minimum, unless opportunity is given for the average individual to participate in the ownership of the companies which are in the major developing areas of the economy, we will have done a disservice which dissuades the average person from putting his money into national development, taking an interest and feeling that he will get a reward from the developments which will take place over the next decade or two. I believe that it is essential that steps be taken, and taken at an early stage, to review the whole way in which brokerage commissions are charged. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of negotiated commissions and all of the other matters which were raised in the Senate Committee's report as long ago as 1974, still appear to be matters which have not been adequately considered or dealt with. I was delighted, however, to see-this caused me to change my mind about the action which I would take-an announcement by Mr Masel just a few days ago indicating that one of the early matters being investigated is the question of brokers' commission rates, the negotiation thereof and the fixing thereof. I therefore do not propose to move any addendum to the second reading motion. I had had in mind that it would be desirable to give the National Companies and Securities Commission a clear indication of the Senate's view of the importance of this question by putting it as an addendum to the second reading motion. In view of the fact that it is already taking steps in relation to it I just pause to congratulate it on doing that and encourage it to do it as expeditiously as possible and certainly to give it a high priority. </PARA>
<PARA> For those brief reasons I support the Bills with the qualifications which I have outlined. I agree with much of the sentiment of what Senator Evans has said, but I do not see it as constructive to do other than simply support the legislation getting through and the whole matter being tried out as soon as possible. I therefore do not see it as productive to support the amendment. I do not propose to proceed with the amendment which I had in mind until I found out that the Commission was already doing what I had in mind it ought to do. </PARA>

<PARA>The Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations-ACIR-was established by legislation in 1976 following agreement reached between the Commonwealth and the States, for the purpose of improving inter-government co-operation in accordance with the federalism policy. Membership of the Council comprises five members of the Commonwealth Parliament, one member from each of the six State Parliaments, six local government representatives and five distinguished citizens, one of whom, Professor R. C. Gates, is Chairman. </PARA>
<PARA> To give effect to its object of improving inter-government co-operation the Council has two principal functions. The first, which must be exercised subject to and in accordance with directions given at the Premiers Conference, is 'to inquire into and keep under consideration and review matters relating to inter-government co-operation', and to make recommendations to the participating governments and the Australian Council of Local Government Associations on these matters. The second is to inquire into, and report on, any matters relating to inter-government co-operation referred to it by a majority of the Premiers at a Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA> Since its establishment, the Council has provided valuable advice to all spheres of government in respect of the relationships between them and such matters as interchange of staff between the various spheres of government. It is now some four years since the original Act establishing the Council was enacted. In that time the Council's operations and changes in governmental arrangements have brought to light the need for amendments to the Act. These amendments are aimed principally at reinforcing the Council's independence in the performance of its functions by providing for the Council to become a body corporate with its own bank account, to have control over its staffing arrangements, exempting the Council from Commonwealth and State taxation laws and by making it clear that the Council is not subject to direction by or on behalf of the Commonwealth. These changes require consequential amendments to ensure appropriate financial accountability in relation to auditing, accounting procedures and financial reporting. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important amendment provides for the change in title of the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly, which has observer status in the Council. There are also machinery-type amendments relating to the appointment of an acting chairman and to enable the Council to prescribe by resolution procedures for meetings and administration. The amendments embodied in the Bill have been agreed to by State Premiers, the Australian Council of Local Government Associations and the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations. I also draw to the attention of honourable senators the fact that although the Northern Territory does not at present have representation on the ACIR it has sought admission as a full member of the Council on the same basis as each of the six States. The Commonwealth supports this change which will require a future amendment to the ACIR Act. We are actively seeking agreement of all States to this measure. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA>This Bill is consequential to the Commonwealth Teaching Service Amendment Bill 1981. Staff employed by authorities of the Northern Territory, other than the Northern Territory Public Service, presently derive their long service leave entitlements from the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976. Since the attainment of self-government, the Commonwealth Government and the Northern Territory Government consider that it is appropriate that staff of Northern Territory authorities should be covered by Northern Territory long service leave conditions rather than by conditions specified in Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to exclude from the coverage of the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act staff of the proposed Teaching Service of the Northern Territory thereby enabling Northern Territory conditions to be applied to them. The Bill also amends the Act so as to enable staff of other Northern Territory authorities to be excluded by regulations from Commonwealth long service leave provisions. This will avoid the necessity of having to amend the Act further to exclude where it is desirable so to do, from the Commonwealth long service leave scheme staff of future Northern Territory authorities. Clause 3A has been included at the request of the Presiding Officers of the Parliament. The clause enables them to delegate their powers under the Act to grant long service leave or authorise payment in lieu of long service leave to staff of the parliamentary departments. The amendment will give the Presiding Officers the same power of delegation in respect of long service leave as they already have in relation to other conditions of employment of staff in Parliamentary departments. The opportunity has been taken to make at the same time a minor drafting amendment to the Act. Clause 4 amends section 10 of the Act to put beyond doubt the intention that the long service leave scheme does not apply to persons employed by the Commonwealth and remunerated solely by fees, allowance or commission. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The main purpose of the Commonwealth Teaching Service Amendment Bill is to provide for the compulsory transfer of Commonwealth Teaching Service personnel based in the Northern Territory to the Northern Territory Teaching Service. The Bill also provides for an amendment to the Commonwealth Teaching Service Act directed at the categories of administrative staff that the Commissioner may employ. Honourable senators will be aware that up to 30 June 1979 responsibility for the provision of educational services in the Northern Territory rested with the Commonwealth. While this responsibility was transferred to the Northern Territory Government on 1 July 1979, it was decided that the Commonwealth Teaching Service would for the time being continue to provide teachers for Northern Territory schools. The Northern Territory Government has now decided to establish a Northern Territory Teaching Service and has requested the Commonwealth to transfer Commonwealth Teaching Service personnel working in the Northern Territory to this Service. Complementary legislation has been introduced in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly to set up this Teaching Service and to cover the transfer of Commonwealth Teaching Service personnel to this service. The two Bills are seen as complementary, and there has been close consultation with the Northern Territory Government on the arrangements for the transfer. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the Bill concerned with this transfer follow, in general, similar amendments made to the Public Service Act to effect the transfer of Australian public servants to the Northern Territory Public Service. In order to ensure that the existing terms and conditions of employment of transferred officers and employees are maintained, clause 7 provides for the Minister to declare through a notice published in the Gazette that he is satisfied that the laws of the Northern Territory comply with the requirements of the Bill. The Minister may revoke this declaration if a change occurs in Northern Territory laws so that they no longer comply with these requirements. The Bill provides for the preservation of the rights and entitlements of transferred officers and employees in respect of such matters as salary, recreation and sick leave, and long service leave. The Bill also specifies the conditions under which a transferred officer may be re-appointed to the Commonwealth Teaching Service by way of transfer or promotion. Special re-entry to the Commonwealth Teaching Service is provided for in circumstances where an officer has been disadvantaged by the compulsory transfer. A Re-appointments Review Committee is to be established to determine eligibility for re-appointment to the Commonwealth Teaching Service under the conditions specified in clause 4 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to providing for the transfer of personnel to the Northern Territory Teaching Service, clause 3 of the Bill amends Section 18 of the Act to enable administrative staff required by the Commissioner to be persons employed under either the Public Service Act or the Commonwealth Teaching Service Act. This will enable the Commissioner to secure the best qualified people for these positions. I believe that the Commonwealth Teaching Service has made a significant contribution to the development of education in the Northern Territory since its inception in 1972. The Government takes the view that it is now more appropriate that teachers in the Northern Territory should be members of the Northern Territory Teaching Service. This Bill provides for this transfer while at the same time preserving the terms and conditions of employment of the transferred officers and preserving the right of re-entry to the Commonwealth Teaching Service in appropriate circumstances for transferred officers. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was the person involved in the matter discussed by the Standing Orders Committee, I felt that I ought to say a few words about it. I notice that the matter was referred to the Privileges Committee on 29 May. I find, having looked up the record of the debate, that I was escorted out of the Senate on that day for having quoted from the Illawarra Mercury because it was claimed that I had used unparliamentary language. To put the matter in its perspective I have to use that language again. I used the words: 'Lies, lies, lies'. Because of that I incurred the wrath of a sufficient number of members of the Senate to be suspended. The Standing Orders Committee, in sub-item 10 of its report, states, in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee considers that, as the report of the Privileges Committee strongly suggested, this rule of debate is a fundamentally sound one and to abandon it would allow speeches to be made deliberately circumventing the prohibition on unparliamentary language. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, as I have pointed out in this chamber on many occasions, if an honourable senator moves a substantive motion he can use any sort of language and have it accepted. We had to suffer that during our reign of office from 1972 to 1975 when honourable senators who now sit opposite, one of whom was then Leader of the Opposition, moved substantive motions in the form of amendments to the Budget and the loan Bills accusing the then Prime Minister and his Ministers of being corrupt, deceitful and dishonest and said that honourable senators who then sat on the Government back bench were of the same calibre. Of course, they got away with it. Yet when I quoted in this place a story from a newspaper which castigated the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the then Treasurer-the story that the Illawarra Mercury ran at the time dealt with taxation, from memory-and which said that what was being put about by the Government with regard to taxation was all lies, I incurred the wrath of the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick). The President had to put the question and I was wheeled out of the place. The only satisfaction I got that day was that I was not wheeled out at the end of the Wilkinson sword which was introduced into this place as a publicity gimmick when Senator Magnus Cormack was President and to which I objected strongly at the time. However, I feel something ought to be done about honourable senators being allowed, by way of substantive motion, to accuse members of this chamber and of the other chamber of being corrupt, dishonest, deceitful and similar words. As a matter of fact, they have also been used in debate by Senator Carrick. I thought it was ironical that when I used the word 'lies' he moved for my suspension. When we were in government he was quite prepared during debate on the loan Bills to accuse us of being dishonest and deceitful. Yet he took umbrage when I quoted from a newspaper. There we have the double standards. I would have thought that the Standing Orders Committee, in its wisdom, would have seen fit to recommend some alteration in the Standing Orders, either to prevent the use of the types of words which I have just cited in a substantive motion or not to cause honourable senators to be expelled from this place when they use words such as 'lies'. Of course, I could quite easily have got around the situation if I had been prepared to substitute the word 'untruths' or something like that. That would have been accepted, but I could then have been accused of not quoting correctly from the newspaper I was using. I had to insist that I be allowed to use those words so I could not be accused of misquoting in this Parliament words used in a newspaper. That is past history now, but I daresay that if a similar matter occurs again and I have to use those words, I might be prepared to do so and to incur the wrath of the Senate. I would have hoped, this matter having been referred to the Privileges Committee and to the Standing Orders Committee, that something would have been done with respect to words used in a substantive motion. I am looking at Senator Withers who has just looked over at me. He was one senator who was prepared to move motions containing words accusing us of being liars and deceivers-the worst names that members of the then Opposition could lay their tongues to. Those words were not thought up on the spur of the moment. They had been given due consideration by every member of the then Opposition in the party room, otherwise they would not have got into this place in the form of a substantive motion. I say again that it is time the Standing Orders Committee gave due consideration to recommending to the Senate a Standing Order which states either that words which are offensive to some of us can be used or cannot be used even in a substantive motion. We could not object at the time because it was ruled that Standing Orders protected the movers of such amendments, but there was no Standing Order to protect an honourable senator like me when on 29 May 1979 I quoted from a newspaper. All I can say is that it is time that something was done to correct that anomaly which in my view exists in the Standing Orders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is another matter I seem to have played some part in. As I recall, I was the honourable senator who was refused leave to make a short statement in reply to what the President said when he brought down a statement concerning questions asked in the Senate and the time taken up with questions. As is pointed out in the report of the Standing Orders Committee, as a consequence leave was refused to Ministers for the rest of that day. As a reprisal leave was refused every time a Minister sought leave to do anything and in particular sought leave for the incorporation of second reading speeches in Hansard. I was not given the opportunity to explain why I sought leave. Had I been given the opportunity it would have taken about 10 seconds of the Senate's time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is another anomaly. The refusal of leave is a device which can be used by the Opposition as well as by the Government. I think the Opposition can create more havoc for the Government by refusing it leave than the Government can create for the Opposition. If it brings in long-winded second reading speeches, only one honourable senator on this side of the chamber needs to object to the granting of leave to incorporate them in Hansard and the works are really gummed up, as the Senate found out on that day when I was refused leave to make a short statement in response to a statement brought down by the President. I will not suggest that the Standing Orders Committee ought to make any recommendations that there ought to be a Standing Order to prevent honourable senators refusing leave because I think to refuse leave is a great weapon that we on this side of the chamber have. I hope the Government learned its lesson on that day because we can easily use that weapon again and might well do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of presentation of committee reports is a difficult one. I think many of us are worried by it. I am certainly far from satisfied with the conclusion the Standing Orders Committee has reached. We all know that when a committee report is brought down and the chairman of the committee makes his statement it is customary to have some debate on the report at that time. But there is the problem that other honourable senators have not seen the committee report. It has been suggested at times that the report should be debated at some later stage. We know that there is a considerable amount of public interest in these reports at the time they are brought down and if there is no opportunity for some debate to take place it may well be that such report of the Senate will never be noticed by the media, the public and so forth. Someone may move that the Senate take note of the paper and it may not be debated again for six to nine months, by which time the interest in and the urgency of the matter will have gone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Standing Orders Committee came to this conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA> As was indicated during the debate in the Senate, the solution to the problem seen by Honourable Senators is not in making committee reports available before they are tabled but in being able to debate them shortly after their presentation, by agreement and arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite frankly, I do not think that is a solution at all. I do not read that as meaning that it is a recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee that senators should not be entitled to debate reports at the time they are brought down. It is put forward in the form of a solution. To table the report and not have any opportunity for debate on it until some later time is unsatisfactory. There will be very little interest in the report if it comes up for debate the next day and some honourable senators make some comment on it. Reports are known to the members of the committee concerned and therefore those members of the committee can open up the debate and argument and at least encourage some interest in the report if there is a debate at that time. I think it would be highly unsatisfactory if the debate were in any way to be prevented from taking place. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise the fact that other senators are not in a position to enter properly into the debate. If there are other honourable senators who have a close interest in the report including, perhaps, the chairman of another committee which is doing contemporaneously some investigation of the same subject and wants to make comment on the report, I think it desirable that those senators should see the report. I do not believe that this so-called magic right of the Senate to have first knowledge of the report is something that should be absolute. Some people are aware that reports are going to be brought down and will see the tabled statements and so forth before the matter comes before the Senate, but it is important that the Senate should promote and highlight its own reports and encourage interest in them. I am afraid that this suggestion-it is not a recommendation-of the Standing Orders Committee that we should not really allow any debate at the time the report is brought down is one with which I do not agree. I think it necessary to have some debate at that time to encourage interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to prolong unduly debate on this section of the report but I believe it is an important section. I agree that in all instances the rights of the Senate must be safeguarded but in this case I am puzzled at and indeed take some small exception to the statement that 'the prohibition on the publication of a committee report prior to its presentation to the Senate is a necessary safeguard of the right of the Senate to have first knowledge of the reports of its committees'. I question just what that statement means. What is 'the Senate' under those circumstances? Is it this room? Is it the tables and chairs? Is it the carpet? No, it is not; it is the senators. The situation with these reports is that some senators have knowledge of them and the rest do not. So, in fact, the Senate does not have first knowledge of the report of the committees; some senators have first knowledge of the report of the committees. The Senate as a whole does not have first knowledge of the reports of the committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take Senator Missen's point and will not extend it unduly. Members of the committee in question know the content of the report. The staff know and it is possible that some other people know. It is sometimes highly pertinent, depending on what the subject of the report is, for senators to have an opportunity to comment at the time it is brought down, as Senator Missen said, particularly in the case of controversial reports. Through the media the public is made aware of the controversy of the report or the recommendations of the report. The only access by the media to the opinions of senators who have an interest in that subject is through those who are in a privileged position in terms of prior knowledge. I believe it is important that some reasonable arrangement be reached-and I understand what principles must be safeguarded-so that when a report is important other senators can have the opportunity to comment at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly agree with the sentiments of the Standing Orders Committee report that reports should be debated shortly after their presentation. This is highly desirable in many cases but I am afraid that pious statement does not help us at all. I question the use of a term such as 'the right of the Senate' when clearly there is a bit of muddle-headed thinking in that sentence about just what the Senate is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support what Senator Martin has said. It seems to me that there are three points at which it might be said that reports are available to the Senate. The first point is the time at which the report becomes available to senators. As Senator Martin has made quite clear, there are some senators, normally the members of the committee concerned, who will have seen the report before it reaches the Senate while other honourable senators will not. The second point is the time at which the report is publicly available, in other words, when it has been tabled and distributed throughout the House and to the media. Finally, there is the point at which debate takes place on the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that once it is publicly available to the media, unless debate takes place forthwith as a media event, as a matter of publicity, the debate will be meaningless. Therefore, I support the point which I think Senator Missen was making, namely, that debate must take place immediately the report is made publicly available. But I can see no reason in principle why some members of the Senate know about this report before it is publicly tabled in the Senate. Why should the report not be available to all senators and to no one else, say, two hours before the report is due to be tabled so that those who wish to take part in the debate may be fully informed on the content of the report? So, the report is issued to all senators two hours before the report is tabled, the report is tabled, the statement on the report is made and debate immediately ensues. The debate by those who wished to take part in it would then be an informed debate. It seems to me that all purposes would be served by such a procedure. It would not be generally released until it was tabled in the Senate. It would be given to all senators two hours before the official tabling statement was made. An informed debate could take place immediately. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to say only a few words in this discussion. I should have thought that what comprised the Senate was well known. The Constitution states what the Senate shall be composed of and how its members shall be elected. That obviously means that the members of the Senate comprise the Senate. If it is desirable to debate a report immediately, some provision should be made to debate it. I think the practice has unfortunately developed in the Senate recently whereby some responsible member of the opposing party says all that he wishes to say on a matter and then seeks leave to continue his remarks later, but will never again refer to it. Everyone else who wishes to speak has to seek leave which can be refused by any person. Unless somebody has something to say in continuation we ought to drop this habit of seeking leave to continue our remarks later, and then a discussion can ensue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but the odd occasion could arise when there was some libellous statement in a report which was not covered by privilege. Of course, it may be that there are cases of libel but that nobody picks them up or no one is inclined to proceed with them. I may be wrong on that point. We, by virtue of our office and position, would be protected from a libel action. But it is one of the things that needs to be decided. If there is the possibility of a solution to the problem about whether we could have a discussion, I think the Committee should examine the question. But there is also the other question: I think that it could disrupt government orders of the day and the carrying out of business.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support what has been said by the previous speakers. The Standing Orders Committee report, of course, is the property of the Senate, and that is the senators themselves. Some of those senators have the advantage of knowing what is in that report, but there may be many other senators who may be interested to know what is in that report and they may wish to speak to it. They are placed at an absolute disadvantage because they first see the report when it is presented in the chamber and they have no time to speak in depth to that report. I support the suggestion that has been made that perhaps senators could be given an opportunity, say two hours before the report's presentation, to look at it. As has been pointed out by Senator Cavanagh, this could create legal problems. I do not know about that, but I suggest that we could refer this matter back to the Standing Orders Committee to enable it to have a further look at it. I know some honourable senators on that Committee have legal backgrounds. They could investigate this matter. I hope that they refer the matter back to the Senate after they have another look at it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One other suggestion I make is that in order to give senators a further opportunity to peruse reports, perhaps the day before presentation, the Senate be informed of what reports are likely to be presented.

Then some means could be devised in the Standing Orders whereby that report must be debated in the next week of sittings.

Here we have a report which has been compiled by senators sitting on a standing committee. They gave much of their time during the days when Parliament was not sitting. The taxpayers have been put to a lot of expense. In the main, two people speak to the report after it is tabled and it is never called on again in the Senate for full debate. My suggestion is that reports be tabled on a given day, a short statement from the chairman be made-I do not suggest that a debate take place; just a short statement-and then the Standing Orders be altered to ensure that that report, irrespective of what the Government thinks is debated during the next week of sitting.

What we ought to have is a rule which embodies the sorts of things we have been talking about with a safeguard for that exception and not let the extreme case in which there is a possibility of libel dictate the manner in which we handle all reports because that would not always be necessary.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is another item which I think reflects a very poor reaction from the Standing Orders Committee the members of which, apart from Senator Rae, are not in the chamber now to hear our criticisms. Item 5 deals with the question of whether Estimates committees should take evidence in camera. The opinion of the Committee is that they should not. The Committee points out that Estimates committees, in examining the Estimates, perform a function that was formerly carried out in the Committee of the Whole. The Committee of the Whole does not take in camera evidence. In other words, the Committee report contends that as it has not been done before it cannot be done in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not accept the mighty conservative attitude which has been adopted in the report. As I see it, it is not satisfactory that an Estimates committee, which is expected to go into more detail than the Committee of the Whole did in the past, should have to run off to the Senate if something arises which means that, in its opinion, it ought to hear evidence in camera. This question may arise suddenly, perhaps when embarrassing matters affecting privacy or commercial confidentiality need to be discussed. As Senator Rae has pointed out, such cases would be very obvious examples. I do not think that in such cases the Committee should have to refer to the Senate. The judgment of the members of the committee should be sufficient to enable them to make the decision. That suggestion is turned down by the Standing Orders Committee on the basis that it has not been done in the past and therefore should not be done in the future. That is not an argument, in my view. I will certainly vote against this item also. I have been persuaded on two occasions now to vote with more courtesy to the Standing Orders Committee for amendments which ask the Committee to consider matters again but I am certainly not prepared to vote for the attitude that we find here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to disagree with Senator Missen. I was once chairman of an Estimates committee in which a request was made by a witness to give in camera evidence. The witness was appearing on behalf of a statutory corporation which was in competition with other enterprises in the community. The corporation claimed, on the commercial confidentiality basis to which Senator Rae and Senator Missen have referred, that answering a particular question would jeopardise its competitive position in a commercial situation and requested that it be allowed to give in camera evidence to the committee. It was pointed out to the corporation that a case would have to be made to the Senate to enable the committee to take the evidence in camera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The committee waited for the statutory corporation to make a case to it on why the evidence should be heard in camera so the committee could determine whether the request was one which it would put to the Senate. Having had that proposition put to it the corporation in question decided that commercial confidentiality was not of such critical importance and answered the question. Of course, we had no basis for deciding, because we did not know the answer to the question, whether commercial interests were at stake. In fact, they were not. Now, it might have just been the case of an over-nervous or over-shy witness. The request might also have been a try-on. In any case, it was not necessary for the committee to request that in camera evidence be given. I think we should bear that in mind. The committee was very conscious at the time of the fact that if it was inclined, on the basis of the case made to it, to allow in camera evidence to be given it would then have to present a recommendation to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that Senate Estimates committees ought to be able to sit in camera without a very good reason and without the permission of the Senate. The committees are meant to represent the whole of the Senate and its interests. To make a decision like that, which would be made with no warning to the Senate, would not be in the interests of the proceedings of the Senate. It may be that the committee would choose to defer taking evidence and inform the Senate, but it may be that the committee could decide that it was important to its proceedings to give permission to proceed in camera, and do so immediately. In that case nobody other than the members of the committee or senators sitting in on the committee at that stage would have any idea that an issue of such importance had arisen. I do not think that it would be a satisfactory alternative just to say that the Senate ought to be notified that in camera evidence was going to be taken. I think that sort of evidence ought not to be allowed to be given to an Estimates committee, which is different from a standing committee or a select committee, without the Senate knowing, agreeing and giving the committee permission. I do not think that it hurts at all for a case to be made. If there is a case it can be made. It can be made by a witness, department or statutory corporation to the Estimates committee and in turn to the Senate. But I think we are more likely to find that the present sanction deters witnesses from requesting the privilege of giving in camera evidence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Missen that a mighty conservative attitude has been taken on this question. I think what we are forgetting is that the Standing Order in question deals only with Estimates committees. The Australian Labor Party originally opposed the establishment of the Estimates committees and was given an assurance that they would not replace the Committee of the Whole, which is a public forum for inquiry. The Estimates committees are designed to investigate the expenditure of public moneys by public organisations. They are concerned not with secret organisations, but with public organisations and public money. The public has a right to know what is happening to its money. It is hard to visualise a case in which an answer may prejudice a company's commercial competitiveness with some other company, but there are occasions when the Senate could be approached.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think we would be carrying out our obligations to conduct a proper scrutiny of public money if it were done behind closed doors where no one knew about it. I think the fact that publicity is given to statements secures their truthfulness. I wonder how many companies would escape public scrutiny if we had a practice of hearing in camera evidence even when there was no need to attach secrecy to the evidence. If we understand that this is an examination of the expenditure of public money by public organisations there is no justification for secrecy in the giving of evidence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter has a long history. It goes back to 1972. An Estimates committee dealt with the same statutory authority to which Senator Martin referred a little while ago. I do feel somewhat sorry for that statutory authority. It did before her Committee what was suggested ought to have been done back in 1972. Be that as it may. At that time the Senate agreed that there were no matters about which a statutory authority could refuse to answer questions of a Senate Estimates committee or the Senate. It was noted that it was desirable to give some protection to the commercial confidentiality which may be otherwise breached. It was noted also that, for other good reasons, it may be necessary for the Committee to have the capacity to take evidence in camera. In 1972 the then Senator Murphy moved a motion. The motion stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Committee is of the opinion that the matter of Estimates committees meeting in private session should be referred to the Standing Orders Committee for its consideration and report to the Senate prior to the next meetings of the Estimates committees and in this regard confirms the opinion so expressed by Estimates Committee B in its report. </PARA>
<PARA>Estimates Committee B, in its report at that time, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Committee is of the opinion that the matter of Estimates committees meeting in private session should be referred to the Standing Orders Committee for its consideration and report to the Senate prior to the next meetings of the Estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA>Estimates Committee B made that recommendation to the Senate, with the view of ensuring that whilst we could get all evidence we could also do the fair thing and ensure that protection, where warranted, was provided. It seems to me, after this matter has been debated in this chamber for more than eight years, quite incredible to keep hearing the argument that it is better to get nothing than to receive it in camera. That is the part that I cannot understand. People continue to adopt that view which has been held by the majority of the Standing Orders Committee over the years. This matter has been referred on I think three, if not four, occasions to the Standing Orders Committee. The Senate has repeatedly resolved that it was a matter which ought to be explored with an expectation that something was going to come out of the Standing Orders Committee to provide for evidence to be taken in camera. Each time it goes to the Standing Orders Committee it comes back with a recommendation that the principle should not be adopted. It is quite a yo yo. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime many large commercial or quasi-commercial statutory authorities are placed in a most invidious position. They can be very adversely affected and prejudiced severely in their commercial undertakings by the disclosure to their competitors of confidential information which has yet to be acted upon. We do wish to assert-a very clear assertion was made in 1972, 1974 and on another occasion since then, but I have forgotten the date-the right of the Senate and its committee to obtain all information which it requires from statutory authorities. The only fair way we can possibly do that is for the Senate to give to the Estimates committees the power to take evidence in camera where they deem it appropriate. It may be that once the committee has taken the evidence in camera it will say: 'That should not remain in camera. There is no real commercial confidentiality about that. The authority has not made out a case for it to remain in camera. It will be published'. At least the opportunity is there. It may be that the matter is of overwhelming importance and the consideration of the protection of the commercial confidentiality of the authority is overridden by the public interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I have listened with great interest to this debate. I see some problems arising if Estimates committees are going to be given the power to take evidence in camera because Estimates committees are entirely different from Senate standing or select committees where a staff of experts is made available to give advice. Senate Estimates commitees do not have that facility. Under our present Standing Orders any senator is allowed to attend an Estimates committee hearing. Any senator is not allowed to attend a standing committee hearing if evidence is being taken in camera. Many changes will have to be made to the Standing Orders if Senate committees are going to be given the power to take evidence in camera. The Standing Orders will have to be amended to the effect that only the elected members of the Estimates committee can attend the hearing in camera. The matter that has been raised at that Estimates committee hearing may have been raised by a senator who is not an elected member of that committee, and it is his right to do so. Where will the line be drawn as to who is to attend the hearing of the Estimates committee when evidence is taken in camera? I ask Senator Rae: Has any thought been given to that problem?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter which I wish to raise-I will mention it in regard to another issue with which this report deals-is the fact that Estimates committees are now assuming the role of the Committee of the Whole. Many matters are debated in Estimates committees about which we are prevented from debating when they come before the Committee of the Whole because the gag is applied. That is a problem which we run into just about every year now when we debate the Appropriation Bills in the Committee of the Whole. People may have an interest in a certain subject which comes before a certain Estimates committee but are not able to attend that Estimates committee hearing because they are involved in another Estimates committee. They may wish to pursue the matter in the Committee of the Whole but are prevented from doing so because the Government has taken the view that the debate is dragging on too long and puts a gag on it. Therefore, the matter cannot be explored. </PARA>
<PARA> That is another problem which is fast rearing its ugly head with Estimates committees. I will oppose this proposition unless I can be convinced that there is some way in which the Standing Orders can be altered so that all members who have an interest in a matter are allowed to attend the Estimates committee hearings at which in camera evidence is taken. </PARA>

Is the argument that we would have to change the Standing Orders a reasoned argument against the changing of the rule? I do not think it is a valid argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is said in this report that we have to remember that the Estimates committees are performing a function formerly carried out in the Committee of the Whole and that the Committee of the Whole does not take in camera evidence. Are we to be bound by a change in procedure made in 1972? Are we to be bound in 20 or 30 years time by a decision made in 1972 that Estimates committees should take over a function that formerly was carried out in the Committee of the Whole? Let there be not the slightest doubt that the Estimates committees perform a separate function altogether. That function may originally have been to take over from the Committee of the Whole but we all know how they operate at present.

<PARA> I was alarmed at a couple of the comments that have been made in this discussion. I am open to persuasion on this subject. I have found Senator Rae's arguments very persuasive but there is just one thing that did not persuade me and that is the lack of an example of when it has been necessary to take in camera evidence. I have given an example of a situation in which it was claimed it was necessary on commercial grounds. When one statutory corporation was invited to make a case-not give the evidence, but to make a case-in support of its claim as to why an answer to a question could threaten its commercial position it chose not to make out a case and instead gave the evidence and the evidence did not affect its commercial viability. The committee was being tried on. That is what it came down to. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told that a committee could take evidence in camera and then, having heard the evidence, could change its mind and make the evidence public. Surely that would strike terror into the heart of every public servant, including the ones who tell the truth. The witnesses would be at the mercy of the day to day whim or the judgment, as it may fluctuate, of the members of a committee, and as we know the membership of committees can change from day to day under particular circumstances. Perhaps we could have some guidelines on in camera evidence. I have not heard of any guidelines. We have the guideline of commercial confidentiality. I have given the example of an attempt to exploit this in camera provision. I have not yet heard of a genuine case having been made, although there may have been one, in which case a request could have been made for evidence to be taken in camera and that request could have been acceded to. I do not think it is at all satisfactory for the committee to say that evidence may be given in camera and then to say that it does not think it should have been taken in camera so it will make it public, although when the evidence was given it was on the understanding that it would be in camera. A case can be made out in terms of principle. At the moment the position is just too scrappy. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the opinion that Estimates committees are different from standing committees. There are major differences in their functions. Every senator is entitled to attend an in camera meeting of an Estimates committee. The only thing non-members of the committee are not entitled to do is vote. Every senator can attend a private meeting of an Estimates committee but when it comes to a vote in that committee only members of the committee may vote. Not every senator is entitled to attend an in camera meeting of a standing committee or of a select committee. These are very significant differences which either were not known to some of the people who have talked on this subject or the implications of which have not been considered. In camera for an Estimates committee just means that members of the Press and public are shut out. In the circumstance where all senators are entitled to attend a hearing they ought to be informed of it and given the opportunity to indicate their agreement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to debate the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence report on Australia and the Association of South East Asian Nations. Mr Deputy President, you will recall that this is one of the few opportunities we have had for many years to debate a report from this Committee within a short time of its being tabled in the Parliament. This has been one of the complaints of many of us. Very often when reports were to be debated events either caught up with us or passed us. This report was tabled on 4 December during the sittings prior to Christmas. This report entitled 'Australia and ASEAN' covers an area of great importance for Australia. This importance is recognised by all political parties. Australia's relationship with ASEAN is a challenge to Australia's ability to manage its international relations. The Committee endorses the views of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hayden, and also the expressed views of the Department of Foreign Affairs. On page 26 of the Committee report the views Mr Hayden put before the Committee are shown. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> ASEAN is the touchstone of Australia's performance in international relations; if we cannot manage our relations successfully on this front, there must be severe reservations about our prospects on others. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Our ASEAN relationships cover the field. They proceed from a long-established basis of amity and recognise strong mutual interests. At the same time, however, it has become increasingly clear that they must accommodate competitive pressures and political differences that often go to the heart of our perceived national interests. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Foreign Affairs in its submission to the Committee raised the point that our relationship with ASEAN was the greatest challenge to Australian foreign policy. On page 29 of the report the Department's view is stated as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The co-ordination and pursuit of policy towards ASEAN and the ASEAN countries has become a task of special significance. It is a task, and a set of circumstances, which Australia has not been required to confront in its external relations before the present decade. </PARA>
<PARA>These views have been examined by the Committee and reported. There is an increasing tendency for ASEAN to act as a group. In the report we deal at some length with this problem. Since the formation of ASEAN the region has experienced major changes. These changes were examined by the Committee. On page 24 of the report the Committee's view sets out in some detail the changes as we see them. Of course, these changes would not be exclusive ones. The Committee report states:</PARA>
<PARA> In the period since ASEAN was formed the region has experienced major changes that have affected the Association's members' and Australia's policies. These changes include:</PARA>
<PARA> the emergence of three communist Indo-China states and the decline of the United States military role in South East Asia;</PARA>
<PARA> an international economic recession bringing a reduction in growth rates and a swing to protectionist policies in developed countries, including major ASEAN market countries;</PARA>
<PARA> changes in major powers' relationships e.g. China and the United States, China and Japan; progressive economic development in ASEAN countries in spite of increasing energy costs; and</PARA>
<PARA> growing doubts about the regional security situation created by the Chinese invasion of Vietnam, Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea and Vietnamese incursion into Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA>The rapidly changing regional situation has required Australia and ASEAN to adapt their policies to meet these changes. Australia was also presented with the requirement to adjust, by the mid-1970s, to a situation of dealing with a revitalised ASEAN. The growing international acceptance of ASEAN as a cohesive group has brought with it repercussions for Australia's relations with the Association. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>A point has now been reached where Australia's relations with ASEAN encompass most aspects of Australia's international relations and many of these issues increasingly impinge on Australian domestic policies. </PARA>
<PARA>It is quite significant that whilst the Committee received a variety of views on the relationship and whilst opinions differed on the state of the relationship and the knowledge we have of one another, no witness questioned the need for close Australia-ASEAN co-operation. In the Committee's view the knowledge and perceptions we have of each other are totally inadequate. Indeed one witness summed up the situation in the following manner:</PARA>
<PARA> Australian ignorance of its neighbouring states and people is considerable and regrettable. Their ignorance of us is almost overwhelming and could at some future time react seriously against us. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee stresses that there is an urgent need to develop a greater knowledge and appreciation of each other's social, cultural, economic and political systems, languages, problems, aspirations and value systems. The Committee also stressed that understanding is not a one-way business. Whereas there is a challenge to Australia to understand these factors in our relations with the ASEAN countries, it is equally important that those countries learn to understand Australia, our political systems and our society. In other words, understanding is a two-way business. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee acknowledged that the ASEAN record of achievement has been great, notably from the mid-1970s following the situation in Indo-China. There has been an impressive record of development in the Association. Nevertheless, ASEAN is still in its formative stage, as indeed are Australia's relations with the Association. The Committee acknowledges that economic issues, both government and private, bi-lateral and multilateral, have developed as the focal, if not the dominant, point of the relationship. In its report the Committee makes a number of observations in relation to economic policies. Some of these economic policies go beyond the simple ASEAN relations. The Committee refers to its report which was tabled some time ago on the implications for Australia of proposals for a new international economic order. On page 30 of this report the Committee draws attention to this. In dealing with the economic relationship the Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to their impact on Australian-ASEAN relations, economic matters have wider implications for Australia, mainly in the context of proposals for a new international economic order and relations generally with the Third World countries. The ASEAN countries identify themselves as Third World members and in this respect the Committee's observations in its report The New International Economic Order-Implications for Australia, page 45, are relevant:</PARA>
<PARA>Page 45 of the report should also be read. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's attitudes must continue to take into account that the Asian countries are its neighbours and that the ASEAN group in particular has a cohesion and solidarity which is significant, one which is shaped importantly by the Group of 77 philosophy . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is to be interpreted in that context. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, Australia's actions and responses will be closely examined from that aspect. They will affect political relations with the region and the countries in it and this itself will affect relations with the developing world generally. Consistent with their interests, the ASEAN countries have at times had a moderating influence in developing countries forums. </PARA>
<PARA>I think this highlights the fact that economic relations with the ASEAN group have implications which may well go beyond that and affect our relations with the Third World in general. The report also deals at length with our cultural and educational relations. I commend those aspects of the report to those who are interested. This highlights, I think, the broadening of our relations with these countries which, as we said earlier, encompasses the whole of our relations. It covers the fields of culture, education and the media. The report deals with all of these aspects. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to draw the attention of the Senate to some of the conclusions and recommendations of the Committee. I know that other members of the Committee would like to deal with other matters. I am trying to be fairly brief. The Committee warns-I think this is an important element-against regarding Australia's relationship with ASEAN as a special relationship and one which should be fostered. The Committee, on page 24, makes reference to this. There has been a feeling in some sections of the community-I do not think it has been reflected in Government policy but certainly it has been felt in some sections of the community-that ASEAN and Australia have a special relationship. The Committee notes that this, of course, raises grave dangers because it nurtures false hopes and expectations and also ignores our relations with other countries in the Asian-Pacific region. It might be a matter of interest to the Senate that a few weeks ago I was in Singapore. This report was widely commended by senior officers of the Singapore foreign ministry who thought it was most objective and sensible. They referred to this aspect and said how wise we were to warn against this feeling that there was, between Australia and ASEAN, some special type of relationship. So the Committee's views have been endorsed by at least one member of ASEAN and I expect it will also be commended by others. Perhaps I should read what the Committee had to say about this special relationship. Having warned against it we did say that we should pursue a long term relationship based upon mutual respect. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A relationship of this type can nurture false hopes and expectations which cannot always be fulfilled and can be construed by others as discriminatory in the context of Australia's overall foreign relations. It must be accepted that there are occasions when Australia and ASEAN act to serve their own interests in a manner which may be opposed to the other's interests. </PARA>
<PARA>That, I think, is a realistic approach. The Committee also drew attention to another matter. I am not aware of anyone else previously drawing attention to this matter. In the next decade new leaders will emerge in the ASEAN countries whose perceptions may well be different from those of the present leaders. On page 24 the Committee drew attention to this. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> When considering Australia's approach to ASEAN it is salutary to recognise that within this decade a new generation of political leaders will emerge in the member states. They will be leaders whose attitudes were not moulded by colonial experience. It is possible that their attitudes will differ from present attitudes towards Australia and ASEAN. The Committee concludes that Australia's approach to ASEAN and its members must take into account these changes and must recognise that Australia's response to these developments is crucial to sound long-term relations. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 28 we also drew attention to another factor which, I suppose, is a sensitive factor but one which no committee considering Australia's ASEAN relation can ignore. The Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA> The frequently expressed Australian desire for a peaceful and prosperous region is shared by the ASEAN countries and the Committee agrees with the accepted view that the evolution of ASEAN has been a contribution to regional stability. </PARA>
<PARA>I add that these areas of internal stability are common to all Third World and developing countries. It would have been foolish for any committee to ignore the possibilities of change due to internal stability within the ASEAN countries with whom we have such close relations. Again, the Committee drew attention to the problems of policy co-ordination. I think this has been one of the difficulties in our relations because domestic policies are impinging more and more-not only with regard to ASEAN but also other countries, but particularly ASEAN-upon foreign policy considerations. Let us look at one example. I do not think the rights or wrongs matter. With the International Civil Aviation Policy dispute there was a domestic policy consideration and little consideration was given at the time to the foreign policy implications of it until they became serious. </PARA>
<PARA> This raises serious problems, not only with our relations with ASEAN but also with international relations altogether. We have to consider the proper co-ordination of domestic policies and the impact they may have upon our foreign relations. At least when we make decisions, they are made on the basis that we understand the implications on foreign policy. I suspect that too often this aspect has been given too little consideration. Departments, following their own policies, are placing too little consideration upon the effect such policies have on international relations. ICAP is just one of the cases. The recent decision to prosecute Singapore Airlines within Australian law-no one is going to argue about that-probably could have been done in a way where explanations could have been made first. The facts, properly understood by the Singapore Government, might have caused less problems. This is a lesson which we seem terribly slow to learn. </PARA>
<PARA> There is very little excuse for this, because the Committee in its 1979 report 'Australian representation overseas-the Department of Foreign Affairs' commented on the increasing complexity of domestic and international issues, their interdependence and effect on policy co-ordination. The Committee, in its latest report, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considers the requirement for effective policy co-ordination is vital to furthering relations with the Association and its members and therefore recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) priority be given to developing policy-making processes to effectively co-ordinate the interdependent elements of domestic and foreign policies;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) consultative procedures in policy co-ordination should be broadened to promote close liaison with the non-government sector when the issues involve them; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) to meet the growing demands of Australian-ASEAN relations, Australia's diplomatic missions in the region be provided with adequate staff and resources to ensure that policies are effectively implemented. </PARA>
<PARA>I think everyone would acknowledge that some efforts have been made to overcome this problem. An Australian-ASEAN research group has been set up to try to look ahead and plan for the problems that may arise. There seems to us still to be an urgent need for a proper co-ordination between departments, and between domestic policies and foreign policy implications. The Committee again draws attention to the urgency of this. The Committee also referred to our immigration policy and the fact that we are still considered in some areas to be a European outpost in an Asian region. Senator McIntosh and Senator Primmer will recall that when we visited the ASEAN countries together we had considerable discussions on this aspect. We put forward a view that there is an urgent need to project an Australian identity, not a European identity, in the region. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes it is imperative for Australia to remove this impression and recommends that the Government concentrate on projecting Australia's identity which is evolving through the changing structure of its society. The Committee also recommends the further development of immigration policy along the lines recently adopted, a humanitarian approach to the needs of refugees and the intensification of efforts to finalise reunion in Australia of families from East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the more encouraging signs is the growing business co-operation between Australia and ASEAN countries. We have the Australian-Indonesian Business Co-operation Committee, the Australian-Philippines Co-operation Committee and the ASEAN-Australian Business Council. The Confederation of Australian Industry is now developing close relations with similar organisations in ASEAN countries. The Committee commends the efforts by private industry to develop these relationships which are an important element, apart from government relationships. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also draws attention to the importance of cultural and educational considerations in our relationship and makes a number of recommendations. We are concerned at the growing lack of interest in the study of Asian languages. This is a terribly complex matter because they are difficult languages and unless students can see something for the future they do not wish to study these languages over a number of years. We cannot come up with any clear-cut recommendations because of these problems. We believe it is absolutely essential that there be a greater understanding in Australia of Asian languages and through that the cultures and traditions of the people with whom we are close neighbours. Australia is playing an important role in the teaching of English in many of the Asian countries particularly those countries, apart from Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines, where English is not and has never been a language which has been well known. There is a demand in Indonesia, for example, for the teaching of English. I think we can do a lot more than we are doing now to meet these requirements. The Committee makes recommendations on these matters also. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes the future relations with the ASEAN countries would involve a multitude of multilateral and bilateral considerations and external events will have a bearing on their relationship. On page 28 of the report we give examples of possible influences. I will mention just a few. They are:</PARA>
<PARA> The effect of regional and major power rivalries in the area;</PARA>
<PARA> Changes of leadership and of government in Australia and the ASEAN countries;</PARA>
<PARA> The state of Australian-ASEAN economic issues. </PARA>
<PARA>One cannot stress too much the importance of economic issues in our relationship. The examples continue:</PARA>
<PARA> Differing concepts of human rights . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The implications of proposals for a Pacific Basin Community;</PARA>
<PARA> Continuing difficulties with the ASEAN countries over Australia's International Civil Aviation Policy; and</PARA>
<PARA> Sea bed boundary negotiations with Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia faces a number of challenges in its relationship with the ASEAN countries. We cannot expect relations to be always smooth. Australians must and will always act in defence of its own national interests, as member countries of ASEAN must and will. Where differences occur we must broaden our relationships and create a greater understanding between ourselves and the ASEAN countries of our respective cultures, traditions and valued systems. This is something I stressed when I visited these countries. Senator McIntosh will recall that we stressed that these countries have an obligation to understand our different systems and our more open society. As I said earlier, it is a two-way business. I believe that this report is a valuable contribution to Australian-ASEAN relations. This report has been well received by ASEAN countries-I mentioned Singapore earlier-as an objective and sensible approach to problems. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, on a slightly personal note, this will be the last occasion when I will speak in the Senate on a Senate standing committee report. I express my appreciation to my colleagues on the Committee-Senator Primmer, the Deputy Chairman, Senator McIntosh, Senator Sibraa, Senator Knight, Senator Scott and finally Senator Collard and to other members who have served in the past for their friendship and co-operation over a large number of years. I believe that we have been a very happy committee and that we have worked together as a team in the interests of the Senate and Australia. I will look back in the future with a good deal of appreciation and gratitude for the work the Committee has done which, in due modesty, I think has been significant in Australia's relations with other countries. This is acknowledged widely overseas. I say 'thank you' to my colleagues for their friendship and support over quite a number of years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I welcome this debate on foreign affairs tonight and I am pleased to be able to follow Senator Sim, the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. I will say something more about the role that he has played in the Committee but I will leave that to my concluding remarks. I think that too often discussion on foreign affairs in the Senate has been restricted, for example, to ministerial statements. The Leader of the Opposition replies to such statements, and that is the end of the debate. When an important report, such as the report entitled 'Australia and ASEAN' that we are debating tonight, is tabled in the Senate the Chairman of the relevant committee and maybe one senator on the Opposition side, if we are lucky, speaks to it. After the honourable senator speaking seeks leave to continue his remarks the matter is put on the Notice Paper and, as often happens, when eventually we get round to debating the report it is irrelevant and not a lot can be said. In this instance the opposite applies. The report is important, as Senator Sim has said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly I will refer to some remarks made by my colleague, Senator Primmer, when speaking on the report on 4 December. He raised the very important issue of the right of committees to travel. I think there has to be an appropriation for committees to travel on special occasions. I believe that this was one of those occasions and that this was a very special committee. There was a complete refusal by the Government to assist in any way though there were many ways it could have helped. I do not think it is right that I should tonight go into the discussions that we had with the relevant people except to re-emphasise the point that there were many ways in which the Government could have helped our Committee to travel through the region of the Association of South East Asian Nations. In my view it was absolutely essential that, for the report on ASEAN to be a success, committee members had a first-hand knowledge of the area especially in view of the fact that very few submissions came from the ASEAN region itself. </PARA>
<PARA> We were extremely fortunate that three members of the Committee-Senator Sim, Senator Primmer and Senator McIntosh-were able to make a private visit as a delegation. They used their own resources. The visit greatly assisted the Committee with its work and deliberations. It was a valuable visit. The honourable senators met important people. However, they did not receive the access that an official visit would have rated. If it had been an official visit they could have demanded access to leaders of the Opposition parties and trade union leaders whom the particular governments in the ASEAN countries would not have wanted them to meet. But on a private visit, no matter how governments looked after them, they were not able to demand the sort of access that an official visit would have rated. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, some of the countries the honourable senators went to extended hospitality. I believe that the Malaysians treated the delegation as if it were there on a state visit. The Malaysians were amazed that an Australian parliamentary committee investigating relations between Australia and ASEAN was in fact paying its own way and travelling on the cheap. I think there was a danger, as my colleague Seantor Primmer said, of a loss of face whereby some of the countries might have felt that they were being slighted or downgraded by the very circumstances surrounding the Committee's visit. In view of some remarks made by Senator Sim, I think it is important to mention that the itinerary, the ticketing and the arrangements for the visit were made by Singapore Airlines Ltd. The Committee members were not able to receive concessions from Qantas Airways Ltd, and Qantas was quite within its rights. In view of some of the actions that have occurred since, it is interesting to note that the members had to go to Singapore Airlines. I intend to spend more time on that matter later. I will deal with some of the Committee's recommendations. One of the important recommendations concerns narcotics control. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee fully supports any programs and proposals aimed at effective narcotics control and it recommends that particular emphasis be given to such endeavours and that any initiatives or opportunities to assist international efforts in this field should not be hampered by arbitrary decisions on staff restraints or budgetary limitations. </PARA>
<PARA>The report also states:</PARA>
<PARA> On a multilateral basis Australian participation in anti-narcotics measures includes:</PARA>
<PARA> a contribution of $1 million to the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control over the 1979-81 period; membership of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs along with all ASEAN countries; membership of the Commission's Heads of National Narcotic Law Enforcement Agencies; and attendance at Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting Working Group on Illicit Drugs. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia has narcotics officers stationed in a number of ASEAN countries. They co-operate with local authorities, but staff restraints or budgetary limitations must not be allowed to hamper their work. No one condones the activities of drug traffickers, and young Australians leaving this country are warned on the dangers of drug possession. The system of justice and punishment in a number of ASEAN countries leaves a lot to be desired. My concern is that many young Australians' lives are wasting away today in ASEAN gaols-in some instances because of possession of what we would call minor or soft drugs-while the ring leaders, the drug traffickers responsible for young Australians being in gaol, enjoy the good life in Australia. I have correspondence from parents whose children have been found guilty of the possession of cannabis and who have received sentences of life imprisonment. Not only are the sentences too harsh in some cases but also the time between arrest and sentence is far too long. It is absolutely essential that in the trial of Australians, English speaking interpreters are available. In some instances, of course, the Australian embassies or high commissions supply such people but in other instances this is not possible. The system is just not goood enough. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the case of three Australians, Hayward, Fellows and Sinclair, who have been in custody in Thai gaols for two and a half years. Their trial has lasted for 22 months but there has still been no judgment. In no way am I supporting the actions of Hayward, Fellows or Sinclair, but I am indebted to a New South Wales State Liberal member of parliament Mr John Dowd, who recently returned from Thailand where he visited the three people I have referred to. He said in a radio interview in Sydney, after he had visited them, that conditions in the gaols they were in were horrendous and that it was absolutely essential that they receive outside financial support to be able to survive. He was also critical of the Thai court procedures. I certainly support the main point that he made in that interview; that is, there must be talks between the two governments so that Australian prisoners can finish their terms of imprisonment in Australian gaols or receive parole concessions equivalent to those they would receive in Australia had they been sentenced by an Australian court. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that there are faults in that argument. I know that many people would say that that would encourage young Australians to risk drug trafficking because they would be able to spend part of their sentence in an Australian gaol. I know there are faults in that point of view, but the present system is bad and there must be a start somewhere. There certainly have to be talks between the Australian Government and the Thai Government. It is also absolutely essential, as we mention in this report, that we have in Bali a Consul-General who can provide consular services. This Committee and other committees have been talking about it for a long time. The Department of Foreign Affairs keeps saying that something will be done, but continually young Australian tourists are getting into difficulties and finding that they have no consular representative to go to. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important area that the committee dealt with was labour relations. One of our recommendations was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee supports the proposal for a Labour Attache, with the appropriate background and qualifications, in the ASEAN region and recommends that the Government, in consultation with industry and the ASEAN governments, should examine the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee took evidence on this matter and wrote in the report:</PARA>
<PARA> To achieve a better appreciation within ASEAN of Australian industrial relations the Confederation of Australian Industry has suggested the appointment of an Australian Labour Attache to serve the ASEAN group of countries . . . the concept met with approval including support from the Australian Council of Trade Unions . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The recommendation is supported by the Confederation of Australian Industry and by the Australian Council of Trade Unions. I strongly support the appointment of a labour attache in the ASEAN region. If it proves successful, and I think it will, we should appoint more than one. If the Committee made a mistake, it was that we recommended that the Government should examine the situation. We should have been stronger; we should have recommended that an appointment take place straightaway. We should have been more insistent, especially in light of the fact that a labour attache has now been appointed to Japan and the Japanese Government has appointed a labour attache to Australia. A labour attache in the area would be able to explain our industrial relations system. He would be on the spot to help with any troubles that might arise. For example, I remind honourable senators of the dispute when the Malaysian Airlines System DC10 was grounded in Sydney. I do not think many people in the ASEAN region knew why it was grounded and I am sure that many people in Australia did not know why it was grounded. It was grounded because of actions that were being taken by the Malaysian authorities against Malaysian trade unionists. That was a particularly important point. A labour attache on the spot would have been able to explain to the Malaysian Government-it would not have mattered to me whether it understood-why that action was being taken. He would be responsible for providing up to date information to us on ASEAN trade unions. They range, as Senator Sim knows, from the fairly sophisticated apparatus in Singapore, the National Trade Union Congress, to outright repression of trade union movements in some of the other ASEAN countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The ASEAN region needs a democratic trade union system. It needs it because it is a barrier against extremists of the Right and of the Left. Yesterday Senator Hearn, in her maiden speech, made the very important point that whenever dictators, whether from the Left or the Right, take over, one of the first institutions they try to put down is a democratic trade union movement. I give an example. In the Philippines, Marcos has lifted martial law. Despite that his Government continues to harass and to arrest trade unionists. A prominent Filipino trade union leader was arrested seven months ago. He was arrested supposedly by the police, but nobody really knows whether it was the police. He is still missing. Apparently his main crime was to urge the workers in the place he was working to stand up to the factory managers and to seek an increase in their wages of 22c a day. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Teague" NAMEID="PJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator Teague</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What was his name?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EJ4">Senator SIBRAA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not got his name, but I can get that information for Senator Teague because it is a well documented case. Senator Sim spoke about political instability in the ASEAN region. There is no doubt in my mind that the Government in the Philippines at the moment is not stable. As I said, martial law has been lifted, but I believe that the Marcos regime is in trouble. I believe the relationship between the Government and the clergy is fragile. I think the Pope's cautioning of the clergy to stay out of politics will be ignored because the clergy in the Philippines is too involved in the issue of human rights and has the support of the majority of the people in the Philippines. Whilst I say that the Government is not stable, I do not believe it will be overthrown by actions of groups such as the Muslim separatists in the south. I do not believe there will be a communist takeover in the Philippines. In fact at the moment the most articulate spokesmen against the Marcos regime are resident in the United States and the majority of them are certainly seen, in Asian terms, to be political moderates. It was disturbing recently to hear that an Australian aid officer had been killed there. I think all members of the Committee would agree that the situation has deteriorated since this report was written and since it was presented to the Senate last December.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I certainly support the remarks of Senator Sim about Asian studies and I strongly support the Committee's recommendation that the Government set up an Asian studies council to promote Asian studies at all levels. One thing noted in the report is that there are few employment opportunities for Asian studies graduates and that with the unemployment situation as bad as it is a school leaver has to choose a course of study that will guarantee a job. Gone are the days when students could study interesting and exciting subjects and still be assured of employment. Consequently, the future of Asian study courses is in jeopardy because of the dwindling number of students. As the report noted, there should be employment prospects in the Department of Foreign Affairs, in the Australian Development Assistance Bureau and in other aid agencies, but unfortunately at the moment there are not. I believe the Government should take a stand on this matter and make it a policy to employ each year a certain number of Asian study graduates whose knowledge, qualifications and enthusiasm could only improve and strengthen our ties with the ASEAN region. Then aid agencies and big private companies, we hope, would follow the Government's example and employ more Asian studies graduates. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to refer to the role of Radio Australia and the media in the region. On this matter the Committee recommended:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is concerned that the Indonesian Government refused to renew a visa for the Australian Broadcasting Commission's journalist in the country. This situation can only be harmful to bilateral relations and the Committee recommends that the Government initiate further discussions with the Indonesian authorities to ensure that Radio Australia has a correspondent in Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee also noted:</PARA>
<PARA> In the ASEAN countries governments have more control of the media and can direct its operations. The respective situations are understood at government levels but not generally throughout the community. As a result of sensitivities and varying interpretations on topics presented in the media, accusations of bias and lack of balance recur. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no ready solution to this problem. The Australian media is independent and much of it is commercially motivated. Government funded radio and television services, including Radio Australia, operate as separate entities and are not an instrument of government policy. Radio Australia maintains an independent editorial policy seeking to provide an impartial, balanced service. It is mindful of Australia's image and foreign relations and liaises with the Department of Foreign Affairs to ensure that its broadcasts are not damaging to these considerations. </PARA>
<PARA>Radio Australia is terribly important. It provides a large number of people in the region with the only contact that they have with Australia. But apparently in some ASEAN nations this is one contact too many. The Indonesian Government is extremely sensitive. It has been estimated that between 30 million and 36 million Indonesians listen to Radio Australia. Therefore it is extremely unfortunate that Warwick Beutler's visa was not extended in June. But it is not surprising in view of what has happened since because it is now becoming apparent that Indonesia is determined that Australia will not be able to receive any first hand information in the future. I refer to the failure of the Indonesian Government to extend the visa of Peter Rodgers, and I would think that that would come as a shock to all honourable senators. Apparently his crime, the one thing he did wrong, was to uncover for the world the fact that widespread starvation existed in East Timor in late 1979. It was Peter Rodgers who smuggled out the banned photos to prove his claims. We all saw the photos that he brought out of East Timor of the starving children. For so doing he received the Australian Journalist of the Year award, an award made for first class investigative journalism. But now the Indonesians have given him their own award. They have expelled him from the country. </PARA>
<PARA> What has this Government done about that? It has asked the Indonesian Government to reconsider its decision. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Street, has said in statements that the Government was disappointed and that it deeply regretted the action. It is no wonder that the Indonesians did not take our so-called protests seriously. There are a number of much tougher diplomatic actions that the Minister could have taken but in fact he has done nothing. Of course on the issue of airline tickets or when we are dealing with an airline of one of the ASEAN countries we know how to get very tough indeed. Australia was taught a very hard lesson when it came to negotiate with the ASEAN countries over Australia's International Civil Aviation Policy-ICAP. The Committee refers to this on page 28 of its report. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> The ICAP experience also demonstrates the need for Australia's policies to be carefully explained and presented only after all their elements have been fully considered and co-ordinated. The Committee is aware from previous inquiries that the policy co-ordination system has deficiencies and is becoming increasingly complex as more domestic policies affect foreign policy. The relevance of long-term effective policy co-ordination in the Australian-ASEAN context is obvious and the Committee emphasises that Australian policies should only be presented after comprehensive consideration and agreement at the inter-departmental level, in consultation with the non-government sector where involved, and where necessary, decision at the Cabinet level. This should be supported by intensive diplomatic activity and detailed explanation at every possible point of contact. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course the big political lesson that we received regarding Singapore Airlines was that even though some of the ASEAN carriers would no doubt have benefited from the Australian ICAP policy, they closed ranks behind Singapore. One of the ASEAN countries was being discriminated against and even though, as I say, some of the ASEAN countries would have benefited, they closed ranks to protect Singapore. The Department of Foreign Affairs was brought in to help solve the problem but as far as I am concerned it was brought in far too late, after the damage was done. We now have the Department of Transport rushing in and harassing airline travellers who have the good fortune to be able to purchase a cheap ticket. Again, the airline involved is Singapore Airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, the actions we have taken will damage our relationship with the ASEAN countries. I wonder how many honourable senators opposite believe that the Department of Transport has the right to intercept a passenger who is boarding a flight, whether or not his ticket was cheap. If a person buys a ticket to travel on Singapore Airlines and Singapore Airlines is prepared to take that person on the flight, I wonder how many honourable senators opposite would be prepared to say that the Department of Transport had the right to intercept that passenger between the ticketing desk at the airport and the plane. I suggest there would be very few indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Australian Journalists Association must be quite bemused by this Government's sense of priority. Apparently it is worth fighting about cheap airline tickets and it is worth upsetting ASEAN nations and on this issue it is worth taking legal action against ASEAN carriers. But let us contrast that with the Government's actions over the expulsion of a highly regarded Australian journalist who, as I said earlier, exposed the plight of the starving people in East Timor. Perhaps the Australian Journalists Association should ask the Department of Transport to work on its behalf. Maybe that Department would be able to find out what happened to the five Australian journalists who were killed in East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of Indonesia, I wish to refer to a newspaper article in today's Australian that caused me a great deal of concern. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Senior officials of the Foreign Affairs Department are worried at the decision by the former Ambassador to Indonesia, Mr T. K. Critchley, to go into business in Jakarta as a lobbyist for Australian companies. </PARA>
<PARA>The article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Critchley recently made headlines when he criticised Australian news coverage of events in Indonesia following the expulsion of two Australian journalists from Jakarta. </PARA>
<PARA>I think this raises a very important question, namely, how can an Australian Ambassador be objective if he is using his position and his contacts to further a business career in the country to which he has been accredited? When this debate was first brought on Senator Primmer said that he believed that Ambassador Critchley had been in Indonesia too long and too often saw things through Indonesian eyes. I suggest that when we read of his decision to set up as a lobbyist in Jakarta we know why he took it. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this is a good report. I believe the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence is a good committee. There is no doubt that after 30 June we will certainly miss the chairmanship of Senator Peter Sim. Senator Sim and I, together with other honourable senators on this side of the chamber, have a number of differences over human rights. However, we realise that Senator Sim is one of those people who are not hypocrites on this issue of human rights. He realises, say on the particular issue of China, that not everything in China is perfect but that not everything in Taiwan is perfect. Too often we hear people in foreign policy debates saying that everything in the Philippines is bad but that everything in Singapore is good or, to use the example I have just used, that everything in China is good but that everything in Taiwan is bad. </PARA>
<PARA> We appreciate Senator Sim's point of view. He looks at issues objectively, especially sensitive issues such as the Middle East and South Africa. Members of our Committee, along with Senator Sim, have been able to develop strong bipartisan positions on those two issues. It is a position that members of the Committee from this side of the Parliament appreciate. We hope that it is not the last report on which Senator Sim has a chance to speak but if it is, on behalf of my colleagues on the Committee from this side of the chamber, we wish him well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I should like to begin my remarks this evening by drawing attention to one of the other items that I think has not been referred to so far but which is before the Senate this evening, and that is item 10, General Business, relating to the law of the sea. Far too little is known in Australia about what has been occurring with the development of the convention on the law of the sea over the past several years, in particular the benefits that have been gained for Australia in that process by Australian negotiators in what is undoubtedly one of the most complex international negotiations conducted in many decades. I refer particularly to the ambassadors who have been involved over a number of years-Mr Keith Brennan and Mr Ralph Harry. Mr Keith Brennan has led the Australian negotiating team for about the past four years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the time that a draft convention was under preparation and was getting close to finalisation a number of gains were made in Australia's interests, and its national interest has been very well served by those negotiators. For example, in the draft convention as it now stands coastal states are given jurisdiction over their off-shore resources, and the traditional freedoms of navigation and overflight of the sea have been confirmed and strengthened, thereby facilitating commercial shipping operations and effective naval and air services and mobility. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that those sorts of matters are of great importance to Australia as a nation with 12,000 miles of coastline. It is important that those matters should now be close to receiving firm international recognition and standing in international law, and it is obviously in Australia's interest that that should be so. More recently, Ambassador Brennan led the Australian delegation to the conference to prepare a treaty on Antarctic marine living resources. Again, the process thus far has been notably to Australia's advantage and in its interests, and indeed under the prepared convention the proposed Antarctic marine living resources commission is to be located in Australia, in Hobart. I know that all those involved in the delegation to that conference-I was one of them, although I was unable to attend as often as I would have liked-would confirm the importance of the role of Ambassador Brennan and his patience and skill in negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that the draft convention on the law of the sea is nearing finalisation. There will be a conference next month in New York which, it is hoped, will be the final negotiating session, although I understand there may be some slight difficulties at the last minute because the Reagan Administration in the United States, as the new administration, may want to have a closer look at what is a tremendously complex international convention and one that has significant implications and, as I have suggested, in many respects will serve Australia's interests well. I therefore want to draw to the Parliament's attention and to the attention of Australians generally the very significant role played by Mr Ralph Harry and by Mr Keith Brennan in leading Australia's delegations to these complex and often for them, no doubt, wearying negotiations in many parts of the world over many years. In doing so they have served the country's interests well. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence which has been discussed already by Senator Sim and by Senator Sibraa. With them, I am a member of the Committee. I shall refer to a few aspects of that report which I think are of particular significance. They are aspects that have already, in one way or another, been touched upon or referred to by Senator Sim and by Senator Sibraa but there are other aspects of those matters to which I should like to draw some attention in the course of this discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, I refer to the decline that has occurred in Asian studies in this country in the recent past. The Asian Studies Association of Australia has undertaken a study of this matter and its report has indicated the magnitude of the decline that has occurred and has suggested some of the implications of that decline for Australia and has made some recommendations as to how the problems might be overcome. The Asian Studies Association inquiry looked at a number of areas of particular concern; for example, career prospects for graduates with an Asian emphasis in their studies; tertiary education in general, with emphasis on universities; schools and teacher education; and education beyond formal institutions through the media, libraries, information services, and so on. The inquiry came up with some recommendations as to what might be done about the problems that have emerged with the decline of Asian studies in this country and the dangers with respect to the potential lack of understanding in this country of our Asian neighbours and the misjudgments that may well occur in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> One of its most important recommendations was that an Asian studies council should be established in Australia to promote Asian studies at all levels. The report went into some detail as to the nature of the work of such a council. I simply draw attention to the fact that the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence recommended that the Government should implement the proposal of the Asian Studies Association to establish an Asian studies council. I hope that as the Government examines its response to this report it might pay particular attention to that recommendation because in many respects it is fundamental to any improvement in our relations and to the further development of Australian understanding of its Asian neighbours. That understanding is essential to good relations between those countries and Australia and to our capacity to make proper judgments about what is occurring in that part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Another significant element and one which I think bears even closer consideration is the fact that there is very little interest in Australia in South East Asian countries-the countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations. We ought not to delude ourselves into thinking that the decline of Asian studies in Australia is the only important element. There has not been a decline in Australian studies in the South East Asian countries because there were virtually no Australian studies to start with, and there seems to be little chance of any change in that situation. In the course of evidence the Curriculum Development Centre, for example, which is based here in Canberra and which is involved in work with educational innovation or development, particularly in the ASEAN countries, expressed some concern about Australia's image, even in text books used in those countries. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> At present, Australia is often loosely lumped in with 'Commonwealth Studies' or 'Oceanic Studies' with a consequent blurring of our image. </PARA>
<PARA>That blurring occurs to the extent that Australia has any image at all in those countries. I suggest that we need, as a nation, to give some attention to how we might promote some interest in Australia in those countries-some interest in Australian studies-so that not only can our judgment of Asian countries be balanced and informed but also so that their judgments of us might be equally balanced and, I hope, informed. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, there has been some discussion and controversy in the last year or two about Asian students in Australia and about the benefits provided for such students. In 1979 some changes were made to impose charges and fees on private students studying in Australia, but I emphasise that this decision did not affect sponsored students. I hope it will open the way to our providing more assistance for more sponsored students from Asia. Quite frankly, I have no hesitation in supporting that position because, clearly, many of the private students from Asia who come to this country come from the existing elites in those countries. I would prefer to see our sponsorship being utilised to assist students who come from less elitist backgrounds in those Asian countries. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IH7">Senator KNIGHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, drawing from all, but I would like to see more attention being given to those students from families and circumstances where the need is greatest. I think that would mean greater benefits for Australia and would certainly spread the benefits within those societies of our development assistance, which takes that form in some cases. I think it is worth quoting from the words of one witness, because those words in a sense encapsulate what I have been saying in the last few minutes. The witness said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australian ignorance of its neighbouring states and peoples is considerable and regrettable. Their ignorance of us is almost overwhelming and could at some future time react seriously against us. </PARA>
<PARA>I simply stress those last few words. That is the point I have been making. That ignorance on their part could at some future time react seriously against us. It is in our interests that they understand us rather better and it may be up to us to do a little more about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sibraa referred to the need for labour attaches in some of these countries and to the fact that since our report was tabled the Government has announced that a labour attache will be appointed to the Australian Embassy in Tokyo. The appointment to Tokyo is important, as is the Japanese appointment of a labour attache to Canberra. There is an obvious and great need for more understanding between Australia and Japan of the nature of industrial relations in the two countries. It is important from our point of view to have someone in Tokyo who can explain and what is going on in this country with respect to industrial relations when, for example, disputes here disrupt our trade with Japan. That is often a very perplexing experience for them and often undermines confidence. But if we have someone in Tokyo who understands and can explain clearly what is going on I think it will assist our cause. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that whilst that is important in Japan it is equally important in parts of South East Asia: In one or two of the ASEAN countries I think there is an equally strong case for a labour attache to be appointed. I hope that once again the Government will give close consideration to that recommendation when it is considering its response to that report. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, of course, many facets to Australia's relationships with the ASEAN countries. In most respects our relations are close and friendly, both at the bilateral and the multilateral levels. The most volatile and potentially harmful area of our relationships with these countries, as with many others, including Japan, is the area of economic, particularly commercial, relationships. I think it has to be recognised-perhaps we ought to be a little more honest with ourselves, a little more frank with one another-that the ASEAN countries are an economic bloc. They will negotiate, when it suits them, to deal as an economic bloc with outside countries. That has been quite noticeable in their dealings with Australia. They are out to get the best possible deal for the ASEAN countries. They can at times be quite ruthless in the pursuit of their interests. They will use Australia, as they have done on many occasions, as a whipping post. If we do not recognise that and respond accordingly, the Government will not be protecting Australia's interests. </PARA>
<PARA> There are vast differences amongst the ASEAN countries, to which this report refers, but when they get together on a particular issue they act as a very effective international lobby, and Australia has to respond accordingly. They have been very critical of Australia with respect to trade and the imbalance of trade, but they frequently and conveniently overlook or discount the invisibles involved in the commerce and trade between Australia and the ASEAN countries. They have been very critical of our tariffs but have been silent about tariffs between the ASEAN countries, some of which are more injurious in their terms, to them, than are ours. There are many internal differences, many barriers, between the ASEAN countries in this respect, but when it suits them they will lash Australia. Particularly will they do so as a group. They say, for example, that we should reduce many of our tariffs, import quotas or other trade barriers. We ought to ask them not only privately but also publicly whether they are prepared to act precipitately against their national interest. We as a country have made it clear that we recognise the problems that our tariffs pose. I do not think we ought to apologise for our situation, our attitudes and our policies. Whilst we ought to be acting to assist those countries wherever we can and to introduce change, I do not think we should apologise. </PARA>
<PARA> Air fares and international civil aviation issues have already been mentioned by Senator Sibraa. Once again, I think he was suggesting that the controversy between Australia and ASEAN has really been between Australia and Singapore. It suited the ASEAN countries, as a group, to lash Australia. They have acted as a group. We have not had great differences with Garuda Indonesian Airways or with Thai Airways International. The problems have been with Singapore. The ASEAN countries have behaved as if there have been problems with the whole group. There have been some, but not to that extent. Some of their statements have been unreasonable and I think our responses have at times been less than adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic relationship between Australia and the ASEAN countries is a critical one. I wish to refer to a statement in the report in which the Committee referred to evidence from the Confederation of Australian Industry. I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the ongoing activities of the business sector and the formal links 'are essential ingredients in improving Australian-ASEAN relations, and in enabling Australian industry to participate in the future development of the region'. </PARA>
<PARA>That is right. Those countries benefit in many respects from our participation and our investment. I do not think that we should continue always to wear the velvet glove when the ASEAN countries choose to wear knuckledusters. I think we should stop being so apologetic in the face of what is often quite unrestrained, unjustified and public criticism of Australia from these countries. One has only to remember most recently, to put it politely, the unrestrained language of Prime Minister Lee of Singapore at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting in New Delhi. Australians have been very restrained in referring, for example, to Singapore's response or Malaysia's response to refugees. We could have said some very harsh things about those two countries and what they did to the boat people, but we have not done so. The Government certainly has not done so. When Mr Lee and some of his colleagues from the ASEAN countries behave and express themselves in the way he did one must ask whether we should be so restrained. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in this context that I refer particularly to Indonesia. The sort of problem to which I have been referring is sometimes not so obvious but probably is much more substantial with respect to Indonesia than the other ASEAN countries. It is often not so directly related to the sorts of commercial issues to which I have been referring, which affect Singapore, the Philippines and Malaysia, for example. It is rather trite to say that we want to have good relations with our big neighbours to the north. Indonesia is our closest neighbour. It is a very large country with a massive population that will double before the end of the century. It will probably reach a quarter of a billion people within the next 20 years. I do not think we should act at any time at the expense of our national integrity or our international standing. If we are going to avoid that, or even the suggestion of it, in my view we will have to be rather more forceful and direct in our relationships with Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA> Indonesia is influential. We have to recognise some of the harsh facts of international life. It is an influential member of the Third World nations and the non-aligned nations. It is closely associated with the Muslim nations and with the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. It is obvious from those facts that Indonesia has some weight in the world. This was demonstrated to us pretty emphatically in the case of East Timor because when Australia sought to muster some international support for action in the United Nations against Indonesia over its invasion of East Timor in 1975 that international support simply was not forthcoming. Indonesia's weight in that respect has to be recognised and we have to acknowledge the constraints that exist when dealing with it. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the stand that was adopted with respect to East Timor one will see that such a strong stand is not always adopted. I think we have to be very careful about the consequences of that because in many respects it weakens us, not only in the eyes of the Indonesians, but also in the eyes of many other nations. As with other ASEAN countries, but more significantly with Indonesia, we are too often apologetic. We have to state our position and not qualify it heavily. If we think that Indonesia has erred in throwing out of that country an Australian journalist I do not see why we should we should qualify that by saying it is Indonesia's right to do so. Everyone knows that. The point is that we regard it as an unwarranted action, an action that restrains the flow of information on Indonesia to this country and an action that can only sour relations between our two countries. We should tell Indonesia that. We should state it publicly and not qualify it. The Indonesians should know clearly what our stand is. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not go into the rights and wrongs of what various journalists did and did not do. The principle of the matter is important as is the strength of our response which is critical to our standing in the eyes of many nations, but Indonesia in particular. I believe we now have to be concerned about the impact of that sort of approach. We should reconsider it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to ensure that the Indonesians are clear about our position. We ought to stop talking about our special relationship with ASEAN, Indonesia or anyone else for that matter. The relationships are not special. In our report we referred to the fact that the rhetoric of the 'special relationship' has worn out anyway. We use it too often. We have so-called 'special relationships' with Papua New Guinea, the South Pacific, ASEAN and Japan. Such a statement does not mean anything. We ought to make it clear to ASEAN particularly Indonesia, that they are just like any other nation and that our relations with them will be conducted accordingly and we will not make special concessions or kowtow because of some 'special' and mystical aspect of that relationship which remains undefined. </PARA>
<PARA> It is because of this that I believe we now run the risk of a major anomaly developing in our foreign policy. This emerges especially from our relationship with ASEAN but more particularly Indonesia. It emerges partly from the rhetoric of the 'special relationship' because that means that others question their place in our foreign policy at the same time as they wonder about the concessions we may make in such a 'special relationship' with someone else. It also means that we run the risk of being blinkered to some extent with respect to other countries and regions. We should not be. We must not, for example, neglect our relations with southern Asia, the Middle East and the South Pacific, and more particularly Africa and South America, which are great gaps in our foreign policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst ASEAN is important and the area is nearby, it must be made clear to those nations that they are no more 'special' than anybody else and that we do not intend to back off our national interest simply because they choose to use unrestrained language in public about one or other action of ours. As I said at the outset, it is important that they know more about us. For them to know more about us we need to be much clearer in our attitude and our policies towards them. They need to know we are not so weak that we will back off on every issue or qualify our stand. I return to the statement made by a witness which, as I said earlier, encapsulates the importance of this point. The witness stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Australian ignorance of its neighbouring states and peoples is considerable and regrettable. Their ignorance of us is almost overwhelming and could at some future time react seriously against us. </PARA>
<PARA>I think we should all ponder that. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to conclude my remarks by paying a tribute to my colleague Senator Sim, who will be retiring from the Senate at the end of June this year. Senator Sim has been the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence throughout the time I have been a member of it since 1976. I have no doubt that all members of the Committee would agree that his chairmanship has been superb. He has provided a clear sense of direction for the Committee and has presided over its hearings with skill and tact. He has presided over the preparation of reports with even greater skill and tact because such properties are probably even more necessary in those circumstances. In the time that I have served under Senator Sim, the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee has produced a number of reports; on refugees, the Indian Ocean, the South Pacific, the Department of Foreign Affairs and now on ASEAN-matters that have considerable substance. Much of that is due to his chairmanship of the Committee. I have no doubt that when he leaves this place he will be missed in many respects, but particularly as Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. However, he can go knowing that we all feel, and acknowledge, that he has made a very significant contribution in his role as Chairman of the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The cognate debate which we are having this evening is a rather wide one. It ranges from Zimbabwe to the Association of South East Asian Nations and from disarmament to the law of the sea. It would seem, therefore, to embrace practically every aspect of foreign policy that one could imagine. I propose to follow the example which has been set in linking these various reports in order to speak in rather more general terms than those who have spoken before me. Before doing so I should like to say that I do feel very appreciative of the work which the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence has carried out with regard to the report which it has presented on ASEAN. I believe it is an admirable report. As previous speakers have done, I should like to express the warm feelings which I think all of my colleagues in the Opposition share-certainly those who have served on one or other of the various parliamentary committees on foreign affairs with Senator Sim-for Senator Sim's diligence, objectivity and very great understanding of these matters and the very considerable contribution that he has made to the debates of this Parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not realise that was required but if you insist, Mr Deputy President, then I shall say that all of my remarks will relate to disarmament. Australia, like many other countries, over the next days will have to make quite a dramatic reassessment of its foreign policy as a result of the very stupendous changes which have recently taken place in the United States with the election of Mr Reagan as President of the United States of America. One might say that in fact a form of revolution has taken place in that country. There is now a President who is committed to pursuing quite different policies from those of all of his predecessors since Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected in 1932. Compared with President Reagan, even President Nixon would have been, I think, part of the mainstream of mid-twentieth century liberal American political thought. Totally new concepts are now being advocated by President Reagan and his Administration. Some of the most important parts of the policies to which the new United States Administration is committed relate to its domestic policy. Doubtless we shall be very interested to see what happens about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Certainly very great difficulties will be facing the United States Republican Administration in carrying out many of those policies to which it is committed. But I think the changes which have been forewarned by Mr Reagan and by those people who were close to him during his presidential campaign in respect of foreign policy so far as we in this country and other people outside the United States are concerned are even more significant. The difficulties which an administration has in carrying out foreign policy are quite insignificant compared with the difficulties facing an administration in respect of domestic policy. Domestic policy does not require legislation or a majority in the Senate or the House of Representatives as most of it relates to administrative action. Now that the Reagan Administration is in office it can carry out those things which it said it would do. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the cornerstone of the new foreign policy of the United States of America is a rejection by the new government of the concept of detente, as it has been called, and a rejection of the assumptions which even President Nixon followed in his meetings with the leaders of the Soviet Union and China and which have been prevalent in the United States ever since the settlement of the Cuban missiles crisis of 1962. The assumptions which previous American administrations followed despite the upheavals caused by the war in Vietnam were, if I understand them correctly, that the leadership in the Soviet Union and in the United States were both composed of sensible, reasonable men who did not want a third world war or a holocaust, that if the leaders were to talk together they would be able to reach some sort of an agreement about a reduction in arms, that both sides were committed to peace, and that negotiations, if they were pursued in an equitable manner, would be fruitful and would lead to general disarmament and the preservation of world peace. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think the new United States Administration believes these things and I do not think a majority of the American people, or at least those who take sufficient trouble to vote in presidential elections, believe it either. I think they believe that despite what has been said about detente over recent years they are living in a situation in which they are faced with a very hostile foe, that they need to combat that foe, that while they have been disarming their counterparts in the Soviet Union have not been disarming, and that there has been an expansion of Soviet power and Soviet influence throughout the world. Whether or not certain missiles were being made, the fact remains that a war other than a war of ideas, other than a war of debate, was taking place and the United States was losing that war. As I understand it, it is the intention of the new United States Administration to put to an end that sort of policy and to see that the United States is at least breaking even in that war. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there are a number of reasons why in 1980 the American people agreed with what Mr Reagan was saying whereas in previous years they had not agreed with what people like Mr Reagan and Senator Goldwater had said. I think events in the quite recent past have caused what John Foster Dulles used to call an agonising reappraisal to be made of America's position in the world and America's relationship with the Soviet Union. I shall just mention a few of them. One-most conspicuously-has been the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan; the virtual seizure of that country by the Soviet Union. It was an action which, if taken by any Western power, particularly in the nineteenth century, would have been described quite simply as colonialism or imperialism. I do not think there would have been any discussion about the merits or otherwise of President Karmal and the others. It would have been regarded as the seizure of a part of Asia by a European power as part of that country's colonial policy. I think the example of Afghanistan is particularly disturbing to a great many people other than those in the United States Administration because it occurred right in the middle of the celebrations connected with the completion of part of the strategic arms limitation talks and right at the height of the euphoria about detente. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fairly obvious that a great many Americans and others would have believed that even if the Soviet Union did feel that it was under threat from the various countries which it enumerated as being the supporters of the brigands in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Israel, China, Saudi Arabia, and all the other countries that it named as being involved in the conspiracy-this strange concatenation of forces-and if it were really serious about detente it would at least have consulted the United States and given some forwarning to the United States of the difficulties in which the Soviet Union claimed to find itself and not have acted unilaterally in the way in which it did in invading a neighbouring weaker country. The Soviet Union has shown no sign of moving from Afghanistan despite decisions of the United Nations whose decisions it has often commended to others. </PARA>
<PARA> Likewise the American people have been very disturbed by the Vietnamese quasi-colonial invasion of Cambodia, and this includes a number of people who were extremely active in their opposition to America's participation in the war in Vietnam. Many people believed-I think correctly; I was certainly one of them-that the United States and other Western countries had no business interfering in the affairs of Indo-China, certainly not people who have a record of hostility to the Indo-Chinese people in general or the Vietnamese people in particular and who believe that what Vietnam has done in regard to Cambodia is again an act which could be described, and would be described in other circumstances, as an act of imperialist aggression. </PARA>
<PARA> Likewise there is concern about the activities of the Soviet Union in Ethopia and the activities of close associates of the Soviet Union, such as Cuba and East Germany, in other parts of Africa where large number of their forces are engaged in conflicts which seem to be no more their business than any conflict in Vietnam was the business of the United States of America. Similarly, one finds that the Cubans are particularly active in other parts of Latin America. Outside of their own territory they are engaging in the provision of weapons and indeed the provision of soldiers in support of causes which, however virtuous they may be, are not the domestic business of Cuba. The wrath of many people would certainly be aroused were the United States to have its marines behaving in the same way that Cuban forces are behaving in Latin America. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, in Poland no military intervention has so far taken place by the Soviet Union but certainly Mr Brezhnev and spokesmen of the Soviet Union have made it clear that they regard it as part of their right, in accordance with what has become known as the Brezhnev doctrine, to interfere in the internal affairs of Poland if what they describe as socialism is being threatened by domestic activities in Poland. They have claimed for themselves a right, which so far fortunately they have not exercised, to act in Poland in a certain way. I think most people would find it completely unacceptable if, for example, the United States were to claim a similar right in respect to Canada or Mexico. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or Cuba, or anywhere else for that matter; but certainly adjoining neighbours such as Canada and Mexico. Something else which has concerned Americans and others has been what appears to be-one does not want to sound paranoiac about these matters-a consistent pattern of destabilisation occurring in a number of Western countries. One finds a remarkable similarity not only in the activities but also actually in the weapons that are used by organisations such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland, the Basque separatists in Spain, the Red Brigades and others in Italy and various people in Turkey.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fact, it is not very long ago, only a month or so ago, that the President of Italy, Mr Pertini-certainly not a person whom anyone could describe as belonging to the extreme Right or as being an agent of the Central Intelligence Agency; he is a veteran socialist, one of the leaders of the Italian anti-fascist resistance and a leading member of the Italian Socialist Party, which has enjoyed in the past and which I think still enjoys a very close association with the Italian Communist Party-said quite clearly that he believed that the Soviet Union was responsible in some way or another for the pattern of destabilising activities by various terrorist organisations in a number of countries, including his own. Added to that in the case of the United States-although it did not in any way directly concern the Soviet Union, the other principal party to detente-is what has happened in Iran. The Americans found themselves placed in the humiliating position of having to negotiate what was virtually ransom for the return of diplomats and other people who had been seized by the new regime in Iran quite contrary to all international law. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these matters have caused almost a 180 degree turn in the foreign policy of the United States. The emphasis is no longer on negotiation with another well-meaning party but on building up the strength of the United States and resisting what it regards as the aggressive activities of the other side. I think that the new attitudes are epitomised in the statements which are being made by President Reagan's new appointee as permanent representative of the United States to the United Nations. The view and the policy which she has put forward-which are important not only because of their relationship to detente but also because of the change which they signify in the policy President Carter was following on human rights in various countries with which the United States had a close association-and which appear to be embraced by the new American Administration-are that the United States of America should be cautious in removing or undermining an autocracy which is sympathetic to the United States and to the West in order to replace it with another equally or even more odious autocracy which is aligned with the Eastern bloc. </PARA>
<PARA> One can only speculate as to where this will lead the United States. I think that one ought to comment on this matter. I think it is perhaps not quite as simple as has been expressed by the newly appointed permanent representative. My own feeling would be that the rather difficult situation in which the United States has found itself in Latin America and countries such as Iran is, to a very large extent, part of its own creation. Its difficulties did not arise because it pursued a policy of human rights initially. If the United States had not been openly supporting people such as Somoza in Nicaragua, Romero in El Salvador and the Shah in Persia and had not, as it quite freely admits, undermined the democratically elected Government of Dr Mossadegh in Iran in the 1950s and assisted in installing a dictatorship conducted by the Shah, it would not have had any of the problems which have subsequently occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems fairly obvious that sooner or later the chickens will come home to roost with regard to Chile where, although I think some people have exaggerated the role played by the United States in the removal of the Allende Government, it could well be that as a result of the present very oppressive military dictatorship in that country there will not be ultimately a return to a democracy, but there could be the establishment of a Cuban-type regime in that country directly as a result of the destruction of the long-established democratic parliamentary system within Chile. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the causes may have been, whatever may have happened in the past and however foolish previous American administrations may have been, the fact remains that the United States will be pursuing new policies. No longer will it be looking for agreement with the Soviet Union as the primary objective of its foreign policy. It will be looking for ascendancy over the Soviet Union as the primary objective of its foreign and military policy. The United States is clearly quite committed now, at the very least, to equality and, one imagines, superiority in military strength over the Soviet Union. If that means that there is no international disarmament agreement and that the SALT II agreement is abandoned and perhaps not even renegotiated, that is a price which I believe people such as President Reagan and General Haig will be quite prepared to accept. </PARA>
<PARA> The question which I think Australia and other countries will have to face is: Where do we fit into all this? Clearly the powers of a country such as Australia are very limited. But if there is going to be a third world war it can take place only if the United States and the Soviet Union are involved in it. It would be the sort of war in which we would be involved willy-nilly, whether we wished to be or not. It is probably only by way of influence on either of those countries that we can play any role whatsoever. But I suggest that at the same time we ought perhaps to pay some attention to some of the positions which the United States has taken. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe-and I agree with the senators who have spoken previously this evening-that we advance our own cause, humanity, democracy or civilisation by adopting a weak, wishy-washy attitude toward Indonesia when five of our journalists are apparently murdered in an area under the authority of the Indonesian military. I do not believe that we advance any cause which is worth while serving, if we do not continue to object-even if, as Senator Knight I think correctly said, very few countries except perhaps Portugal support us-to the quite immoral seizure of East Timor by Indonesia. That is in no way to be preferred to what the Soviet Union has done in Afghanistan. If we are going to condemn one action we have to condemn both. I think that if one is going to take positions on these questions one at least has to have some semblance of consistency about what one is saying, otherwise one will be branded, properly, as a humbug. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly do not think we shall lose anything by being critical of Indonesia. I do not suggest that we declare war on it. I do not suggest that we engage in trade sanctions or embargoes. But I do suggest that we continue to tell the Indonesian Government, at the very least, that we strongly disapprove of what it has done in East Timor and make it clear to Indonesia that we do not believe it is entitled to go around seizing other people's countries whatever its motives may or may not be. At the same time, I do not think either for reasons of morality or for reasons of self-interest that we should be prepared to withhold criticism of oppressive, torturing governments such as those in Chile and the Argentine. </PARA>
<PARA> If it were to become accepted that somehow we believed that the sorts of things that General Pinochet is doing in Chile and the new junta is doing in the Argentine-dragging people out of their beds in the middle of the night who then vanish and whose bodies are subsequently discovered-is a proper way to conduct a Western democracy, obviously our credibility would vanish. We are in the fortunate position that we can insult the Argentine and Chile as much as we like without it doing us any harm whatsoever. We are not quite as free to do that with regard to Indonesia but I certainly think that we are more important to Indonesia than Indonesia is to us. I do not think there is anything whatsoever to be lost by making our position perfectly clear. At the same time, we ought to show some caution when we select for the attention of our wrath countries which may be imperfect but nonetheless are better than some of those with which they are contending. </PARA>
<PARA> I know we do have some criticisms of Singapore. I am not now referring to any dispute about Singapore Airlines Ltd. At the same time, surely an examination of other countries of Asia would show that Singapore is one of the least undemocratic countries of the whole area. At least elections are held there. At least in those elections a number of parties are able to stand for election. No satisfactory evidence has ever been presented to me that they have not been bona fide elections. I know it is a little startling for any of us in the Australian Labor Party to imagine anybody winning all the seats in any parliament. I do not think that the fact that a person is popular necessarily makes him evil. </PARA>

I had not been thinking of him at all until he attracted my attention. Senator Evans apparently feels I am directing my remarks towards him. If so, I am happy to do so. What I am saying is that those who are critical of Singapore-I have heard some people who are critical only of Singapore-ought to recognise the fact that there are many more elements of democracy in Singapore than there are in North Korea. I feel that I can speak freely on North Korea because I speak in my capacity as President of the Australia-Democratic People's Republic of Korea Committee. Despite holding that high office I am nonetheless firmly convinced that there is much more democracy in Singapore. I am convinced also that there is much more freedom of dissemination of information, of coming and going, of assembly, of trade union rights and of all sorts of political activities in Singapore than there is in most countries in Asia. I stand by that. I am not quite sure what Senator Evans thinks about that. Doubtless he will explain it later, but I stand by that position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I notice that a campaign is now developing with regard to El Salvador. I think it is very largely a misinformed campaign. It is a campaign to the effect that a rather brutish right wing dictatorship is imposing its will on the innocent peasantry. I do not doubt that there is an element of truth in this. I do not think it is a very good administration in El Salvador. If the present so-called civilian military junta was to run a team in the next Senate election in Western Australia I doubt that it would get my vote; it would not get very high preferences either. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It depends on who the other candidate was. I think anybody who has been following what has been happening in El Salvador knows that there was a singularly oppressive right wing military dictatorship under General Romero. General Romero has been removed. A civilian military junta has now been formed in that country. It is a mixed group of people. It is a group which is opposed by the supporters of General Romero, the old extreme right wing. It is engaged in acts of terrorism against the present government in El Salvador, which has opponents on both sides. It has opponents of the old extreme right, the supporters of the regime which has been been removed, and it has opponents who are supported by Cuba. I do not believe Cuba is a democracy. I think Cuba is anything but a democracy. I think the Cuban society is one of the most oppressive in the world. Despite its rather extraordinary occupancy of its chair at the non-aligned conference, it is the most extraordinarily aligned non-aligned country that one could imagine. I should have very great suspicion, I may say, of anybody conducting a campaign against a government with the support of Cuban arms and Cuban personnel. I would have very great suspicion indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This government in El Salvador is struggling against very great difficulties. The president of El Salvador has a name which I know would immediately spring to the mind of Senator Evans, Dr Jose Napoleon Duarte. He was, for many years, a prisoner of the previous regime of General Romero. He was a refugee and has really only recently returned from exile in Venezuela. He has been a committed democrat all his life. He is dealing with a pretty hopeless crowd of colleagues in a very difficult situation. I suggest that the proper course for any of us who are interested in securing some sort of democracy and any sort of justice in Latin America would be to encourage the present government in El Salvador-I know it is a tiny country, but we seem to be hearing about it every day; that is why I mention it-to continue at a faster rate with the reforms which it undertook to introduce and which it has been rather sluggish in introducing. We should certainly not support the overthrow of that regime and replace it with a regime of the Cuban variety. That is what the alternative really has come to. </PARA>

<PARA> Similar campaigns of an equally spurious nature are taking place against alleged remnants of colonialism. A campaign is being undertaken at the present time to acquire independence for Puerto Rico. We are being told that a number of heroic people have been incarcerated in various places because of their struggles against United States oppression and that the United States is trying to prevent these people from obtaining that freedom which they all want. It is rather curious that when the election was held in Puerto Rico last year-I mention this only because this is one of the many sorts of issues which come before us all the time-one of the major parties had as its platform a continuation of the present commonwealth status with the United States of America and the other party wanted complete statehood, complete incorporation of Puerto Rico into the United States. Between them the two parties got well over 90 per cent of the votes that were cast in that election. Nonetheless we still hear organisations like the World Peace Council and people who support those organisations advocating independence for Puerto Rico whether the people of Puerto Rico want this so-called independence or do not want this so-called independence. </PARA>
<PARA> Closer to our own shores, and even closer to us than some parts of the Association of South East Asian Nations, we find a not dissimilar situation in New Caledonia. There are a number of people, including a number of very prominent people, who have said that we ought to be working for the immediate independence of New Caledonia. The situation in New Caledonia is a very complicated one. It is one of the so-called overseas territories of France. This means that New Caledonia has a constitutional status whereby it has direct representation in both houses of the French Parliament. The people who live there all have French citizenship. They have a territorial assembly which administers a number of the local matters specifically of a New Caledonian nature. I do not think anyone now looking back on the history of the nineteenth century would say that it was right that France should have taken New Caledonia when it did in the 1850s. None of us now would support European colonialism of that kind. It was an act of colonialism which caused New Caledonia to become a French possession. The same could be said about Australia being taken by the British in 1788. Whether it should have happened or should not have happened, the fact is now that in New Caledonia the indigenous Melanesian population is only 44 per cent or 45 per cent of the total population. The majority of the people who live in New Caledonia are of European descent; they are either French or people from other parts of the former French empire who have now settled there. I know one prominent New Caledonian trade unionist, a member of the Caledonian socialist party whose grandfather settled in New Caledonia in 1890 at the age of 21. He and his father were both born in New Caledonia and have lived there all their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> To suggest, as some people are now suggesting, that people like that should not be entitled to a vote in the New Caledonian elections and that only the Melanesians should be entitled to a vote is like suggesting that only the American Indians should be entitled to vote in the American elections and only Aborigines should be entitled to vote in Australian elecitons. If we were to apply to Australia the same demands as some people are making on New Caledonia, the only member of this Parliament who would be entitled to vote in the Australian elections would be Senator Bonner. That would be the consequence. This is a very complicated situation. The French Government has made it clear time and time again that if there is a majority vote in New Caledonia for independence it will evacuate the country. The French certainly do not want to get themselves involved in a colonial war. In the elections which have taken place in New Caledonia a very substantial majority have voted for a continuance of the present association with France. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that we ought to be devoting hours and hours to worrying about New Caledonia. But it is a country which is very close to Australia. It is a country where there is a very complicated situation. It seems to me to be quite irresponsible for us to say that in a complicated situation the side which we ought to take is the side which is most likely to be opposed to our interests and those whom we ought to oppose are those who are most likely to be in support of our interests. I do not think anybody could deny that having the French presence in the Pacific is an advantage to Australia. I do not doubt that there are many people within the Senate who would not agree with me. It is to our advantage for one of the major European powers to have some presence in the Pacific. If it is not there oppressing a group of people who do not want to be under its domination, but there because a majority of the people in the small territory want it to be there, I think it is to our advantage. It is only if it is clear that the majority of the people who live in that country, whether of indigenous origin or otherwise want the French to go, that we should in any way suggest that they should go. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major difficulties which faces Australia and countries similar to Australia is that we tend to bob around like a cork in the ocean waiting for every new current and wave that hits us. If one has the experience, as I have, of attending the United Nations General Assembly one will realise that there are all sorts of associations of nations. Many of them are not so powerful or so coherent as they appear to be. They might have some of the characteristics of what Chairman Mao in one of his happier moments described as a paper tiger. Nonetheless, there are organisations such as the Organisation of African Unity, the various Islamic states and the countries of the Warsaw pact which work together as blocs. Not many countries have a democratic form of political system, whatever their economic system may be. Those countries do not work with any sort of cohesion. If we believe that democracy is important and ought to be supported, it would seem to me that those countries which do support the democratic system ought to act together with the same cohesion as those who would like to destroy the democratic system. </PARA>
<PARA> Constantly in the United Nations countries such as Australia are defending themselves from the criticisms and attacks of all sorts of other people, but are themselves very seldom raising matters which could be of importance in the field of human rights. Just how absurd the United Nations is was shown on one occasion in the General Assembly last year. The delegate from Democratic Kampuchea announced that Democratic Kampuchea had become a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and it was put that because Democratic Kampuchea was an adherent to this fine document it showed how highly respected civil and political rights were in that country and how contemptible was the record with regard to civil and political rights of countries such as the United States and Australia which had not adhered to it. This is the sort of nonsense which constantly takes place in those chambers in New York. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, although it may be nonsense, it indicates that there is a consistent, coherent course of action by some of those forces who were represented there, with no countervailing force coming from Western countries. I do not think it ought to be our purpose to save capitalism or to save any economic system in these debates. What should be of the greatest concern to us is the fact that those of us who believe in a democratic system, a liberal, tolerant political society, do not act together to defend those societies which subscribe to the same doctrines and do not act to extend those values in the same way as those who subscribe to contrary values act to extend them. </PARA>
<PARA> In any event, the fact remains that we are faced with a totally new situation in regard to the relationship between the two major powers. We have to face the fact that the era of detente is over. We have to face the fact that no longer does our major like-minded country, the United States of America, believe that it is possible to secure peace merely by negotiation; that it can be achieved only if the United States greatly increases its strength. This places greatly different burdens and greatly different requirements upon us, whatever one's opinion may be of some of the other views I have expressed during what I was just saying. Things are not what they were before the elections of last November; they are now quite different and Australia will have to find a way to accommodate itself and to influence the new course of events. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take it that more than one report comes within the compass of this debate this evening. I want to say something about the report relating to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs which was tabled at the end of the last session. A report such as this is normally presented. It is extensively produced and full of very important detail. The matter of movements of peoples in the world in this part of the twentieth century is much more than the movement of people from one country to another. Today's migrant is in the intercontinental class and he is able to move from one country to another and back again and still work out a lifestyle which will be of satisfaction to himself and which will have some influence on the community into which he moves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A program of immigration today is much more than a program of numbers. As the report says, it is a program of ethnic affairs and, as such, it involves social welfare, education, employment, housing, new industries and, of course, the whole world of cultural affairs and human relations. The report which is on the Notice Paper for review tonight indicates quite strongly something of the change that is taking place in this whole area of immigration and ethnic affairs. It indicates that the first year of the 1980s is a watershed in the history of the Australian Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. During the year under review major immigration policy initiatives have been undertaken; an Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs has been established; the recommendations of the Galbally report are being implemented; and there have been other important initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us who have been interested in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, or the Department of Immigration as it was known for a very long time, will have noted one or two changes in the personnel of the Department. As the report reminds us, this new decade sees the departure of many senior, experienced officers who have served this Department faithfully and well over many years. May I, not only as one who has been interested in it, but also as one who has served within it as the Chairman of the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council for a number of years, pay tribute to officers from the Department of Immigration. They have served this country in many parts of the world under varying circumstances and during times when we were needing more migrants than we are taking now, at times when we were in need of a range of skills and at times when there were population movements in the world which were quite different from those that are in existence now. These people brought to their jobs not only great skills but also extensive areas of human understanding. They brought with them a capacity to recognise technical skills and cultural capacity all of which have made a tremendous difference to our lifestyle as well as to our economic growth. Indeed, the report reminds us that there are still some officers whose experience extends back to the days of the Second World War though within a few years all of them will have retired and so there will be a decrease in the number of officers whose experience has spanned the period of large scale immigration that took place in the post-war years. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that we are the beneficiaries of this skill and understanding of the people who have undertaken this work professionally. However, in dealing in the field of human endeavour, understanding and movement there is really, after all, nothing that can take the place of experience. The experience of these people who served the Department of Immigration in the post-war years has been of tremendous benefit not only to the Department but also to this country. As the report points out, the subject of immigration can arouse a whole range of feelings and passions. It is an area in which many avenues exist and which must be constantly reviewed and reformed from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> The report is significant insofar as it points out that overseas there is a marked resurgence of interest in coming to Australia. Further evidence of this recovery from the lower levels of intake during the 1970s is already in existence. There is a significant reference to the movement of what we call the trans-Tasman migrant. The report states that both migration inquiries and applications were up 30 per cent on the previous year. More than 38,000 migrants arrived in Australia in the first six months of 1979-80. This was a 12 per cent increase over the first six months of the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> The report, in its opening pages, deals with a number of what it calls significant events. It then goes on to detail not only those significant events but also a whole range of important events. The first significant event to which I refer is the appropriation in the Budget brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) which increased funds for the Department by more than $11m to around $73.4m. Another significant event that took place during the year under review was the development of the Australian Population and Immigration Council. During the period membership of the Council was increased quite considerably. As a result its expertise on international relations, its attitudes to and its relationships with local government and with the whole range of industry have been strengthened. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If it does not have links with this Parliament any more, Senator Mulvihill, I suggest it is the role of this Parliament and the Government to ensure that the links are restored. The Council is a very important body and is still the principal advisory body on population and immigration policy. It advises the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) on a whole range of matters including the monitoring of research into population change and the ways in which immigration intakes can be planned to complement the planning of other national organisations. I suggest that at present this is a very important area concerning immigration. Immigration is not only a means of building a population content which might meet the needs of industry but also it has a close relationship to and influence upon the size and nature of the Australian population. The size and nature of the Australian population is all important for international relations-a subject which occupied so much of our time earlier tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Other areas to which the Australian Population and Immigration Council has devoted its attention include family reunion, assisted passages and other matters of that kind. As I said, the importance of this body is not limited to its advisory role to the Minister or indeed to its advisory role to the Government. Its advice can have an influence upon government policy. The work carried out by the Council flows through into other fields. As I said earlier, it assists employers, industry and local government to plan ahead by making available and investigating the various Australian demographic and population patterns. It needs to take into account not only the number of people which the country can take but also the age of various segments of the population. We have plenty of evidence that Australia is approaching the time when its population will be aged. This will be of some significance not only for our lifestyles but also for social service payments, sustenance and maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA> I have selected only one or two of the significant events contained in the report. I will now examine the establishment of the Australian Refugee Advisory Council which is also given some considerable attention in this report. That Council has a range of purposes which includes the reception and resettlement of refugees. It looks closely at the needs of displaced persons within this country and at the important matter of development of resettlement procedures and resources for refugees. What we did in this area some 20 or 30 years ago no longer necessarily applies because there are now new situations and conditions with the refugees. One of the important areas to which the Council is giving its attention deals with ways of informing the Australian community about refugees and their resettlement program. For the first time in its history Australia has had to come to terms with refugees from neighbouring countries arriving on its shores and in its communities. The Council takes time to deliberate and to provide greater understanding and a better community attitude toward refugees and better relationships between refugees and the host communities. </PARA>
<PARA> Early in the Council's program it set out a comprehensive plan to assist refugees to settle in Australia. It has provided for schemes which enable community based groups and other organisations to provide personal interest and direct assistance to refugees, particularly the Indo-China refugees. The first four families settled in Australia under this scheme came to Whyalla in my own State of South Australia. In 1979-80 some 800 refugees were resettled under the scheme. I think it is important to point out in looking at any report on immigration and ethnic affairs and the intake of people into the Australian society that the world refugee situation is still critical although, fortunately, there have been some improvements in recent months. I made it my business and had the opportunity to visit refugee settlements and camps in a number of countries over a good many years. These include camps in Europe, the Middle East, Vietnam and, more recently, in the South China Sea. I refer to the island of Paulo Bidong, Hong Kong and elsewhere. These camps contained the people who vote with their feet. They are the product of today's international turmoil. I suppose refugees have always been part of history. Their arrival has influenced history in one way or another, and for the first time in our history refugees are a significant ethnic movement in the Australian population growth and in this part of the world. They are already part of our migrant intake. They are part of the work force, they are part of the social scene and they are part of the cultural blend. The report draws attention to Australia's involvement in this development in our part of the world. Early in the report there is a photograph of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs with the 300,000th refugee to come to Australia since the Second World War. The Minister states in the report that Australia has benefited from the talents and energy of refugees. I think we have to recognise this development in our immigration program and in our approach to ethnic affairs and hold in balance its influence on our refugee intake as well as on our humanitarian concepts. </PARA>
<PARA> The third and only other significant event referred to in the report to which I wish to refer concerns the development of the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs. The word 'multiculturalism' has been used in a wide variety of ways and I think we tend to get carried away with it. Nevertheless, in a society such as ours it is something we must constantly hold up for examination and review; and the establishment of the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs, which is referred to in the report, is of some particular significance. It was established in response to a definite need for information on this aspect of our social development in our changing society. As honourable senators know very well, over the past 30 years something like 3.5 million people have come to Australia from well over 100 different countries. As evidence of our changing lifestyles, the Australian-born population has shown itself in very large measure to be capable of adapting and accepting many of the new cultural values which have been introduced from overseas without any significant racial antagonisms and without the significant tensions which somehow seem to have marred life in other countries. This changing nature has been identified by the Galbally Review of Post-arrival Programs and Services for Migrants. </PARA>
<PARA> The report we are debating emphasises that Australia is at a critical stage in its development of a cohesive and united society. Whilst there is a need to assist the development of a multicultural society on the basis of skilled research, at the time of the establishment of this Institute of Multicultural Affairs not much research had been done and not much information was available. I think this Institute of Multicultural Affairs has already done a signal service to the country and it will continue not only to furnish reports to the Minister but also to make information available to the Australian community and to provide a repository of literature and other material which will help us understand the diverse cultures of our Australian community. Having said that, I think we must always be mindful of the importance of the central nature of the host Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA> As an aside to that I draw attention to the comments of the head of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs of only a few weeks ago when he drew attention to the need for Australians to develop skills in languages and to his call for every child in Australia to learn a second language as part of its normal education. He says that we have most physical resources but that we seem to be very careless of language resources. Of course, Mr Menadue, who is head of the Department, has a considerable number of capacities in the area of languages. He says that they are needed to bridge the gap in understanding between different ethnic communities within Australia. It is all part of the development of the multicultural society about which we speak. </PARA>
<PARA> Another development related to this is the establishment of the Australian Ethnic Affairs Council, sometimes called the successor to the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council. The Australian Ethnic Affairs Council was established in 1977 to advise the Minister on a number of matters. It has been reviewed and was re-established in January of last year. My distinguished friend Professor George Zubrzycki, the Polish-born Foundation Professor of Sociology at the Australian National University, is its chairman. Its assignments include advising the Minister and the Government on the integration of migrants into the community and the position of migrants in relation to health, welfare, housing, education, employment and a whole range of other matters. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the report there is a rather lesser item to which I draw attention. There appear a number of photographs in which migrants and others are featured, but in the background of those photographs there is the recurring portrait of Her Majesty the Queen which is the same as that which hangs in King's Hall and which, if my memory serves me correctly, dates back to 1953 or 1954. I would have thought-indeed, I have expressed this hope-that in contemporary Australian society, when we have so much pride in our head of state and head of the Commonwealth whose portrait and photograph appear in so many offices and on so many documents which relate to immigration and ethnic affairs, we might very well take up the idea of up-dating this portrait so that the migrants who receive documentation at least have on that documentation a portrait of the head of state which is as contemporary as they are. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, immigration is accepted, I think, by the Australian community as an important factor in the attainment of a wide range of national goals. We have experienced its role in the supply of labour, and that must be a continuing dimension of our policy. But we see also other dimensions in the pursuit of other national objectives-a larger domestic economy; the transfer to Australia of new technologies; the maintenance of a relatively young population despite the falling birthrate; the importation of new cultures and different social and political perspectives to help us to understand not only other people and other nations but also ourselves; a humanitarian response to human need; the development through population growth of a more enduring relationship with other countries; and a substantial national industrial and communications system. All told we are a nation which is growing and making considerable advances in development. We will make those advances in development only through a strong body of people, of families, working and living together in harmony and understanding. So I commend to the Senate the Review of Activities of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and wish that Department every success as it undertakes its diverse activities on behalf of the nation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 2 December 1980 (Hansard, page 208), Senator McIntosh asked Senator Carrick, as Minister representing the Prime Minister, a question without notice concerning the staffing of hospitals in Western Australia. Senator Carrick indicated he would refer the question to the Minister for Health who has provided the following information:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the hospital cost sharing arrangements, the Commonwealth meets 50 per cent of the agreed net operating costs of recognised (i.e. public) hospitals in Western Australia. The outlays for this purpose in 1980-81 are estimated at $145m, an increase of about 12 per cent over the previous year. Although the Commonwealth makes this significant contribution to the States' hospital operating costs, allocation of these funds and the administration and provision of hospital services are entirely the States' responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that trained nurses in Western Australian public hospitals were granted by the Western Australian Industrial Commission a 5 per cent salary increase, effective from the first pay after 1 October 1980. It is expected that the increase will involve additional payments of about $5m in 1980-81, and $7m in a full year.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth's policy in relation to salary increases is that it is prepared to cost share those salary increases that fall within the wage indexation guidelines. Provided that the Commonwealth is assured that the recent nurses' award increase in Western Australia comes within these guidelines, the Commonwealth is prepared to meet, under the current hospital cost sharing arrangements, its share of the increased salary costs for trained nurses in Western Australia.</PARA>
