<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 70 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that the introduction of tuition fees for post-graduate and second degree students will:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) severely limit access to such levels of study. The ability of a student to pay tuition fees will be the main criteria for entry to such courses. The restricted availability of Commonwealth post-graduate scholarships and the difficulty of finding part-time work in employment related areas further restricts the ability of post-graduate students to pay tuition fees.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) result in higher attrition rates in post-graduate and second degree studies. Recent surveys have indicated that up to 50 per cent of students would be unable to continue their studies if tuition fees at the level of $1,000 per year were introduced. Inability to continue study is both a personal tragedy and a waste of the community's resources.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) limit Australia's capacity to cope with technological, economic and social change. Many degree students who will have to pay tuition fees undertake further study to upgrade their qualifications to cope with changes in their area of employment. Many are forced to undertake retraining in areas outside their current employment because of declining job opportunities in such areas due to economic change. Further study for many students will bring no financial benefit but simply allow them to extend their contribution in the course of their work. For example thousands of teachers have undertaken further study to gain expertise in such areas as migrant education, remedial literacy and numeracy teaching, curriculum development and so on.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) further restrict access to such study for women students. As a result of the abolition of tuition fees the proportion of women students in tertiary education has increased significantly. Mature age women students have benefited by the opportunity denied them when they left school.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) seriously undermine Australia's research effort. Approximately 22 per cent of Australian research takes place in tertiary institutions. The bulk of Australia's basic research is undertaken in universities. The introduction of tuition fees threatens Australia's capacity to cope with major structural change in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senate will reject the introduction of tuition fees.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 27 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable President and Senators in the Parliament assembled. This Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. the proposal to introduce fees for higher and second degrees will mean that access to post-graduate and recurrent education will be limited to the rich. Australian research and ability to cope with technological change will suffer; this proposal must be seen as a step in the direction of the introduction of fees for all tertiary students.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. the proposed introduction of a loans scheme for students will mean graduating with a heavy debt or being denied a tertiary education if loans are refused because a student is seen as a ''poor risk'' (particularly affecting women and those doing non-vocational courses); only the rich will be able to get a tertiary education without course restrictions and the burden of indebtedness.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. in regard to the proposal to restrict eligibility for TEAS and the foreshadowing of reviewing TEAS levels only in the light of the availability of loans; it should be noted that any further downgrading of TEAS, which is already inadequate, can only further limit access to education.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. the proposed restriction of Adult Secondary Assistance to those needing qualifications for employment will severely restrict access to a full high school education and necessary bridging education to tertiary education for those who left school early.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. the proposal not to fund 30 Colleges of Advanced Education if they are not rationalised is an attack on teacher education. This attack will create teacher shortages in the mid 1980s, restrict access to education now and endanger the future quality of teaching available to Australian children.</PARA>
<PARA>Your petitioners therefore pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) post-secondary tuition fees not be introduced for any courses or for any category of students;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that the TEAS scheme be extended so as to more fully meet the real financial needs of students;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) that a comprehensive loans scheme not be introduced;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O97">Senator ELSTOB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Last week Mr Bruce Denham, the General Manager of the Electricity Trust of South Australia, warned that South Australians can expect to pay higher electricity charges until the Federal Government approves greater semi-governmental borrowings. He also stated that the reason why Victoria had a 20 per cent increase in electricity charges was the severe restrictions being imposed by the Australian Loan Council. I refer the Minister to those statements and ask: Is it not a fact that the Government's restrictive policies in this area have led and will continue to lead to extra charges, to extra costs to consumers and industry and, as a consequence, to increases in inflation and unemployment? How can the Government explain this inconsistent and contradictory economic policy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I did not see the statement referred to by Senator Elstob. But I think it is a fact that varying rates of electricity charges are imposed in the different States of Australia and a number of factors would be related to the precise costs. In some States there may be an attitude that there ought to be some subsidisation or equalisation of costs. In others there may be a very different point of view. It is always competent for State Premiers at Loan Council meetings to press their own position and to take as strong action as they are able to within the Loan Council to see that the needs of their States are met. I will have a look at the question that arises from the statement that was referred to, and if there is any information I am able to provide I will see that it is given to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="C67">Senator COLLARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport. I refer to the current situation at Brisbane Airport, where air traffic control is not available between 9 p.m. and midnight, with resultant inconvenience to the travelling public. Is it true that controllers at Brisbane Airport are not prepared to work overtime, whereas controllers at other airports are prepared to work overtime to maintain services? If this is so, notwithstanding the administrative and/or political bungling that has led to the current shortage of controllers, will the Minister advise whether the disruptions at Brisbane Airport are caused as much by industrial action as by the operational shortage of controllers?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1264" SPEAKER="Messner Sen The Hon A.J." NAMEID="9I4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="VETERANS' AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some information on the matter which has been raised by Senator Collard. It is true, I think, that controllers at Brisbane Airport decided at a meeting convened by the local branch of their industrial organisation-the Civil Air Operations Officers Association-that they would not extend their normal shifts of seven hours without a break beyond 9 p.m. during the period of the current shortage. The principal reason for the disruption to passengers at Brisbane is the shortage of traffic controllers. We have been considering that question in the Senate and in the other chamber for some considerable time now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Had the controllers agreed to work one hour overtime each night the inconvenience caused by diversion or cancellation of delayed flights would have been significantly reduced. Apparently the Department of Transport has not been able to negotiate successfully with the relevant industrial organisation for unconditional working of overtime at Brisbane as required. However, the Association has advised that controllers will work overtime and also agree to roster flexibility in return for fundamental changes to conditions of employment of air traffic controllers. That claim which has been put forward by the Association is being considered at present by both the Department and the Public Service Board. I expect that the Minister will be in a position to make a statement in that connection at the earliest opportunity.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Did the Minister representing the Minister for Communications note the comments of the Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, Mr Norgard, on the Australian Broadcasting Commission's AM program this morning on the question of corporate funding of ABC programs? Did Mr Norgard indicate, or at least hint, that by providing inadequate funding to the ABC the Government was placing pressure on the ABC, in effect, to accept some form of corporate funding? Is it a fact that the Government is exerting such pressure? As part of the general financial squeeze on the ABC, does the Government propose to implement those recommendations of the Dix report that would in effect destroy the ABC's symphony orchestras by transferring the responsibility of running them to State governments and also by dismantling those vital and essential elements of Australian music-the training orchestras? I urge the Minister to give a reply to this question as there is great concern in the community over these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know really what is behind Senator Mason's question. The facts are quite clear. This Government supports, and continues to support, the Australian Broadcasting Commission. It does so in a very major way with financial and other support. I understand that on 14 October Mr John Norgard delivered the C. G. Lewis Memorial Lecture entitled 'The Future of National Broadcasting in Australia' at the Australian Institute of Public Administration in Adelaide. Although I did not hear this morning's AM program, it may well be that it was inspired by this lecture. Mr Norgard's comments concerning corporate sponsorship for the ABC have been widely reported in today's Press. I take it that Senator Mason heard comments in this respect on the radio. Mr Norgard is quoted as saying that in the current situation concerning government funding the ABC needed to contribute to its own funding through corporate sponsorship and merchandising of programs and related material. He expressed the belief that corporate sponsorship could operate satisfactorily, given adequate safeguards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ABC favours the introduction of corporate sponsorship and in its review proposed that the ABC be enabled to introduce corporate sponsorship in carefully controlled circumstances. This suggestion was supported by the Dix Committee which recommended the introduction of corporate underwriting in the sense of the contribution of funds or other resources by organisations towards the cost of program production. Corporate underwriting would be subject to strict guidelines to regulate the practice.</PARA>
<PARA> The Dix report is currently under consideration by Government and the matter of corporate sponsorship is receiving close attention. A parliamentary debate will be held later in the Budget session, or when possible, to canvass this and other key issues within the report. It is quite clear that the Government is concerned to ensure the best possible basis for the operation of the ABC. We are very concerned-here I pick up the point about the orchestras-that the orchestras, which play such an important part in the cultural life of this country, should continue so to do.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter has been raised in the Senate on a number of occasions. I think that in response to earlier questions I have outlined that Aspect House received approval from my predecessor for funding for services to handicapped children, that a level of funding of approximately $60,000 per annum was approved and that funds considerably in excess of that amount were utilised in less than the first six months of operation. There has since been a deal of publicity and concern about the future of that project. As a result of that, a group comprising representatives of the State Government departments involved and my own Department has examined the operations of Aspect House and has reported to both the Commonwealth Government and the State Government. I was in the process of dealing with that report with the Honourable Andrew Lohrey, I think last week, when in fact he, for reasons quite unrelated to Aspect House, ceased to be a Minister in the Tasmanian Government. The matter is now, I think, in the hands of the Premier of Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In response to a request which was made to us by the parents involved in Aspect House, both the Premier of Tasmania and I have agreed that we should hold action until the parents have had a chance to respond to the report which was made by departmental officers who examined Aspect House, and we have asked that that response be made as promptly as possible. Following receipt of that response, I will be further considering the matter in conjunction with the relevant State Minister from Tasmania. Needless to say, we are anxious to find an appropriate solution to the problem which has emerged, and I expect that we will be able to proceed in this matter in the same close consultation with the Tasmanian Government as we have done over recent weeks.</PARA>
<PARA> The matter is quite difficult. The matter involves handicapped children. It involves a project which did get some approval and which has now got under way, as I said before, on a very much larger basis than was ever approved. It is the wish of both governments, I think, to find a solution which will ensure that the needs of those children are met in a proper way and within the funds available to both governments.</PARA>

The scheme will enable students to supplement their current incomes with amounts which will be repayable after their graduation. In preparation for the introduction of the scheme Ministers have been considering such questions as eligibility and administration. There have been fruitful discussions between Commonwealth officials and representatives of the Australian Bankers Association. Some aspects of the scheme have still to be settled, which may cause problems in having the scheme operating at the beginning of 1982.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Health by stating that I have been approached regarding the high cost of pharmaceutical items relating to the day to day control of diabetes. The cost of single-use syringes to diabetics is between 14c and 40c a syringe. In view of this, will the Government give consideration to allowing syringes to be made available in packages of 100 for the current standard cost of $2.75 under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bjelke-Petersen says that she has been approached on this matter. I recently acted as Minister for Health and seemed to sign hundreds of letters on this same subject. I take it that there is a fair amount of community interest and concern from diabetic associations and from groups representing diabetic patients. I can well understand the matters raised by Senator Bjelke-Petersen. She would be aware that under the provisions of the National Health Act the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is limited to providing drugs and medicinal preparations as benefits and therefore at the moment items such as insulin syringes are not made available under the Scheme. To take up the point so correctly made by Senator Bjelke-Petersen, consideration has been given to seeking ways and means by which Government assistance might be given in meeting the cost of insulin syringes required by diabetics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can assure the honourable senator that the Government is sympathetic to the needs of diabetics and is aware and mindful of the costs to the patients in the management of diabetes. However, at the moment the Government is unable, in the present economic situation, to find the available money to meet the needs that Senator Bjelke-Petersen has pointed out. In view of this it is not possible for the Government at this time to commit itself to additional programs such as assistance with the cost of insulin syringes and other equipment. I am advised by the Minister for Health that this matter will be kept under review and that he is concerned to continue to see what might be done to assist these constituents.</PARA>

Is it also true, as claimed in an article entitled 'Counting the One Per Cent' by Mr Jim Thorn, the editor of the magazine, that a senior Ansett executive has stated that the Boeing 737-200 is no more economical to run than the McDonnell Douglas DC9-30, with which Ansett is already equipped? Can the Minister confirm what the magazine describes as a strong rumour in the industry that Ansett plans to back-trade or trade-in its newly introduced Boeing 737-200s for 737-300s in 1985, only four years after the introduction of the 737-200s? Does the Minister think it proper that Ansett should be allowed to spend approximately $150m on the purchase of aircraft which offer no significant advantage over existing equipment and which the airline apparently admits are being bought solely as a result of a marketing decision? Can the Minister justify the capital expenditure of $150m at the expense of the long-suffering air traveller to maintain the market share of a privately-owned airline?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry and refer him to the dumping of almonds on the Australian market by United States producers. Is it a fact that these almonds are being sold at $2.90 a kilogram, compared with $4.50 a kilo for the Australian product? Although the quantity of United States almonds represents only 5 per cent of its total production, it amounts to 40 per cent of our domestic demand. Can the Minister confirm that these United States producers agreed not to undercut Australian producers, and then reneged on that agreement? Will the Minister assure the Senate that his Department will examine this matter and take action to protect the industry in Australia? Incidentally, the major proportion of the production comes from South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did seek some information from the Minister for Primary Industry with respect to the matter raised by the honourable senator. That enables me to advise the Senate that the reason for the difficulty which is raised in the honourable senator's question is that there has been a record almond crop in the United States. Production has risen to 204,000 tonnes in 1981 from 146,000 tonnes in 1980. In addition to that, production for 1981 from the three major world producers-the United States, Spain and Italy-totals a record 300,000 tonnes, an increase of nearly 50 per cent on the 1980 output of these countries. That is the explanation for the very considerable drop in the price of almonds on the world market. As a consequence of those world record crops, the duty paid price of United States almonds has fallen from $4.30 per kilogram to $2.75 per kilogram.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Co-operative Almond Producers Ltd, which markets the great bulk-over 90 per cent-of Australian production, sets its selling price in August each year in advance of the subsequent harvest in March-April of the following year. It bases that price on the equivalent duty paid price for United States almonds. It set its price last August for the 1981 crop at $4.50 per kilogram, which was the equivalent of the United States ruling rate in August 1980. There is, of course, nothing that the Government can do to stop the United States producers from altering their price in the light of the world production situation.</PARA>
<PARA> We, in turn, have managed to live up to the general world situation by also producing a record crop this year. But the figure of 1,453 tonnes indicates what a relatively small part of the world production we grow in Australia. Of course, as the honourable senator said, the bulk of our production is grown in his State of South Australia. Because of the marketing difficulties which are being experienced by the Australian almond industry in the difficult circumstances I have outlined and following representations which have been made by the industry in Australia, on 28 August Mr Nixon requested the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs to send a reference to the Temporary Assistance Authority. Public hearings of the Authority have already been held, on 17 September, and it is hoped that the Government will be able to give consideration to the matter in the very near future.</PARA>

I refer to the blatant racist bigotry of the statement by Mr Lang Hancock outrageously proposing a so-called murderous solution for Aboriginal people in Australia. This statement was given wide media publicity during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting last week. The Parliament was not sitting at the time. If it had been, the uproar of disapproval in this chamber would also have been widely heard. I ask: What, at the time, were the terms of the Minister's own condemnation of this outrage? Whilst it is now true that Mr Hancock can only hang his head in shame when in the company of other Australians, can the Minister now say whether State Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs or Premiers have joined with him in gaining a full retraction by Mr Hancock of this much-publicised statement and his apology to the Aboriginal people and all Australians?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Hancock's statements concerned people who were, as he termed them, half castes. This, of course, is a condition which people acquire by virtue of their parents and to condemn them on the ground of their racial composition seems to me to be the height of crudity and something quite abhorrent to all Australians. At the time Mr Hancock made this outrageous statement, I did indicate my view to the Press by way of response to a number of queries. This was extensively reported in the print media. I will make available to Senator Teague copies of the Press reports which set out quite clearly the disgust which I expressed about Mr Hancock's statements and his sentiments. I went on television to make it clear that this view was held.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sure that honourable senators on both sides of the House would find Mr Hancock's opinions crude and abhorrent. I am also sure that most Australians would feel the same. His views are contrary to the increased sensitivity and awareness of Aboriginal problems which exist in Australia. They are contrary to the willingness to work with Aboriginals in a constructive way which characterises Australians and Australian opinion now. They are contrary to the views and behaviour of most resource developers in this country who are displaying a positive attitude in working with Aboriginal communities. I cite there the work of the Australian Mining Industry Council and the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association, both of which have published policies which recognise the needs and interests of Aboriginals and seek co-operative solutions.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Commissioner for Community Relations has written to Mr Hancock in terms of his powers under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Provision also exists for individuals to complain to the Commissioner for Community Relations if they believe that Mr Hancock's actions are in contravention of the Act. If people feel strongly, they should write to Mr Hancock. I have made my own position quite clear. I believe that what was said was quite outrageous and quite unhelpful. I can only conclude that Mr Hancock's judgment is not what it used to be.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise this matter in the Senate today because arts activity throughout Australia is in serious disarray. The Australian Labor Party and I consider it a matter of great concern that the viability of the artistic and cultural life in this country is in jeopardy because of Fraser Government policies-because of cutbacks in funding, administrative incompetence and lack of a clearly enunciated policy to assist the arts. Australian artists are finding it harder and harder to work productively and Australian audiences are being more and more deprived of access to their own culture. During the last six years Australia has experienced the most philistine government it has ever experienced, certainly in my lifetime-the most anti-intellectual and the most anti-cultural government. Yet, of course, it is willing to ride on and to exploit the successes of arts activities encouraged by a previous government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government now is prepared to say: 'Look at the Australian film industry. Isn't it doing well?' The Government is very happy to associate itself with such successes but when it comes to providing adequate funds to ensure the continuation of the development of the sort of talent that led to the burgeoning of the Australian film industry it is quite silent. In place of a well thought out arts funding structure and adequate appropriation equitably distributed the Fraser Government has administered and funded the arts with a combination of outright neglect, erratic administrative decisions and, most significantly, by using the arts as yet another means of providing tax havens for the wealthy. Insofar as one can detect any trend or theme in the Government's approach to arts funding it has been this: To withdraw properly accountable public assistance and substitute private sector support by way of tax concessions and corporate self-promotion activities. This approach is objectionable on many scores. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the main objections is that assistance to the arts in the form of tax concessions for the rich is a form of assistance that is not publicly accountable. It is difficult, in some cases impossible, to assess the public revenue lost by this method. A further objection is that the method itself is open to abuse. Indeed, there have been some notorious cases of abuse. Only today the media carry a report that the Government is to close a tax loophole used by a syndicate of businessmen to claim a tax deduction of $3.7m for a donation of a collection of pre-Colombian art to the National Gallery of Victoria. The syndicate had paid only $1.2m for the collection immediately before it donated it to the gallery. But it was able to claim a tax deduction of $3.7m-three times what it had paid for it-based upon valuation of the art. The loophole is now to be closed. </PARA>
<PARA> The report in today's Age points out that this is not the only time a loophole has been used. In a number of less publicised cases the same loophole was used to achieve tax deductions in excess of the paid price for the works of art. An additional element has been added to the scheme whereby in some cases-we were told in today's Age-the work is donated to the gallery and the gallery then lends it back to the donor for the duration of his lifetime. Of course, the tax concession is still paid. It is abuses such as these that are inevitable when the Government's preferred means of assisting the arts is to assist the rich to minimise their tax bills. It is incidents such as these that cause the Labor Party to be quite sceptical about the substitution of tax concessions for properly accountable direct public assistance. It is incidents such as these that raise doubts about the whole question of corporate support for the arts. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that these doubts extend to the appointment of Dr Timothy Pascoe as the new Executive Chairman of the Australia Council. Dr Pascoe is a person with considerable qualifications. The Labor Party does not regard the period he spent working at the Liberal Party headquarters as a disqualification for his appointment to a statutory body</PARA>
<PARA> However, because of his closeness to the Government of the day the question of jobs for the boys does arise and the government in its usual arrogance and negligence, has made no real attempt to answer that question. If we look at Dr Pascoe's qualifications for the specific job of administering direct Federal Government assistance to the arts, we find that his prior experience has been something less than appropriate. His previous job was running an organisation called ARTS Ltd, whose charter was to persuade corporations to sponsor the arts as a means of self advertisement. He had some modest success in this, although one could hardly say that his activities caused a massive flow of private sector money into the arts. The total figure claimed by Dr Pascoe for corporate sponsorship is $10m a year, but only $54,500 of this went through ARTS Ltd, the organisation with which Dr Pascoe has been involved for the past few years. That is a miniscule amount, I might say, and hardly one that establishes that we do not need proper public sponsorship of the arts because the corporations are very anxious to hop into the breach. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Pascoe's understanding of the role of independent statutory authorities also seems to be somewhat deficient. His analogy, as reported in the Age, in an interview with Jill Sykes on Tuesday of this week, is that the relationship between Government and statutory bodies is that of the rapist and his victim. Apart from the tastelessness of the image his analogy conjures up-Dr Pascoe being raped by Mr Wilson, perhaps-the analogy hardly inspires confidence that the Government's appointment is one of a person who is determined to be independent in the administration of his function. It seems to me that the rapist victim is hardly the appropriate analogy for what we, in the Labor Party at least, understand to be the proper, independent role of a statutory body. </PARA>
<PARA> However, granted that Dr Pascoe may be able to make the transition from corporate sponsorship to public administration, this question still remains unanswered: Why does the Australia Council need a new executive Chairman? How is Dr Pascoe's salary of $56,000 to be justified? The Australia Council is not short of executive talent. The widely admired Dr Jean Battersby was the Chief Executive Officer of the Council for some years. Then the Fraser Government, without any real explanation of its decision, added another chief, Mr John Cameron-again a competent person. Dr Battersby was moved sideways into what one can only imagine to be the less than fully demanding area of managing the International Cultural Exhibitions Corporation. Now we have another chief at a time when the indians, that is the people who actually service the boards and administer the programs, are all too few on the ground. In the absence of any justification for this decision, it can be assumed only that, rather than face up to the task of rationalising the administration of the Council, the Government has taken the line of least resistance and has appointed yet another chief whose only real qualifications for the job seem to be his shared political philosophy with the Government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the matter of funding. This Government's paltry expenditure on the arts since it attained office is an example of the meanness of spirit which typifies the Fraser Government and for which it will be remembered. The vigorous cultural life which flourished under the Whitlam Government was a direct result of clear sighted arts policy and appropriate funding, particularly for the new, the innovative and the Australian. By contrast, the period of the Fraser Government has been characterised by cutbacks, incompetent administration of arts policy and a lack of encouragement for the development of Australian artists and arts activities. There has been a cutback of almost 40 per cent in the last six years and the level of staffing for the Council has dropped from 167 to 102. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Budget $29m has been allocated to the Australia Council, which to begin with is a drop of over 5 per cent in real terms. Of course, this money is not all available for direct expenditure by the Council, as Senator Hamer, who I am pleased to see is sitting in this chamber, is very well aware. An amount of $7.6m is earmarked for the ballet, the opera and the orchestras. After administration costs the Council is left with only $17m for distribution to the arts. Of this amount the Government, not the Australian council, has decided that more than $500,000 will be spent on a Commonwealth Games arts festival. In the forthcoming year the Australia Council will have $373,000 less to assist Australian writers, painters, musicians, craftspeople and others. Whilst I am in favour of creating a favourable impression for visitors to this country, I cannot condone cuts to the Australia Council's already miniscule budget for the encouragement of the arts just so that the Government can grandstand at the Commonwealth Games. </PARA>
<PARA> The total funding for the arts provided through the Australia Council in this Budget is only 0.07 per cent of total government outlays, a figure which is described by Richard Wherrett, the Director of the Sydney Theatre Co., in a recent letter to the Sydney Morning Herald, as derisory. I point out that the figure has fallen from 0.12 per cent of total government outlays under the Whitlam Government. At this stage I must ask why the Government is so unprepared to give assistance to the arts. Why is the Government so unprepared to assist struggling theatre companies and other arts activities to keep pace with the effects of inflation when it is so prepared to be generous to other areas of the economy? As I said, it is indeed the most philistine government in this country that I have seen in my lifetime. </PARA>
<PARA> In practical terms, the Government's funding squeeze is curtailing Australian creativity and the development of an Australian culture. The Australia Council's Literature Board, for example, in 1974-75 spent $1.3m on payment to individual writers. Last financial year it spent less than $1m-a drop in real terms of 52 per cent. The result is fewer grants of smaller value and ultimately fewer fine Australian books. Meanwhile the Government does nothing about the takeover of Australian publishing by multinational publishing companies, an activity which will result in even fewer Australian books being published here and being available for Australians to read. The Government's actions have not gone unnoticed. In an editorial entitled 'Squeezing the Arts', the Sydney Morning Herald, which is hardly noted for its radical or progressive views, on 24 August had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> One of the short-sighted, even shabby, dispensations of the 1981-82 Budget is its continuation, for the sixth year in succession, of the Fraser Government's squeeze on the funding of the arts . . . reversing the trend towards a growing Commonwealth role in encouraging the expansion of our indigenous culture. Following important initiatives by the Holt, Gorton and McMahon Governments, that trend became a surge under Mr Whitlam's enlightened understanding of the vital contribution indigenous arts can make to our national identity and international reputation. The policies of the Fraser Government are placing that advance in jeopardy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be interested to see what kind of defence the Minister can offer for this appalling and shabby treatment of arts activities. I turn my attention to structural matters. As the Government is only too happy to tell us with boring repetition, it is not only the allocation of money that matters. I quite agree. We need proper structures for the assistance of the arts. We have seen a number of amendments to the Australia Council Act during the last six years of the Fraser Government. None of them seem to have been made with any clear objective of rationalising the functions of the Council. None of them seems to have brought about any real administrative improvement in the operation of the Council. None of these changes, including the downgrading in the role of the boards, the removal of board chairmen from the Council and introduction of a new and, as I have said, apparently unnecessary chief executive officer position, has been justified. The Government has not bothered to try to explain to us why these changes are in the interests of arts administration in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To fulfil its position as a major advisory body on the arts as well as a main disseminator of government financial support to the arts and arts companies, the Australia Council requires a workable structure and an adequate number of members with expertise in the arts. On that latter point I must make further comment. The Australia Council is not a struggling arts company in need of business expertise to assist it to retain its financial viability. Therefore, its primary need is for members who have experience in the arts rather than people with entrepreneurial experience. </PARA>

I say in passing, commenting on Senator Teague's interjection, that although this Government seems to believe that a great deal of entrepreneurial skill and experience exists within the business community and has made appointments to statutory boards and bodies associated with arts administration because of this belief, we have seen a series of chaotic administrative exercises by these bodies which are supposed to be getting the benefit of all this entrepreneurial expertise. It seems that the time has come to look at people with experience in the arts rather than experience in running some kind of business enterprise if we are to get proper administration. I must remind the Senate of the continuing crises in the Australian Opera management. I think we have had something like seven general managers in the last 12 years, the most recent being Mr Patrick Veitch from New York.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope he will be a good one. I would like to see a change in this kind of administrative chaos, but what kind of soundness and stability of administration can we have when we constantly have these controversies, resignations and forced resignations? There was an inquiry into the affairs of the Opera-the McKinnon report-but the Government seems to have taken very little action in response to that report. If we turn to the Australian Ballet we find similar stories of controversial administrative situations. Two very talented artistic administrators, first Sir Robert Helpmann and then Ms Anne Woolliams, resigned or were forced to resign in a flurry of controversy. That sort of thing does not demonstrate a government that is determined to have proper arts administration in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the problems is that this Government has never shown the slightest interest in providing for the training of arts administrators in this country. We have a dearth of our own people with competence in arts administration. Very few courses are available. Very few schemes are available to encourage the development of administrative skills. We go into the cultural cringe and constantly import our arts administrators from overseas and, I have to say, to very little effect. I do not want to dismiss the contribution made by overseas administrators in this country but the picture is not a rosy one. As I have suggested, there have been constant controversies in the area of our major companies. Of course, when we come to our smaller companies, the ones that do not attract so much media attention, we find similar stories of administrative chaos and incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet the Government has taken no serious steps to ensure that we can start to train people in arts administration in Australia. But when we take people from overseas and provide them with jobs in a world situation of decreasing employment in arts administration-Australia is really a very good country to come to get a job-do we ever insist on reciprocal arrangements?</PARA>
<PARA> Do we ever say to the United Kingdom or to the United States of America: 'We will employ your people here but we insist that our young developing administrators get experience in your country'? No, of course; it is a cultural exchange that is only one way. That is typical of this Government, which has no confidence in the true independence of an Australian culture. </PARA>
<PARA> I see that my time has almost run out. Unless this Government seriously faces up to the funding inadequacies for the arts in this country, unless this Government is serious about ensuring a proper arts policy administrated by an independent statutory body staffed by competent people, we will see a serious decline of all forms of creative activity in Australia. The film industry, of which we have been so proud; Australian Broadcasting Commission productions, of which we have been so proud in the past; the marvellous flourishing of Australian literature, fiction and non-fiction, of which we have had many examples in just this last year, all will be in jeopardy unless the Government is prepared to abandon its philistine attitude and provide proper resources and proper thought to establishing a workable arts policy for this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a matter of public importance. It may be worth while to bring to the attention of the Senate the way in which it is worded. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Government to ensure stable administration and adequate funding for the arts. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to start by making the observation that we would all agree that one of the marks of a civilised society is surely the extent to which it is involved in the arts and values its culture and cultural activity. Another of the marks is the extent to which the society will strive for excellence. I submit that we are such a society; we are a society which values its artistic endeavours, values its artists and values excellence. This Government strives for these values and my party is firmly committed to striving for these values as well. This whole debate as it was presented by Senator Ryan is neither merely an exercise in accountancy, nor merely an opportunity for some kind of socialist polemic-nor yet is it an opportunity for a character assassination, under privilege, of someone who has been appointed as Chairman of the Australia Council. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe Senator Ryan really addressed the subject of the matter of public importance. Yet again she has brought up a case which she has totally failed to address or to justify. The question we have to ask is whether we value the arts, whether we care for the arts. Senator Ryan has failed to establish either that we do not have adequate administration or that we do not have adequate funding. To dwell on a few select figures as she read away is to miss the point completely. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the structures and networks that exist, that we do have in place and that we have developed for funding. The development has occurred since 1968, as Senator Ryan said. It has occurred under both Liberal and Labor governments. We have developed a sophisticated framework-a framework for administration, a framework for support and a framework for encouragement; a framework which does exist and which is working. I almost believe that Senator Ryan is upset that it is working. I almost think she would rather it was not working so she could make a case in the Parliament. At a grass roots level we have a range of boards. We have theatre boards, Aboriginal arts boards, literature boards and procedures for orderly dealings. We have a system under which people know where they can relate and where they can plug in. People know where to go to get involved in arts activities in an administrative sense. </PARA>
<PARA> I am fascinated by Senator Ryan's concern that we should want to have administrators to administer. After all, administration is, itself, a specialist activity. A coloratura may be a very good singer but hopeless at administration. It does not follow that a ballet dancer with an international reputation will have any skill at administration. In this country alone we have already set into place some courses for administration in the arts. I am surprised Senator Ryan did not want to advert to the course being run at the moment by the Victorian College of the Arts, which trains arts administrators, or to the course being operated at the moment through the South Australian Institute of Technology. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Teague interjects to say it is a very good course. They are courses designed to produce the administrators that can do a professional job of administration. I am not sure whether Senator Ryan was criticising us because we did not entrench for all time the incumbents at one moment on the various boards because we thought there was some virtue in opening up the positions to a wider membership so we could have a cadre of people who had been through and who had membership-a wide spectrum of involved citizens. I could mention bodies which are concerned with maintaining the excellence of the arts and which fund the various arts. These include, to mention just two, the Australia Council and the Australian National Gallery. They are administered by councils which are representative of people who have expertise in the relative and various art forms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are many levels of administration. Senator Ryan said in the words of her matter of public importance that there is a failure to ensure stable administration. I submit there are many levels of administration of the arts. At another level, in conjunction with State and local governments we are funding community arts offices in particular areas. We are carrying out funding in association with particular organisations such as ethnic groups, Aboriginal groups and the trade union movement. That is not to say that our administrative structure or administrative model is static. It is not static; it is constantly being reviewed. My party and Senator Ryan's party are involved in examining all the time whether the structure is adequate or needs some change. For example, in recent years significant changes and amendments have been made to the Australia Council Act and to the administration of other bodies. They have constantly been under review and the operations which they undertake have been provided for in the respective legislation at all times with a view to improving and to responding in an appropriate way to the needs of the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ryan talked about the failure to provide adequate funding. Again she did not establish her case. Senator Ryan is pre-occupied just with some of the narrow accountancy aspects of a minor but important part of the Government's involvement with the arts. She dwells on the fact that in one specific area Australia Council funding has been such and such. I remind the Senate that Australia Council funding is important, but it is a small part of the total picture. The Australia Council, itself, is adjusting its funding capacity. It is developing a program specifically to meet its new funding situation. It is developing what is called a challenge grants scheme-it is in the process of establishing that-for the arts organisations to try to ensure that there is adequate financial support for the arts now and in succeeding years. Maybe, as spokesman for the arts, she does not know about the challenge grants scheme. Perhaps she would like to know more about it. That scheme will give us time to review this area. It is intended to open up additional sources of income and support for organisations. This will provide an opportunity for public demonstration of support for the arts and for the community. I hope Senator Ryan does not think that is a bad thing. By adopting this scheme the Council will be able to increase its funds for individual creative artists in 1982 by 15 per cent. I hope Senator Ryan does not think that is a bad thing. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators that providing for the Australia Council represents only a small part of the money commitment that goes into arts in Australia. Senator Ryan is concentrating on a small, though important, aspect of the whole picture. I remind honourable senators also that well over $1 billion goes into arts, including pop and classical, crafts-including craft based industries and activities-and into the Australian Broadcasting Commission, et cetera. There seems to be some view that it is only the commitment that goes through the Appropriation Bills that is real, that exists. There is a total failure on the part of the Australian Labor Party and its spokesmen to understand the wider commitment of a mass of Australian people to involvement in the arts at a whole range of levels and the commitment of financial resources, human resources, time and interest which exists in the community today and which we are busy supporting. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Council provides funds for national organisations such as the Australian Opera, the Australian Ballet, the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust and many more, but the funds that go to the Australia Council are not the only funds for the development of the arts in Australia; far from it. Let me list just a few of the significant contributions this Government makes to the arts. Firstly, this financial year the allowance to the Australian National Gallery is $15m. That is an increase of about one-third over expenditure in the previous year. Did Senator Ryan set that out to give a nice, balanced picture? Secondly, last financial year and this financial year Government support for Artbank in each year was $425,000. I remind honourable senators that the purpose of Artbank is the acquisition of works by living Australian artists and the exhibition of art works in public buildings by acquiring a collection of Australian arts and crafts. Is that not a significant and worthwhile activity?</PARA>
<PARA> The third point is that the Government makes contributions to the International Cultural Corporation of Australia Ltd to the Australian Film and Television School, to the Australian Film Commission, and to the Public Lending Right, where payments to authors and publishers exceeded $1m last year. There is also the Australian Ballet Development Foundation and the National Institute of Dramatic Art. In talking about NIDA I just mention the provision of $3m--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Ryan" NAMEID="GD5">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;About time, too. Why did Senator Ryan not mention that contribution, that $3m? Perhaps she did not know about it. It is a contribution of $3m for the construction of a building adjacent to the Seymour Centre for the purposes of NIDA. Either the honourable senator did not know about it, which would represent incompetence in the representative job she has to do, or she did know about it but had no intention of presenting a balanced picture to this Senate. In addition to the Government's contribution to NIDA's running costs, that $3m will be of immense value. Then, of course, there are things such as the Australian Broadcasting Commission orchestras, which are funded through the ABC. Even if we were to engage in Senator Ryan's accounting exercise and look at total funding covered by the Department of Home Affairs and Environment, if we took the total contribution to the arts through the Department we would see that the Government has fully maintained its real contribution in total funding. Whereas in 1974-75 funding of these areas totalled $40.6m-that was a Labor Government year-the allocation this year through Home Affairs is $84.3m. Let me repeat that. Under a Labor Government in 1974-75 just over $40m was provided and this year just under $85m is being provided. Funding has more than doubled in just over eight years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We should not forget the contributions of State governments to the arts in Australia and the co-operative activity that takes place between different levels of government. Even if we look at the activities supported by the Australia Council we see that between them the States provide roughly the same level of financial support as does the Australia Council. That is a very significant contribution to arts activity in Australia, and that is in addition to the States' contributions to their own film corporations, their own galleries, their own museums and their own libraries. Why did Senator Ryan not mention those things? She did not mention them because they would have helped give a balanced picture to the Senate. The honourable senator talks about only a very narrow part of the picture, only a tip of a very large iceberg, a very large commitment of support, a very large commitment by people, a very large interest in arts activity in Australia, a very large and complex set of networks, and a large number of administrations. To confine the debate to the narrow tack taken by Senator Ryan is, of course, to make it meaningless and to devalue what a lot of people are doing. It ignores, as a recent survey showed, the level of corporate support for a whole range of arts organisations across Australia. It ignores the fact that this corporate support has increased tenfold over the last five years. I had hoped that Senator Ryan would encourage, support and welcome that support. I did not hear her doing so. Corporate support has increased from $1m a year to $10m a year. That is a valuable commitment from another part of Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this raises the question of government support through a variety of tax support schemes. Is it such a bad thing? What about all these matters? What about total support? What about total funding? What about bringing together all these kinds of activities? If we are going to look at art in Australia then why do we not look at it from all sources? Why did not Sentor Ryan consider all these things? Either she does not know about them or she chooses to ignore them. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say something about Dr Timothy Pascoe. I imagine that the Australian Labor Party would welcome the employment of administrators to do administration. The Australian Labor Party has welcomed the work done by McKinsey and Co. Inc. It has told us what a fine job McKinsey has done in producing the Telecom report. In fact the Opposition tabled it on Tuesday. Dr Timothy Pascoe is an administrator who is trained as one, trained to make things work and run, with a Cambridge Ph.D. and a Harvard M.B.A. He established the McKinsey office in Sydney and is, if he is nothing else, a person to make things work and run. Again I put it to honourable senators that to have a person whose expertise has been in management, in making things work to their best ability, brought into the arts and arts administration in Australia can only be a good thing. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one final point. The question of funding from the Federal Government Budget in the end comes down to a question of priorities. It comes down to a question of how funding for this function is related against funding for that function, which one is valued more highly. Do I take it Senator Ryan is saying that the Budget should have been recast to provide greater outlays and expenditure in this area of the arts? She is Labor's spokeswoman for the arts. Would she say that activity in the arts should have a higher priority than welfare, a higher priority, say, than Aboriginal advancement? I would have thought that, for example, our concentration, with all the available funds we have, on lifting Aboriginal advancement by a significant amount-she is the spokeswoman for this area as well-is something she would have valued. In terms of these competing priorities, I thought she would have understood that it is necessary to make these choices. The Government has made these choices to place the value it does on the needy, on the weak, on Aboriginals, on welfare.</PARA>
<PARA> I point out that, if Senator Ryan goes back and examines the Budget, she will find those priorities reflected. The Government is concerned in a multitude of ways with the arts and with the administration of the arts in Australia. There is stable administration. Networks extend throughout the community. We have adequate funding. We have adequate structures. We have adequate administration. Once again Senator Ryan has brought up a matter of public importance and totally failed to sustain her case. We value the excellence of the arts, and we value the contribution being made by our enormously talented artists. We look to the development of these artists and to activities in a whole range of ways. I believe the structures we have provided will allow this to happen. Accordingly, I move:</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the papers. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to make a couple of brief comments on the subject of studies of tertiary student finances. The three volumes of studies highlight the inadequacies of the current Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. In particular they recognise that the level of assistance currently provided is totally inadequate for full time students living away from home unless they can find part time jobs. Of course, I should not have to point out to the Senate at this stage that the part time job market is shrinking very drastically and that students are not nearly as easily able to subsidise themselves in this way as they used to be before the Fraser Government took over the administration of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The reports comment on the declining living standards of full time students. For example, the small expenditure on food by students in rented accommodation suggests that financial hardship may be preventing such students from having adequate diet and nutrition. The third volume of the reports suggests that the position of such students is steadily growing worse. In comparison with others relying on government assistance, such as pensioners and the unemployed, assistance to students is declining. I point out that such a picture of declining living standards amongst tertiary students is unacceptable to the Federal Opposition. The Australian Labor Party has called for an immediate increase of at least $9 per week in the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowance, the immediate indexation of TEAS and the liberalisation of the means test. The aim of current Government policies is to push as many students as possible off TEAS and into poverty. The recent Budget Papers estimate that the failure to adjust the means test in 1981-82 will result in a reduction of the number of students eligible for TEAS by 200. The Tertiary Education Commission's most recent triennial report has demonstrated that the declining number of students in Australian universities is directly attributable to the Government's unwillingness to provide a proper level of tertiary assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to us in the Labor Party and I think also to the Australian Democrats that the Government's strategy of forcing students out of full time study and onto the dole is totally irrational and totally indefensible. At a time when the Australian economy needs all the skills and all of the expertise that it can possibly have to recover from six years of Fraser administration we are actually forcing people to abandon proper courses of study. We are forcing them to abandon the acquisition of skills which this economy so desperately needs. Whilever there is such a disparity between the level of payment available for unemployment benefit and the level of assistance available for full time students, students from modest backgrounds will from time to time be forced out of universities and tertiary institutions and on to the dole. How the Government can possibly defend and maintain that system really defies rational understanding. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I could say much more about the inadequacy of the tertiary student finances, I conclude by pointing out that the Opposition welcomes these reports because they reinforce what we have been saying. They document beyond any possible area of argument or disagreement that the scheme is inadequate, that students are suffering, that student numbers are declining and that the whole question of education and the development of skills and knowledge in this country is being put at risk by an inadequate scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that the three volumes concerned with the studies of tertiary student finances are very useful documents because for the first time we have some basis for reasonable discussion about the extremely important subject of the ability of students in our tertiary institutions to maintain a reasonable living standard while they are engaged in their studies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to make a number of comments about the reports. Firstly I would like to make a comment in passing about volume No. 1, which is a review of recent literature and research. I believe it is quite a good review, but unfortunately it contains some fairly serious anomalies and omissions. I would like to point to one of those. My comments should not be taken as a criticism of the author of the report. He sought to do an extremely difficult job in reviewing literature across a wide range of disciplines. As anybody who has been engaged in a review of literature knows, once one tends to wander outside one's field of expertise one enters an absolute minefield and the most pertinent information can be left aside. As I said, this is not to be taken as a criticism of the author, whose review of the literature I think is a very good one. Nevertheless, he has left aside a couple of relevant documents that I believe would have altered quite considerably that review. I refer to page 32 of volume No. 1, in which a comparison is made of two items-the consumer demand theory in relation to tertiary students and the human capital theory in relation to tertiary students. I hope at some stage in the future to elaborate on the comments on the human capital theory if indeed we ever get the chance again in this chamber to discuss the Budget Papers. But in the meantime, may I make some comments. I think that the author has missed the point almost entirely when he talks about human capital theory. </PARA>
<PARA> This is because he relies on one source of information on human capital theory. In this respect I draw the attention of honourable senators to footnote 52. The major work that has been done in that area to date has been carried out by Edward Denison of the United States of America. His work established the technical base of human capital theory and provided a vast amount of documentation. I think that if the author had relied on the work of Edward Denison a completely different type of construction would have been put on his report. We would have then seen the extreme importance of support available for tertiary studies. Unfortunately, the author thinks that human capital theory has something to do with whether or not there is an investment on the part of the student. Human capital theory is posited on the basis that it is an investment on the part of a country. That difference, I think, then tends to vitiate some of the comments that he goes on to make. I believe that is unfortunate in an otherwise very interesting review. </PARA>

<PARA> I pass now to volumes 2 and 3 and make some comments about the actual study. I reiterate the point that unfortunately here again while we have a worthwhile and useful study there are fundamental flaws in the conclusions which the study drew in relation to student incomes and expenditures. I will mention briefly a couple of these conclusions. The first point is the serious flaw in the failure to account for the value of the in kind and direct financial assistance given by parents and others. This is understandable because the actual study was undertaken mainly in terms of questionnaires. But it is not merely a minor problem; 40 per cent of the respondents reported receiving in kind assistance in food; 37 per cent reported receiving in kind assistance in accommodation, 42 per cent reported receiving in kind assistance in clothing, 28 per cent reported receiving in kind assistance in the use of a vehicle and 41 per cent reported receiving in kind assistance for medical and dental purposes. The in kind assistance which is given by parents, relatives, friends or by some system of sharing that is fairly typical of tertiary students is really an extremely important area. What we find is that about half the students surveyed receive in kind assistance for those items which make up a very large proportion of average expenditure. There is an unfortunate aspect to the survey. Students were asked to estimate the cash value of this particular assistance. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in a large proportion of cases, respondents were not able to give an actual amount, and hence no attempt was made to analyse this component of the data. </PARA>
<PARA>While in an academic study that may be acceptable, when one wants to make a policy decision based upon this particular item and a report actually says that no attempt was made to analyse the component of the data particular students could suffer greatly. Let me give an example. As it stands we could have a situation of two students living in identical accommodation with one receiving free rent from parents and the other paying $1,300 per annum in rent to a group household. The average annual rent expenditure is thus $650, a figure which gives a completely misleading impression of what students spend and what is the cost of accommodation. I believe that that is a matter of grave concern in that report. </PARA>
<PARA> The areas of expenditure are likely to be affected by failure to take into account the in kind payments that can be derived from the various expenditure tables contained in the report. I hope that the people who undertook the report will do a re-analysis of the data. That data obviously is available and it could be re-analysed to take account of those particular methodological problems. If we eliminate those people who were not able to respond because they could not give a cash value we may then have a closer estimate of the remaining number in the study. Since this study has in fact a fair data base, I do not believe there would be any problems in suggesting that it might be unrepresentative. There would be no problem in a runback through the data in a computer to put in validating mechanisms to make sure that our sample remains representative. I believe that if we do that, and I hope that these authors will do a follow-up paper on that particular point, we will find that the accommodation figure, instead of being relatively low, will be a lot higher. That particular point goes for all of the other six items. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that we have an averaging report and not a true reflection report. That is of grave concern, I think, to people who want to make sure that we can get a fair and clear picture of what is happening in the area of student allowances. I hope that the Government will request the authors to do that type of work again. I am quite sure that the authors would be interested to enter into a debate on that particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one last point on volume 3, the validation studies. Again, I do not wish to raise problems about the competence of the author. I quote from the actual validation study report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Our examination was based on ascertaining whether students' answers to the September 1979 survey of their financial position showed any evidence of systematic overstatement of their expenditure-possibly in order to strengthen the case for a subsequent increase in TEAS allowance. </PARA>
<PARA>That type of validation is thoroughly reputable. Any validation study must look at the veracity of the answers of people to questionnaires. That part of the study is very well done. Unfortunately, the validation studies do not enter into the adequacy of the survey questions and the method of analysing responses which also ought to be done in any validation study. I am suggesting that we have one-third of what would be a very useful validation study. I believe that that study is very well done. </PARA>
<PARA> We are getting a good response in terms of the veracity of those answers. What we do not know at this particular point is the adequacy of the survey questions. It surprises me, in some sense, that the authors have not given that information in the report. It is a normal part of a validation study, so I believe that it is somewhere around. I would like to be able to see that element of the study. It is a normal way of doing such a study. I do not know whether the authors looked into the validation of the method. In other words, one method in a study such as this would be to have an evaluation person from outside come in and make sure that a method of analysis was done. The validation study people would be the correct people to do that particular analysis of the methods. Again, as it is not in the report one can only raise doubts as to whether it was done. </PARA>
<PARA> Saying those things in a sense, I think, leaves me to point out that we have a good data base but we do not know what the real conclusions are. They are not contained in these reports, but I believe they would be contained in the data. I look forward, at some time in the future, to our getting that further information which will allow us to have a reasonable and rational debate on this matter. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In doing so I congratulate the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and his Department on the production of a clearly and attractively produced and informative and, for the most part, comprehensive annual report. When one is confronted by a report of this kind, touching as it does on every single thing that the Department and its various satellites do or should be doing, one of course is tempted to make a speech of Castro-like dimensions and, with respect to the Attorney-General's Department, at least in some respect, with Castro-like invective. But I will for the moment resist that temptation and comment only that it does continue to be a matter of profound disappointment to me and indeed to the Opposition that a department which does contain within its ranks so much expertise and so much real capacity for performance, as was amply demonstrated during the period of administration of this Department by Senator Lionel Murphy-he is now Mr Justice Murphy-should have such a poor record when it comes to actual substantive achievements of the kind that are retailed in this report. The hard truth of the matter is that the reform process, which must be of the essence in the administration of any Attorney-General's portfolio if he is to be doing his job and exercising his responsibility to the nation, has simply almost ground to a halt during the tenure of the current regime. I do not stop to give chapter and verse on that because I do that almost every day of the week in this Parliament in the context of Australian Law Reform Commission reports and in the context most recently of the sluggishness demonstrated by the Department in formulating a response to the very apt and very sensible proposals of the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act. There are many other such examples which we of the Opposition are constantly raising. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I make is the obvious one, that is, that all departments do derive a great deal of momentum, or the converse of momentum, from their Minister, the ministerial head of the department. The reality of the matter is that so long as Senator Durack, for whom I have the greatest affection as an individual, remains in office as this nation's Attorney-General which, according to recent rumours, it must be said, may not be for very much longer, it will--</PARA>

So long as Senator Durack does remain in office the Department will be a lethargic one not realising its true capacity and its true potential.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only other brief comment I make relates to the timing of this report and indeed other departmental reports. I simply make the fairly obvious point that it would be a great advantage not only to the community at large but also and more particularly to this chamber and to individual senators within it if these reports could be made available prior to Estimates committee hearings at least perhaps in some unprinted draft form. </PARA>

I do not underestimate the difficulties in their compilation and certainly in their production. But the Attorney-General's Department is a well-managed department. Whether it is a well-led or a productive department is another question. I simply hope that this can be an area that will be the subject of some improvement in the future.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In doing so I make some really rather serious comments. The situation revealed by this very short report would be farcical if it were not so serious. We are talking of the report of the Security Appeals Tribunal that was set up, with a great deal of fanfare and a great deal of legislative detail backing it, under the Australian Security intelligence Organization Act 1979 to review adverse or qualified security assessments issued by ASIO on persons in government employment, persons employed by Commonwealth contractors who have access to security classified matter or secure areas and also persons who come within the provisions of the Migration Act, the Passports Act, the Citizenship Act and the associated regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition, at the time of the establishment of the Tribunal, welcomed it. It had no objection at all to the concept of it or to the membership of the Tribunal when it was appointed. The four members, under the chairmanship of Mr Justice Samuels, did seem to be as well chosen as one could expect from this Government, and certainly we had nothing adverse to say in that respect. But we did have a number of objections to the jurisdiction that was vested in the Tribunal and the scope of the Tribunal's authority. In particular we had a very strong objection, which of course we maintain, to the fact the Tribunal has no capacity to review adverse assessments made prior to the commencement of the operation of the new ASIO legislation and the new powers associated with that legislation. So, going right back into the distant past and the more recent past as well, in respect of those who have reason to believe that their employment prospects have been prejudiced or their applications for citizenship have been denied or their applications to migrate to Australia or to have a passport issued to them have been denied for security reasons, no one of that numerous class of people who feel so aggrieved, for better or for worse, is able, under the terms of this legislation, in fact to do anything about it to ensure that their appeals are heard and determined by this highly qualified Tribunal under the elaborate procedures that were set up to govern the hearing, largely in camera, of such appeals. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, we had profound reservations about and we expressed profound objections to the sort of catch-22 provision, if I can use that rather overworked expression which again is perfectly apt here, which is embodied in the legislation whereby there is absolutely no guarantee that someone who is the recipient of an adverse security assessment will in fact be able to have that adverse assessment tested before the Tribunal, the catch lying in fact that under section 38 of the ASIO Act the Attorney-General is vested with the power to certify that it is inappropriate for a person to be given knowledge of the fact that the adverse security assessment in question has been made. So there can be a situation in which, if the Attorney-General is satisfied that on the grounds of security the person ought not to be told that he has been the subject of an adverse security assessment, the preconditions for the operation of an appeal against that assessment are simply not satisfied. Therefore, the Attorney-General is able to cut off at the knees without the person in question, whatever the suspicions might be of having been dealt with in this way, being able to do anything about it. That seemed very unsatisfactory in principle and we said that loudly and clearly at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the report of the Tribunal to see what has happened since it came into operation on 1 June 1980, I think it was, we find that our fears in that respect have in fact been significantly confirmed because since the establishment of the Tribunal on that date it appears that the Tribunal has done precisely nothing except to conduct one preliminary conference and to engage in a rather bizarre game of musical chairs so far as the staff and the composition of the Tribunal are concerned, but it has not actually heard and determined one single security appeal. In the 12 months, which covers almost the entire period of the Tribunal's existence, the 12 months that are the subject of this one and a half page report, it appears that just three applications to review an assessment have been received-one on 7 November 1980, one on April Fool's Day 1981 and one on 9 June. The progress in respect of those three appeals has been non-existent. There was, we are told, a preliminary conference in respect of one of them, one of them sought an adjournment and the other has not been heard or determined at all. So, in fact, we have a situation in which in fact three appeals have been instituted and none has come to any kind of fruition. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of unsatisfactory features which may lie behind the text of this report although it is difficult to appreciate the significance of them at the moment. One of them concerns the denial of legal assistance which is supposed to be available under section 72 of the Act. We were told by the Attorney-General this was denied in one of these cases but we were not told why it was denied, whether it was on the ground of insufficient need or for some other reason. That apart, the main point I want to make is that there has been an absolutely derisory output from the Tribunal. Presumably, not so much as a result of any defalcation of duty on behalf of the members of the Tribunal itself or their hardly overworked staff but rather simply because no business of any significant kind is coming before them. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that one of the, I think, two staff members allocated to serve-presumably part time-the Tribunal has thrown in the towel altogether. The report says that a Miss Leslie Ann Davidson resigned from the staff in February 1981 but her position has not been filled. As to the other staff member, the existance of whom we know about, I remind the Senate of the report that appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald on 3 June this year which prompted a question from me in this chamber to the Attorney. It concerned Mr Fred Hawkins-who was the professional permanent staff member of the Tribunal and himself a principal legal officer in the Attorney-General's Department-who was reported as saying that the lack of work was close to driving him 'up the wall'. That was the situation so far as the Tribunal was concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very much a matter for us to be asking now, on the occasion of this report being brought down, why that is so. Is it the case that there are simply no security risks around Australia any more and that nobody is getting an adverse assessment either within Commonwealth employment, within the class of Commonwealth contractors or among people applying for citizenship or passports or applying to migrate to Australia? Is it the case that there has been a remarkable increase in the cleanliness and godliness of applicants and employees of these various classes such that it is just not necessary for there to be adverse assessments? That is one possible interpretation. A second possible interpretation is that there has been no such increase in the necessity to make such adverse assessments but that there has been an increase in ASIO's incapacity to make such assessments; that it is not doing its job properly, not weeding such people out and not making the assessments. That may or may not be the case but it does not sit too closely with the other kind of data-that I will come to in a moment-available about ASIO's role these days. </PARA>
<PARA> The third possible interpretation seems to me to be the much more likely one; that is that ASIO in fact is working quite actively, as it always has in this area, and is making a large number of adverse security assessments but that the Attorney-General is exercising his statutory powers under section 38 of the Act-that I have referred to previously-not to make available to the persons who are the subject of those security assessments the information about their receipt of such adverse assessments. Of course, it may be the case that lots of people are being advised of adverse assessments and are choosing not to do anything about it. We have not any figures to enable us to make such a judgment. It may be the case that the Attorney-General is not making many such certifications. But he will not tell us. </PARA>
<PARA> We sought to question him about this in this chamber three of four months ago, on 3 June in fact, the day that report about Mr Hawkins's anguish in his trade was revealed. The Attorney-General then said he did not propose to make available that information about the number of times-not the individual cases-he had exercised that power to record an adverse assessment. So we just do not know what is going on beneath the surface. Of course, that mirrors our ignorance that is so apparent in so many different aspects of the way in which this Australian Security Intelligence Organisation actually works. That is an unhappy state of affairs. The leaked annual report of ASIO is, I imagine, a fairly sanitised report because after all it was only the one going to the politicians and a copy was to be made available to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden). So one would expect that it would not contain too much that was especially sensitive. But even the presumably sanitised annual report of the Organisation revealed in the National Times of 28 June made it clear not only that the budget of the Organisation-as indeed we know from the one-line appropriations that we see in this Parliament-has increased by nearly 300 per cent since the Fraser Government came to power but also, it appears from the scant information we have, that three times as many wire taps were also in operation in the last year as were in operation in 1973, which is the last year for which we had comparable information put on the public record-in that instance by the then Attorney-General, Senator Murphy, making it publicly available. </PARA>
<PARA> What is worse, we learnt from this annual report-it has not been subsequently denied that this is so by anyone in government-that many new classes of organisations seem to have come under active surveillance by ASIO 'with increased attention', to use the language of the report, in particular being given to monitoring of anti-uranium and unemployment groups. There was no attempt in the text of the report to justify that happening. That is the situation. We have an increase in ASIO activity and allegations continuing to be made about the overreach by ASIO of its activities; by Scientology organisations, for better or for worse, in the context of the case now before the High Court; in the matter I raised two days ago about the indiscriminate interception of telexes and telegrams in whole postal areas even though only one individual within such postal areas is the subject of the warrant in question; and we now have the allegations brought to the attention of the Attorney today in Question Time about the monitoring or interception of telephone conversations passing to or from radio stations during the course of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point that if the Government is really serious about civil liberties and if it is confident that ASIO is acting within a reasonably civilised charter and acting effectively in that way then it should open up the jurisdiction of this Tribunal in the way that was earlier urged by the Australian Labor Party and make it a genuine forum for people who are the recipients, for better or for worse, of this kind of assessment to have the quality and accuracy of that assessment objectively tested. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Institute of Marine Science is of great value to Australian science, and in particular to the science faculties of the Queensland universities at Townsville and Brisbane. Therefore, honourable senators from that area have viewed the progress of the Institute with great interest. In addition to wishing the Institute well, I want to attract attention to one paragraph of the statement by its Chairman. Perhaps if I read it that will truncate my remarks. The Chairman said:</PARA>
<PARA> The past two years have been very important in the further development of the Institute and its research program. Following the decision of the Government in 1979-80 to increase the number of research scientists from eight to nineteen, approval was given in 1980-81 for an additional twenty-one support positions. The Council acknowledges the strong support given by the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) in these developments. </PARA>
<PARA> The implementation of these two decisions brought the total full-time staff of AIMS to 105. However, this approved complement has recently been reduced to 103 in line with the Government's staff ceiling policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Even though that is a reduction of only two staff members, in a developing Institute of this sort, which is merely in its foundation-building stages, it represents a retreat from fulfilment of the original intentions of the previous Government, under which the Institute was created, and this Government, which has supported it by considerable funding. The Chairman stated further:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . One consequence of this and the accompanying constraint on future funding is that it became necessary to defer the appointment of a senior scientist as Assistant Director which had been planned following international advertisement. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, the position was advertised but the appointment was not proceeded with. The Chairman added:</PARA>
<PARA> A continuing concern is the lengthening delay in brining the total full-time staff of the Institute to the planned figure of 130 which had been endorsed by the Government in 1972 for implementation by mid-1977 when the headquarters and laboratory complex at Cape Ferguson were occupied. Until this goal is achieved, the full potential of the Institute will not be realized. </PARA>
<PARA>I underline the statement that the full potential of the Institute will not be realised until the planned figure of 130 has been reached. I merely place on record the fact that we ought to monitor the situation from time to time and, when considering future Budgets, place no limitation on the full implementation of the program of the Institute. </PARA>
<PARA> In due course, the Institute will become one of the most important of such organisations in the world. It is situated in one of the most important world areas for marine science-the complex of the Great Barrier Reef. Concern has been expressed in a variety of quarters in this chamber about the future of the reef, its protection, the protection of the environment, and the need for a full understanding of the ecological consequences of any human interference in that area. I commend the report to honourable senators and, in order to allow others to debate the matter at a later stage, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I propose to make some brief comments on this significant matter because the importance of the Supervising Scientist's role in what has been called the uranium province is vital. His authority and right to suggest standards, based on the knowledge he has acquired throughout the world-knowledge to which we know he does have access-ought to be applied. The way for it to be applied is by the Commonwealth Government, whose arm the Supervising Scientist is in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The late reporting of the escape of water at Nabarlek was disquieting in itself. I am prepared to accept, on what we have heard so far, that no great damage was done. That does not alter the fact that a great deal of damage could in fact have been done. We have to consider that this happened at Nabarlek, which is one of the richest uranium mines in the world, an undertaking which is making enormous profits, far greater than was ever visualised. I would have thought it possible for that organisation to have guaranteed a situation in which it could abide by its word, and what was required in that regard-that there should be no release of water, under any weather circumstances, from uranium mines. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a key question-that is why I want to raise it-that must now apply to both existing uranium mines in Australia, particularly those where the weather patterns are extreme, as is the case in the Northern Territory, and future mines, if any. I say 'if any' because there is such doubt about the future of uranium, and nuclear power generally, that I question whether any real purpose is to be served by having additional uranium mines in Australia. That view is increasingly supported by world opinion. However, in the case of existing mines and projected mines-if they should go ahead-there must be adequate containment of contaminated water, which includes contamination by heavy metals. Of course, in that part of the world the heavy metals include radium. </PARA>
<PARA> The weather patterns of the Northern Territory are well known. Its climate is unpredictable and very heavy rain can and does occur regularly. Therefore, it is essential that any uranium mine in that area should have sufficiently stable, and large, pondage to contain all contaminated water that might be released under any circumstances. Anything less than that, is not good enough. I say that because we are associating uranium mining in Australia with the co-existence of the Kakadu National Park, which is one of the most remarkable, unique and beautiful national parks in the world. As has been conceded by the Government, it is a world asset and, as I have predicted before, and will predict again, it will be one of Australia's most valuable economic resources in terms of tourism, into the indefinite future. Unlike uranium mining, which will fizzle out in a foreseeable time, the Kakadu National Park will be of enormous and continuing importance. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the world oversupply of uranium and the doubtful prospects for these mines now, I would say that very few other nations would even consider allowing projected uranium mines to be continued with, much less that there should be any further depredation of that area. I say 'depredation' advisedly, because the Nabarlek incident has shown us that the uranium miners are not levelling and that the Supervising Scientist does not have enough power to do what he should do in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to speak of the applications of this incident and the shadow that it casts on the future, particularly in relation to the proposed Pancontinental mine at Jabiluka. This is proposed to be one of the largest uranium mines in the world. It is being placed in a position on the banks of Magela Creek. When the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment, on which I have the honour to serve, last visited the area it found that as a result of a cyclone-cyclones occur regularly in that area-the No. 1 ore body was in fact under water and the buildings there had to be hastily evacuated. This is the place where it is proposed to have an underground uranium mine of considerable proportions. What I am saying is that if we proceed with this folly, at least the Government has a responsibility to see that sufficient money is provided and that sufficient plans are drawn up. If the mining at Jabiluka proceeds, at all times-including times of cyclones and floods-there must be sufficient pondage to hold any waste products and any flood waters which might enter the mine. If flood waters enter the mines they will be entering areas of radioactive mineralisation. It is essential that those waters should not under any circumstances escape into Magela Creek. </PARA>
<PARA> Why Magela Creek? Magela Creek has an important geographical significance. It is a tributary of the East Alligator River, which is the most beautiful, unique and interesting part of the Kakadu National Park region. It is distinctive and it is a very fragile environment. Its future tourist potential will depend absolutely on its being pristine and unspoiled. It is an asset to the country in that regard. Already water from the Ranger uranium mine is going into that creek. The two mines are very close together. I suggest that the Government have a good look at the figures. More than we would like is escaping into Magela Creek through seepage from the holding dams at Ranger. The point about this is that the effectiveness of those holding containers around the holding ponds is related directly to the amount of money that the uranium company can be persuaded to spend on the impermeability of them. This is something that has to be looked at very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is Magela Creek particularly important? It is important for this reason: Particularly in flood times water from Magela Creek does not escape to the sea. When the tide is rising in the lower reaches of the East Alligator River, water which is backing up from Magela Creek is carried upstream into the whole of the rest of the East Alligator River region. I repeat that this is a national park area of vital importance. We are not just talking about some backwoods area. We should regard the risks to it as extreme. I ask that the Government immediately consider going to the miners as they exist now-I hope that nobody will deny that enormous profits have been reaped from the Nabarlek mine; fantastic dividends-and insisting that if any further uranium mine is to be developed in the East Alligator region of the park, especially if it is anywhere near Magela Creek, adequate funds should be provided in advance by Pancontinental Mining Ltd, if it intends to go ahead, to ensure and guarantee that there will be no release of water under any circumstances whatsoever. It should insist also that penalties against the company responsible be provided for in the contract in the event of any release. I think it is reasonable that if a company goes into a national park of importance and is prepared to exploit it, it should also be prepared to accept full responsibility for any damage that it may cause. That is all we are asking the Government to do. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am saying now is that the Government immediately ought to authorise the Supervising Scientist to view the matter in that light, to get world opinion on it and to draw up a system of water pondage and storage at Jabiluka which can be presented to Pancontinental. The system should be regarded by the Government and the Supervising Scientist-not by Pancontinental, which is an interested party, but by outside sources-of being capable of making sure that there is no release of contaminated water with heavy metals or radioactive substances from that mine under any conceivable circumstances. I would like to see that proposal presented to Pancontinental, which can then do a costing on it. I think we can proceed adequately on that basis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It appears to me that the remarks passed by the previous speaker, Senator Mason, need some endorsement. There was a spillage of wastes from holding ponds at the Nabarlek uranium mine which the company concerned was late in reporting to the Supervising Scientist. We are now told that the problems caused were not all that grave. It would seem that the Supervising Scientist should have been notified earlier. Indeed, the company should not have allowed that spillage to occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has occurred to me that the same sort of situation is developing at the Ben Lomond mine in Queensland, where already there has been leaching and seepage from a stored ore body. The situation will be aggravated by heavy rain in the wet season in January and February. I do not believe the Commonwealth has looked at what is happening in that area. The Supervising Scientist or Commonwealth scientists should look at what is happening in that area. The Supervising Scientist or Commonwealth scientists should look at what is happening in that region as well. I believe the undertaking given by the company is not sufficient to ensure that mining operations will not put into jeopardy the Burdekin River system. If seepage or leakage occurs in that area it will cause problems. If the Federal Government intends to allocate money for the development of the Burdekin River system, I believe the Supervising Scientist and his Office should look at what is happening with uranium mining in that area. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will update and revise a number of the provisions of the Crimes Act 1914 to take into account modern concepts, particularly in the area of sentencing, and to remove anomalies and defects revealed in the recent administration of the Act. The amendments will firstly require courts to consider whether some form of non-custodial punishment may be imposed instead of imprisonment on offenders against Commonwealth and Australian Capital Territory laws and the laws of prescribed external Territories. It is provided in relation to offences described in the Bill that a court is not to pass a sentence of imprisonment unless the court, after having considered all other available sentences, is satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case. This accords with modern thinking that imprisonment should be imposed only as a measure of last resort. The amendments will also make available to the courts, when dealing with Commonwealth offenders, sentencing options such as community service orders now available in relation to State and Territory offenders. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the Act dealing with the conditional release of Commonwealth offenders have been remodelled. Conditions upon which an offender may be released include the condition that the offender make restitution or pay compensation to the victim of the crime and the condition that the offender will submit to probationary supervision. In addition, the court may order that the offender is to pay a pecuniary penalty in a lump sum or by instalments. This condition and the condition relating to restitution, when combined with probationary supervision, will provide a practicable alternative to imprisonment. The legislation additionally revises and updates pecuniary penalties in the Crimes Act. Provision is also made to enable offenders on whom a fine has been imposed to apply either for time to pay the fine or for payment of the fine by instalments. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with the laws of several States provisions are to be inserted into the Crimes Act under which a court, when sentencing a Commonwealth offender, will be empowered to take into account, for the purpose of imposing sentence, other offences in relation to which the defendant has admitted his guilt. Where a defendant before a court on one charge has also pending against him charges in relation to other and less serious offences in respect of which he admits guilt, the amendment will remove the need for the defendant to be convicted in relation to all the offences and enable the court when sentencing him for the primary offence also to take into account the commission of the other offences provided the defendant consents. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation also effects amendments to the bribery provisions of the Crimes Act as recommended in the report of the Committee of Inquiry concerning Public Duty and Private Interest known as the Bowen report. As recommended by the Committee, the amendments will remove present uncertainty as to application of the criminal law to bribery of members of parliament. The amendments will also, as recommended by the Committee, extend the application of the Crimes Act to Commonwealth officers obtaining or attempting to obtain a bribe for a third party or agreeing to accept a bribe. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been aware for some time of the need to revise the Crimes Act to provide the courts with a better range of options when dealing with Commonwealth offenders. The need to stress to the courts that they should regard imprisonment as a punishment of last resort when sentencing Commonwealth offenders has also been apparent. At the first conference of Australian magistrates held in Sydney in June 1978 a number of deficiencies in Commonwealth law in relation to sentencing were aired in considerable detail. I pointed out to the attending magistrates that I had a major personal interest in the whole policy of sentencing and in providing alternative punishments to the punishment of imprisonment. I undertook to initiate a review of the relevant sections of the Crimes Act, particularly those relating to the conditional release of offenders. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1978, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General considered a paper submitted by me, in connection with preparations for the Sixth United Nations Crime Congress, on the subject of sentencing. That paper recommended, among other things, that consideration be given by a law reform commission of the Commonwealth or the States to the revision of the laws with respect to sentencing to promote the greater use of alternatives to imprisonment, having regard to the costs and other unsatisfactory features of punishment by imprisonment. The paper also stressed the need for legislation to be introduced to provide that no person be sentenced to imprisonment unless the court is of the opinion that, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, no other sentence is appropriate. The Standing Committee agreed that the matter be submitted to the Commonwealth's Law Reform Commission. On 11 August 1978 I referred the question of the sentencing of federal offenders to the Commission and in 1980 the Commission delivered an interim report on the reference. Certain of the Commission's recommendations are given effect to in the present Bill and other provisions of the Bill reflect the experience of my Department in the day to day administration of the Crimes Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important question is the development of sentencing guidelines. The development of guidelines on a systematic basis to provide a greater consistency and uniformity in sentencing should, in my view, be encouraged. I have therefore written to the States and Northern Territory Attorneys-General proposing that a sentencing council consisting of Federal, State and Territory judges be established administratively to discuss sentencing guidelines. The present Bill does not represent a complete revision of the Crimes Act. A number of other aspects require review and these will be undertaken by my Department next year. The Bill does, however, deal with the more pressing matters requiring attention and effects practical reforms of real worth and significance. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to make a personal explanation. Because of information which has been made available to Estimates Committee H since the Committee formally approved its report at its meeting yesterday I believe paragraph 4 misrepresents my position and I want to dissociate myself from that paragraph.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. At the time the Committee considered the report, at five o'clock yesterday afternoon, I expressed some reservations about paragraph 4, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee records its appreciation of the assistance of the Ministers and officers of the Departments concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>My reservations have since been considerably heightened and what I considered to be the last straw was a correction to an earlier answer given to the Committee by the Department of Trade and Resources. When the Committee was sitting an officer of the Department of Trade and Resources, Mr Webb, said that no complaint had been received from the United States, to the best of his recollection, but that he would check the record and supply the Committee with a further explanation. This was in reference to a complaint about a possible breach of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The correction received by Committee members after the Committee had met said, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department advises that representations were received from the United States after announcement of the concession on manufactured tobacco imports questioning whether the concession was consistent with Australia's international obligations. In response, Austraila advised the United States that its assertions were formulated with insufficient detail to permit a specific response. The United States has not pursued the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>That reply was received almost immediately after the Committee had formally met. Whether the reply was being withheld until after the Committee had been known to make a decision is a matter on which I have no knowledge. However, I want to dissociate myself from paragraph 4 because, in my view, far from the officers and Ministers of the departments concerned being anxious to provide information and assistance, Mr Wallace, the First Assistant Secretary of the Dairy Products Division of the Department of Primary Industry, did not appear at all and the record shows that at least two officers from the Department of Trade and Resources-Mr Webb and Mr Daly-were obfuscating and evasive, being much more concerned with concealing the chicanery of their Country Party ministerial masters than with providing information to the members of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> If some of the other matters which were raised, which I cannot speak about in detail at this stage, had been subject to the same sorts of specific questions requiring later answers by a department, one wonders how many more corrections would have been made. The originally misleading answer regarding a protest from the United States was corrected only because the officer concerned was pressed to provide the Committee with subsequent information on this matter. One wonders whether such specific questions requiring further answers would have produced corrections regarding the allegations of blackmailing activities by officers of the Department of Trade and Resources, shady backroom deals organised by Mr Colin Teese and some other members of that Department, and also the degree to which the Department actually fulfils its obligation to ensure that Australia abides by its obligations under the GATT treaty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-In moving this amendment to the terms of reference for this inquiry, the Standing Committee on Science and the Environment is ensuring that all pesticides, both herbicides and insecticides, to which Vietnam veterans were exposed can be examined within the scope of the inquiry. Specifically, the term 'pesticides' will allow such chemicals as agent blue, a mixture of cacodylic acid and sodium cacodylate, and malathion to be included. While both these substances were used in Vietnam, neither is a phenoxy herbicide or contains dioxin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to point out that it is the intention of the Committee to focus firstly on health problems of the Vietnam veterans as they relate to this inquiry. To this end, evidence will be heard firstly from the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia, secondly from the Commonwealth Institute of Health, which is conducting the epidemiological study into the possible links between exposure to herbicides and current health problems, and thirdly from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The Committee hopes to commence these hearings as soon as practicable in the summer recess. Evidence will, of course, be taken from other witnesses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Epidemiological Studies (Confidentiality) Bill 1981 provides for the protection of the confidentiality of information provided for epidemiological surveys conducted by the Commonwealth. Through the usual method of fines and penalties the privacy of such information is protected, with an added retrospective provision to cover the pilot study on Vietnam veterans which is in progress. The Opposition does not oppose the legislation. However, we will move an amendment expressing a view we have about the situation of the Vietnam veterans and their problem with herbicides. We will not delay at all the passing of this legislation because the success of such surveys depends on an adequate response which, in turn, depends on the guarantee of privacy and confidentiality given to those who are being surveyed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The survey which has brought this matter to the Parliament is, of course, that applying to Vietnam veterans. It is necessary as part of the investigation into the claims and fears that veterans have for themselves and their offspring as a result of exposure to the herbicide 2,4,5-T and its contaminant dioxin and exposure to other herbicides used in that unfortunate conflict. The predictions of the results of the pilot study being conducted make it obvious that the full epidemiological survey to be conducted will take much longer than was previously suggested and further delay providing some basic knowledge necessary to any rational assessment of the situation as it affects the veterans. If we proceed at the present rate in dealing with the investigation of these claims and if we insist on a high degree of scientific proof, as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) seems to insist, which is something we do not do for veterans in other circumstances, then I believe we will never make a decision. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no argument, except, from the most blind, that 2,4,5-T and, in particular, dioxin are toxic in various ways. The world has known that since the late 1940s. What we need at the moment is an assessment of the evidence that is available and the facts as they are known. That would be done in any claim for compensation and it should be done in this claim for compensation by the veterans of the Vietnam war. The Opposition believes, and I think many of the Vietnam veterans believe, that the best way to assess the information and the evidence which is already available is to do what one would do in any claim for compensation, that is, conduct a judicial inquiry. We persist with out belief that that should occur, despite the fall-back position we have now with the Senate Committee on Science and the Environment investigating the effect of these herbicides. It is for that reason that, on behalf of the Opposition, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add</PARA>
<PARA> ', but the Senate is of the opinion that the Vietnam Veterans Study referred to in the Bill should be supported by a wide judicial inquiry.'</PARA>
<PARA>We do so not to delay the Bill but to express again our view that the veterans cannot consistently and persistently be left in the position of uncertainty and anxiety caused by their lack of knowledge of what has happened to them through their exposure to these herbicides, through their lack of knowledge of what has happened to their offspring, and through their inability to get full assistance and compensation for serving our country in that war. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Labor Party would not deny the need for confidentiality in studies of this nature, and the importance of confidentiality of individual information on individuals is certainly not to be denied. There are questions in the minds of a number of Vietnam veterans about whether the results of the pilot study can be made use of or whether they may be witheld from other organisations or associations of ex-servicemen prior to what has been stated as being the very long period that will be needed for the full-scale study. In fact, a recent statement from the National President of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia includes these words:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If you would care to contact any expert in the field of epidemiological studies you will find as I have that what the Australian Government proposes will take up to or even more than a twenty year period. </PARA>
<PARA>We also hope that the aggregate results will be made available for responsible scientific use. One wonders, too, whether the associations themselves had been consulted about the need perhaps for such stringent measures to maintain confidentiality. One might draw the Senate's attention to the fact that it is paradoxical, I suppose, that veterans have been prepared to go very public in order to draw attention to their plight and the plight of their families and offspring. </PARA>
<PARA> The questionnaire that has been distributed and available for some months is in itself a very daunting document. Amongst its 70 sets of questions there are many with 10 to 14 parts. Question Nos 22 to 23 focus on the veterans's recollections of his service in Vietnam. Some of those questions have eight, nine or ten parts. Social scientists tend to reject the validity of a study which depends on the memories of the participants. In this case we are asking people to remember very fine details of what occurred to them 10 or even 15 years ago. Many of the veterans complain, amongst many other things, of a loss of memory, of loss of concentration and of problems with recalling details. The thoroughly horrifying experiences that they have had in their years in Vietnam are such that many of them would have deliberately sought to erase them from their memories. Surely the records of operations of the Australian Army are available officially. Surely it is possible from those records to tell who was where and why on what dates. Surely this would be better to do this plan that to jeopardise the validity of an important study such as this by requesting the Vietnam veterans themselves to provide such details, a task which I suggest is completely beyond the capacity of very many of them. In fact, it has been suggested to me that the veterans themselves while on service in Vietnam knew very little about the nature of the operations apart from their own individual place in those operations. Obviously, in the case of capture, the dictum was 'the less you know the better'. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that this study is relying upon information from veterans themselves may very well make the results considerably more questionable than would otherwise be the case if they were backed up by hard data. The results may very well be inaccurate and incomplete. In the event that the information is among the Army records, will the recollections of the veterans be checked against the records? As I say, for some of the veterans the questions they are being asked are impossible to answer. It seems to me that the fact that the questions are there may make the difference between whether the ex-serviceman responds to the questionnaire and whether he does not, especially if he feels that his memory is suspect, that his answers may be checked against Army records and then discarded. This exercise also may add only to the cynicism and the frustration of many of the veterans who feel that there is developing very rapidly a tendency to diagnose their problems as neurotic, psychosomatic and hysterical. They are being disignated as psychologically disturbed because in many cases of the multiplicity of their clinical reactions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Returned Services League national solicitor, Mr John Button, prepared a background paper well over 12 months ago in which he listed 48 different types of clinical reactions being complained of at that stage by Vietnam veterans. Eleven of those 48 might be categorised as the types of symptoms very likely to lead a medical adviser to diagnose neurosis or psychosis. Much of the publicity around the scandal, if I may put it in such strong words, of the herbicides and pesticides to which Vietnam veterans may have been exposed has concentrated on agent orange and its contaminant dioxin. The effect of agent orange on humans, as Senator Grimes says, has been well known for quite a long time. Many of the other chemicals which were used have also been well known for a very long time because of their adverse effects upon human beings. One of those was agent blue-cacodylic acid. The first shipment of herbicide blue was received in Vietnam in 1962. Between 1962 and 1964 5,000 gallons of this chemical were used. Between January 1965 and February 1971 over 1.1 million gallons were used. Symptoms of acute poisoning from cacodylic acid are well known as the symptoms of arsenical poisoning. In fact, cacodylic acid is an organic compound of arsenic yielding inorganic trivalent arsenic in the body. That is the arsenic which is highly toxic to human beings. Symptoms of this type of acute poisoning are headache, vomiting, diarrhoea, dizziness, stupor, convulsions, general paralysis and ultimately death. Amongst the non-fatal symptoms would be many which would be familiar to Vietnam veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> Malathion was used in significantly large quantities. This substance has widespread effects which are in accordance with its effect on the central nervous system, including vomiting, diarrhoea, pin-point pupils, sweating, elevated blood pressure, weakness, anxiety, fever and, in very severe cases, coma. Acute toxic episodes are not infrequent and severe systemic disturbances caused by their muscarine-like and nicotine-like actions have been widely reported. The psychiatrists tell us that there are two types of psychiatric sequelae of chronic exposure. These are schizophrenia and depression. Effects on the central nervous system of malathion include giddiness, fainting, tremor, paralysis, speech difficulties, memory defects, insomnia, lassitude and weakness. Once again these are very familiar symptoms amongst those Vietnam veterans who have made their plight known. Other developments amongst a group of subjects who were studied very carefully include depression, irritability, lassitude and apathy. The subjects looked dejected and felt unhappy. </PARA>
<PARA> Dieldrin was another one of the most unpleasant chemicals used in considerable quantities in Vietnam. Most of us would have used this chemical in our homes. We have perhaps read the Shell booklet on the safe handling and the toxicology of dieldrin. Eleven symptoms of poisoning are listed and include headache, dizziness, blurred vision, abnormal sweating, loss of appetite and nausea. Paraquat-grammoxone is another of the extremely dangerous toxins which were spread about with great abandon in Vietnam during this period. Paraquat is highly toxic to man and there have been several reported fatalities. Literature which I have seen documents at least 200 deaths. If a man spends much of his time walking through spray drift which is prevented from dispersal by overhanging foliage there may be a risk of lung damage from fine particles and also of irritation from coarser particles trapped in the upper respiratory tract, possibly leading to nose bleeding. In such circumstances, a filter respirator should be worn. Paraquat must be handled carefully for it possesses toxicity to man, the nature of which is only gradually becoming evident. In particular this chemical, which has been widely used in suburban gardens, can be dangerous because there is no known antidote and restrictions on its sale have just been introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Paraquat is a very interesting member of this family of chemicals. It was used first, as far as we know, by Australian troops in Vietnam in the week spread from Sunday 3 December 1967 to Friday 8 December 1967. The servicemen using this chemical were apparently using no protection whatsoever. At the end of the week's spraying they were asked to report whether they had any problems. They all reported with symptoms of breakdown in mucous membrane which included nosebleeds, ulceration of lips and conjunctivitis. From then on more stringent regulations were introduced and the servicemen were instructed that they should use rubber gloves, respirators and clothing which covered them from head to toe. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the servicemen are being required to state in the questionnaire whether they believe that they and their clothing had been contaminated, they are not being asked about the use of protective equipment or clothing. A set of regulations for the use of pesticides by Australian forces in South Vietnam emphasises time and again in the course of its seven or eight pages the danger of handling these particular substances carelessly. It gives detailed instructions for the use of full face respirators and gloves in relation to all procedures including mixing chemicals and preparation for spraying. It indicates how the servicemen should be careful to avoid spillage and splashing and points out that only those actually required for spraying should remain on the vehicle being used. It states that respirators and gloves are to be worn by all team members, and that sleeves are to be rolled down and long trousers worn. The officer in charge during the spraying procedure has to ensure that the team members are wearing respirators and gloves, and to be absolutely certain, among other things, that wind blown spray does not drift back on to the vehicles and operators. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a section on afterspraying procedure which is also quite detailed. The document concludes with an instruction that 10 gallons of fresh water is to be sprayed from the spray guns and that any spillage should be cleaned off using clean water. I have been assured that it is highly unlikely that on more than a very few occasions during the handling of these pesticides and herbicides in Vietnam the equipment was being used as instructed. Given the climate under which these people were working, the conditions and the general approach to hygiene, and, in addition, the shortage of water, it seems highly probable that in most cases the servicemen were being exposed to hazards which should have been appreciated but obviously were not. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps one of the most alarming parts of this set of regulations is the instruction which insists that empty containers should be carefully handled. The instruction says that empty containers can be a hazard. For example, drums and barrels converted into water storage tanks become sources of contamination of water. It has been suggested to me that it was a fairly common practice to use empty drums for the storage of water and for the storage of other foodstuffs and that it is highly unlikely that they would have been cleaned beforehand in accordance with the instructions that were issued but which were not seen and certainly not followed by the majority of ex-servicemen. </PARA>
<PARA> Records of the chemicals which were taken to and used in Vietnam have been made available, mostly through the United States authorities. We know the names of most of them and we have some idea of the quantities. The American Herbs Tapes tell us that there were something like 17 million gallons of herbicides of various types accounted for within those years in Vietnam. But nobody is quite certain what happened to another two million gallons which were transported to Vietnam and which are unaccounted for. I suggest that we are all reaching the point now where we believe that there is criminal neglect. There is no other way to describe it. A recent report in Australian newspapers tells us what happened to at least some of the two million gallons of herbicides which were previously unaccounted for. An article in the West Australian under a New York dateline of Thursday, 24 September, states:</PARA>
<PARA> The US has found new evidence that large numbers of American and allied troops in Vietnam were exposed to the defoliant Agent Orange. </PARA>
<PARA> Quoting 'just discovered records', the Reagan Administration's Secretary for Health and Human Services, Mr Richard Schweiker, said that there may have been as many as 41 Agent Orange sprayings of friendly troops. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The new information lists 90 US chemical spraying missions in Vietnam which were aborted either from aircraft engine failure or enemy fire. </PARA>
<PARA> Agent Orange being carried was dumped in at least 41 of these, Mr Schweiker said. </PARA>
<PARA> The chemical was dumped near US or allied military installations 'some directly over or near air bases.'</PARA>
<PARA> The Defence Department is now said to be trying to isolate the exact locations and is tracing weather patterns on the days the defoliant was dumped. </PARA>
<PARA> Until today the US admitted to only 1200 aircrew and ground staff being exposed to Agent Orange. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition to the extremely long, detailed and complicated questionnaire required to be completed by male ex-servicemen who were in Vietnam and, of course, the pilot group who were not, each wife or partner of an ex-serviceman is also required to complete a questionnaire, not quite so lengthy but certainly requiring of her a great deal of recall in relation to her own obstetric and gynaecological history over the past ten years. My criticisms of the questionnaire for the male are just as valid for this one. People's memories are notoriously unreliable in relation not only to their illnesses but also to unpleasant occurrences in their lives. Just as an ex-serviceman from Vietnam may very well not wish to recall the unpleasant details of his time in Vietnam, so it may be very difficult for a woman to recall the unpleasant and in some cases heartbreaking details of children born deformed or children who have died soon after birth. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly hope that the counselling services for Vietnam veterans and their families that have been promised before the end of this year will be able to provide the sort of support and encouragement that those families will require. The results of this epidemiological study will not be of any assistance whatsoever for this generation; they probably will not be of any use until the next. There will be precious little comfort from biochemists, from epidemiologists or from geneticists for the wives and families of ex-servicemen in relation to the likelihood of their bearing more children with deformities. There will be very little proper information available to them, and certainly none as a result of this epidemiological study. </PARA>
<PARA> People in Atlanta in the United States of America are just a little more fortunate. The Sunday Times of 11 October reported that a large study is to be undertaken to determine the cause of birth defects in Atlanta and that the cost will reach $1.5m. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Thirty investigators using telephone and city directories, voting lists, post office forwarding addresses . . . are tracing the parents of 7,000 infants born since 1968 with major birth defects. The parents of another 3,000 normal children will take part as controls. </PARA>
<PARA> The study is being done in . . . Atlanta . . . where the National Centre for Disease Control has been compiling a register of malformed infants for more than a decade. </PARA>
<PARA>The Atlanta parents are just that much more fortunate than any of the parents in Australia because there is no such information in Australia which would give a data base from which valid comparisons could be made at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia a small study was initiated three years ago by a geneticist, a woman doctor, with a grant of $25,000 to start a congenital malformation register. This has been operating very well and continuously as of course, it must. The money, which was Federal funding, was sufficient to pay for the salaries of a part time geneticist and a part time nurse and for some help from a clerical assistant. The funding will cut out in 1982, which will make the register completely worthless. The study must be continuous if this register is to be of any value. Its value will not be apparent to any particular group or individual in the community until a record has been able to be compiled over a considerable period. The very nature of a study of this sort means that several years are needed to establish such a register. So little is known about congenital malformities in the community that when we are told that there is something like a 10 per cent rate of congenital malformity in the children of Western Australian veterans we have nothing against which to compare that rate in the population at large. We are told that the rate of serious, severe malformities may be 3 per cent or 4 per cent. If we are looking at moderate or not quite so severe ones it may be up to 7 per cent or 8 per cent. That is no comfort whatsoever to the Vietnam veterans and their families. </PARA>
<PARA> If we had had a register for any length of time there would be available evidence on which to assess the scares that have been rife over the last few years. The sort of data that that sort of register could provide is priceless, but we do not have it. The information would have provided to a small extent some peace of mind to the young families of young Vietnam veterans. That sounds like a contradiction in terms. They are certainly not veterans in the sense of being geriatrics. Most of them are less than 40 years of age. Most of them would be younger than the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Many of them would be hoping still to have children. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that many lessons should be learned from the debacle of Vietnam, and the particular horror of exposure to herbicides is certainly one of them. I hope that the message will be taken around Australia about the necessity to have public registers of congenital malformities so that in the future we will not be faced with no alternative other than to conducting a vastly expensive, extremely lengthy and probably useless epidemiological study. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nobody will doubt, I am sure, the sincerity of any Australians who have taken part in this debate on behalf of Vietnam veterans, whether within or outside the Parliament. However, we do have some specifics to attract our attention in the Senate this afternoon. One of the specifics is the amendment moved by the Opposition which is in these terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that the Vietnam Veterans Study referred to in the Bill should be supported by a wide judicial inquiry'. </PARA>
<PARA>I mention that because Senator Giles has made an interesting contribution to the debate and mentioned a number of the issues that have been debated surrounding the total issue of agent orange. However, we are not going to pass judgment on the sincerity of Senator Giles or the validity of what she has said. We are here to pass into law a Bill which will enable the Government to forward its studies into the effects of agent orange on Vietnam veterans and at the same time to indicate our opinion on the amendment moved by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset I would like to say a couple of things about my general attitude on the subject of agent orange. When this subject first claimed publicity it raised some alarming possibilities but, at that stage, the possibilities were pretty cloudy and one could not make any sort of judgment. Right from the beginning one had to recognise that if the allegations relating to the effects of agent orange on Australian veterans from Vietnam were well-founded they should properly have been taken very seriously. I know that in the past there has been some criticism of the actual conduct of the Vietnam Veterans' Action Association. As I watched rather bemused from a distance what very loosely then could be called a debate I had a growing sympathy for that Association. If its fears were well-founded one could understand its alarm. Unfortunately, rightly or wrongly, that Association clearly thought that its fears were not being paid very much attention. That thought might have been stirred by the alarm and fears that its members individually felt. Nevertheless the Association was ultimately successful in gaining the attention it wanted and in achieving movement on the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I well remember a conversation I had at about that time, about 18 months ago, with a member of the United States Congress who happened to be visiting Australia at the time and who remarked on the fact that the issue of agent orange was occupying a large area of newspaper space. His comment was that he was surprised it had come so late to Australia because in the United States it had been an issue for some little time and at that stage had died down to some extent. In any event, it came to Australia. It was taken seriously and the Government moved very seriously to deal with the issues. The issue of birth deformities in children is an enormously emotive one. The issue of the potential for some sort of permanent psychological impairment of veterans is a very emotive one, and issues relating to other physical disabilities as a result of service in the name of our country are also very emotive ones. We recognise the strength of that emotion and at the same time how important it is that a country take its veterans seriously if there appears to be a well-founded fear in the minds of the veterans. I believe the Government is doing that and is approaching the problem in a very reasonable and sensible way and in a way which is designed to bring satisfaction to its veterans if their claims prove to be well-founded in fact. This leads us into many aspects of difficulties in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently I had the opportunity of visiting the United States of America. One of the subjects which I sought to study while I visited there was the issue of agent orange and how studies on the effect of agent orange on the United States veterans were being handled in that country. I discussed the issue with members of the Congress and the Senate who are involved in the issue and with members of the government both federal and of one State-from one of the States which is very involved in the studies. I am pleased to say that I came away with a reassurance of the assessment that the Australian authorities are trying very hard, indeed are well to the fore. We are well regarded in the United States in terms of the sort of progress we are making, the prospects of our success in the issue we have tackled and the way we have tackled it. In fact, on a couple of occasions some envy of Australia's position was expressed to me by American officials if only by virtue of the fact that we seemed to have a very much more manageable situation in terms of the number of veterans, and the information we have on the movements of our troops and on their exposure to the dioxin chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem in the United States is infinitely more difficult because of the numbers of people potentially involved, the sorts of records kept and, frankly, because of the sheer facts of war. It is not normal for an army when in a theatre of war to keep detailed information and to fill in forms in a highly bureaucratic fashion about just where it is dropping a drum of chemical. One might have some general ideas and perhaps in some instances very detailed records but to be specific about exactly where all that chemical went and in what quantity when waging war-not spraying a sugar cane field-is not easy. The scale on which the United States was involved in Vietnam gives that government particular difficulties. We are at an advantage because of the relatively small number of Australians involved and the small geographical involvement of Australians in Vietnam. The officials I talked to in the United States believe that Australia is making very good progress-in a couple of areas superior progress-to that which they are able to make-and that we have excellent prospects for a successful pursuit and conclusion of inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA> All that is relevant when the Opposition raises the issue of a judicial inquiry. I will say a few words about that. The central issue about a judicial inquiry-not a new issue; it has been raised by others-is how one can possibly move to a conclusion in a judicial inquiry. I think it is fair to accept the claim that has been made that probably to get the best result we could expect from a judical inquiry, before it could draw a factual conclusion, someone would need to have successfully pursued and concluded the sort of scientific inquiries that the Government is undertaking now. Judicial inquiries cannot of themselves discern facts that are not available to them. Scientific facts are required in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to emphasise that I can understand the anxiety of the veterans and the very strength of feeling they must have about the issues raised for them. I do understand that, given some of the background to the issue, it is difficult for them to be patient. But I say to them that one must accept that there is evidence of good will and proper intention on the part of the Government. The programs announced in relation to investigation of the effects of agent orange are very thorough. Nobody can objectively say that any other government is trying harder or has a better prospect of success in what it has undertaken than the Australian Government in its undertakings in relation to this. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has undertaken to survey the possibilities of birth defects among children of Vietnam veterans. This is probably the easiest area of inquiry. It is very difficult to forecast and to say to veterans who are yet to have children whether they should go ahead and plan to have children because objective evidence of the likelihood of birth abnormalities is not yet available. They must recognise that the evidence is not available. Certainly there are birth defects occurring among the children of Vietnam veterans. What we must attempt to determine is whether the incidence of those defects in some way is not consistent with the incidence of the same sorts of defects in the community at large. That has a very particular application to my State. I wish to say more about that later in my speech. I emphasise that the significance of this examination of birth defects is well beyond just the Vietnam veterans; it reaches into other areas of Australia and other areas of concern. I shall come to that shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Institute of Health in Sydney is undertaking preliminary work for a major epidemiological survey on the health of Vietnam veterans. It is exploring urgently the feasibility of carrying out a case control study. When one gets into the area of science-that is, looking for scientific evidence which is figures-which appears to support a thesis one cannot anticipate the results of the investigation. The situation must be surveyed. We must find a reasonable basis on which to proceed. Because we do not rush willy-nilly into it does not mean that our intentions are any less than the best. The Government has the best possible advice on the best way to proceed. Obviously it is taking advantage of the best possible advice and nobody is suggesting that in this area it is doing anything else. The Opposition's amendment asks before the Government receives the benefit of that advice it should act, or have some other body act, regardless. That is not a reasonable suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of the incidence of carcinomas is a far more difficult one. Over a period-before decisions were made in relation to what investigations would be taken on agent orange-I became more and more disquietened by the sort of private information I was being given by people either currently or formerly associated with our armed Services and their own personal opinions and conclusions in relation to their experiences or the experiences of their comrades in service in Vietnam. It has been very interesting for me to have had continuing conversations with the same army personnel, or ex-army personnel, on this subject. I was enormously moved just recently to have a conversation with one of these individuals who throughout has vigorously attacked any suggestion that agent orange was responsible for birth deformities; understandable perhaps in view of the fact that that individual fathered a child while on service in Vietnam. Recently he had the very sad experience of one of his close friends dying of cancer at a very early age. He is now sufficiently shaken by the circumstances to question what were previously, in his opinion, what were well and firmly held beliefs. The personal impact of the issue cannot be underestimated. When young men in their 30s and 40s die of cancer then of course it has a shattering impact for their families and friends. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I think we have to face one fact on this matter, which is that unless the surveys that we are currently undertaking quickly show some incredibly dramatic variance from the community's average incidence of malignancies, we will have to be prepared to keep on taking such surveys for a number of years. It may well be quite some years. We will have to have a commitment to the issue for a long time-10 or 15 years-before we have the reasonable evidence that one would need to have to conclude that agent orange causes cancer, as has been claimed. People in their thirties and forties do die from cancer. Indeed, children under the age of 10 die from cancer. It is not unknown at younger ages. What we must attempt to determine is whether the incidence of death from carcinoma amongst those who served in Vietnam, and who appear to have been exposed to the dioxin chemicals, is higher than the community norm in some scientifically significant way. Unless there is some extraordinary departure from the norm we have to recognise it as an issue that we will have to settle in and want on over a number of years. There may not be, with the best will in the world, quick answers with which to allay very deeply felt worries and very real fears on the part of a number of Vietnam veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope nobody would suggest that the Government wants to do anything other than the best for veterans. Certainly, my personal view is that those who obey the command of their country to serve in a theatre of war, who risk their lives in obedience to that command, are entitled to the very best possible consideration from their country. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole issue of the dioxins is, of course, an enormously emotive one. As I mentioned earlier, it has a particular significance in my own State. In Queensland there has been in the north of the State for some time a controversy about the connection between dioxin herbicides and birth defects; so the outcome of these surveys will be very interesting to Queenslanders. A report produced on the subject by the Government of Queensland tends to discount the claims of increased incidence of birth deformities. The situation, if I might explain it to the Senate, is that dioxin-based herbicides are sprayed aerially in Queensland for the control of weeds and other matter encountered in the growing of sugar cane. Sprays with this chemical base have been used for some time and there have been over a period now-fuelled by the agent orange controversy-suggestions of a resultant higher incidence of birth defects in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to be very careful concerning what I am about to say. I want no one to misunderstand my intent. I emphasise that I have as open a mind on the issues as it is possible to have. From the time that I heard that this chemical may be responsible for increased birth defects I have had great concern. To all who came to be expressing particular concerns I listened carefully and gave an assurance that what they had said to me was of the utmost importance. However, there is a little hypocrisy in an omission from the public debate on this issue and it ought to be faced. I do not attach the charge of hyprocrisy to those who have expressed concern about birth defects and certainly not to those who have experienced it or to their medical counsel. We should be aware that dioxin sprays, which kill plants of a particular leaf configuration, can have other effects other than killing the weeds on which they are sprayed. </PARA>
<PARA> In the United States I encountered another piece of information which I learned was no secret but one that no one dares mention. The issue was raised, not in relation to Australia but in relation to the United States and an area of the United States where there has been a controversy about the aerial spraying of dioxin-based herbicides and the matter of birth defects. Coincidentally, it happens to be an area which it is alleged grows a large amount of marihuana. It occurred to me when I heard that startling suggestion that the significant claims that aerial spraying of cane with dioxin based herbicides resulted in an increased rate of birth defects had come from north Queensland. It may be that there are those in central Queensland, southern Queensland and northern New South Wales who have a concern but have not expressed it. I cannot know that. However, we ought to be aware that dioxin sprays have a potential to do things other than defoliate jungles in Vietnam or kill weeds in cane fields. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I welcome the statements that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) made when he returned from the United States of America. I believe that the Government is proceeding properly in all areas. I was heartened to hear the comments that had been made, not for the purpose of just saying nice things about Australia but at a number of levels in the United States, on the real progress we had made and how they looked forward to receiving some of the results that would flow from the studies being undertaken, because they believed they would be assisted in their scientific studies by what we had done. It is recognised that Australia is ahead in some aspects of this matter. So I do not think it is fair to suggest that the Government is being slow, holding back, dragging its feet, or being unwilling in any way in this matter. One must recognise that the Government has moved fairly and well, with a reasonable expectation of reaching a satisfactory conclusion in those areas where one can hope for a short term conclusion, to which I referred earlier in my speech. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to the Opposition, whilst in no way detracting from its bona fides, its good intentions, or the effort that it has put into this debate or into consideration of the issue, that its suggested amendment is not appropriate and would not be a reasonable alternative to proceeding along the lines outlined by the Minister. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope to keep my remarks fairly brief, but I would like to support Senator Martin's statement regarding the honesty of the Opposition's approach to this Bill. However, let me say that right from the beginning of the debate on this matter, which goes back over a considerable period, there has been a vast difference between the attitude adopted by the Opposition and that adopted by the Government. In other words, the Opposition has forthrightly and consistently supported the holding of a judicial inquiry. We believe that is the only method by which the whole matter will be brought to a somewhat more speedy and probably much more satisfactory solution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The epidemiological study that has been advocated by the Government, which it has been just as consistent in pushing through, will be very lengthy. In the meantime hundreds, probably thousands, of Vietnam veterans are suffering as a result of their contact with chemical and related sprays. In World War II we saw what was probably the beginning of aerial spraying to destroy enemy crops. However, in those days we did not have sophisticated and highly dangerous sprays in the quantity that the Australian and American troops were able to practise with in Vietnam. In our case, in World War II it was mainly a matter of spraying sump oil on vegetable crops in areas occupied by the Japanese. It was sufficient to kill the foliage and it is doubtful whether it produced any adverse health effects at all. The end result was that food supplies were cut back by the destruction of the leaves on the vines. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner), in the first paragraph of his second reading speech, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> By this Bill the Government seeks to provide for the confidentiality of personal information collected during the conduct of the epidemiological study of Vietnam veterans and when necessary other Government sponsored epidemiological studies. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Some of the questions being tested in the pilot study and which might also be asked in a later major survey are on personal subjects such as drug abuse and interpersonal relations. </PARA>
<PARA>I guess the Minister achieved headline publicity when he suggested very early in the piece that some of the problems from which the veterans were suffering probably had nothing to do with agent orange. I know that has been repeated on several occasions. The Minister can shake his head, but the evidence from the published version of what he said left no other conclusion to be drawn. The Vietnam veterans were amongst the first people to pick it up. One would hope that the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and indeed any other government department, would treat any information of a medical nature confidentially. </PARA>
<PARA> Any survey which might be carried out should be carried out by experts. The information should not be made available to any ordinary stickybeak who wants to look at it. The drafting of the Freedom of Information Bill-I am not talking about the bobtailed one which went from this place to another place and which will undoubtedly be back here again but about the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs-was carried out by experts in the field who studied the matter in depth. They decided that some things ought not to be disclosed. Whilst I am not quarrelling with the right to tighten legislation to ensure that certain information does not get out, I believe it will have a tendency to highlight certain aspects of the whole problem which should not exist. </PARA>
<PARA> Vietnam is a special case. The Whitlam Gvernment recognised that people who served in Vietnam should receive special entitlements, including what we usually refer to as war service homes and other types of pensions and repatriation treatment. The excuse of the Government in those days was that there was not a war, but we did send many thousands of people into Vietnam on a war-like basis. Something like 1,000 lives were lost and many more people were injured. The Australians of that generation are still paying the price of our illegal involvement in Vietnam. I fail to see why the Government does not treat the problems associated with the use of agent orange and similar chemicals in a much more urgent manner. That is why the Opposition has moved an amendment to the Bill. We feel that the matter is of great importance and that what is proposed by the Government represents further stalling. By the time the final inquiries and data have been gathered and analysed it will probably be too late for many, particularly those veterans who have developed suicidal tendencies. It will fail to save the breakdown of marriages in which there has been quite heavy conflict between families, particularly between husband and wife, as a result of the suffering of veterans engaged in the Vietnam conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> On 20 August I asked the Minister a question regarding his failure to make contact with a congressional group of people in America during his American visit. The Minister very kindly said that when he replied to the Vietnam Veterans in Congress group he would table a copy in the Parliament. I want to set out a series of events that will form a historical record of the general trend that has occurred over the last few weeks. The Minister later wrote to Mr Daschle as a result of the question which I asked. At a later stage I will seek leave to incorporate in Hansard five or six pages of the House of Representatives Hansard. I have shown it to the Minister and he has no objections to its incorporation. The material sets out in detail a number of tables and facts which where incorporated in Hansard by my colleague in the other place, Mrs Joan Child. I return now to the reply of the Minister to Mr Daschle, who is the Chairman of the Vietnam Veterans in Congress. This committee comprises members of both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party in the American Congress. The letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Daschle,</PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for your letter of 31 July 1981, signed jointly with Mr Panetta, concerning my visit to the United States earlier this year. It was unfortunate that we were unable to consult during the visit. My time in Washington was extremely limited, and some of the meetings with Government officials and veterans' organisations had to be fitted in during visits to other cities, as I needed to include in my schedule an examination of important research projects and practical programmes being conducted outside Washington to help veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time available during my visit to Congress offices, I was able to have discussions with members of the Veterans' Affairs Committees of both the Senate and the House of Representatives. In requesting these meetings, the Australian Embassy made it clear to the staff directors of the two Committees that I would be pleased to meet any other Committee members who were in the position to join the meetings with the Chairmen. Those who did attend the meetings were the Chairman of the Senate Committee and the Chairman and the ranking minority member of the House of Representatives Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Ambassador endeavoured also to arrange for me to meet representatives of the Vietnam Veterans in Congress by inviting Mr Bonior and you to join us at an evening function on 18 June. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one point on which I would like there to be no misunderstanding. While the Australian Government gives no undertaking to base decisions on the opinions of any particular body, it does endeavour to consider the widest possible range of views relevant to veterans' issues in determinging its policies. In this context, I would be happy to examine any submission you care to make which you feel would be of value. The Government is glad to have available information relevant to this aspect of its policy-making, the aim of which is to contribute, within the Government's economic possibilities, to the well-being of Australian veterans. </PARA>
<PARA>I would now like to read a fairly short document into the Hansard record. It is a letter written by Dr Harry Pope, a general practitioner, who is the National Medical Advisor and Co-ordinator for the Vietnam Veterans Association. Dr Pope was quite frank in his statement and he distributed copies to members of the Federal Parliament. He states:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sirs,</PARA>
<PARA> It is with dismay that the Vietnam Veterans' Association (VVA) notes that Senator Messner and his advisors have shown how misinformed they are in the scientific area of the 'Agent Orange' issue. This can be our only conclusion as any other would imply that the Senator was misleading parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I think I said that about the Minister when dealing with some aspects of the matter in a previous debate. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In Senator Messner's letter to members of parliament, dated 21st September, 1981, he alleges certain points which are inaccurate. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, the VVA has not 'ignored a large body of literature'. Indeed the Senator's reference, the 1977 IARC report is a briefing article that the Association gives as a reference for interested medical and scientific personnel. It aptly surmises the then current literature and concluded that there was not sufficient information to evaluate these controversial chemicals. This is not an article which 'does not suit' our argument. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the issue is not which veterans were exposed or whether exposure was sufficient to place the veterans at risk. The issue is whether the significant problems of Vietnam Veterans are related to chemical exposure. </PARA>
<PARA> Exposure in Vietnam cannot be quantified at this late date. Records are too incomplete, and to imply that the veterans merely walked 'through an area which might have been chemically defoliated days or months before' belies the fact that the veterans were showered by a mist of chemicals and that they breathed, ate and drank the chemicals from contaminated local foods and water.</PARA>
<PARA>I will come back to that paragraph when I have completed reading the next two paragraphs of the letter. The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, one fortieth of the total number of veterans are claiming disabilities, but this does not mean that they are the only ones with problems. Many are suffering, distrustful of government institutionalism and prefer to go it alone. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Department of Veterans' Affairs has not readily sought, to try to resolve the question as soon as possible. In fact the VVA is powerless to motivate the DVA. Media pressure was and is the only motivating factor of the DVA in the 'Agent Orange, chemical warfare and poisons' issue. </PARA>
<PARA>I will refer to the third last and second last paragraphs of that letter. Dr Pope states:</PARA>
<PARA> Exposure in Vietnam cannot be quantified at this late date. Records are too incomplete, . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This seems to be a general pattern that is showing up in a great many ways in complaints veterans have made to me and to other persons. When the veterans first complained about suffering some disabilities very few people took any notice of them. In many instances doctors put it down to heat rashes or something else when the veterans showed skin diseases. It was only when these things kept reappearing that the more consistent people wanted to look at the whole matter in depth, whether those people were qualified doctors or other concerned persons. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate will recall the case I mentioned earlier this year regarding a veteran named Graham Scarce who had repeated outbreaks of rashes, whose children were not well and who had other disabilities as well, all of which could be attributed to some unseen agent and possibly the chemical known as agent orange. The reference made by Dr Pope to some of the veterans' problems being dismissed on the basis that they had walked into a mist of chemicals is, in fact, quite true. Scarce related to me on several occasions how, when he was operating in the field, he and his comrades in his unit were in fact sprayed on many occasions. If that is not sufficient evidence-this evidence has been and will be repeated again-obviously the Government is not really fair dinkum about trying to solve the situation. In the second last paragraph Dr Pope states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . one-fortieth of the total number of veterans are claiming disabilities, but this does not mean that they are the only ones with problems. Many are suffering, distrustful of government institutionalism and prefer to go it alone. </PARA>
<PARA>A veteran living in my region refuses to register for medical treatment. His wife has endeavoured to persuade him that he needs medical treatment. Others have endeavoured to persuade him that he ought at least to have a medical examination, but he is totally distrustful of what the Government or anyone associated with the Government is likely to do. Perhaps, more correctly, he is distrustful of what they will not do after cross-examining him. That is one example I know of and it is a clear-cut case. As Dr Pope says, there are probably many others who are in similar situations. </PARA>
<PARA> To complete the historical record I will refer to the statements made by my colleague in another place, Mrs Joan Child. Among the documents to which she referred is a section of a Press release issued recently from the Vietnam Veterans' Action Association. She referred to a table setting out the disabilities being suffered by some 30 veterans and their families. The next document she referred to is an article published in the Canberra Times on 11 January 1980 explaining the problems of a Vietnam veteran and his two-year-old son. Also, on 26 January 1980 the Sydney Morning Herald carried an editorial about a Mr Bob Gibson of Sydney. Mrs Child is recorded in Hansard as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> It is most unusual for a major newspaper to editorialise in this way about one individual who is not a public figure. </PARA>
<PARA>She referred also to correspondence which took place between Mrs Voltz and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), as well as two short letters from the permanent head of the Department and a statement about this Victorian lady whose husband committed suicide as a result of his suffering. I seek leave to have those documents incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> All Vietnam veterans are extremely disappointed that neither Mr Hodgman nor Mr Goodluck honoured their written undertakings to support a judicial inquiry into our claims. </PARA>
<PARA> There undertakings were given in October, 1980, prior to the last election. </PARA>
<PARA> On the first parliamentary opportunity to honour their commitment-debate on the Epidemiological Studies Bill in the House of Representatives yesterday-they voted against a judicial inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA> Bob Gibson was a fit, healthy young man when he went to Vietnam in 1967. Mr Gibson was conscripted but he went into the army without complaint. For a country boy from Warren in western NSW, the army sounded like an adventure. That adventure cost Mr Gibson dearly. At 33, he is no longer healthy. Like some other veterans, he is plagued with rashes, insomnia and hypertension. Mr Gibson sprayed defoliants for the Australian army. He lived and worked beneath the American planes which dropped the 'withering rain'-Agent Orange-on the jungle. </PARA>
<PARA> Two months ago, he had never heard the name Agent Orange. Like the others, he believed his illnesses were his own, individual problem. When he heard that other veterans had similar symptoms, he joined their campaign for an inquiry into the effect of Agent Orange. Mr Gibson is concerned for his job but he believes he has an obligation to tell his story and to look for evidence from other men whose families have been affected. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Gibson and his wife have given up the idea of having children, now that the link between Agent Orange and birth defects has been postulated. He feels he has been shunted around by the Government and he has been through two unsuccessful appeals for an entitlement for nervous disorders. It was left for the veterans themselves to draw the link between their cases and the similar cases of veterans in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, an investigation has been announced. Research will be undertaken. These are welcome moves. The research should establish whether men such as Bob Gibson are entitled to compensation. If they are they should receive it, promptly and ungrudgingly. If there is any doubt, they should be given the benefit of it. </PARA>

On this point and of this moment, that is not foremost in our minds; although it does answer, for numerous events, that have taken place in Rex's life; (?) since his return from Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA> The upper most relevant decision at this time, is that Rex needs help; and is being continually turned away. </PARA>
<PARA> He spent 5 weeks in Larundel, (State Mental Health) of which provided fruitless. They admitted that they, 'could do nothing for him; and had achieved nothing'. So he was discharged from there. To where?!! There is nowhere left, for Rex to go; the doors continually close one after the other. </PARA>
<PARA> I am fully aware, of the Political issues involved; but surely that should not even come into account, when the man concerned is a Veteran; one whom was sent overseas to defend Australia. Then; when he breaks down, obviously suffering psychologically, from his service in Vietnam; he is not looked after by, the same Government, which sent him to War. An unreal and astonishing parallel; wouldn't you agree?!!</PARA>
<PARA> Our marriage and home life; has been shattered. We are now divorced, as quite frankly; I could not take any more of the violence, rages, suicides, (or attempts at!) and the underlying tension. The children, we have 3; were too young to understand, thank goodness; and now, all they know is that their Dad is sick. Could you, yourself; cope with a situation, that so many of the Vietnam Veterans wives, and families; are faced with. I think not Mr Fraser; or else, you would have helped out the Veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> The only people; that can fully understand the Veterans (Vietnam) plight, are the Vietnam Veterans themselves!!</PARA>
<PARA> For this reason; those bunch of good hearted guys, formed Vietnam Veterans Action Association! Without any funding whatsoever! Even if you decide not to help Rex, Mr Fraser; how about Government funding, for the Vietnam Veterans Action Association? The same guys, that were sent overseas, to fight for Australia; the same country that in the Veterans time of need, does not want to help the Veterans themelves. </PARA>
<PARA> I've endeavoured to gain admission for Rex to Repat. for months; it seems like years! He; as many of the other Vietnam Veterans are; is going through a private Hell, and there is no help; through all of the Red tape involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I've tried, with the help of the VVAA; approaches to many, and supposedly influential 'top' people; all to no avail. My last plea of perhaps hope; is to you, Mr Fraser. Please can you help at all?!! You see Mr Fraser, I stand to gain nothing from this; I only wholeheartedly believe; that as Veterans, all of these guys deserve the best. It's not only on a Personal level; they (VVAA!) have helped Rex, in his time of need. So why; shouldn't you re-examine their need, for funding? To provide the best; for their fellow Veterans!</PARA>
<PARA> If, you have read this letter; and considered all aspects regarding Rex, himself; and funding for his fellow Veterans; then I thank you. </PARA>
<PARA> And if, you decide to act positively; regards the above mentioned funding, and for Rex; then I am indebted to you. </PARA>
<PARA> You'll find that quite a few people know of REX VOLTZ's name, and situation; because as I said before, I have tried all other avenues!! Being:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Adermann-Minister for Veterans Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Keith Fleming-Sir Richard Kingsley-Holt McMinn talked to these 2 men. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Dame Mary Guilfoyle-Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Pace Mathews, M.P.-Member for Oakleigh. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bernie McPhee-Deputy Commissioner Veterans Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Drs Rose &amp; Gidley-Medical Supt &amp; Chief of Psychiatry at Repat. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Barlow-Medical Supt of Larundel, respectively. </PARA>
<PARA>So as you can see, 7 to 2; the odds are against Rex. </PARA>
<PARA> Why? Mr Fraser, why; is it all so damn hard?! As you've said before, quote: 'Life, wasn't meant to be easy!' But; is it supposed to be so hard?!</PARA>
<PARA> There are people's whole lives involved here; the suicide ratio is terrifically high; as the Viet. Veterans, just cannot get help! It takes so long, for the 'System,' to see the light!</PARA>
<PARA> No-one; is prepared to take Rex in, as a boarder, nor keep him in Larundel; until the Repat. &amp; Veterans Affairs decide just what, they will do! So I had to let Rex stay here; what or where else can he go?</PARA>
<PARA> But believe you; it is having it's effect on myself, and the children. When will someone see; that your 'System', is off-loading it's problems onto the Community, or relatives in general?! It is as totally unfair to us, and the Veterans; as they cannot help their reactions. </PARA>
<PARA> My ex-husband, knows his limitations; and has appealed for help, continuously; never receiving it psychiatrically. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fraser; sure, your can dismiss my letter and appeal; but sooner or later, as the suicide rate rises; you'll have to answer to someone. If not here, then to God. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a christian; and was brought up to respect authority, and people in status generally. But; after having ground myself down, to earth level; trying to achieve Peace, and help for Rex; I too, will now re-think my living code. </PARA>
<PARA> Rex; is not even the same man, that I loved and married. I may see the 'old Rex', in flashes; but since his return from Vietnam, there is a 'new Rex'. Rex; as he is now, is totally confused and lost. He can not relate to your Society; and neither can your Society, relate to him. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet; for the man he once was; I fight on, Mr Fraser. And for all the other, Vietnam Veterans; especially the ones that could no longer take the pressure, and therefore suicided. I hope and pray, that Rex and his fellow mates; can hang on, until a humanitarian decision is made for them, in their favour. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours Sincerely, Paula I Voltz.</PARA>
<PARA>Prime Minister, Canberra, 13 October 1980 Dear Mrs Voltz. </PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for your letter of 24 July 1980 concerning your ex-husband's situation. I apologise for the delay in replying to you. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is aware of, and sympathetic to, the problems faced by Vietnam veterans who believe they and their children are suffering from exposure to herbicides and other chemicals used in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Veterans' Affairs announced in Parliament on 31 March 1980 a major epidemiological study, to be carried out by the Commonwealth Institute of Health, into the effects of herbicides and other chemicals on Vietnam veterans. The Government believes that the epidemiological study is the only way to resolve the uncertainties about whether exposure to herbicides and other chemicals used in Vietnam has affected the health of Australian veterans and their children. </PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that the decision not to admit your ex-husband to the Repatriation General Hospital, Heidelberg, was based on the advice of medical officers who believed he would not benefit from admission to Heidelberg. </PARA>
<PARA> The request from the Vietnam Veterans' Action Association for a grant-in-aid to establish a welfare program for Vietnam Veterans was carefully considered. In deciding not to accede to the request, the Government recognized that existing health and welfare programs adequately covered the needs of veterans.</PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for writing to me on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA>21 October 1980 Dear Mrs Voltz,</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Robert Coleman of the Melbourne Herald spoke to me last week about your husband's claim for compensation and suggested I should ring you. </PARA>
<PARA> I tried to telephone you on Friday and failed, and tried again yesterday, Monday, and today, with no success yet. </PARA>
<PARA> And on Monday and Tuesday I tried to contact you through the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australian office in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> If you would like to have a word with me about your husband's case I should be pleased to hear from you. You might like to telephone me to suit your convenience on 89 6736 in Canberra, reverse charge, if I don't manage to contact you before this letter arrives. </PARA>

<PARA> Having spoken to you on those occasions when you tried to get some help for him you must take some comfort in the fact that you did all that you could to lead him towards the psychiatric treatment which we were offering at Heidelberg and which may have helped his unhappy condition. </PARA>

<PARA> Mr Fraser,</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> I wrote to you, quote; ''out of sheer exasperation,'' on the 24th July 1980; to try to obtain help for my ex-husband (Vietnam Veteran), Rex Edward VOLTZ. </PARA>
<PARA> You answered my letter; and I received it, on the 14th October 1980; 2 1/2 months later!</PARA>
<PARA> My ex-husband, Rex Edward Voltz; is now DEAD! He hung himself from a tree. Because of your total apathy, another Vietnam Veteran is now dead. How many more, do you want Mr Fraser; before, you realize just what these Veterans went through, and are still suffering from?</PARA>
<PARA> You speak of, ''existing health and welfare programs;'' ''in your decision not, to accede to my request for a grant-in-aid.'' There are NO health and welfare programs. And unless the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia, receive a grant-in-aid soon; you will have more deaths to answer for. </PARA>
<PARA> I find this all unbelievable! I appealed for help everywhere; and finally, to you Mr Fraser; but Rex never received it, and now he is DEAD! 32 years old; and yet so tormented, by Vietnam Service for Australia; he killed himself! How much more, do you want?!</PARA>
<PARA> What's even more a disgrace; is that Australia couldn't even bury him! I've been told, that from Veterans Affairs, if I'm lucky; we may receive $300! Big deal! The funeral costs; and by no means, as expensive as yours would be when the time comes; amount to $1053!</PARA>
<PARA> The Government conscripted these guys, to fight for Australia in Vietnam; and then the families and or relatives have to bury them! It really is a shameful disgrace; and I'm not proud of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Do you know Mr Fraser; that in New Zealand (Rex's birthplace), the Government bury their returned servicemen. Why, is Australian so mean?</PARA>
<PARA> I've gone over and over; the things I did to try and help Rex, Mr Fraser. And although I did my hardest; it can not have been good enough, or else he would be alive. I can't sleep; as I see Rex hanging from a tree, whenever I close my eyes. Our children are broken hearted. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely Mr Fraser; that it has been proven to you, first hand; you must be able to see and acknowledge, the Vietnam Veterans Association's need for a grant. They need help!</PARA>
<PARA> Please; do not let any more Veterans feel as though they have nothing left for them, and they then therefore Suicide. These Men defended you! I loved Rex; and now I have nothing. For God's sake, make his death at least worthwhile; and let no more follow him! There have been too many, already. </PARA>
<PARA> Christmas and New Year, will hold very little for us ever again. Our children and I, are crushed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Vietnam Veterans helped me, to make arrangements. Mr Fraser please help them. </PARA>
<PARA> My beloved Rex is gone; and I still cannot believe nor accept it. I also now, have nothing to live for; we ask for nothing of you, other than to help his fellow Veterans. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SG7">Senator KEEFFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I conclude by referring to something that was touched on by Senator Martin, and that is the use of 2,4,5-T and similar chemicals for the destruction of weed patches in many local government areas and for the destruction of weeds in crops, including sugar cane. Dioxin, which is used in Australia in much lesser quantities than it was ever used in Vietnam, is sprayed particularly in the sugar cane areas. Of course, dioxin is a constituent chemical of the herbicide. There have been instances where crop dusting has been carried out. I understand that before a plane goes out to spray chemicals or any obnoxious type of spray, whether it be in powder or liquid form, it is supposed to get permission from the Department of Primary Industry. There is supposed to be a check made of which way the wind is blowing and planes are supposed to keep a certain distance away from occupied areas or farm houses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As happens in cane growing areas in tropical Queensland many of the assignments are on farms which run right up to the edges of small country towns and provincial cities such as Cairns, Mackay, Innisfail, Tully and a whole host of small villages north and south of those areas. I suppose winds do change sometimes. Unfortunately, we know of instances when the crop spraying planes have gone out, apparently without the knowledge or consent of the relevant authorities, and chemicals have been dropped over occupied areas. This has led to a whole flood of complaints about problems for children. I know there appears to be some inconclusive evidence about how much effect this really has. But the circumstantial evidence is certainly very substantial, so much so that quite a large number of local authority organisations in Australia now forbid the use of these herbicides. </PARA>
<PARA> Even though we are not happy about this survey I hope that when it has been carried out no stones will be left unturned in the endeavour to collect the information. I respectfully suggest to the Government that such an investigation should not be allowed to drag on over a period of many years. If any even mildly conclusive evidence is turned up in the first few months that ought to be sufficient to make the Government act. In the meantime, the ex-service organisations, particularly the Legion of Ex-servicemen and Women, have suggested that, pending any finality of any such investigation, veterans ought to be given the benefit of the doubt. The amount of money involved would not be great and would not break this Government. We could afford to pay compensation when we decided to abandon the Moscow Olympics. Compensation, as the relevant Minister said yesterday, is already in the vicinity of $7m. If we can afford to put on all the frills at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, overreact in relation to security and pay compensation in a couple of other areas for disabilities suffered by people one would think that, if we add to these things the numerous overseas trips of the Prime Minister, we could afford to pay compensation for the veterans who are unable to work. Some compensation ought to be paid to them until finality is reached in this investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, my party shall continue to press for a full judicial inquiry with wide terms of reference. We believe that is the type of inquiry that would help to clean up quickly the so-called grey areas in the claims made by these veterans. When the conclusions are reached I think it will be the Vietnam veterans who will be proved to be correct. This Government will be proved again to have been stalling for time. It is a bit like the Government's sales tax Bills: They are here today and gone tomorrow but they will be back next week. The Government will continue with the ad hoc types of policies which it applies not only to the financial and economic sections of the Parliament of Australia but also to veterans who ought to be given the benefit of the doubt. Everything ought to be done for them in the shortest possible time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish firstly to make a few general remarks on this matter and then to come to a few of the points that have been made by the various speakers in the debate. I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the Epidemiological Studies (Confidentiality) Bill relates to the provision of certain material that is provided in the course of epidemiological studies undertaken by the Commonwealth. I point out that it does not restrict itself specifically, although it is mentioned in the Bill, to the study which is currently being undertaken by the Commonwealth Institute of Health in respect of Vietnam veterans. The Bill encompasses a mechanism which provides that information given in the course of various studies will be kept confidential. We ought to consider the broad principle of that even though that, in itself, might apply to Vietnam veterans and various other health matters relating to that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point I am trying to make is that this study, which has been the feature of so much discussion and debate today, may in itself not specifically be the only study which is ever made in respect of Vietnam veterans. As honourable senators would know, I have announced in recent weeks the undertaking of another study by the Commonwealth Institute of Health in respect of birth defects. It is hoped that that particular study will touch on perhaps the most emotional area of concern in this whole debate and give us answers somewhat more quickly than we might otherwise have expected from the major epidemiological study which is now in the course of preparation. I mention that because it was clear to me that one or two Opposition speakers had not appreciated the extent of the Government's approach in this area and had not realised-I think Senator Giles was one and perhaps Senator Keeffe was another, although he may know of the existence of that inquiry-that the Government has a multi-pronged approach to this question and is not relying wholly and solely on the one major study which is the major concern of this Bill. It is important to recognise that. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Keeffe" NAMEID="SG7">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SG7">Senator Keeffe</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But should not those two studies be conducted together?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are. They are going forward concurrently at this time. That is the way in which we hope to get answers somewhat more quickly from the birth defects study. I now address my remarks to one or two points made by Senator Keeffe. He has done it before and I suppose he will continue to make the point that I have somehow always denied that there is any connection between disabilities and herbicide exposure. I have told him ad nauseam that that is not so, that I have never stated that and that in fact I have been misrepresented by the Press in regard to that matter on many occasions. I have made that clear from time to time. Nor have I attributed other reasons as the sole causes of the disabilities of Vietnam veterans, even though the Press has sought on some occasions to attribute other reasons. The honourable senator has placed his own interpretation upon some particular remarks I have made from time to time and I can only leave it to him to continue to make those points. But I wish to put it on the public record that in no way have I made the kinds of remarks which Senator Keeffe has attributed to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Keeffe also mentioned a letter which came into his hands, addressed to me, from a Mr Daschle who represents an organisation known as Vietnam Veterans in Congress in the United States. I do not have a copy of that letter with me but from memory it claimed I had been discourteous in not seeking to contact Mr Daschle and his organisation while I was in the United States. In fact, the happenings were such that I had very limited time. Through my officers in the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the officers in the Embassy in Washington we had some contact with that organisation and invited it to send representatives to an evening function. I think I referred to that in my reply. I did hope to be able to contact that organisation on that occasion but unfortunately no representatives attended. I do not believe, given the exigencies of the particular timing and of being in Washington at that time, that much can be made of that complaint. However I would be anxious to hear from that organisation by way of submission as to the various issues to which it would like to address itself. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am perfectly happy for the honourable senator to do that since what I have said has already been incorporated in the letter which went to the organisation some six or eight weeks ago. I have not yet received a submission from it, to the best of my knowledge. With regard to one or two other matters that were mentioned, I noted that Senator Keeffe referred to a letter sent by Dr Harry Pope to members of parliament in the last few days. Without wishing to labour this matter, I just draw the Senate's attention to the fact that whilst Dr Pope does talk of the toxicity of various chemicals-no one disagrees with that, least of all myself; certainly I have not disagreed with it in the letter I have circulated to members-unless a connection can be established between the level of exposure of Australian soldiers in Vietnam to the chemical which was sprayed, or with which they might have come into contact in Vietnam, it is extremely difficult to assess the actual effects, in the way that Senator Keeffe seems to think is automatic, from a scientific standpoint.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would not like honourable senators to think, as it is from time to time represented in the Press, that Vietnam veterans are somehow totally ignored by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Of a total number of approximately 41,000 troops who had service in Vietnam, roughly 7,000 receive treatment and/or pension benefits or payments of some kind or another from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. It is important to recognise that soldiers from Vietnam are receiving the same kinds of benefits, the same kinds of treatment and care, that have been available to a very satisfactory degree over many years to the veterans of other wars. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to one or two other matters mentioned particularly by Senator Giles. She referred to the fact that there had been no consultation with the Vietnam Veterans' Association of Australia in respect of the preparation of the questionnaire circulated amongst Vietnam veterans for the pilot study for the epidemiological study. I should point out that it was the request of the Vietnam Veterans' Association and other organisations that the highest degree of confidentiality in the preparation and collection of data from that questionnaire should be maintained by the Institute of Health in formulating its answers to the inquiry. They did request that a Bill of the kind that has now been presented, and which we hope will be passed into law shortly, be prepared. I think that is a very important factor. Certainly it is a key factor in the ultimate success of any epidemiological study in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Without going into any more detail in relation to the many points Senator Giles made, perhaps the one other area that bears mentioning is her reference to the Atlanta birth defects study. During my trip to the United States in June I visited the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta to determine the state of progress with relation to the birth defects study in that area. It was a most interesting visit and we were able to establish that it would be some considerable time before the Atlanta organisation could produce meaningful results. In that respect it was disappointing because we were not able to get a clear answer as to whether there could be established quickly any linkage between birth defects and defoliant exposure. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the major point, the amendment moved by Senator Grimes on behalf of the Opposition to the motion for the second reading of this Bill. It requires that the Senate states an opinion that the Vietnam veterans study referred to in the Bill should be supported by a wide judicial inquiry. The Government's position on this has been consistently made plain. Indeed, Senator Martin in her speech made both her position and that of the Government very clear in that regard. We do not see that a judicial inquiry could come down with any other opinion than that there ought to be some kind of major scientific study to establish the linkages between veterans' disabilities and their exposure to chemicals. Therefore, it seems to us that the quickest and most effective route to establishing the rights and wrongs of this situation is via the gathering, sifting and assessment of scientific information in such a way as to establish conclusively one way or another whether there are these linkages as claimed. It is for that reason that the Government opposes the establishment of a judicial inquiry. Notwithstanding the fact that the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment will be looking at these matters very closely, and has very considerable powers to examine those questions and may well produce its own results--</PARA>

Finally, it is our view that a judicial inquiry would not produce the results which the Vietnam Veterans' Association of Australia and other supporters of that organisation, and the Opposition are seeking. In fact, the route the Government is following, that is, a solid scientific inquiry, we believe will finally produce the goods in this matter. For that reason the Government opposes the amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These four Bills seek to increase where possible penalties under various Acts for mislabelling export meat. Of course, the legislation has been prompted by the recent meat export scandal. It could be said that it is a bit late in the day for the Government to be acting in this area because almost two years ago W. Pope and Co., a firm in Western Australia, was convicted of an offence very similar to those with which other firms have since been charged. The offence by Pope was to mislabel as beef meat which was in fact mutton. Other firms have since mislabelled horse and kangaroo flesh as beef in export cartons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation which was exposed in recent months is, among other things, a function of the years of dithering in official circles, in particular by the National Country Party Ministers who have been responsible, over the establishment of a single efficient meat inspection service. One of the many ironies raised by these Bills and the Government's attempt belatedly to increase penalties for offences of this nature is that some of the offending firms have been simultaneously receiving Government funds in the form of export incentives. This prompted Senator Primmer to ask in Senate Estimates Committee last Monday whether there was any mechanism under which the Government could recover money paid to these offending firms in the form of export incentives. The Chairman of the Export Development Grants Board, Mr Daly, gave a characteristically windy and irrelevant reply in which he concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> I think the time has so passed on that in October 1981 we have moved a long way beyond 30 June 1979, and so the question may have more than a little of a hypothetical element in it. </PARA>
<PARA>Fortunately, Senator Primmer was not satisfied with that evasive reply and put the question again in this form:</PARA>
<PARA> Is some form of false pretences in the export of certain goods feasible? If so, is there any provision under the Act to retrieve funds so granted?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Daly replied that under section 40 of the Export Market Development Grants Act and section 19 of the Export Expansion Grants Act 'specific provisions are available where a grant has been made in good faith but on the basis of subsequently shown false information moneys can be recouped'. Certainly the customers have been provided with false information by offending firms. I also expect that the firms have made declarations to the Department of Primary Industry that they have exported beef whereas they have exported a mixture of beef and/or kangaroo and horse or perhaps donkey. I hope that action is initiated by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), if the Export Development Grants Board is too inert to do so, at least to recover those public moneys which these firms have received while simultaneously misleading our export customers. </PARA>
<PARA> I followed Senator Primmer with a question relating to Statutory Rule No. 127 which was gazetted on 30 May 1980. I asked what additional financial obligations were incurred by the Commonwealth because of gazettal of Statutory Rule No. 127. I received an evasive and irrelevant answer along the lines of the answer supplied earlier to a question asked in the Senate by Senator McLaren. After several more attempts to establish whether the Commonwealth's liability was increased due to Statutory Rule No. 127 had been foiled by Mr Daly I asked a question which concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . was it not possible under the legislation in the form it was in then--</PARA>
<PARA>That is originally-</PARA>
<PARA>to calculate the entitlement of meat exporters?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Daly, having previously asserted that there was no additional financial obligation thrust upon the Commonwealth as a result of Statutory Rule No. 127 because there was no obligation additional to that which was intended at the time the legislation was passed, then implied it was not possible to calculate it anyway. In answer to my question whether it was possible to calculate entitlement as the Act was originally worded, Mr Daly said:</PARA>
<PARA> Yes. It was obviously possible to calculate the entitlement of meat exporters who were not engaged in the trade which involved quota meat with the United States and Canada. </PARA>
<PARA>That was an ambivalent answer which forced me to follow up with the question:</PARA>
<PARA> Is Mr Daly saying that it was not possible to calculate the entitlements of exporters who were engaged in trade with Canada and the United States under the Act as it originally stood?</PARA>
<PARA>That specific question produced another rambling, irrelevant and misleading reply, the first phrase of which I will quote, which had nothing to do with the question. Mr Daly said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Export Development Grants Board is charged with the administration of the legislation--</PARA>
<PARA>And so on. I was forced to put the question again. After a couple more futile endeavours to extract the truth from Mr Daly, I said:</PARA>
<PARA> I will assert that it was possible to calculate entitlements under the original Act. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked Mr Daly either to confirm or deny that. Finally, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I accept that it was possible to make a calculation of a grant entitlement which, if it had been strictly on the wording of section 4 (2)--</PARA>
<PARA>That was a reference to the original Act. Having established finally and with great difficulty that entitlements of individual exporters could be calculated before Statutory Rule No. 127 was gazetted, and whether Statutory Rule No. 127 was ever gazetted or not, I asked whether, having established that it was possible to calculate this figure as a result of Statutory Rule No. 127 having been gazetted, the Commonwealth had incurred an additional financial liability to exporters of the order of $20m. After another rather evasive answer and the rephrasing of the question, Mr Daly said that no, that could not be done. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . because at no stage did it seek to do other than what it understood the Government's intention to be. It--</PARA>
<PARA>'It' being the Export Development Grants Board-</PARA>
<PARA>Never sought to make any calculations as to what might have been the determinations without or with Statutory Rule No. 127. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat. Mr Daly said:</PARA>
<PARA> It--</PARA>
<PARA>that is the Board-</PARA>
<PARA>Never sought to make any calculation as to what might have been the determinations without or with Statutory Rule No. 127. </PARA>
<PARA>That conflicts with a statement made a few minutes prior to that by Mr Daly who stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In the adjustments which have been made by the Board in these redeterminations--</PARA>
<PARA>I stress 'in these redeterminations'-</PARA>
<PARA> There have been pluses and minuses to claimants but usually of fairly small amounts. The suggestion that the end result of bringing in Statutory Rule No. 127 would be to give a further entitlement of $20m has no basis in fact. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Senate to contrast Mr Daly's claim that at no stage did the Board seek to calculate what the entitlements would have been without Statutory Rule No. 127 with his earlier statement which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> In the adjustments which have been made by the Board in these redeterminations there have been pluses and minuses--</PARA>
<PARA>Either he was very careless in the way he expressed himself or he was misleading the Committee. His references to redeterminations cannot mean anything other than that the Board had calculated entitlements for at least some exporters before the gazettal of Statutory Rule No. 127 and that as a result of Statutory Rule No. 127 those entitlements were recalculated afterwards. </PARA>
<PARA> I then asked whether, with regard to the 53 firms which, according to Mr Daly's information, had had their entitlements finally assessed, there was any difference between the original entitlement under the Act and the ultimate entitlement following the gazettal of Statutory Rule No. 127. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Could the Committee have a list of those 53 firms with their entitlements as finally assessed and their entitlements as they would have been if the Act had been applied as it was originally written?</PARA>
<PARA>Audible to those nearby but not audible to Hansard, and therefore not recorded, was Mr Daly's advice to the presiding Minister, which was: 'I strongly recommended not providing that information'. The reason for not providing that information, which a close scrutiny of Mr Daly's evidence reveals could technically be provided and indeed much of which ought still to be lying around in the Export Development Grants Board, is that as a result of Statutory Rule No. 127 having been gazetted a $20m gratuitous restrospective handout was made to meat exporters. It was gratuitous and retrospective because the rule itself was gazetted 11 months after meat, or at least beef, mutton and lamb, had ceased to be eligible at all for export grants. </PARA>
<PARA> If, as I expect, the request that I made to have the before and after entitlements of those 53 firms provided to the Committee or to the Senate is not met, the only remaining conclusion is that the Government does not want those names to be publicly revealed. Mr Daly, on several occasions, denied that there was a $20m additional entitlement. He did so firstly in an evasive and obfuscatory way and, secondly, in a more direct way. He also claimed that no assessment had been made. The figure of $20m was supplied to me some two years ago from within his department, apparently by one of the rare creatures in that department, someone willing to disclose the truth. It should also be noted that Statutory Rule No. 127 was written in language which was incomprehensible and that no statement of the extra financial obligations it entailed or even of the intention of that rule was made by the Minister at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Daly's evidence before the Committee maintained the standard of Statutory Rule No. 127 and the language in which it was written. As I said earlier, he was obfuscatory and evasive. I have no doubt that he intended to withhold the truth from the Committee, and to some extent he succeeded. Equally, I have no doubt that requests for information to be supplied regarding the difference to the entitlements of those 53 firms whose claims have been finalised before and after Statutory Rule No. 127 will not be officially supplied. the excuse will be that it cannot be determined, which leads me to emphasise again Mr Daly's reference at page 665 of the Hansard of Estimates Committee H of 12 October:</PARA>
<PARA> In the adjustments which have been made by the Board in these redeterminations there have been pluses and minuses-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Daly is, of course, a graduate of a department which has been maladministered for decades by National Country Party Ministers. He was not made chairman of the Export Development Grants Board to provide information to taxpayers about how their money is gratuitously handed out to favoured clients of that party. Lest it be thought that I have consciously or otherwise distorted the evasive and misleading nature of Mr Daly's replies, I seek leave to incorporate into Hansard pages 664-668 inclusive of Estimates Committee H Hansard dated 12 October 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The pages read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Daly-It is not a question specifically for a person on the Board to answer. However I will attempt to assist you. The Government determines its appropriation. The Board administers the grants schemes and makes grants up to that amount of appropriation in a year. Government policy determines how much goes into any appropriation item. An estimate was made of the number of claims the Board expected to receive in the financial year. The value was carried over from the previous financial year at 1 July and determination made that the amount available this year would be increased so that additional moneys would be paid out to exporters in that time. Frankly, government policy determines how much is made available there. </PARA>

<PARA> Mr Daly-The fact that the grant rights for the export expansion grants scheme will be halved in respect of 1982-83 and those claims will come to the Board for determination from July 1983 onwards will not reduce the amount of work on the Board because the same number of claims or indeed more or less can be expected, but it will not be dependent on the grant right.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is any mechanism available within the system for export development grants to recoup from an exporter where that exporter is proved to have exported goods that do not come up to standard? For example in 1978-79 amongst the many export grants made available was one of $245 to Steigers Meat Supply (Aust.) Pty Ltd. It is not a very large amount. I do not wish to do anybody any harm. My memory is that this firm may be one that has been involved with meat rackets. If we turn to the later year we find the company Edward Sovery &amp; Co. Pty Ltd, which received $60,712. I think in the same year we find the names Protean (Holdings) Ltd and Protean Trading Pty Ltd, and I think later the same firm is mentioned again. I am not saying that the companies did so, but I believe Mr Hammond, the follow who is up on charges, took meat out of Protean (Holdings). I am wondering whether it is proved that some of this meat may have come from any of those establishments which are later proved to have been less than honest in their dealings. Is there any mechanism for that money to be retrieved?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Daly-I think one would have to recognise that some of the content of the question is really sub-judice, so I will answer in principle. Exports of the principal classes of meat were made ineligible for grant purposes after the 1978-79 grant year, that is, from 1 July 1979. Some other meats remain eligible. Without being facetious, I know that horse and kangaroo meat remain eligible for export expansion grant claims. I think the time has so passed on that in October 1981 we have moved a long way beyond 30 June 1979, and so the question may have more than a little of a hypothetical element in it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is some form of false pretences in the export of certain goods feasible? If so, is there any provision under the Act to retrieve funds so granted?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Daly-Yes, there is ample provision for the recoupment of funds which may have been unwittingly paid on good faith when further knowledge comes to the Board. That is referred to in section 40 of the Export Market Development Grants Act, where there is a specific provision for the recoupment of such moneys, and also in the equivalent section-section 19-of the Export Expansion Grants Act 1979. Specific provisions are available where a grant has been made in good faith but on the basis of subsequently shown false information moneys can be recouped. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to Statutory Rule No. 127, which was gazetted at the end of May last year. An answer was supplied to Senator McLaren relating to a question without notice asked on 11 June. I am not sure when the answer was supplied to him. The basis of Senator McLaren's question arose from the additional eligibility for grants created by Statutory Rule No. 127, and he asked whether it was expected that about $20m additional cost would be incurred. The answer said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Statutory Rule No. 127 confers no benefits other than those intended at the time the legislation was enacted in 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> This does not really answer the question because the question does not refer to the intentions which may have existed in someone's mind at the time it was enacted. It is whether the effect of Statutory Rule No. 127 had incurred additional liabilities of the order of $20m. Could I have that question answered now? Is it correct that the additional liabilities created by Statutory Rule No. 127 amounted to about $20m?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Daly-The senators had before them the Board's sixth annual report which was tabled in the Senate on 10 September. I would refer them to paragraph 58 in that report and perhaps it would be useful for me now to read that paragraph because it will, I think, assist Senator Walsh to understand what was behind, and what has been the result of the particular statutory rule that he speaks of. I quote from the Board's annual report at page 12:</PARA>
<PARA> The Board is engaged in the particular endeavour of making the ultimate determination of claims by claimants in the meat exporting industry whose exports were necessarily caught up in the application of Statutory Rules 1980, No. 127, where meat was exported under quota to the U.S.A. and/or Canada. In August 1979 when the administrative problem involving section 4 (2) of the EEG Act 78 became apparent, the Board determined to defer for consideration exports to U.S.A. and Canada of both quota and non-quota meat. When the Board established its guidelines and procedures for the application of Statutory Rules 1980 No. 127, the involved claimants were recontacted so that the necessary data could be assembled for investigation. A total of 105 claims were seen to be involved. At its meeting on 16 June 1981, the Board was advised that of the particular 105 claims, revised determinations had been finalised or submitted for approval for 53; 26 continued under investigation, while the necessary data for adjustment were still to be provided for the remaining 26 claims. The Board, for its part, established a task group of senior investigation officers to carry through the complicated procedures involved in the adjustment of grant entitlement as provided for in the particular Statutory Rules. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me explain that the administrative problem that arose was in the wording of section 4 (2) which overlooked the fact that on 1 December 1977 the Australian Meat Board changed into the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation. It was the intention of government, as I understood it, that any quota arrangements which flowed from the Meat Board through to the Meat and Livestock Corporation would automatically be covered by the wording of section 4 (2). Advice from the Attorney-General's Department was such that there was a particular paragraph in the Australian Meat Board Act which prevented that interpretation. That was the whole basis of the need for bringing out what has transpired to be a most complicated regulation because the regulation, being retrospective to the enactment of the legislation itself, could not be brought in to disadvantage any particular claimant. But on the same score, it was not intended to give a particular advantage to any particular claimant. What the Board did when it was aware of this problem, was to advise Government of it but then it kept in reserve some claims or possible claim entitlement by setting aside both the quota and non-quota meat and saying it would not determine those until it had the proper regulation in place so that the thing could be done properly, in the way the Government intended. That has been the result. In the adjustments which have been made by the Board in these redeterminations there have been pluses and minuses to claimants, but usually of fairly small amounts. The suggestion that the end result of bringing in Statutory Rule No. 127 would be to give a further entitlement of $20m has no basis in fact. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I dispute that. The effect of Statutory Rule No. 127 was to reduce the base from which an entitlement to a grant would be determined. Is that correct?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Daly-The effect of Statutory Rule No. 127 was to enable the Board to make the determinations in the way in which the Government intended when the legislation was enacted in November 1978. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I come back to that question of intention. Am I correct in stating that the effect of Statutory Rule No. 127 was to reduce the amount of money in the base period for the firm involved below what it would have been if Statutory Rule No. 127 had not been gazetted? If so, and given that the entitlement to a grant was assessed as the difference between the value of exports in the base period and the value of exports in the qualifying period, how could it have failed to incur a greater financial liability?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Daly-Let me reiterate that the principal problem in the wording of section 4 (2) was the fact that the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel had sought to use a form of words which overlooked a small section in the Australian Meat Industry Act. This section did not, on the advice of the Attorney-General's Department, confer the intention of the Government that all meat, both under the Australian Meat Board and the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, would have been ineligible for grant purposes under section 4 (2). The Board did not provide any moneys to any meat exporter in respect of quota or non-quota meat until the proper legislation and Statutory Rule No. 127 was in place. So the effect of this was that no additional entitlement was provided to any of the meat exporters. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I put the question in another way? That does not answer my question any more than the reply received a couple of months ago answered Senator McLaren's question. Whether it met the alleged intention of the people who framed the legislation or not, was it not possible under the legislation in the form it was in then to calculate the entitlement of meat exporters? I realise that it would have been calculated in a different way because of the exclusion of certain exports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Daly-Yes. It was obviously possible to calculate the entitlement of meat exporters who were not engaged in the trade which involved quota meat with the United States and Canada. Quite a number of claims were determined where there was grant entitlement which did not involve section 4 (2). </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is Mr Daly saying that it was not possible to calculate the entitlements of exporters who were engaged in trade with Canada and the United States under the Act as it originally stood? Leaving aside the question of whether it was the intention, was it technically possible to calculate what the entitlements of those exporters would be? If not, why not?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Daly-The Export Development Grants Board is charged with the administration of the legislation, which is the Export Expansion Grants Act. It seeks to administer that legislation in terms of the wording of the legislation and its understanding of that legislation and also of its understanding of the Government's intention in respect to that legislation. It is aided by the legal authorities of the Commonwealth where problems arise. Before it determines claims it has to be reasonably certain that those claims, those grants, are in accord with the legislation and the facts. I am saying to Senator Walsh that we deliberately put aside finalising the determinations of those meat exporters' claims until the proper regulation was in place on the advice of the Commonwealth law authorities so that we could then proceed to determine the grants as was intended. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the board made a decision not to finalise those claims pending the gazettal of Statutory Rule No. 127, but I also understood Mr Daly to assert earlier that it was not possible to calculate their entitlements prior to Statutory Rule No. 127 having been gazetted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also understand Mr Daly to say that he thought the entitlements might have been lessened by section 4 (2) from what they had been and they were restored by Statutory Rule No. 127. Have I understood it incorrectly?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Daly-To safeguard myself, I would need to have a look at the transcript to see the particular words. But let me reiterate that where meat exports were underquoted to the United States of America and Canada the Board did not determine the ultimate grant entitlement of any of those claimants until Statutory Rule No. 127 was in place. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that point, but I still want to clear up this other matter. I will assert that it was possible to calculate entitlements under the original Act. I know it was decided not to do so. I am asserting, however, that it was possible to calculate the entitlements because the procedures were quite clear cut. Does Mr Daly accept that it was possible, or does he dispute it?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Daly-I accept that it was possible to make a calculation of a grant entitlement which, if it had been strictly on the wording of section 4 (2) and as advised to us by the Commonwealth law authorities, would have been a calculation outside the intention of government in the formulation of that legislation. The Board shrank from making any of those determinations until everything was in place to make an appropriate determination. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have now established that it was possible to calculate the entitlements under the Act in its original form. We go back to the question I asked some time ago. As a result of Statutory Rule No. 127, was the ultimate liability of the Government increased by approximately $20m above what it would have been had the payments been made strictly in accord with the original Act?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Daly-I assert and I think there were some questions on notice and the Department of Primary Industry was attributed with the figure of $20m-that of that there is no basis on which that Department could have made any assessment of that size and I think that Department also advised that was the case. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My understanding is that the estimate was not made by the Department of Primary Industry. I know Senator McLaren's question said that, but I understood that an estimate of $20m had been made within the Department of Trade or possibly within the Board, I am not sure which.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Daly-Certainly the Board made no such attempt at any estimate of that size. I cannot speak for the Department of Trade but possibly Mr Hall would like to. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hall-From the point of view of the Department of Trade the answer is no, the Department did not make such a calculation and, as with the DPI, there is no way in which any Department could make such a calculation. The Grants Board is the sole repository for claims made and that information which is in a claim is not available to anyone else. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So no estimate was made or recorded, anyway at the time, but surely the Board must have some idea-at least by now-of the likely additional liabilities incurred as a result of Statutory Rule No. 127. Does the Board have such an estimate now?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Daly-I have to suggest on the part of the Board that it would not consider that question appropriate in the circumstances, because at no stage did it seek to do other than what it understood the Government's intention to be. It never sought to make any calculation as to what might have been the determinations without or with Statutory Rule No. 127. Indeed we have not at this point completed all of those 105 claims, because some of the claims are still providing data, to be able to tell you the total outcome of those readjustments made after the quota and the non-quota meat were reassessed. But at no stage did the Board see it appropriate to make any calculation of the sort the senator is suggesting. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Who did divine the intention of the legislation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Hall, was any statement of government policy made by a Minister?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Hall-Not as such, but I think one should bear in mind what the effect of not making the regulation would have been. If the Board were forced to make its determinations on the basis of the Act as it was written, it would have meant that meat exported to the United States of America and Canada in the grant year would be ineligible and yet meat exported in the base years would have been . . . </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If that was made known to the Minister, I imagine he would have sought a government policy decision based on that advice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Hall-The intention at the time of drafting that clause was, as Mr Daly pointed out, made without research having been made into the provision of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Act which related to the transition from the Australian Meat Board to the AMLC. It was thought at the time that a reference to the AMLC quota would include that of the body that the AMLC took over from. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I still think we are entitled to something a bit more specific. We are told that the intention of the Act was something different from what was actually written in it. Somebody must have made the decision that that would be so. Is it known who made that decision? Was it someone within the Department of Trade and Resources, someone within the Board?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Daly, was a decision within the Board not to process these claims made by the Board spontaneously or was the Board asked not to process them either by the Minister or by the Department until Statutory Regulation No. 127, or something like it, had been gazetted?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Daly-I can state firmly and categorically that the Board, in seeking to make guidelines in respect of each of the provisions, foresaw the difficulty. Perhaps for persons here not conversant with this section, it ought to be stated. Section 4 (2) says that for the purposes of sub-section (1), where meat is exported to the United States of America or Canada, by virtue of a quota allocated under a scheme prepared by the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, that meat shall not be taken to be eligible goods. The Board, in seeking to make guidelines, foresaw the difficulty which eventually emerged. Without any external prompting, it approached the Attorney-General's Department, which is the appropriate Crown Law authority, for advice. The Attorney-General's Department, in looking at the wording of that section, saw a defect, in its view, arising out of a particular section in the Australian Meat Industry Act, the forerunner to the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Act. I understand that defect was not foreseen by the Parliamentary Counsel at the time. On receiving this advice from the Attorney-General's Department, the Board immediately advised the Department of Trade and Resources, which immediately was in touch with the Minister. My understanding is that the Minister said that a regulation should be prepared for gazettal. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer once more to the intention, or what we have been told about someone's assessment of what the Government intention was. We are not too sure whose assessment it was. Let us bear in mind the price of beef, which was the major export and which roughly doubled in price in the financial year 1978-79, over what it had been in the previous year. It seems to be postulated that because the grants to particular firms would be less than the Government had intended at the time the original Act was passed, it is reasonable, fitting and proper that the regulation should effectively amend the Act. Did the Government also anticipate, at the time it drew up the conditions, that the price of beef would double in that second year for which the product was eligible for a grant? A dual standard seems to be operating. A belief seems to be held that the firms ought to be compensated for some unintended loss which they may incur, and that it is quote acceptable for them to pick up a huge windfall gain because the extent of the grant was determined not by the volume of the product but by its value. When prices doubled, as they did in that year, was there not enormous windfall gain, as well? If the firms are going to be compensated for their windfall losses, would it not be reasonable to argue that some account should be taken of the windfall gain-unless the Government at the time it framed the Act anticipated that meat prices would double in the financial year?</PARA></TALK.START>

The long term damage which this scandal will do in particular to the Australian beef export industry on the United States market is incalculable. The attributes of Country Party administered departments are inertia, incompetence and a propensity to set up sleazy backroom deals. The departments have acquired the character of their Ministers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to say a few words in the debate on these meat Bills which deal with penalties for fraudulent activities in relation to the export of meat. I particularly welcome the fact that this legislation is before the Parliament so soon after the issue of horse meat and later kangaroo meat substitution for beef in meat exported from Australia was raised. I remind the Senate that it was in mid-August that the first reports were given that in San Diego meat which had been discovered in cartons purporting to contain Australian export beef was discovered not to be beef as it should have been. The Government moved quickly but at that stage needed evidence to confirm the suspicions, and some species testing had to take place. Immediately, meat was impounded in Australia and species testing took place in Australia. On 19 August it was confirmed that among that meat which had been impounded meat other than beef had been detected following species testing in Australia. At that time many stories were circulating about what this all meant. Many allegations were being made privately about people involved in a meat fraud and about the scope of the fraud itself. On 20 August in this chamber I asked a question of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) who represents the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon). I asked whether the Government would consider setting up a judicial inquiry into this matter. The reason I asked the question in the way in which I did was that at that stage none of the allegations had been made publicly and there was no way of discerning whether the very serious allegations were in any way well justified. I supported the call for a judicial inquiry on the grounds that a judicial inquiry can move quickly and it gives people the opportunity publicly to make their allegations, which allegations can be either proven or disproven. Subsequent events led to the setting up of a royal commission into the whole meat scandal. At the same time the Government also moved quickly to increase the penalties that apply to fraudulent practices in relation to the labelling and export of meat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ought to say at this stage that it is incumbent on us to remember that it is not only export meat that we need to be concerned about. The domestic meat market is a significant one for those involved in the meat industry and there is evidence of a decline in the consumption of meat in Australia. The ramifications of this meat scandal could be very serious for the meat industry in regard to the consequences within Australia as well as the United States. We ought not to forget that the Australian consumer is a major consumer of the meat that our producers need to market. </PARA>
<PARA> I visited the United States at the time that this scandal was at its height and I was there when the Minister for Primary Industry announced that there would be a royal commission and that the Government was moving to levy severe penalties on those who had so fraudulantly acted and so abused Australia's good name and integrity in the international meat trade. I had the opportunity to speak on the issue to officials of the United States Department of Agriculture and the Department of State, to members and staff of congressmen and of Senators as well as to our representatives in the United States. I spoke also to others associated with the meat lobby in the United States. I was therefore surprised when I returned to Australia to find that there was quite some complacency here about how seriously we ought to regard the impact that this scandal has had on our integrity and standing in the United States. I am not suggesting for one minute that the Government had that view but I was surprised to read news reports quoting people who purported to be spokesmen for those interested in the beef industry in the United States saying that it was not a large issue in that country. I found it to be a very large issue. Wherever I travelled in the United States I encountered people not involved in the industry at all who were aware of the fact that there was a scandal current and that kangaroo meat and horsemeat had been sold in the United States masquerading as beef. </PARA>
<PARA> This fear of mine was borne out by a story in today's Australian Financial Review headed 'New threat to US beef market'. The article outlined moves made in the United States Congress which could severely restrict Australia's beef export trade to America. While I was in the United States I had the opportunity to discuss this very legislation with those associated with it. The report in the Australian Financial Review indicated that the legislation in question has been passed by the United States Senate in the United States and that it may well be passed by Congress. We need to be very concerned indeed. When speaking to one of the supporters of the legislation no bones were made at all about the fact that the horsemeat scandal had given this legislation just the fillip it needed to be passed by Congress. The legislation had been before Congress twice and had been twice defeated. This time it looks as though it will be passed. </PARA>
<PARA> The reasons for the legislation are not based in Australia. The reasons are the protection of United States beef producers and also there is some concern about some of the processing procedures which are used in countries other than Australia which export beef to the United States. In the past the criticism that has been levelled at the methods of inspection, inspection standards and so on in meat processing plants has not attached to Australia. Australia has been a well regarded supplier of meat to the American market. However, this scandal has effectively destroyed our credibility with a large number of the members of the United States Congress and the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say to the credit of the United States Government officials who were involved in the discussions that they were entirely fair and they did all that they could to ensure that Australia's meat export trade to the United States was not unfairly jeopardised. The Government of course moved very quickly, as I said earlier, to impound meat from the Profreeze processing works, and as a result of the prompt action by the Australian Government the United States officials were able to reassure some who would have wanted instantly to stop all further shipments of meat from Australia to the United States and to persuade them that was not reasonable or fair. </PARA>
<PARA> We ought to recognise that the United States Government has been very fair and reasonable with Australia in this matter. However, the Government cannot control what legislation will pass Congress. Under those circumstances one can understand the outrage felt by Australian beef producers and others involved in our meat industry at the effect that the actions of these perpetrators of fraud have had on their industry. As I said earlier, it is important that the allegations that have been made-some of them publicly, some of them not publicly-come out into the open and that those who have allegations to make, make them to the royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the issues I discussed with those interested in the United States was the significance of the Government having decided to appoint a royal commission and of its having to move quickly to increase penalties to show its bona fides. It is very important that we handle this whole issue properly now. One of my great fears about allegations that are made-but not made in the proper channels-is the potential for future damage to our meat industry. If we reasonably overcome this present difficulty and legislation which would enormously disadvantage our meat producers, processors and exporters does not pass through the Houses in the United States then we can be grateful. However in just a couple of years time, because of cyclical problems, exports to the United States will be more difficult anyway for our meat industry. We must ensure that when that time comes it will not be possible for those who would try to stop the import of our meat into the United States to say there is something wrong with the Australian meat industry that has never been cleared up. We must ensure they will not be able to refer to this scandal to raise vague fears about its significance. The allegations must be made publicly now and they must be proven or disproven and those who are implicated must face the consequences of their action. </PARA>
<PARA> If, after the hue and cry has died down and after we have these much higher penalties, we do not as a government move as severely as we can to bring to bear the penalties applying to the actions of any who have been involved in aiding and abetting this swindle we will have betrayed our entire industry. In September Mr Nixon said:</PARA>
<PARA> Without in any way trying to play down the gravity of the situation, the facts at present indicate that the great bulk of Australia's meat export industry is carrying out its trade honestly and fairly. </PARA>
<PARA>For the sake of that great bulk of the meat export industry, for the producers, processors and exporters, and for the sake of the livelihoods of all who depend on that industry and who trade and work honestly and fairly, we must make sure at all times as a government that our actions in relation to those who have jeopardised this industry are as clear and as severe as we can make them. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I think a very special tribute should be paid to those who represent our country in Washington. Mr Nixon, in his statement, said that actions by the United States Department of Agriculture and its co-operative attitude on our problem confirmed these two significant points:</PARA>
<PARA> The confidence of the US Administration in the Australian meat export industry, and</PARA>
<PARA> The success of close co-operation and consultation between US and Australian government and veterinary authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>I add that the efforts made on our behalf by our officers, particularly by our trade officers, in our embassy in Washington, ought to be publicly acknowledged. The contribution they made in assisting our case and in the understanding of our position when this scandal arose was enormous. It was not something they could do on short notice. Their effectiveness largely arose because they are very professional people who are well regarded and who always work very hard in our interests. It was to the benefit of all Australians that they so ably assisted in averting what could have been an instant disaster for our meat industry. As it was, the meat market instantly declined with a softening of prices and our beef producers received a lower return. Some indications now are that that market is firming up and that our meat producers can look forward to a reasonably stable future in the short term. One can only hope that those who have the power to make law in the United States will recognise that the Australian Government has moved resolutely and firmly and is determined to ensure that those fraudulent actions which have come so close to sabotaging such a vital industry will not be tolerated in this country, and that they are indeed only a small minority of our total industry and that our meat industry is one of integrity and deserves to be treated as such. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Definitely. The major thrust of the Meat Export (Penalties) Bill 1981 and associated Bills, as the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) pointed out, is in fact to provide for severe penalties to be imposed on any person who contravenes the provisions of the Bills. The Bills seek to impose increased penalties, which are welcomed by the Australian Democrats. However, in relationship to these increased penalties, section 12 of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act 1977 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Where the Corporation is satisfied that a licensee has contravened or failed to comply with a condition to which the licence is subject, the Corporation may cancel the licence on and from such date as it thinks fit or may suspend the licence-</PARA>
<PARA>Sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) make similar types of provisions. It strikes me that the penalty of suspension or cancellation of a licence is one of the most important of the penalties that the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation may impose. However, although we have these Bills before us to increase penalties and although that quite severe penalty was contained in the original Act of 1977, the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation had never exercised that power until September 1981. In other words, merely setting Bills down in this House is useless and increasing penalties is useless unless indeed the Corporation becomes more active and actually makes use of its powers in the protection of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to us that rather than imposing the financial types of penalties contained in these Bills, which we support, the Corporation ought to direct itself quite specifically to exercising its muscle in terms of the power already given to it under the original Act of 1977. It should actively suspend or cancel the licences of any of those companies or individuals found trespassing on the provisions of their licence. We believe that only in that way can we protect the rest of the industry and our major export markets. There are examples of companies that have been subjected to fines under previous Acts and have then received grants from the Government for a variety of developmental projects. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Corporation had acted firmly since 1977 and made full use of its powers we would not be in the situation that has been revealed in the last few months. Any company that is found to be involved in the type of operation that is currently being revealed, and no doubt will be revealed by the Royal Commission, should have its licences cancelled and should not again be allowed to apply for a licence. While that may seem draconian, I believe that it is the only fair and proper course for the Corporation to pursue if the livelihood, good name and reputation of other companies, which abide by the law in going about their business and exporting, are to be protected. If the Corporation is not willing to use the power granted to it under the 1977 Act to suspend or cancel licences, I see absolutely no reason why it should be interested in using the types of penalties to be imposed under this legislation. Merely gathering income by imposing a financial penalty on an individual will certainly penalise that individual but it will do absolutely nothing for the confidence of the industry as a whole. What will find a great deal of support within the industry, and I am sure that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) who represents the Minister for Primary Industry in this place would agree with me, is that people in primary industry, and the meat industry in particular, are of one mind in believing that the existing provisions ought to have been used and ought to be used regularly in the future against any company found guilty of such offences. We believe that the stringent application of the power the Corporation already has would be sufficient to regulate the problem that has arisen. By that means, and by the use of additional provisions-because of the complexity of the company law-we would ensure that those who had been directors and were in any way involved in those companies' nefarious activities would not be allowed to regain a licence under some other company title. If such matters were looked into and the Corporation exercised its muscle with the powers that it already has, the provisions of this legislation to which I have referred would not have been necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats will be supporting these Bills. We believe that they form a useful adjunct to what we are doing, but we do not believe that they contain the major power available to the Corporation. I hope that we will not have to wait another four or five years before the Corporation uses the power it has had since 1977. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-Unlike Senator Macklin, I hope that we will have to wait more than four or five years before there is any call for the exercise of this power, but perhaps I have lost the zest for battle that he, as a more recently arrived senator, still has. In any event, I thank all honourable senators for their support of this legislation, which is but one reaction to the problems which beset the meat industry and which have received a considerable amount of attention in this chamber since they were first brought to notice. There has also been the question of a police investigation. There have been suspensions of licences. New procedures with respect to the handling and testing of meat have been instituted, and we have in process a Royal Commission which will be examining matters of concern in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation, which imposes very heavy penalties for offences, is but one of the steps to be taken in the matter. Although Senator Macklin observed that he believed this was not the effective area of penalty, he too indicated that in general he supported the legislation. The importance of the industry to Australia is a matter on which there is general agreement in the Parliament. The concern expressed about the damage that might be done to our trade reflects that view, and I commend the legislation to the Senate for speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to the motion, which of course I do not oppose. On 24 September, which was the last day of the session before the fortnight recess for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, the Government Whip said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer now to the reports that have been tabled. I have given an assurance to the Opposition Whip and to honourable senators who discussed this matter in the last few minutes that the reports will be noted and debate on them adjourned. I assure the Senate that these reports will be available for debate on the return of the Senate in two weeks' time. There is no suggestion that these reports are being put aside so they cannot be brought forward for debate. I have given honourable senators an understanding of what has happened. Nothing is hidden; there is no suggestion of trickery. It is a straight out arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA>What happened was that these reports were put at the end of the Notice Paper on Tuesday of this week and, as every honourable senator knows, business was not completed on that day and the reports were not debated at all. On Wednesday, the adjournment was negatived to enable the Government to complete its business. We now find on Thursday, at 25 minutes past 5, that 22 reports, many of which are important and deserve considered comment from at least this side of the chamber and perhaps also the other side, are to be introduced and we are to be given 35 minutes in which to debate them. That is hardly time enough for comment on more than one of two. That is not a satisfactory arrangement. It does not bear out the words of Senator Kilgariff, which I am sure were uttered in all sincerity, on Thursday, 24 September. I suggest that plenty of things are hidden; that there is every indication of trickery, not by Senator Kilgariff but by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) and those who run the affairs of the Government in this place. In the circumstances, I wish to register the protest of the Opposition at the treatment it has received. </PARA>

The facts of the matter in the broad have been accurately put by the Acting Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Grimes. It is true that the items were listed to be dealt with on Tuesday and that they were not reached. I suppose that experience will be a caution to us in terms of coming to similar arrangements in the future. It was certainly not the intention of the Government to bury these reports or prevent discussion on them. My understanding was that the Opposition wished to address itself to at least one of the reports and that the procedure of the Senate would permit that to be done now.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The annual report of the Trade Practices Commission for 1980-81 raises quite fundamental questions about the functions, and the capacity to function, of the Commission. It is now seven years since the Murphy Trade Practices Act was introduced, changing as it did the face of restrictive trade practices and consumer protection law. This report highlights the continuing retreat of this Government from the objectives of that Act. It is a simple truth that there is no better way to frustrate the operation of regulatory legislation such as this than to withhold funds from the body set up to administer it. The evidence is overwhelming that Australian industry and business do not spontaneously eradicate restrictive practices or place consumer protection above profit, without legislative direction. Such legislative direction must be capable of enforcement by a suitably equipped and funded supervisory body. Yet this Government seeks to perpetrate another sleight of hand on the Australian public by publicly supporting the legislation while secretly, away from the public gaze, making the Trade Practices Commission progressively impotent by cutting back its funds and staff. The reduction of the Commission's staff by 30, or 16 per cent, over the last eight months of the immediately concluded 1980-81 financial year can only be described as savage in the extreme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is one optical illusion, this time perpetrated by the Trade Practices Commission itself, which I believe is deserving of some comment. I refer to the assertion in the report that the thrust of the competition provisions of the Trade Practices Act 'is not at all regulatory but indeed is deregulatory'. Whilst it is true that restrictive practices are a form, in a sense, of private regulation, which this legislation seeks to remove, it is simply incorrect and indeed misleading, for reasons which I spelt out in some detail in a recently published article in the Australian Financial Review, to characterise the Trade Practices Act as being 'deregulatory'. It was instituted as and must remain unashamedly a form of business regulation-that is, a form of government interference-in the operations of the market and in the decisions and the practices of non-government enterprises. That is exactly what regulation is all about. It has the capacity to be defensible regulation, regulation that is to be applauded, to the extent that the object of this kind of regulation, as it is with other categories of defensible regulation, is to ensure the achievement of widely desired social and economic objectives which the unregulated market does not necessarily achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> The Trade Practices Act is concerned with two broad matters: Restrictive trade practices on the one hand and consumer protection on the other, although they do obviously overlap to the extent that restrictive practices are themselves detrimental to consumers. Those matters are dealt with separately in the annual report. Restrictive trade practices, which are prohibited by the Act, include contracts, arrangements or understandings which substantially lessen competition, including price fixing agreements; monopolisation or the misuse of market power to exclude or damage competitors; exclusive dealing or commercial blackmail; resale price maintenance; price discrimination between customers; and mergers which place a corporation in a position of market dominance. These practices are objectionable for a number of reasons. They involve the misuse of market power by powerful corporations against smaller competitors, the maintenance of prices at a higher level than they would otherwise be, and the functioning of an economic system on a basis of discrimination, unfairness, inequality, and self-interest to the exclusion of the general interest. </PARA>
<PARA> In economic terms these practices are objectionable because they inhibit competition. This is hardly the time or place for any kind of detailed analysis of the concept of competition, but it is sufficient to say that we regard effective competition as being a pre-condition for the Australian economy to operate in the interests of all Australians instead of in the interests of private sector economic oligarchies. Unregulated monopolistic and collusive practices are almost always contrary to the best interests of Australian citizens, whether they be employees, self-employed businessmen or consumers. The classical theory of perfect competition holds that competition in a market maximises the efficient allocation of resources. Even if one could ever find a perfect market in the real world to test the theory, which of course one never can, the Australian Labor Party does not believe that economic efficiency is in any event the paramount goal or that the market alone provides any real solution to the complex economic and social needs of Australia. We deplore and will go on deploring the acts of social barbarity committed by the Reagan and Thatcher administrations in the name of freedom of the market, just as we also deplore the naivety of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Moore, who said in the House of Representatives on 9 September, as recorded at page 1070 of Hansard:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . self-regulation is the best way in which any industry can provide for the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA>We readily acknowledge-indeed it was a motivating force behind the Murphy Trade Practices Act-that to the extent that we have a market economy in Australia, maximum competition is essential to ensure that the economy functions in the public interest. What has happened to the restrictive trade practices work of the Trade Practices Commission? I come squarely to the nub of this report. At paragraph 4.2.1. the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission is giving effect to the Government's RCF decision that the Commission should be more selective in restrictive trade practices complaint investigation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In short, the enforcement of the Trade Practices Act is being wound back. We wholeheartedly endorse the comment of Commissioner Pengilley in what is described as 'additional comments appended to the report-which appears to be the current euphemism for a minority report-when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Litigation is now of the essence of the credibility of the Trade Practices Act . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Act is a paper tiger unless it is enforced. Yet, as a result of this Government's calculated undermining of this legislation, the Commission is being compelled to be even more selective than it has been up to date and to prefer administrative action over court action, administrative action being, in the words of the Commission as set out on page 7, 'much more acceptable to those who are alleged to be in breach of the law'. The Commission has also been compelled to rely heavily on private action which has all the numerous limitations alluded to by Commissioner Pengilley. I refer to paragraph 1.7 of his additional comments which appear on page 137 of the document now before us. </PARA>
<PARA> If litigation is the essence of the Act's credibility then its credibility is, I am afraid, in serious jeopardy. The Trade Practices Commission has instituted only one new case under the restrictive practice provisions since the beginning of the 1980-81 financial year. It was pointed out at the Senate Estimates Committee A meeting on 21 September last that certain of the present cases are of far-reaching significance and demanding of extensive resources. Whilst that is a partial answer, I suppose, to the point I am making, it is really no answer at all to the wholly inadequate level of active enforcement which these figures reveal. There just has to be more to the eradication of restrictive trade practices than taking on a few big cases. </PARA>
<PARA> I make these comments while being really quite fully aware that within the last week the Commission has had a major victory in the Federal Court of Australia with five glucose manufacturers being found guilty of collusive price fixing, each being fined $50,000 and ordered to pay the Commission's costs. That is a most welcome result and it is a resounding endorsement of the legislation and of the Commission's capacity, when it has adequate resources, to enforce the legislation. I repeat that if the prohibition of restrictive practices is to be enforced more than just symbolically, more than just selectively, the Commission must have resources to engage in investigation and enforcement on a wide range of cases, large and small. </PARA>
<PARA> The other main concern of the Trade Practices Act is consumer protection. It may be of some interest to honourable senators to be reminded that when the Trade Practices Act, as it now is, was introduced into Federal Parliament in 1974 the then Opposition, now the Government, opposed the inclusion of consumer protection provisions which were yet another Labor innovation. Of course, all the right sentiments were mouthed about agreeing in principle with the need for greater consumer protection but, in a manner all too prophetic of the 'co-operative federalism' in which this Government would like to see any Commonwealth legislative leadership drown, Mr Ellicott, as he then was, stated that the Opposition preferred to encourage uniformity between State consumer protection laws and hoped to see the establishment of consumer affairs bureaus and tribunals at that kind of level. The Labor Government stated then, and we reiterate now, our belief that consumers have a fundamental right to fair and honest dealing in business and that this right must be enforceable in law. It simply cannot be left to the erratic inclinations of the various States around Australia to generate the kind of consumer protection laws, which historically they have been so unwilling systematically to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The consumer protection provisions are set out in Part V of the Trade Practices Act. They prohibit, as we all know, unfair business practices such as misleading or deceptive conduct, false representations, bait advertising, coercion and harassment, pyramid selling and unsolicited goods or credit cards. They require compliance with product safety and information standards. They establish statutory warranties of quality, fitness, description and title in respect of goods supplied. In other words, they give consumers a shield against unacceptable practices and a sword with which to enforce their rights in transactions with those who possess greater economic power. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Trade Practices Commission now able to do about consumer protection? The answer is: Precious little. By a ministerial direction, binding in law, which was issued on 25 May 1981 and which is reproduced at paragraph 2.2.2 of the report the Commission is actually prohibited from investigating a possible breach of the consumer protection provisions in Division 1 of Part V of the Act unless it raises issues of national importance and the matter is brought to its attention by another person other than someone operating on the staff of the Commission. This directive obviously has the most serious consequences for the functioning of the Commission in this consumer protection area. As the Commission acknowledges in paragraphs 2.2.5 and 2.2.6 of the report the Commission must now be 'even more selective' in consumer protection investigation and enforcement and will not be able to engage in such activity on its own initiative. Reference to the schedule of cases currently being prosecuted-that is set out in Schedule IV, Part C of the report-shows how limited the activity already is. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps worst of all, this directive means a retreat down the road to non-uniformity of consumer protection. Put simply, the individual consumer whose case does not raise matters of national importance-me can imagine what a large percentage that will be-will be at the mercy of the State administration to which he is subject. As Commissioner Pengilley points out again in his minority report, State law in some cases is simply inadequate and, on any view, there is a substantial degree of non-uniformity between the law of the respective States. That ministerial directive effectively marks the abandonment of the goals of certainty and uniformity of consumer protection law generally which the 1974 Act sought to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> We note that this fundamental reordering of the Trade Practices Act has taken place by the back door; not by the Government publicly declaring its hand and amending the Act but by a ministerial directive. It is a miracle, I suppose, that the existence of that ministerial directive has at least come to light. It is also interesting to note that what is being achieved by this back-door method is precisely what the Opposition had in mind in 1974 when it opposed the consumer protection legislation. What it has resulted in is exactly what the now Government, the then Opposition, wanted it to become, namely, a State by State lottery for the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA> There is quite a number of other disturbing consequences of this cutback in consumer protection. All of them in the consumer protection work of the Commission are ably set out by Commissioner Pengilley in paragraph 3.6 on pages 141 to 144 of the main volume of his report. I do not need, particularly in light of the time, to repeat them. Finally let there be no mistake about what this Government is doing. By surreptitious financial and executive actions it is reducing the scope and efficacy of the Trade Practices Act. It is rendering the Act inoperative by degrees. In fact, it might even be described as a classic case of murder by degree, with each passing year seeing another drop of arsenic administered to the Trade Practices Commission's teacup. The next Labor Government will take immediate steps to restore the Act and the Commission which administers it to their full capacity and effectiveness. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate on the report of the Australian Electoral Office affords the Senate an opportunity to examine the deficiencies that obviously flow from the report. The report deals with a number of matters of a statistical nature but it does not deal objectively with the problems that confront the Parliament and the electors of this country so far as the Commonwealth Electoral Act is concerned. Of course the Government is aware of the deficiencies that exist in the Electoral Act. After the 1977 election the then Minister for Administrative Services, Mr McLeay, caused a report to be prepared. The preparation of that report took almost 18 months. It examined all of the features of the Act and its amendments from 1918 onwards. Subsequently that report was made available to the government of the day. For the Government's own reasons that report has not been made a public document so we do not know what it said, other than the general observation that has been made in the lobbies that the report is critical of the number of deficiencies that exist in the Commonwealth Electoral Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Subsequent to that the new Minister responsible, Mr Newman, following the appointment of Mr McLeay overseas, announced on 2 December 1980 that there would be a further review of the Australian Electoral Act. To our knowledge that report is still not available to the Parliament or to the Government, although in a letter of reply to me of 23 April-six months ago-Mr Newman, amongst a number of other things, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Questions relating to voting facilities and assistance for the disabled are among the matters being considered in my current review of the Commonwealth Electoral Act which is nearing completion. </PARA>
<PARA>So we have the statement of six months ago by the Minister that the second review of the Commonwealth Electoral Act was nearing completion. Here we are, coming towards the end of this session of Parliament, and still no information is available to us. As was the case with the first report and the report of the Harders Inquiry into Disclosure of Electoral Expenditure about which Senator Missen and I have asked at least three questions in this current session of Parliament, it has not been made available. We think it is treating the Parliament with contempt not to make available the work of the Department of Administrative Services and committees which have been charged with responsibilities concerning electoral reform in Australia. We can say that the situation surrounding the report of the Australian Electoral Office, insofar as it does not refer to the first report, insofar as there is no mention of the Harders committee report and insofar as there is no progress reported in respect of the second report conducted by Mr Newman, is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Electoral Office report provides us with some important figures and statistics. For example, it shows that 11.9 per cent of all electors in Australia do not vote at their subdivisional voting points; that postal votes, absentee votes and section votes now account for almost one-ninth of the formal votes cast. We have nine million voters and there is need for a review of the legislation to deal with such a dramatic change to the whole voting process. </PARA>
<PARA> The report makes reference to the large proportion of informal votes but makes no suggestions or recommendations to the Parliament about what should be done about the 9.65 per cent of votes cast in the last Senate elections that were recorded as informal, as wasted votes. The effectiveness of their votes was denied to almost 10 per cent of the people who voted in the last Senate elections. Surely that is a matter for the Parliament and a matter for the Government. It concerns the Opposition that these matters are still in limbo, that they are not receiving sufficient attention. Surely there is a need for a complete overhaul of postal voting requirements and a complete overhaul of the Act that deals with informal voting. Surely we can reach some agreement in the Parliament that as long as the intention of the voter is clear his vote should be regarded as an effective vote. </PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned about the people who are permanently incapacitated or disabled. We are concerned that the requirements of the Act prohibit many people, for a variety of reasons, from being able to record a postal vote, a section vote or an absentee vote. There is a need, therefore, for special steps to be taken in the review of the Commonwealth Electoral Act to enable all citizens of this country, wherever they are, to record effective votes. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcom Fraser) on 30 September last, over a year ago, promised to introduce legislation to change voluntary electoral enrolment for Aborigines to compulsory enrolment. Here we are a year later, with no further legislation projected in this session to overcome the difficulties that are apparent in the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Queensland in regard to the enrolment of Aborigines. We have seen some of the corruption in which some of those associated with the Government parties have been involved. They have attempted to impose restrictions, sanctions and discriminations against the right of Aborigines to be placed on the electoral roll. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is very concerned-there is no mention of this subject in the report-about the activities surrounding the habitation reviews and the steps that are taken willy-nilly, haphazardly, by the Australian Electoral Office to check on the enrolment and eligibility of voters. The Electoral Office has made available to me information that indicates that in the year to December 1980, 279,784 voters were disenfranchised, taken off the electoral roll as a result of the haphazard way in which the habitation reviews are carried out by the Australian Electoral Office. Because of staff ceilings they are not carried out in all the electorates; they are carried out whenever a decision is made by an electoral officer that part-time staff will go into a particular electorate to check to see whether people have moved from the area. Consequently, steps are taken to remove them from the roll. In this way some 280,000 people have been disenfranchised. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a matter about which we would want to have a great deal to say because the people who are being disenfranchised, the people who are being taken off the roll, are those who are looking for work and who are moving about, those who have difficulties with accommodation, migrants who are not in stable employment or in a stable environment and people who generally move about without necessarily having a permanent place of abode or a permanent position. They are taken off the electoral roll. </PARA>
<PARA> I will have more to say about that. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few minutes available to me I want to refer to the fact that the Commonwealth, in conducting elections for Christmas Island and Norfolk Island, has applied some important new principles in respect of Federal voting in this country. In both those elections the Australian Electoral Office made decisions to introduce multi-member constituencies and the principle of proportional representation, matters which are the subject of a paper I have had prepared for general debate in the Australian community. I find it interesting that the Government has applied those principles in respect of elections conducted on Christmas Island and Norfolk Island, taking on board the regulations framed by the Whitlam Government in 1975 in respect of the Australian Capital Territory relating to the means by which candidates here are elected to the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly. I understand that some arrangements have to be met by the Opposition in respect of the Government's legislative program and I therefore seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate on the annual report of the Commonwealth Electoral Office gives the Senate an opportunity to raise a number of the deficiencies that we in the Opposition believe exist in respect of voting procedures in our country. There is no mention in the report, for example, of the very important feature which is now operating in three of the States of our Commonwealth-that is, in Tasmania, South Australia and New South Wales. I refer to the system of optional preferential voting. This means, of course, that half of our country is operating under a system different from that operating nationally. That is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs because clearly electors are going to be confused. I would have imagined that a report from the Commonwealth Electoral Office to the National Parliament would at least pose questions for the Parliament in considering how to overcome the difficulties and deficiencies that obviously exist in our voting systems. Consequently, we can only say that a government that twice in the last four years has called for reports dealing with the Commonwealth Electoral Act and has failed to present them to the National Parliament must have an ulterior reason for not giving the Parliament the opportunity to discuss and debate these sorts of matters. Of course, it is in the interests of the conservative parties to have the community confused. It is clearly the young people, migrants and Aboriginals, some of whom are voting in the Australian system for the first time, who will make mistakes. They are the people who generally vote against the conservative parties and against conservative policies. They are disenfranchised as a result of the failure of our Federal Government, the Fraser Government, to rectify and simplify the whole voting processes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report gives us the statistics about informal voting. However, it gives us no recommendations on how to rectify this situation. It does not put forward steps that can be taken to rectify the position. Of course, it points to the obstinate and dogmatic attitude that was so much prevalent when you, Madam Acting Deputy President, were in this place on a previous occasion, when the Senate took the view that the lower House was not the place that ought to be supported in terms of its legislative program. In fact at that time before the Senate was legislation that would have simplified the whole electoral processes of this country. What were the issues six or seven years ago? What were the steps being freely talked about that ought to be taken to simplify the electoral processes in Australia? One proposal for the introduction of optional preferential voting had only one objective, namely, to make the vote more effective and reduce the informality of the vote by recognising that a vote was being cast in a certain direction even if a figure or two might have been transposed or improperly placed on the ballot paper. We said there was a need for a complete overhaul of postal voting and that a more efficient system should be operating. We said there was a need for a home ballot system for disabled persons, that there ought to be mobile polling booths visiting the homes of such voters. We said that there ought to be facilities available to people who are incapacitated in a variety of ways and may not be able even to apply for a postal vote because of the nature of their infirmity. We said the subdivisions should be eliminated so that we do not have the problem of people having to vote in the district in which they perhaps once lived, so that a vote is an effective vote wherever it is cast within the division itself. We said that there was a need to carry out a public education campaign. I think that need is even more pressing today, given the different voting processes which now exist in the States. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise again the very deep concern that the Opposition has about the way in which the Commonwealth Electoral Office is forced because of the Electoral Act itself to carry out what is known as habitation reviews. It can be said that the provision in the Commonwealth Electoral Act which allows an officer from the Commonwealth Electoral Office to go at random to an electorate and carry out a review to see that electors still reside at the address stipulated on the electoral roll is justified. But the facts are that in one year 280,000 people have had their names removed from the role because of habitation reviews that are carried out informally, haphazardly and in a random sort of way. The Opposition takes a very strong view about this. It believes that the Act needs to be amended, given the changes that have taken place in our society, the great mobility of people, the fact that people move from one electorate to another, from one State to another, often in search of work, often for a whole variety of personal and other reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> We stand by the view that once an elector has registered his name should stay on the roll, that the onus of proof should rest on the Commonwealth and not on the individual to place back on the role a name that has been removed. The only time a name should be removed from the role is when there is death, permanent overseas residency, serious criminal conviction or some mental institutionalising. The onus to establish residency of the elector should be on the Electoral Office. What happens, of course, is that the Electoral Office puts a card under the front door or in the letter box of a house if a next door neighbour or some disgruntled person makes a complaint or an allegation, and unless that card is replied to the name of the person is removed from the roll. The fact is that 280,000 people were denied a vote in the last elections because of this process. Yet, these matters are not even referred to in the report of the Australian Electoral Office with which we are asked to deal. I make no criticism of the Chief Australian Electoral Officer. I know, as I have stated in this place, that he has made two reports to the Australian Government but that those reports have not been published. They have been suppressed, and the Parliament and the Australian people have received no explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally I want briefly to deal with the question to which I was referring before the suspension of the sitting in relation to the background paper that I prepared in respect of these matters, as well as to the establishment of a different voting system in this country, a system based on multi-member constituencies, a system based on proportional representation and a system which would make one vote one value effective in the way in which our parliamentary democracy operates in this country. This system operates in many parts of the world and, strangely enough, in the legislative councils of New South Wales and South Australia. It has operated in local government in New South Wales since 1941 with five and three member constituencies on the basis of proportional representation. The system was introduced by the Whitlam Government for the election of the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly. As I was saying, it is a system that this Government has introduced in respect of the elections at Christmas Island where an advisory council has been established. </PARA>
<PARA> The day after I made available publicly the background paper on electoral law reform, a courier from the Prime Minister's office was on my office steps seeking a copy of that report. It is interesting that the Liberal Party has made no comment about the suggestions that we have put forward for party consideration. It is interesting to note that at Christmas Island this Government has in fact applied the very self same principles of that report to the election of the advisory council. The same applies in respect of the elections at Norfolk Island. One can only say that there is some merit in the system and that it is not way out, radical or revolutionary. It operates in a great number of countries and is already in application in parts of the parliaments of our country. The Hare Clark system has operated in Tasmania since 1907. </PARA>
<PARA> One would imagine, therefore, that in this report there would be some comment about the need for the Parliament to be looking at improving the existing voting processes as well as looking at other voting procedures. One can only say that the report is valuable insofar as it tells us statistically how many people vote in Australia and how many informal votes there are. It tells us that the Government is considering compulsory enrolment for Aborigines rather than the present voluntary system which has been corrupted by the Liberal Party in Western Australian and the Northern Territory, and we know all of the problems which have accrued in those two States, particularly in Western Australia, about Aboriginal enrolments. But quite clearly the Government is prepared to allow the Electoral Act to remain in its present form and not take steps to modernise and simplify it in a way that will enable every vote, whether it is cast in Tamworth, Turramurra or Toongabbie, in my own State, to have the same value. Currently we have an inbuilt situation where the seat of Werriwa in New South Wales has more than 90,000 people on the electoral roll and, within a stone's throw, the seat of Grayndler has 67,000 people, a difference of some 23,000. No action has been taken by this Government to bring about some equity in a redistribution to overcome the difficulties which exist in my State in respect of those figures and similarly in the States of Queensland, Western Australia and Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not satisfied with the report. We make no criticism of the officer who has to present a report within the confines of the responsibility of the office, but we are critical that the Government has not seen fit to direct the Commonwealth Electoral Office to deal with the matters which are obviously pertinent and relevant to a modernisation of our Commonwealth Electoral Act and the voting systems that flow from it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The report of the Tertiary Education Commission in relation to the establishment of a university in the Northern Territory I believe requires at least some statement to be made in this chamber. It is an extremely important report concerned with higher education in the Northern Territory which is the type of development likely to ensue in the foreseeable future. I agree totally with the recommendations in the report. I believe that it is a well balanced projection of the possibilities that the Northern Territory has in higher education. The report comes down not in support of the Northern Territory Government in relation to the establishment of a university, but does not cut off the possibility of the establishment of that university when the population is at sufficient level to warrant it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I emphasise one major point in the report, and that is the point dealing with the Darwin Community College. The Darwin Community College was the first major attempt in Australia to establish a different type of tertiary institution, one which was able in fact to cope with what are generally called post-secondary and technical courses, courses which are in other States looked after by colleges of advanced education and universities. The Darwin Community College, I believe, deserves support in terms of that type of experimentation and development because I believe it is a model. Although it has been subjected to a fair degree of criticism in terms of its development, nevertheless it does present to Australia a possible model of educational establishments that we could make use of in future. I believe the Darwin Community College would have been a far better model to have pursued than many of the developments that are currently taking place under the Technical and Further Education Commission such as its development of colleges of one kind or another. I see the Darwin Community College as a desirable development within Australia. It is one which is economical in terms of its expenditure and scale and yet is able to provide for a community with a small population a high standard of post-secondary education. </PARA>
<PARA> The further point that the report makes in terms of strengthening the North Australian Research Unit of the Australian National University is also welcomed, I believe, because it provides the opportunity for the Northern Territory to establish in due course a university on a traditional model. I believe that must eventually come. One point that does need to be made-it is a point which was raised in debate in the Northern Territory on this aspect-concerns the fact that a number of people saw the establishment in the Northern Territory of its own university in terms of the prestige that would flow to the Territory. Whilst accepting that such prestige is important to local communities, and certainly to a community that is moving rapidly to statehood, I nevertheless believe that to proceed to the establishment of a university with prestige being its sole support would be a bad type of precedent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Darwin Community College and the North Australian Research Unit will, between them, adequately cover all of those areas that realistically and economically could be established at the present time in the Northern Territory. I think the people of the Northern Territory themselves are quite happy with this type of arrangement. Obviously it is not to the liking of the Northern Territory Government. Nevertheless I think it is not possible for the Australian community to foot the bill for an additional university in an area where the population is so small. Indeed, if the Northern Territory were able to argue successfully for a university at this time, many major cities in this country would be able to put a stronger case. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point I want to make is that since the Government has come down on the side of not establishing a university-I support that decision-I believe there is one further step that it needs to take, and that is to give to students from the Northern Territory support to enable them to study courses which are not offered in the Northern Territory but which are offered at other universities throughout Australia. I believe the Government needs to look at assisting the Northern Territory Government to provide slightly more generous bursaries and scholarships than other States are able to provide from their funds to enable students who have the capacity and the calibre to undertake a variety of courses to do so at other universities. I believe it would not be beyond the bounds of propriety to make it a requirement of those bursaries and scholarships that some undertaking be given by their recipients that they will return to the Northern Territory for at least a limited period to provide to the Territory a strengthening of its technical, professional and economic base. I believe this type of report does credit to the people who initiated it. It also enables the Northern Territory to move forward to statehood with a firm foundation in tertiary education. I look forward to the time when the growth which is currently taking place in the Northern Territory will enable the Territory to have a university which will take its place among the other universities in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters is, I believe, worthy of comment in this chamber. To date the Authority has accredited some 1,053 people at three levels and in ten languages. In the last year precedence has been given to major community languages in this country, apart from English of course, namely, Arabic, Croatian, Greek, Italian, Serbian, Spanish, Turkish and Vietnamese. The 1980 annual report states that candidates have criticised the Authority's tests, particularly its use of language laboratories. The Authority has said that from now on more tests will be given on a face to face basis instead of reliance on language laboratories. The Authority is also seeking to encourage governmental and educational authorities to establish short term coaching courses to enable prospective candidates to improve or refine their interpreting and translation skills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The absence of such courses, in the Authority's opinion, is a factor preventing applicants for accreditation by test achieving better results at their first attempt. One can only praise the Authority for taking this line of action to improve the training of interpreters in this country. This need was reinforced by the report called 'Catalysts for a Multicultural Society', which in June of this year recommended that the Commonwealth and State governments work together with tertiary bodies to ensure that the National Accreditation Authority for Translaters and Interpreters level 2 and level 3 courses are made available in languages which are most needed in the community. It recommended also that adequate allowances be paid to those taking the courses, that employing bodies provide study leave to enable staff members to take such courses and that employing bodies offer in-service training. I think we would all like to know what positive response the Government has made to these constructive recommendations. These recommendations, if carried out, could only assist in the assimilation and settlement of new settlers in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> As from now, presumably as a result of pressure from the Government in pursuit of what it calls its user pays principle-one might say it is an obsession-one wonders whether fees will be levied on candidates for accreditation. Certainly the Opposition is unhappy about this principle which the National Accreditation Authority in its report appears to accept on the basis that a professional self-regulatory body will in fact replace the Authority. I do not believe that most of our migrant translators are in the same economic bracket as people in the Australian Medical Association or the legal professional bodies. I would certainly deeply regret it if otherwise qualified people were prevented from receiving accreditation because of a high fee. I believe it is something the Government should keep in mind. It should ensure that there is no restriction on the training and accreditation of interpreters and translators because of this. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Authority's report in 1979 it was proposed that the National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters should extend its responsibilities to accreditation of interpreters in Aboriginal languages. It is a great pity that it has not done so to date, though it claims it will take this responsibility over in 1981. As we have only the 1980 report before us we do not know whether in the previous nine months of this year this project has been started. There are Aboriginal liaison officers in the Northern Territory and other areas with large Aboriginal populations who are trying to do a very difficult job in overseeing the welfare of Aboriginals in remote and distant areas. Anyone who visits such areas, particularly Alice Springs, will know the difficulties that these people face. The tragedy is that most of the officers do not speak Aboriginal languages. Their task would be simplified and the need of the Aboriginal people better met if they had with them, or could use on an easily contactable basis, accredited interpreters who not only know the language but also know the system they would be trying to interpret for those people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Accreditation Authority has also been approached to accredit persons in sign language for the deaf. So far it has thought it inappropriate to do this, although I am pleased to see that discussions are still continuing. If the Accreditation Authority will not or cannot do it the Government, and particularly the Department of Social Security and the Department of Education, should make good this deficiency. The profoundly deaf have been left out of what is called the communication explosion. There ought to be a body which takes responsibility for ensuring that, as much as possible, young and adult deaf people receive interpreting help, that as much sign language as is practicable is shown on television programs and that a good deal more help is given to these people in negotiating their way through our government bureaucracies in particular. I hope the discussions with various authorities on this matter are resolved very soon. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a new approach from the Independent and Multicultural Broadcasting Corporation to test sub-titlers. This is a good move but I suspect it is mainly for English speakers. The Authority report has an appendix giving a breakdown of the number of accredited translators and interpreters and their names by State. This is of assistance. The appendix also gives the Authority's objectives of which the first is to:</PARA>
<PARA> Establish the standards and conditions leading to professional status, and in so doing developing translating and interpreting in Australia to meet community needs. </PARA>
<PARA>To this end the Authority is charged with a number of tasks which include monitoring changing needs for the interpreter-translator services throughout Australia to enable the meeting of these important community needs. I am afraid though that there is minimal information in this report as to how successfully these objectives are being achieved. For instance, it would be useful to know how many of these translator and interpreters are in government service, particularly in the crucial areas of police, welfare and health. Perhaps this information could be included in next year's report. I believe it is important that we have independent translators in these areas. One remembers that when the so-called social security fraud case featured prominently in this place one of the repeated complaints was that the interpreters were frequently the police officers, or associates of the police, who in fact were doing the investigations-hardly a situation in which justice is seen to be done. Neither police officials nor social security officers are amongst the groups with which the Authority said it had consulted in 1980 in spite of the importance and the urgency of migrant needs in these areas in these difficult times. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally I will quote from the report I mentioned earlier titled 'Catalysts for a Multicultural Society' dealing with interpreter services in Australia. The report commented on recent government policies. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the right of the non-English speaking person to interpreter/translator services was gaining general community acceptance in recent years . . . this acceptance is now being eroded by the Government's recent policy changes which among other changes encouraged a 'fee for service' approach for service delivery. This approach is totally contrary to the original thrust of the developments designed to meet the needs of those non-English speaking persons, in the Australian community, disadvantaged by the lack of interpreter/ translator facilities in community services. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Spiro Moraitis from Melbourne is quoted as expressing the fear that the interpreter-translator services would return to the 1960s situation. He summed up the current situation as a 'struggle in a sea of apathy'. The information needs of migrants have been categorised in the Galbally and the Scott reports. They have been detailed and we know the sort of problems being faced. We have to face the fact that if we are going to have the successful multicultural society so many people want, if we are going to have satisfactory settlement of non-English speakers in this country, we must act on these needs that have been now well documented. I believe the Government has taken minimal steps to meet these needs and went backwards as a result of the razor gang report on cutting out publications, restricting the telephone interpreter service, instituting charges for translators and other actions taken in this area. These services, together with readily available interpreter-translator services, are essential to the successful settlement of new settlers. I do not think anyone will disagree with that. </PARA>
<PARA> Rapid action needs to be taken to ensure that all proper assistance is available for non-English speaking members of the community not only in the area of justice, social security and education but also increasingly in the areas of medicine and the sorts of areas that English speakers take as readily available and have ready information on. Together with the recommendations in 'Catalysts for a Multicultural Society', this third annual report of the Accreditation Authority gives an opportunity for the Government to revise recent policies and broaden and hasten policies which show a real commitment to assist our non-English speaking migrants. Unless we do this we will add further to the divisions in our society. Unless we do this we could make second class citizens of a large group of people whom we attracted to this country who have contributed much already and who will contribute much to this country in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Advisory Council for the Handicapped has produced in 1981 its fourth annual report. I note that the report was presented to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) on 3 April this year and has now been tabled in the Senate some five and a half months later. I suggest this is a delay which is particularly significant as this is the International Year of Disabled Persons. It is a delay for which no explanation has been given in the presenting statement. The report is twice the length, but I suggest it has half the bite, of its immediate predecessor. There is a noticeable muting of the sense of urgency that pervaded the third report, which was presented in 1979. That was a report which caused considerable discussion among those interested in the matter. One is tempted to wonder whether the Council is beginning to realise that the Minister and the Government in fact take very little notice of its recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report is full of general rather than specific material which certainly does not reflect the priorities that have been established by disabled people this year. They have been stressing through direct contact and through their organisations the need to compensate them for the extra costs of disability and to make independent living a real option. Disability is a very expensive life- style. Our country, which is to sign the international covenant, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons, has a duty to its disabled citizens to ensure that they have the opportunity to take as full a part in our society as they can. </PARA>
<PARA> These issues are covered in the section that follows 'Prevention' in the report. I suggest that on this occasion the recommendations are disappointingly weak and general. Disabled people have been hoping for action as a result of the work on income security by the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled. Instead they have here a recommendation that there should be more research into the extra costs of disability. This pushes the possibility of action even further into the future and is certainly disappointing in the International Year of Disabled Persons. </PARA>
<PARA> On employment, the Council notes that disabled people registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service have less than a one-in-five chance of a job as against the one-in-three chance of the non-disabled person. In the face of this, their sole recommendation, that governments stick behind the National Employment Strategy for Handicapped program, is empty in the absence of some provision for the evaluation of that program. Are we really sure as a parliament and as a country that we just want more of the same? In fact, the strategy that is being pursued by the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs is designed to segregate rather than to integrate. Disabled people are being trained in special rather than existing courses and the jobs at the end will inevitably acquire a stigma. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) notes that the Government is trying to give a lead in a program of equal opportunity by providing such opportunities in the Public Service, and I hope that the position in his own Department has improved since I asked a question some time ago about the number of wheelchair users on his staff. On 17 April 1980 the then Minister answered that it was a mere seven for the whole country. I welcome the recommendation that the income test free earnings limit for the sheltered employment allowance be increased. This, and the recommendations concerning regular adjustment, do reflect the demands of the field, and I would like to think that they would be implemented or at least seriously considered. </PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to read the report without the knowledge of all that has happened or has failed to happen in the five and half months since its completion. The Provision of Aids for the Disabled Scheme began belatedly in four States and is already regarded as little short of a disaster in at least one. The Government has retained the unjust, albeit reduced, tariff on imported wheelchairs, and the Australian Bureau of Statistics survey of handicapped people has found even more handicapped people in the country than the previous estimate of 10 per cent. It claims, in fact that there are 1,200,000 such people. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of this, the National Advisory Council for the Handicapped document fails to reflect the urgency with which the Government should address the problems of 12 per cent of the community. Most significantly in the International Year of Disabled Persons, no resounding commitment is made to the fact that disabled people are the real experts on disability and should be moving at the fastest possible rate to take charge of their own affairs. We still consult too little those who are directly involved. We still leave too many disabled dependent on non-disabled groups in the community which, well-meaning though they may be, do not consult sufficiently. The Government does not consult sufficiently, and the community has a long way to go before it accepts the disabled in the manner that it should. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to express my disappointment this year in the Advisory Council's report and hope that it is not being reduced to a mere cipher because the Government has ignored its reports in the past, or from a sense of hopelessness because of the apparent failure of the Government to be interested in this area. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate is of the opinion that legislation should be introduced urgently to provide for payments under the Compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Act to be restored to the 1974 levels, with annual indexation to apply subsequently to those amounts. </PARA>
<PARA>Since I have been shadow Minister for Social Security in the Senate, this motion has been a hardy perennial. It arises from the Government's attitude to the compensation paid to its own injured employees. Payments to ex-employees of the Commonwealth who had suffered injury or breakdown of health in its service were indexed annually until the Fraser Government came to power. We ask that legislation be brought down to guarantee at least annual indexation of those payments. If the Senate should wish to increase that to twice-yearly, or even quarterly, indexation in line with pension increases, the Opposition would certainly not oppose it, but I and my colleagues believe that indexation should take place at least annually. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in the short term it is important that such an annual increase be introduced. The Fraser Government, on coming to power in 1975, cancelled the increase which was due in that year and provided no increases at all between 1976 and 1979, when it granted a 12 per increase to compensate for a period when the cost of living had increased by more than 36 per cent. On 1 September the Government increased the standard weekly compensation payment to $114. I assume that it will remain at that level until September 1982 or even longer. That figure is $13.89, or almost $14 a week, less than the compensation victim would be getting if the payment had been indexed to the 1974 level. </PARA>
<PARA> In July of this year the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) said, in answer to question on notice No. 664, that the estimated cost of raising Commonwealth compensation payments to 84 per cent of the minimum wage in the last financial year had been $3,500,000. To raise payments to the 1974 level in this financial year, which is what we have asked for in this motion, would cost the Commonwealh Government no more than $4m, or about one-third of the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people, such as Defence Force reservists, are now receiving more favourable treatment under the Compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Act, and we certainly do not quarrel with that. The position of Commonwealth employees in dangerous overseas postings has raised again the adequacy of compensation payments for those in government employ. Doubtless it has been raised recently in the case of the injury to Mr John Woods of the Department of Foreign Affairs during the assassination of President Sadat of Egypt. The late Tony Joyce of the Australian Broadcasting Commission was covered only by the provisions of this Act, but in that case an ex gratia payment was made to his widow. This is an unsatisfactory arrangement in the compensation region, as has been known for a long time. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Keeffe says, the ex gratia payment was pretty meagre considering the situation. This motion seeks to draw attention to the inadequacy of the compensation payments and to the present random approach to the cost of living increases to those payments. The current Government practice of increasing these compensation payments by regulation instead of by parliamentary legislation has in the past two years seen increases in the standard rates. It is not necessarily the case that injured ex-Commonwealth workers will get the continued increases unless there is, in fact, legislation. What this motion is trying to get over is a situation in which the Government becomes tight-fisted, as it did in the late 1970s, and refuses to give any increases at all over a period of years, as happened from 1975 to 1979. It is important that compensation victims are truly compensated for the cost of living rises which occur once they are invalided out of the Commonwealth Public Service or indeed out of any service. It is important that they are assured by legislation that they will receive increases to cope with the cost of living rises. In the early 1970s the Senate committee on national compensation commented on the present assortment of State and Commonwealth schemes. The committee's report stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clear that the compensation systems are random in their coverage, often provide inadequate compensation and can give rise to inequities. The Committee is concerned that existing social service benefits for sickness are inadequate and that compensation for injuries is effectively limited to work-caused injuries suffered by employees, to some victims of highway accidents who can establish fault in other persons . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Senators Chaney, Button, Missen and I took part in that inquiry. I am sure we would all agree that the situation has not improved since then. In fact, in some ways, it has got worse. There is a serious need, therefore, to re-examine the whole compensation system, particularly the question of a national compensation scheme, and whether there is a basis for the fault elements which play such an important part in the awards. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government last met with State Ministers in April 1976 regarding a national compensation scheme and then gave away the whole idea. But it needs to be looked at again. The matter requires careful consideration. The present compensation system is far too random. Factors such as where a person lives, how a person received an injury and how and when settlements take place in the courts influence tremendously the amount that will be received and the adequacy of the compensation. It is important to put some regularity and equity, as well as adequacy, into the system of payments. I suggest that this can only be done nationally, and in consultation with the States and the union movement. It is certainly difficult but the problems are not insuperable. New Zealand, under a Conservative Party Government, introduced a national compensation scheme. It should not be beyond the wit of this country to do so. I suggest that it does not make sense to throw the towel in, as was done in 1976. In the meantime it is important that workers who have spent their service, sometimes all of their working lives, with the Commonwealth, should not be financially penalised because they have worked for the Commonwealth. Their payments should be restored to the 1974 figure, which was considered an adequate figure, and adjusted annually. It is one of the best ways in which the Government can spend an extra $4m-a pittance in the total budgetary context. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for this reason that the Opposition has put this motion on the Notice Paper. It is again to draw attention to the fact that people under the Compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Act receive payments at the whim of a government. The payments are at risk if a government comes in with restrictive financial policies, as this one did for five years. Those people should not be placed in that situation. We must ensure that we do not create a similar situation to that which existed from 1975 to 1979, when there were no increases and these people were asked to bear more than their fair share of the burden of the Government's economic policies. For this reason I urge the Government to reconsider the situation and to restore some justice to this group of people for whom it is directly responsible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Grimes, in relation to Commonwealth compensation payments. I wish to quote from a number of paragraphs contained in a letter written by one of my constituents. The letter was addressed to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) and was dated 5 October 1981. I wonder why the Minister has left the chamber. I must say that he showed very little interest in what Senator Grimes was saying. This letter is not a private document. I have handed a copy to the shadow Minister for Social Security. The first paragraph of the letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Reference your News Release FC 81/49 of 19.8.'81 it is noted that the overall increase in rates is approximately 8.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to ask the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA> Would you please explain why the increase is less than the CPI of 9.4 per cent?</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose that one might go further and ask why the increase was not at least equivalent to the inflation rate of between 10 per cent and 12 per cent which existed at that time. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Particularly in the Year of the Disabled, one would have expected that a more generous attitude would have been adopted and a more meaningful adjustment have been made. </PARA>
<PARA>As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate has pointed out, there has been an erosion of benefits since the election of the first Fraser Government. Next year is the year of the tree. If the Fraser Government is still in office one can imagine the magnificent reaction of planting ring-barked trees so that water and fertiliser are not required to keep them going. I am quite sure that the Government will save money wherever it can. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The second paragraph of your News Release makes an attempt to make the government's decision appear a generous one by pretending that Commonwealth benefits continue to compare favourably with similar benefits payable under State and Territory workers compensation Codes; this, as you must know is, in general terms, simply not true. </PARA>
<PARA>I know that we cannot use that three-letter word 'lie'. My constituent has been well coached by me so he said 'simply not true'. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> However, even if this were true, comparison with State compensation provisions is rather meaningless. It may at best prove that the Commonwealth Government is less mean than others, but is mean just the same. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know where the Minister is at the moment. It is 9 o'clock, which is probably his coffee time. I hope that he will find a spare five minutes in which to reply to the letter. As far as I know, to date my constituent has not had an acknowledgement of receipt of his letter, let alone a reply to his complaint. The letter further states:</PARA>
<PARA> Just how mean the Commonwealth Government is in the matter of compensation for its employees, may probably best be demonstrated when one considers that on 1.9.77; 1.9.78 till 1.9.79 no adjustment to rates were made at all. </PARA>
<PARA>This occurred at about the time when we were endeavouring, through the ordinary pension rates, to get some sort of indexation restored. I suppose the Government can justify its inability to make those adjustments over that period because of the extreme economic situation in which Mr Fraser found himself. My constituent's last remark is:</PARA>
<PARA> So, please, spare the public hypocritical statements on the Government's generosity. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Budget Speech the Government was very vocal in praising itself for its implementation of compensation payments, pensions and various other handouts that it was making under the Acts associated with the Social Services Act. I suggest that the statements made tonight by Senator Grimes are absolutely and utterly true and that it is time for the Government to take a good look at some of its own legislation and some of its own payments in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> My constituent, who I am sure is one of the most honest people I have ever met, has set out the details in a number of documents on this occasion and on previous occasions. He is not one of those people who sit down and wait for something to happen, as the Prime Minister of this country appears to do. Apparently the same sort of attitude has now been adopted by the Minister for Social Security. He sits and waits for something to happen. Whatever complaints we might have had about Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle at least there were times when she made things move. The current Minister is apparently incapable of moving anything at all and he is certainly not capable of increasing pension rates, particularly in the Commonwealth compensation field. I hope that the few words I have added to the debate tonight have helped. I threatened the Deputy Government Whip that if I was not allowed to speak for five minutes now I would speak for an hour in the adjournment debate. I conclude on that point. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate notes with concern the rising rate of unemployment amongst girls and women as documented in the Myers Report on Technological Change and the failure of the Fraser Government to take specific steps to train women and girls for the changed job market. </PARA>
<PARA>At this stage of the parliamentary sitting I do not pretend that this evening I will be able to do justice to the subject I have raised. We have a crisis in women's unemployment in this country, a crisis which is not even being acknowledged, let alone addressed, by the Fraser Government. In the six years I have been in this place the situation in relation to women's employment has deteriorated month after month. Yet, not once have I heard a Minister of this Government acknowledge and propose any remedies for this situation. Indeed, a number of economic strategies which the Fraser Government is pursuing in a whole range of areas seems to be having the direct effect of creating even more female unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> Women in this country are being forced into dependence either on a spouse or on the state. As I speak about three million Australians are living on benefits and the majority of those are women. The majority of women living on benefits are either unemployed or living on the supporting mothers' benefit. Of those women living on the supporting mothers' benefit very many, perhaps the majority, would be in employment if appropriate employment were available, if they had the opportunity to train for employment and, to speak of perhaps a most basic inadequacy in the Fraser Government's provision of public services, if there were proper child care services for their children so that they could be free to go to work. This is a very serious matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last six years we have seen a number of economic strategies which are creating a huge and growing class of permanently dependent people, most of whom are women. We do not argue against the payment of a supporting mothers' benefit. Indeed, it was the Whitlam Labor Government which introduced it. What we on this side of the chamber are increasingly alarmed about is that women who are forced into unemployment or who are responsible alone for the care and development of children are being forced to live the life of a pensioner. There is decreasing opportunity for any woman in this country to move from a position of dependence to independence and that, I believe, is a crisis in itself. The scope of the crisis widens daily. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very many months since the report of the Myers Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia was tabled in this place. Yet, to date, there has not been an adequate consideration of this report by the Government. It is a most crucial report because it documents in convincing detail the changes that have taken place in the structure of our economy as a result of the introduction of new technology-those changes which have specifically led to unemployment or underemployment in a number of areas. Many of those areas, as was documented in the report, are traditional areas of female employment. I have been critical publicly and in this place of the amount of attention paid in the Myers report to the consequences of technological change for women. However, I must endorse its conclusion. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> In summary then the adverse employment effects of technological change tend to fall disproportionately on particular groups in the community (women, youth, immigrants and the aged) and the beneficial effects are best able to be enjoyed by other groups (the more highly educated and the more mobile adapative and retrainable workers). </PARA>
<PARA>The report came to another very important conclusion which has been totally ignored by the Government. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee sees it as being the role of governments to ensure that benefits accruing from technological change are equitably distributed among all members of the community, both in and out of the workforce, and that the costs incurred in pursuit of these benefits are likewise equitably distributed. </PARA>
<PARA>All I can say in response to that conclusion is that the Fraser Government has done absolutely nothing to ensure that women do not bear a disproportionate share of the cost while missing out on the benefits. Both of those things are, in fact, happening. If we look at the unemployment rates for women we see how disproportionately the effects of technological change are affecting the female employment market. Unemployment among women and girls is consistently higher than it is among men. The latest figures show that 7.1 per cent of the female work force compared with 4.7 per cent of the male work force is unemployed. Female youth unemployment figures are appalling. In August 18.3 per cent of females aged between 15 years and 19 years were out of work compared with 11.8 per cent of males in the same age group. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at migrant women we find rates which are very much worse. Of course, when we get to the stage of looking at employment opportunities for Aboriginal women we see that they hardly exist in this country. Because so many women are ineligible for unemployment benefit and therefore do not register, the unemployment situation is actually much worse than is indicated in the statistics. A recent assessment by a Sydney University economist, Dr Margaret Power, shows that on her calculations probably the real rate of female unemployment is double the measured rate. Yet we hear nothing from the Government in response to this. </PARA>
<PARA> Another disturbing trend in the female work force is the growing substitution of part time jobs for full time jobs. There was a time when women interested in promoting the employment status of women in the community argued the case for more part time employment. Indeed, I have argued that case myself under certain circumstances. Certainly, while ever child care is so hard to come by and while ever women continue to have to bear the full domestic duties as well as work force duties, part time work is an option that can be of assistance to some women. But in recent years we have not been seeing the development of beneficial part time work with all the benefits of permanency; we have been seeing, in fact, the abolition of full time permanent employment for women and the substitution of casual employment. </PARA>
<PARA> By casual employment I mean employment which may be a few hours a week. It may be 20 hours a week. It is paid by the hour. There are no proper entitlements such as holiday pay, sick pay, superannuation, long service leave or anything of that kind. Women are simply being called on to work for as many hours as is profitable for the employer and are sent home without pay for the rest of the week. This is happening at the expense of permanent, proper employment-not in addition to it. Because of the unemployment market the campaign to have permanent benefits for part time work has not been very successful. There has been very modest progress towards that objective in the public sector and hardly any progress in the private sector. What is happening, as I have said and as has been documented in a number of areas, including the Myers report, is that employers are simply sacking their women employees and taking on casuals. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of the casualisation of the female work force is a form of age-ism which is creeping into employer practice in this country. Not only are full time jobs being abolished with part time jobs replacing them but also employers are anxious wherever possible to employ the youngest female school leavers, the 15 and 16-year-olds, in these jobs. Why? Because they attract the lowest rates of pay. When these 15 and 16-year-old girls turn 17 or 18 years of age and become eligible for a higher rate of pay, what happens? I know very well that in my own electorate-I am sure many honourable senators in this place can back me up-the employers sack them and take on a new group of employees that they can employ at the lowest possible rate. This is the reality of what is happening in the female labour market in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I must remind honourable senators that it is quite pertinent to speak in terms of the female labour market because we still have a sex-segregated labour force in this country. Despite the efforts of the Whitlam Government and despite the efforts of some State governments in introducing anti-discrimination legislation and equal employment policies within the public sector, we still have a sex-segregated employment market. That means that the lowest paid, unskilled, least sought after jobs are the jobs available to women. The high-paid jobs, the jobs that attract on-the-job training, promotion opportunities, security and so forth, are the jobs that men get, speaking in very general terms. The mobility of women from the female labour force to the male labour force in the last six years has been at an absolutely minimal level. Even in the public sector, the figures put out by the Public Service Board for the Commonwealth Public Service indicate that the number of women who have changed from Fourth Division jobs into Third or even Second Division jobs is absolutely minute and almost statistically insignificant. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact that the female labour force is growing in crude numbers there has been very little desegregation of the labour force and indeed there is now a new kind of sex-segregtion in the labour force which is not only segregation between the low-paid unskilled jobs for women and the high-paid promotion oriented jobs for men but also it is between casual employment, which is for women, and permanent employment, which is for men. This situation has been getting worse and worse and yet no Minister responsible for employment in this Government has even acknowledged that it is happening. A total of 36 per cent of the female work force is now in part time or casual employment. Seventy per cent of women part time workers are married and 55 per cent are aged between 25 and 44 years-the time when child care responsibilities are heaviest. It is quite clear that women with family responsibilities are moving into casual employment with inferior conditions and that they are doing this because of the lack of proper child care services. </PARA>
<PARA> These developments do have a lot to do with technological change, as documented in the Myers report, because technological change has been eroding those areas of employment which have been female areas. The clerical areas, of course, are very susceptible to the new technology. Word processors, computers and all that kind of technology may create jobs for some people but they are not creating jobs for women; they are destroying jobs for women. It is very easy to be slick and to look at the overall change in the job market while ignoring the sex-segregated aspects of it and to say that the new technology is bringing all these benefits such as improved efficiency in business and things of that kind. Certainly it is to an extent, and certainly the Australian Labor Party wants to see improved efficiency in business. We want to see profitability increase and we want to see development in entrepreneurial activities throughout this country, but where women's jobs are being eroded we also want to see appropriate government action to ensure that those women who are discarded by the introduction of new technology are given other employment options. It is certainly not happening at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Myers committee of inquiry received a number of very interesting submissions which documented exactly how technological change is eroding women's jobs. I would like to refer briefly to some of those. The Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations and the Australian Council of Trade Unions submissions pointed out that technological change will allow the banking and insurance sector to cut staff by between 30 per cent and 40 per cent in 10 years. Experience in overseas banking systems has demonstrated that this is inevitable. New technology has already cut jobs in these sectors by 150,000 and, of course, most of the jobs which have disappeared have been women's jobs. The Westaff temporary employment agency told the Myers committee that word processors have taken over the jobs of more than 20,000 typists in Sydney alone. The Commonwealth Bank said that computerisation will cut staff by 2,000 after allowing for the employment of 700 staff. Despite the documentation that the Myers committee received we have had virtually no response from the Government except for the tired old expression of the pious hope that somehow the economy will be all brought right if we get enough new technology to do it. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, my concern is not specifically that the jobs are disappearing but that no other job opportunities are being created. We are not going to argue that unproductive kinds of employment should be retained in this country but we do argue and advocate that there should be a national employment policy, a national labour force policy, whereby changes in the work force, such as the ones to which I have been referring which affect women, are properly monitored and documented, that new areas of employment are discovered and identified and that training schemes with proper allowances, proper opportunities, child care and whatever is necessary, are provided for the displaced workers. The Whitlam Labor Government attempted to institute something of this kind when it instituted the National Employment and Training Scheme. I think that scheme was a fairly rudimentary kind of national training scheme. I would not defend it in every detail but I am sure that had we stayed in office longer we would have refined it and made it a more focused, more effective tool of management of the employment market. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the present Government has dismantled most of the effective aspects of the NEAT Scheme and has replaced it with a number of schemes which are not training schemes at all; they are really just employer subsidy schemes. They are really just handouts to employers to encourage them to take on employees that they might otherwise have been reluctant to take on. What sort of training takes place, whether the training is appropriate to the labour market and whether any training takes place at all is entirely up to the employer. The schemes are not monitored. I have sought, and I think other honourable senators in this place have sought, year after year with questions on notice to find out what kind of scrutiny the Government engages in to see whether training is taking place under these employer subsidy schemes. We have got very little result for our trouble. Basically the Government hands over the money to the employers and asks no further questions. As a result, very little training is taking place and certainly training that would assist women to re-equip themselves for the changed structure of the labour market hardly exists. </PARA>
<PARA> Our criticisms of the Government in this case are quite general. I would say that in view of the current trends in work force requirements the Government has failed entirely to come up with an appropriate training policy. Since 1975-76- the last year of the Whitlam Government-government spending on employment and training has fallen by 44 per cent in real terms. The majority of training programs which the Government has funded have not been based on the fundamental manpower principle; that is, channelling people away from areas where there is a contracting demand for labour into areas where there is an expanding demand for labour. This failure creates situations such as the one which currently exists in the Department of Defence. Because the Department has drastically reduced the training of technical officers, over $1m is now being spent to bring engineers, technical officers and other skilled personnel from Britain. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that of some thousands of engineers, draughtspeople, naval architects, technical officers and trainees in these fields who are employed by the Department of Defence, fewer than a dozen are women. Fewer than 12 trainees in the entire Department of Defence are women. The Defence Forces also implement employment policies which discriminate against women. Women are still not accepted as officer cadets at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, and on current plans they will not be accepted at Casey University when it opens either. It is ironic that the area of defence, where discrimination against women in government employment is at its most blatant, has been the only area of Government spending to get a boost in the Budget-a 5.3 per cent increase in real terms. Clearly that boost will do nothing for employment for women. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of the increase in Government expenditure on training in this Budget is directed towards the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training scheme, which subsidises private employers to take on apprentices in areas such as metal and electrical trades and the construction industry. There is no mechanism, that is, no legislation or government policy, to ensure that women receive equal access to these programs. Of course, in practice they do not. While the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs does not keep a male-female break-up of those receiving assistance under CRAFT, the facts are that over 90 per cent of apprentices are male. It is reasonable to assume that a similar percentage of those receiving assistance under CRAFT are also male. While the Government advertises its CRAFT scheme in full page newspaper advertisements showing two young males in work clothes with the caption 'More Jobs for the Boys Means More Bikkies for the Bosses', this situation is unlikely to change. Such advertisements actively discourage young women from considering themselves eligible for apprenticeship training, and also discourage employers from considering female trainees. </PARA>
<PARA> The increased Budget allocation for skills in short supply will also go mostly to males because the areas of need are not traditional areas of female employment. No special effort is being made to encourage young women to stop training for office jobs which do not exist and start training for the skilled jobs that do. Without action on the part of the Government to ensure equal access for women to these schemes, the Budget's training provisions can be seen only as further subsidising male youths seeking skills at the expense of young unemployed girls. I have already referred to the huge disparity between unemployed male teenagers and unemployed female teenagers. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make a couple of comments on education funding and the failure of the Government to ensure educational opportunities which would assist women to overcome their disadvantages on the labour market. Part of the Government's Budget package is the imposition of fees for second and higher degrees in tertiary institutions. Who will this affect? Women who have spent some years out of the work force raising children are much more likely to need to upgrade outdated qualifications or to take a second or higher degree to be employable. They are much less likely than men to find themselves in the exempt categories announced by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown), so many of them will have to give up the hope of qualifying themselves for a good job. The area of women's employment is vital because it is a major determinant of women's incomes. As I have pointed out, women comprise a disproportionate percentage of those on low incomes and those on social security benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Almost two-thirds of those who rely on social security benefits for the major proportion of their income are women. Budget figures on taxable incomes of males and females show that while 90 per cent of men earn less than $30,000 per annum, about 90 per cent of women earn less than $15,000 per annum. Fifty-five per cent of women who pay tax have incomes of under $10,000, compared with 27 per cent of men. One-quarter of all women paying tax earn under $7,000 per annum. This reflects women's part time participation in the work force. So it is very clear, whether we look at incomes, employment statistics, access to tertiary institutions for higher education, or job training that women are missing out. If we look at the Government's employment policies within areas of employment where it is the employer, such as the Department of Defence, we see highly discriminatory practices and policies. We need a complete change of approach if we are going to put a stop to the erosion of women's employment prospects. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer honourable senators again to the report of the Myers Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia, which documents the disadvantage suffered by women in the job market. The disappointing aspect of the report is that it paid so little attention to positive recommendations with regard to education and training to overcome this. It should not be beyond the capacity of a government of determination and good will in this matter to evolve appropriate training and education schemes. As I said at the beginning of my speech, there is much that could be said on this subject. I certainly do not pretend to have said it all tonight and I do not intend now to delay the Senate by saying anything further. I wanted to take this opportunity to make some comments on the situation. I hope that other honourable senators in this place will address their attention to this matter and follow suit and that we can have, at least in this chamber, a proper consideration of this most urgent and critical problem of women's employment and technological change. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -As Senator Ryan has so eloquently stated, the recommendations of the report of the Myers Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia were excellent as far as they went. However, they have been left languishing on the shelf amongst many other excellent recommendations such as those of the Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education, Training and Employment and, looking back over the years, those contained in another excellent report entitled 'Girls, Schools and Society'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the meantime, employment of young women in Australia has become an ever-increasing problem. The double labour market has gradually developed into a triple labour market. One market is for males, and one is for mature experienced women who have been in the work force or have the skills that are valuable in the work force and to employers. The third is for young women who have left school, typically at about 15 years of age, who have no job experience, whose education may be rudimentary in the sense that they are barely literate and numerate, and whom nobody wants to employ. Their ambitions, on the whole, are very limited. They lack knowledge, they lack opportunity, and their aspirations are very low. School curricula in the main have led them into a circumscribed set of options. Community attitudes still see them in a very narrow range of occupations. Most of them, when they look for work, indicate that they are looking for jobs as shop assistants and clerks when, as we have been told so clearly this evening, those are exactly the fields in which job opportunities are declining rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA> The lack of education and guidance in vocational fields is a matter of great concern. I feel it would make an excellent reference for our Standing Committee on Education and the Arts and it is something which should be dealt with fairly soon. Eighty per cent of the women in the work force in Australia today would have left school at 14 or 15 years of age and would have only basic levels of education. Their training, such as it is, is what they have received on the job and may take perhaps from an hour to a week. They have learned their job sitting or standing next to Nellie. They go into jobs which have been described as low wage, low satisfaction and low status. Many of them work on a weekly contract, which means that their employment can be terminated with simply the giving of a week's notice and for no other reason whatsoever except that they are on a weekly contract. Very few of them have ever qualified for long service leave, especially the three-quarters of them who are employed in private enterprise and who would have to work continuously for 15 years before qualifying. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, four-fifths of the female work force has very little in the way of formal qualifications. This is not to say that they are stupid. Very many of them are intelligent, loyal, hard working and good natured. That is why they are employed. It looks as if an enormous sector of the female work force is in this category. However, looking at the increasing number of young women who stay at school for four or five years of secondary education, one would think that the situation could change. But, of course, this will happen only very gradually over the years, given that the average age of working women is now in the late 30s and early 40s. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to being immobilised in terms of her occupation, geographically she is unable usually to move far away from home and her family responsibilities to work. Our typical working woman will have the choice of only a very narrow range of occupations. These will be found in one of eight industrial groups. She will be working in the retail trade, in some sort of clerical work, in manufacturing industry or in the catering industry. If she has done an apprenticeship she may be a hairdresser. Apart from that she may be doing cleaning of some sort or another. If she is one of the fortunate well educated women she will be working as a nurse, a teacher, a social worker or a librarian. She will be one of the 10 per cent or 11 per cent in the female work force who are elite by comparison with the rest in the sense that she is working on a somewhat better contract than the one that makes her vulnerable to being sacked on an hour's or a week's notice. She has some opportunity for promotion, for training, for moving up in her profession. </PARA>
<PARA> A study of young employed women that was carried out in Melbourne two or three years ago found that young women by comparison with young men were invisible. When unable to get work they tended to return home quietly to do the housework, to sit and watch television and to be out of sight and out of mind of society. Young migrant women particularly are in this position. The tendency, of course, is for them to feel that the only thing for them is to justify their existence by marrying young. </PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment rates for young women have always been higher than the national average with young girls-those between 15 and 19 years of age-constituting over 20 per cent of the registered unemployed in 1979. That has been the situation for quite a long time except that 20 per cent of the unemployed in 1970 did not represent a very large number of young women or, for that matter, any other sector of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a gradually developing change in the attitude of young women towards themselves and work. When I started talking to groups of high school students five or six years ago about women in the work force I found that the main ambition among the majority of them was to marry. However, when forced really to study the situation most of them admitted that their mothers, their older sisters, their next door neighbours and their aunts were in the work force if not for all of their adult lives, for probably most of their adult lives. In fact the figures show that something like two-thirds of adult mature women are in the work force at any one time. One could turn that statistic on its head and say that almost all adult women are in the paid work force for something like two-thirds of their adult lives. In a study recently carried out in Australia on young unemployed women and their attitude towards work comments were made that young women were gradually taking a different approach to themselves as potential members of society and as potential workers. In the 1930s Wight Bakke wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> With a job there is a future, without a job there is slow death of all that makes a man ambitious, industrious and glad to be alive. </PARA>
<PARA>I might add that the word 'man' in that statement is not particularly appropriate. In fact it is one of my ambitions to see the word 'manpower' completely eradicated from the dictionary and replaced with something a little more appropriate in view of the fact that well over one-third of the work force is female. </PARA>
<PARA> More recently research in Australia and overseas has clearly shown the social, economic and psychological consequences of prolonged periods without work. Indeed, given the overwhelming agreement as to the negative consequences for the societies, the individuals concerned and their families, the general neglect of the problem is difficult to understand. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other unfortunate spin-offs of retraction in the Australian work force and in the cutting back of funds for essential services is that women are being forced more and more into voluntary and semi-voluntary work. In health care, in hostels for homeless youth, in women's refuges, the funding is becoming so pathetically inadequate that to keep these facilities functioning the people who have taken on the responsibilities are being forced to accept far less than awarded wages. Some of them are working appallingly long hours without claiming any sort of overtime. We have a society which is saying: 'Yes, we need the community health services; yes, we need hostels for homeless youth; yes, women's refuges are essential', but declining to set aside sufficient funds so that the workers in these essential services are correctly paid. Not only do we see deteriorating work standards as a result of these sorts of policy but, worse than that, we see a deterioration in the way that women perceive themselves in society and in relation to the work force. They are being told quite clearly that their services are not worth a great deal of money. In some institutions it is even more blatant than that. They are being told that the type of work they are performing can be done at home and therefore it is valued very poorly in the market place. </PARA>
<PARA> Opportunities for young women to work could be made available just as they could be made available for young men. But the inadequacies are a great deal more blatant. As I said earlier, the only apprenticeship which is truly open to women is hairdressing. The number of young women who have in the most recent years become pioneers in traditionally male trades are greatly to be commended, but their lives have been very difficult, and it is really only the toughest who have managed to survive. They can still be identified in their ones and twos in occupations such as mechanical engineering and the electrical trades. They are entering in greater numbers trades such as pastry cooking. They are doing optical mechanical work and are becoming dental mechanics and dental therapists. </PARA>
<PARA> Women are entering the newer occupations or the ones that have become trades fairly recently, such as horticulture, in slightly greater numbers. I believe there are 12 in that trade in the Australian Capital Territory. But it is still only a trickle rather than a flood, and there is no real encouragement for girls to apply for apprenticeships while so many young men are unable to get the trade training which they traditionally have believed to be their right. </PARA>
<PARA> The ratio of occupations actually available to women and to males by comparison is quite startling. When the Australian Statistician takes out his average award wage earnings each quarter he looks at 500-odd common awards for females and 2,500 common awards for males. That gives us some idea of the very restricted opportunities that are available for young women in this society. It seems to me that the Government could do a great deal more than has already been done. Earlier this year a set of equal opportunity guidelines were released with a great deal of pomp and ceremony by the then Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, Mr Viner. </PARA>
<PARA> That particular set of guidelines was designed to apply to small and large industries and to both government and private industries. It was put together as a joint exercise of the women's employment sub-committee of the National Labour Consultative Council which means that it was a tripartite project. In the event and after many drafts and redrafts of those guidelines that sub-committee came up with a document which was acceptable to the Federal Government, to the Confederation of Australian Industry and to the Australian Council of Trade Unions. It was released, as I said, with a considerable amount of publicity and with a complete commitment from those people who are supposed to be able to make things happen. We have seen very little activity in the way of equal opportunity from a government which should be able to put into effect such important principles as equality of opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> In the defence forces in particular, where a very expensive advertising campaign has been conducted over the last few months, we have seen very little extra opportunities made available for young women. The Department of Defence has a number of installations and institutions in which there are quite significant numbers of apprenticeships and training places available, but still there is very little acknowledgement of the fact that young women should be able to apply for a complete range of occupations in the way that young men can do; that in fact their potential is what matters, not their sex. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, I would very much like to see the word 'manpower' removed from the names of all our committees, policies and publications. This word crops up in the weirdest places. I recently saw a manpower study on nursing in Australia, and I cannot imagine anything less appropriate than that particular title. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate is of the opinion that legislation should be introduced to compensate families for the erosion of family allowances, the value of which has been cut by 50 per cent since they were introduced in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not delay the Senate long but as this motion has been on the Notice Paper since November 1980-if it disappears into the lists again it may not appear for another year or so-I think it is important that I make some points on it, even if briefly. The motion, I believe, needs little explanation. The matter has been gone over at length many times in this place. Certainly it is out of date in that it says:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate is of the opinion that legislation should be introduced to compensate families for the erosion of family allowances, the value of which has been cut by 50 per cent since they were introduced in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA>We know that inflation has increased since that time even more. We know that changes have been made in the last Budget to the family allowance scheme, but the motion is still relevant. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1976 the Government introduced the present family allowance scheme. The family allowances replaced the old child endowment payments which had been reduced to a derisory level by inflation and they also replaced the children's rebate which not long before that had replaced the old tax deduction system for children. When other family allowances were introduced they were certainly an advance, and the Opposition agreed with them. They represented a positive payment for women. They represented a positive payment to families, some of whom had previously received nothing out of the rebate scheme because they paid no tax. The Opposition was suspicious at the time that the scheme had been in fact introduced as a money saving measure in the long run, because if the children's taxation rebate had been retained and had been indexed with other indexation changes, the cost to the revenue, of course, would have increased. At the time we and others pointed out that family allowances, unless they were increased annually in line with inflation, would quickly erode in value and would in fact end up heading down the same track as the old child endowment payments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, of course, has always been very strong on claiming that it supports the family and the main item it has always cited in its support has been family allowances. One remembers the continuous self-praise which was heaped on Government members by other Government members in this place at the time of the introduction of the scheme. One can well remember Senator Baume telling us that it was the greatest advance in social security since the introduction of the old age pension. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, not at all. But other members of the Government over the years, of course, have had plenty to say about family allowances and about support for the family in general. In 1976, Mr Fraser had this to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We committed ourselves to helping the disadvantaged in ways leaving them the greatest scope for independence. We have acted by introducing our family allowance scheme. This has been recognised as the single most important reform in the Australian welfare system since federation. </PARA>
<PARA>That is typical Fraser-type rhetoric. The only person who recognised the scheme as such, in fact, was Mr Fraser himself. Senator Baume had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> It is only occasionally in the life of any government, and not too frequently in the life of any country, that there is a major revolutionary change in the way in which welfare services are provided . . . It is a major endeavour of which my Government will be proud. </PARA>
<PARA>Incidentally, Senator Baume was then a back bencher. He went on to say. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be proud to be a member of any party which introduced this measure . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In 1977 Mr Fraser said:</PARA>
<PARA> Family allowances will not be means tested. This is a universal scheme. It represents the most important innovation in welfare for a decade. </PARA>
<PARA>The year before he said it was the most important reform in welfare since Federation. Of course he did not say at the time that the Government was not going to increase family allowances for many years. In 1977 Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle said:</PARA>
<PARA> Family allowances provide a regular income to mothers and form an important part of their budget. </PARA>
<PARA>That is true, and I will have something to say about that in a moment. She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, family allowances had important redistributive effects to low income families. . . millions of Australians properly regard family allowances as the most important innovation in social welfare for decades. </PARA>
<PARA>So we have had the statements that it is the most important innovation since Federation, the most important in a decade and the most important for decades. I think it depends on the circumstances and how government supporters feel as to what they say about them. Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle was right of course; family allowances are important. They do provide regular income for mothers and they do form an important part of the budget of any family. That is all the more reason why they should be increased each year in line with inflation, if we are to have this sort of payment. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the important things about family allowances is the fact that they are paid to the mother and it is usually recognised that it is the mother's money and the mother's property. Unfortunately, in some families, even some of the more than low income families, family allowances are the only cash money that the mother gets. In some of the poor families in some of our cities family allowances are known as shoe money. The mothers use it to buy shoes, items of clothing and large items which otherwise would be difficult to buy from the family budget. </PARA>

<PARA> During the last election campaign the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, made another promise about Australian families. He promised that he would use the increased oil revenues to the Government to help Australian families. It was generally considered by those who were in Tasmania at the time where this promise was initially made that this meant that there would be a general increase in family allowances from this large amount of oil money which the Prime Minister said was flowing into the country. What in fact has happened is that in the recent Budget it was announced that the increase in family allowances is to apply only to families with three or more children. Certainly that increase was needed and certainly it will be welcomed in those families. But low income families and pensioner families who have only one or two children will in fact receive no increase under this Budget. Seventy-six per cent of families in this country have two children or less and in pensioner families the percentage is even higher. The Government's major advisory body, the National Consultative Council on Social Welfare, has regularly advocated indexing or increasing family allowances. In its most recent report it stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . There is a considerable amount of evidence which shows that families with children, are disadvantaged by recent changes in taxation structures and the level of Family Allowance. The Council regards this situation, and especially that of lower income families with children, as serious and requiring redress as a matter of urgency. The Minister for Social Security is urged, as a matter of urgency, to press for an increase in the Family Alowance to restore it to the 1976 real value and, thereafter, for Family Allowance to be indexed according to the C.P.I. </PARA>
<PARA>Family allowances in fact represent some sort of recognition of the cost of parenthood, some sort of recognition of the cost of bringing up children. But what the Government has done in this Budget is to increase the benefits only for parents with three or more children-only one-quarter of Australian families. But 1 1/2 million families with only one or two children were totally ignored in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Family allowances in relation to which, as has been said, the Prime Minister has made all sorts of extravagant claims have now become a fairly hollow gesture in the support of families in this country. If family allowances had been indexed after their introduction, families with one child would be now getting an extra $9.30 a month, families with two children would be getting an extra $22.37 a month, families with three children would be getting an extra $25 a month, families with four children would be getting an extra $27 a month and families with five children would be getting $30 a month above the increases which have been promised in this Budget. If family allowances had not been allowed to erode in value the Government would be spending another $580m next year instead of the estimated increase of $124m. The money the Government is saving is a direct take from 1 1/2 million families, irrespective of their living standards and the numbers of children. The impression has been given in fact that the Government is rewarding large families regardless of their income, regardless of their means, and it is in fact penalising small families. It was prior to these Budget changes being announced that I put this notice of motion on the Notice Paper. Others have been put on by other senators in this place. There have been repeated calls from all sorts of authorities in the community concerned about the welfare of women, children and families in general in this community for a regular and proper increase in the amount of money paid directly to families through this measure. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite wrong and in fact it is immoral to replace one system with a new system as was done in 1976, to claim that it represents an advance for the families in the community and then to allow the value of these payments to erode in the manner in which they have been allowed to erode by this Government since that time, even taking into account the extra $124m which is to be spent under this Budget. We must remember that these payments provide for too many families in this community an essential supplement to their income. They provide for so many women in this community the only cash payments they get. </PARA>
<PARA> That, briefly, is the case that I put before the Senate in asking it to insist on an increase in family allowances to compensate for inflation. One could, as one has done in the past, have spoken at considerable length on this subject, and I dare say that we will all be doing so in the future. But in this debate on a General Business item I have at least expressed the Opposition's concern and expressed a point of view on the need for this very real difficulty facing families to be compensated for. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a habit of blending into the background. One learns interesting things in the background. I open my remarks as Senator Grimes opened his remarks: I do not intend to take up a great deal of the time of the Senate. However, as he indicated also during his speech, the topic of family allowances is one about which I am particularly concerned. I am concerned for all families of course but for low income families in particular. As Senator Ryan pointed out in an earlier debate some three million people in this country receive benefits of some sort or another and a considerable number more than that fit into what would be termed low income families. These low income families are hardest hit by the present Government's failure to index family allowances. At the same time, they are hardest hit by the imposition of indirect taxes on the necessities of life and conversely they are helped the least by any income tax relief that the Federal Government may see as a way of offsetting sales tax impositions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problem is exacerbated in families in which-Senator Grimes pointed this out-the only independent income of the wife is the family allowance. I am sure that we all have anecdotes, not very amusing ones, that we could tell of families we know in which the woman is kept so destitute for money that she is forced to wait for the family allowance cheque to come through before she can buy some necessities-socks and so on-for her children, simply because husbands often are not responsible enough in their attitude to sharing the income that they bring in. Of course, as a consequence any income tax relief in this sort of family-Meredith Edwards in a recent study has itemised, discussed and dissected the problem-will help only the husband. Then of course there is the rider that the lower the income the less relief that will be provided anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> Income sharing in too many Australian families is limited to the situation in which the husband earns the income because he works in the paid labour force whereas the wife stays at home minding the children, looking after the house and subsisting on whatever pittance her husband elects to give her. This means that in many instances the family allowance is a very real source-not of luxury items or even of necessary expenditure on the children-of income for purchasing food and clothing. Of course, what happens in the case of income tax relief in that instance is that the husband gets it; it stays in his pocket to be spent as he wishes. It very rarely gets passed on to the wife, who obviously often needs it more than he does. On the other hand, of course, any sales tax imposition, particularly that on the necessities of life and that affecting requirements for children, is going to be particularly hard on a wife dependent on the family allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for that reason that I have been moved tonight to support entirely Senator Grimes's motion calling on the Federal Government to compensate families for the erosion of family allowances, the value of which has been cut by 50 per cent since they were introduced in 1976, and to urge that the Government give due consideration to doing that as a matter of urgency. I of course, accept that it is not possible for any government to hand out money to all and sundry. The simple fact of the matter is that it is just as expensive to clothe and feed-particularly to clothe-the first two children in a family as it is for subsequent children since there is no opportunity for offsetting costs by handing down. Of course, this is particularly true if the first two children are what is commonly known as a pigeon pair; that is, where there is one of each sex. Then there is no opportunity at all for sharing clothing requirements. On behalf of the Australian Democrats I certainly endorse Senator Grimes's motion and urge the Government to give very urgent consideration to removing the anomaly. </PARA>

The main point about that debate was that if we had 9 o'clock closing that would be the very last demand of the retail groups. It is a bit like the situation with Hitler after he went into the Rhineland. The last demand would be 9 o'clock closing. As a result of pressure small businesses and unions eventually had to cave in. So we had 9 o'clock closing on Friday nights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Just recently a group, I think very well termed the gang of five-Coles, Woolworths, McEwans, Myer and Safeway-launched a very expensive campaign in Victoria. They were going to spend millions of dollars to bring us Saturday afternoon trading. A quote from the Australian gives some indication of just how far they were going to go. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Executives of the Myer, McEwan's, Safeway and Coles groups refused to reveal how much the campaign would cost, but said they were prepared to spend as much and fight for as long as it took. </PARA>
<PARA>Many of us expected that this would be a long four or five year campaign. However, immediately opposition was voiced from several groups in the Victorian community. First of all small businesses voiced their opposition. Honourable senators opposite quite often in this place and elsewhere express affection for small businesses. Unfortunately that message has not got through to their State colleagues in Victoria. It is not only the small businesses that are opposed to extended trading hours, but also the major union-I think the largest union in Victoria-the shop assistants union, is opposed to bringing in extended hours, for quite obvious reasons I would think. It could be thought that many consumers would love to have extended shopping hours on Saturday afternoon because it would give them more time to shop. They quite readily realise that this will mean increased prices. Whether the Saturday afternoon trading issue is really what the retailers are about I doubt. I noticed that in an interview in the Business Review a chief Myer's executive said:</PARA>
<PARA>' . . . but certainly we would be open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Thursday, Friday, Saturday. We will eventually open on Sunday, but I wouldn't be pressing Sundays all that hard at the minute.'</PARA>
<PARA>If the normal cycle is followed what will happen? After 9 o'clock closing being introduced in 1971 and Saturday trading in 1981, I doubt that the retailers will wait till 1991 to get Sunday trading; it will come quite soon. Of course, a lot of pressure was put on the Liberal Party in Victoria to extend shopping hours. The main pressure has come from newspapers in that State. We do not have a great variety of ownership of newspapers. There is the Fairfax group controlling the Age and there is the Herald group. Of course, both newspapers support longer trading hours. I am sure it is only coincidental that half their advertising revenue comes from the gang of five! Nevertheless, in their rather objective way they have approached the issue and given it full support! Pressure was put on to the State Liberal Party so it had a State Council meeting. Mr Acting Deputy President, I do not know whether you were in attendance at that meeting and I am not sure which way you voted but there was a three to one majority for the following motion:</PARA>
<PARA> This State Council calls on the Victoria Government to legislate immediately to enable businesses to trade seven days a week with no restrictions on trading hours, should they so desire. </PARA>
<PARA>I have some sympathy for the person who moved that motion because he has been fined a lot of money for opening his hardware shop. He is the one Liberal in Victoria who has put his money where his principles are. We have in Victoria a rather strange situation in that unlike the Labor Party, the State Council of the Liberal Party cannot direct its parliamentarians. It can merely threaten to withdraw their pre-selection. However, I invite honourable senators to note that the immediate reaction of the State Liberal Party, bearing in mind that it knew it had a State election coming up, was to deny completely that motion and the Gang of Five's assertions. I propose to quote what was said by the Victorian Minister for Consumer Affairs, Mr Ramsay. No Minister in this Senate, I am sure, would have the gall to make the kind of turnaround that he made. Mr Ramsay said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not proposing, nor is it considering, nor would it agree to, any proposal for a general extension in shop trading hours. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it quite clear that there is no proposal for a general extension to shop trading hours and the Government would not be prepared to agree to one if there was. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Ramsay said that on 16 September. Perhaps a month is a long time in politics, but yesterday the Victorian Liberal Party decided to introduce extended trading hours. True, it is only to be on a four-week basis, but the State Liberal Party was very fair about it. It said: 'Let us take a nice average trading time, the four weekends before Christmas.' I would have been more impressed if it had taken the four weeks before the Grand Final, to see how many shoppers they got through the doors. Nevertheless, that decision has been made. Many questions have been asked as to why the State Liberal Party made it. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Jim Maher, the Secretary of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association said:</PARA>
<PARA> The deal entails the major retailers donating $500,000 to the Liberal election fund. This, I believe, is bordering on a bribe. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, and I must put it on record, the Victorian Liberal Party has strongly denied that claim. I do not assert that it is true, but it is a pity that those suspicions have to surround such a great party. Nevertheless, I believe the truth to be that the Liberal Party of Victoria has sold out to big business. Traditionally, small business has provided the base of its support. We have to admit that quite often the Victorian Labor Party has failed to generate the support of small business in that State. That is a matter we are moving to rectify, but I would have to admit that generally small business has supported the Liberal Party in Victoria. I dare say that half of the branches of the Liberal Party there consist of the proprietors of small business. Staid old Victoria, we might think, would be the last place in the world where we would get a revolution but, whether people realise it or not, a revolution on the part of the small business groups is taking place in Victoria. That revolution will see the current State Liberal Government defeated at the next election, whether it be on 5 December or in May of next year. I thank honourable senators for their attention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, despite your obvious fears, I do not intend to be provocative. I rise to respond to the words of Senator Messner in moving the adjournment motion. I wish to say, as one who believes that we need to reform the sitting hours of the Senate, that I have no regret at all that tonight we are to get up about 10 or 15 minutes early. Last night we were to have adjourned at 11 o'clock but adjourned at seven minutes past 12. That was not because the Opposition parties did not have their business organised. It was because the Government could not organise its affairs and, in fact, its program has fallen badly behind. That has happened for reasons for which the Government, not anyone on the Opposition side, must take the blame.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out that tonight there were four notices of motion on the General Business paper, two in my name, one in Senator Ryan's name, and one in the name of Senator Mason. Senator Mason could not proceed with his motion. I do not know the exact reason and am not going to say that there were other than proper reasons why he could not do so. Since 8 o'clock tonight I have spoken twice on reports presented, and twice on my notices of motion. Things are becoming so bad that I am not only boring my colleagues, I am also boring myself. I believe that that kind of situation does arise because of certain unfortunate circumstances. I certainly make no apologies on behalf of the Australian Labor Party for what has happened tonight. I am glad that we are to get up early. I wish that we would get up early more often. I wish that the Government would so organise its affairs that we would not have to sit after midnight on various occasions. Senator Messner may want to stay here all night. If he really has urgent business to bring in and wants to sit on, we will co-operate. However, I believe that he was speaking with tongue in cheek. That is one reason for the mildness of my remarks. The second is the look of anguish on the face of the Acting Deputy President when I rose and he thought that I intended to be provocative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, at Question Time, Senator Crichton-Browne asked me a question without notice about the report on Australia's Aboriginals by the mission of the World Council of Churches which recently visited Australia. I replied that I was writing to a number of church leaders making detailed comments on that report. I undertook to make that document available to the Senate. It has been settled and sent out. I now have it in my possession and can make it available to the Senate. I have not yet shown it to Senator Grimes. It has gone out to church leaders. It might be appropriate for me to seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>World Council of Churches Report</PARA>
<PARA>JUSTICE FOR ABORIGINAL AUSTRALIANS</PARA>
<PARA>General Comments</PARA>
<PARA> While the Australian Government cannot agree with everything in the report, it considers that the team, within the time available to it, has attempted to provide a sympathetic commentary on the Aboriginal situation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We are saddened that the WCC could find the sorts of things it has talked about in the report. The Australian Government is committed to improving the welfare and standing of the Aboriginal people and in this regard is at one with the WCC. </PARA>
<PARA> Need to establish community consensus of Australia's approach to overcome the many problems which Aboriginals face. If the report contributes to that consensus by promoting discussion among the churches and elsewhere in the community, it will have positive value. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the recommendations are an endorsement of the Commonwealth's general policy approach, particularly in terms of directing funds to Aboriginal organsiations. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of example, more than 70 per cent of expenditure by the Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs on Aboriginal programs last financial year went direct to Aboriginal organisations. The proportion of that Department's health funding to Aboriginal Medical Services relative to State services has tripled in the last six years. </PARA>
<PARA> The report gives some recognition of the progress made in Australia in the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA> The report points to areas of concern which come within the responsibility of individual States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government considers that considerable progress has been made in Aboriginal affairs in recent years, but acknowledges that a great deal more remains to be done. </PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth Relations in Australia</PARA>
<PARA> Australian federal system based on a division of powers between the Commonwealth and the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Both levels of Government have responsibilities for making laws and for providing services in particular spheres. </PARA>
<PARA> There are very considerable problems for the Commonwealth in asserting its powers to make laws for Aboriginal people if those laws result in State Governments withdrawing normal State services from the areas in which Aboriginals are living. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth and State Governments have since 1967 had concurrent powers in respect of Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth for its part wishes to achieve Aboriginal advancement through co-operation-by negotiation and not by confrontation. That is not to say that in an extreme situation the Government would not seek to exercise its constitutional power vis a vis the States. Such a situation to date has not arisen. It would be a judgement to be made at the time. No Commonwealth Government has yet been willing to take such action. </PARA>
<PARA> Advances have been made. The Queensland Government has announced its intention to repeal its existing legislation and is committed to consulting with Aboriginal and Islander people about future land and reserve management options. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATIONS AFFECTING THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT</PARA>
<PARA>I Federal Government Action</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>LAND RIGHTS</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 1. that the Federal Government accept its responsibility and use its powers under the Constitution to override racist state legislation, particularly in regard to Land Rights. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government prefers to exercise its consitutional powers where possible in collaboration with the exercise by the States of their own powers.</PARA>
<PARA>THE LEGAL SYSTEM</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 2. that the Australian Government more effectively enforce the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. We express deep regret at the recent downgrading of the Commissioner of Community Relations Office, so that no longer will it directly report to Parliament or have a role in public education. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has recently passed legislation, the Human Rights Commission Act 1981, to enable it to meet its obligations under the International Bill of Rights. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Act, the Commissioner for Community Relations will continue to carry out the complaint-handling and conciliation functions associated with administration of the Racial Discrimination Act. Further, the added resources of the Commission will be available to assist as required in the important task of combating racial discrimination and there will be a recourse, as there was not previously, to the Meeting of Ministers on Human Rights on Racial Discrimination matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is confident therefore that establishing the Commission will not make less effective the role of the Commissioner for Community Relations in dealing with complaints of racial discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 3. that the Federal Government undertake a commitment to guarantee permanency to the Aboriginal Legal Service network throughout Australia, and ensure there is sufficient funding to enable the service to broaden its functions to extend beyond case by case representation to areas such as legal education for Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has endorsed the continued support of Aboriginal Legal Services as specialist legal aid organisations. The Government believes that Aboriginal Legal Services can most effectively meet the legal aid needs of Aboriginals because of their acceptability and accessibilty to Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government appreciates the need Legal Services have for sufficient funds and every attempt is made, within normal budgetary constraints, to meet this need. Legal Services are, of course, not the only Aboriginal organisations needing funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal Legal Service in Sydney and the Central Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service have made valuable contributions to Aboriginal legal education with specially designed consumer education and racial discrimination programs. It is also part of the duties of every Legal Service field officer employed by Aboriginal Legal Services to provide advice to individuals and groups on matters affecting them. This is a most effective form of education. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 4. that Churches and Governments be urged to encourage Aboriginal voter enrolment in order that they may become participants in the democratic processes of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Electoral Office is conducting continuing programs of instruction on electoral matters for adult Aboriginals. The program began in June 1979, and is currently concentrating on remote areas of the Northern Territory, Western Australia and South Australia but will be expanded to other areas as resoures permit. </PARA>
<PARA>HEALTH</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 5. that the current Commonwealth Aboriginal Health Funding Policy (which we understand was described in the programme effectiveness review commissioned by the Prime Minister as being ''irrational'') be substantially altered to ensure increased funding for Aboriginal community controlled health services, with reduced funding for the less efficient programmes for Aborigines operated by the State Health Departments. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government strongly supports Aboriginal community controlled health services, and overall funding of these services has almost trebled since 1977-78. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth will expand support to Aboriginal Medical Services and try to improve the effectiveness of the States' Aboriginal health programs as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The Program Effectiveness Review did not describe Commonwealth Aboriginal health funding policy as irrational, although it did note a lack of rationale for the division of funds between States Grants and Grants-in-Aid. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 6. that the Federal Government immediately increase and retain adequate levels of funding to Aboriginal community controlled health services, since such services have proved that they can greatly improve the deplorable health situation of Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Government expects that recent trends whereby an increasing number of Aboriginal Medical Services are receiving an increasing level of funding will be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 7. that Aboriginal controlled programmes for Aboriginal medical aides and nurses, appropriate to community health care, be strengthened and that special effort be made to train Aboriginal doctors. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> All reports on Aboriginal health urge the need for more Aboriginal medical manpower, and for greater Aboriginal involvement in and control of health services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government strongly supports both recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 8. that traditional medicine and doctors be respected and used in co-operation with modern medical techniques. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Respect and co-operation are absolutely essential and particularly so in traditional communities. </PARA>
<PARA> At present we fund the employment of several hundred Aboriginal health workers and camp nurses (e.g. in Western Australia there are 163). </PARA>
<PARA> Most are selected by the communities themselves for the job. Communities are always consulted in traditional areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Government would like to see more done to improve non-Aboriginal staff awareness of Aboriginal tranditional medicine and skills. </PARA>
<PARA>HOUSING</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 9. that the State and Federal Governments expand Aboriginal housing programmes as a matter of urgency. Even with an expanded programme, it may take a decade or more to catch up the backlog of need. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Government generally agrees with the approach taken in recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> Funds were increased by additional $20m per annum in 1979-80 and this increase is being followed up for subsequent years. The total funds spend for identifiable programs Aboriginal housing in 1980-81 were $67m. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 10. that, where possible, governments implement their Aboriginal housing programmes through Aboriginal housing Associations or Co-operatives. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The number of Aboriginal Housing Associations funded by the Australian Government has increased over the years to a total of 224, at present. </PARA>
<PARA> State authorities, which can usually provide houses much more cheaply than Aboriginal Housing Associations, obtain Aboriginal involvement in the planning, location and management of houses through Aboriginal housing boards.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 11. that State and Federal Governments involve Aboriginal communities in the planning, locating and designing of houses to be built in their communities. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Two Aboriginal-managed bodies, the Aboriginal Development Commission and Aboriginal Hostels Ltd, are responsible for Commonwealth housing programs for Aboriginals. These bodies have a policy of close consultation with Aboriginal communities and are largely Aboriginal-staffed. </PARA>
<PARA> State Governments consult with Aboriginal communities via their Aboriginal housing boards, which are made up of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA>EDUCATION</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 12. that State and Federal Governments involve Aborigines more fully in the formulation and implementation of policies on Aboriginal education. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> It is a major thrust of Commonwealth policy that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people assume a central role in Aboriginal programs affecting them. </PARA>
<PARA> Establishment of mechanisms and processes to ensure that there is real consultation at all levels has involved:</PARA>
<PARA> establishment of National Aboriginal Education Committee (NAEC). Established in 1977 the NAEC is a wholly Aboriginal committee which provides the Commonwealth with Aboriginal views on the educations needs of aboriginal people and appropriate methods of meeting those needs. The NAEC has fulfilled an invaluable and highly professional role in providing a federal Aboriginal voice in education. </PARA>
<PARA> establishment by Education Departments in all States and the Northern Territory of Aboriginal Education Consultative Groups. A number of the State groups are now moving to establish a regional structure. </PARA>
<PARA> encouragement of educational institutions and administrators to seek meaningful involvement of Aboriginal people at community level. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 13. that State and Federal Governments adequately fund Aboriginal initiated schools and programmes for the teaching of Aboriginal culture and tradition. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> In recent years the Commonwealth Government has supported Aboriginal community-based non-government schools in Townsville (the Black Community School) and the Strelly, Noonkanbah and Lake Gnangara (Nyoongah) Schools in Western Australia. Funds are also now being provided for the christian Aboriginal Parent Controlled School in Coolgardie (WA). </PARA>
<PARA>EMPLOYMENT</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 14. that the Federal and State Governments provide a fixed percentage of work places for Aborigines within the Public Services. A minimum of 1 per cent would be an appropriate figure. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Recruitment and advancement in the Australian Public Service is based on the merit principle. Those applying to fill a position in the Service must meet specific requirements as to qualifications and ability. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the limits of this policy, the Australian Public Service has taken several initiatives to promote the entry of Aboriginals into all areas of the Service and their promotion throughout its structure. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of the National Employment Strategy for Aboriginals (NESA), the Australian Public Service has indentified approximately 740 positions in Commonwealth Government Departments for which an ability to communicate with Aboriginals and a knowledge of Aboriginal culture are either essential or of value for the performance of the duties. </PARA>
<PARA> It is expected that Aboriginals with their backgrounds will have an inherent advantage when seeking appointment to these positions as they become vacant. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 15. that Federal and State Governments request all statutory authorities and commissions to make available a similar percentage of positions for Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth Statutory Authorities have been approached to identify positions in their staff structure for which a knowledge of Aboriginal culture and an ability to communicate with Aboriginals is either essential or of value in the performance of the duties. </PARA>
<PARA> They have also been requested to give sympathetic attention to the recruitment of Aboriginals and to provide training opportunities for their Aboriginal employees and for those participating in National Employment and Training (NEAT) public sector training. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth statutory authorities have made an important contribution to NEAT training for Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 16. that Federal and State Governments fund special programs to provide necessary training to enable the above targets for Aboriginal employment to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The NEAT system has been modified to enable Aboriginals to receive training in the public sector in positions in excess of the normal staff structure of the organizations involved. While the trainees do not have a guarantee of a position at the completion of training their chances of finding employment are greatly improved as a result of the training they have undergone. </PARA>
<PARA> As at the end of April 1981, 1164 Aboriginals were receiving training under NEAT on-the-job in the public sector. From the commencement of public sector NEAT to August 1980, 2040 Aboriginals had undertaken such training in the Australian Public Service. Up to August 1980, 220 Aboriginals who had completed NEAT training had entered the Service. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 17. that the Aboriginal Development Commission give high priority to funding employment creating projects in outback Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The ADC is an independent statutory commission with a variety of responsibilities which include the promotion and assistance of Aboriginal-owned enterprise projects throughout Australia. The activities of the ADC should aid in the economic self-sufficiency of Aboriginals and the creation of employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>POLITICAL PARTICIPATION</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 18. therefore we recommend that Governments and Churches give top priority in their allocation of funds for Aborigines to Aboriginal-initiated organisations such as Land Councils, Medical Services, Legal Services and Co-operatives. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth Government Aboriginal Affairs Policy recognises the need to maximise Aboriginal involvement in the design, management and delivery of services and thus accords high priority to the funding of Aboriginal organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a steady trend in DAA programs away from States Grants towards Grants-in-Aid to Aboriginal organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>II State Government Action</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>MINING</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 3. that the freeze on the granting of exploration licences in Arnhem Land be reinstigated for a further 5 years to allow the Aborigines and the Northern Land Council time to work through the changes occurring and establish the means and procedures to protect their interests. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Land Council is already processing applications for further exploration licences in Arnhem Land and has not sought an extension of the freeze for this area. </PARA>
<PARA>LEGAL SYSTEM</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 8. that State Ministers for Police ensure police recruits receive special training in Aboriginal history, culture, society and language (where no such courses currently exist). </PARA>
<PARA> 9. that State Ministers for Police increase Aboriginal involvement in all levels of the Police Forces and Police activities. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. that State Ministers for Police establish appropriate Aboriginal/Police Liaison Committees. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. that State Ministers for Police adopt the practice of police notifying any local Aboriginal Legal Service of the arrest of an Aboriginal person. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Since 1978 the Department of Aboriginal Affairs has been promoting a special strategy to overcome problems which Aboriginals encounter in their dealings with the law. The strategy encompasses:</PARA>
<PARA> the establishment of police/Aboriginal liaison systems;</PARA>
<PARA> recruitment of Aboriginal police and police aides;</PARA>
<PARA> the institution of training schemes to assist police in recognising the particular needs of Aboriginals;</PARA>
<PARA> improvement in police complaints procedures; and</PARA>
<PARA> procedural reforms relating to the detention and interrogation of Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA> These aspects were also covered by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs in its report-Aboriginal Legal Aid. </PARA>
<PARA> In reply to that report the Commonwealth pointed out that it has been seeking the co-operation of State and Territory Governments in introducing programs to improve relations between Aboriginals and police. The Western Australian, South Australian and Northern Territory Governments have taken positive steps to recruit Aboriginal police aides and make police officers aware of Aboriginal problems. Formal Aboriginal/police liaison committees have been established in South Australia and Western Australia. The Commonwealth has also introduced legislation which will improve procedures for investigating complaints against officers of the Australian Federal Police Force. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 12. that the Churches and Governments be urged to encourage Aboriginal voter enrolment in order that they may become participants in the democratic processes of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> As for I, 4. </PARA>
<PARA>HOUSING</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 13. that State and Federal Governments expand Aboriginal housing programs as a matter of urgency. Even with an expanded program, it may take a decade or more to catch up the backlog of need. </PARA>
<PARA> 14. that, where possible, Governments implement their Aboriginal housing programs through Aboriginal Housing Associations or Co-operatives. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> As for I, 9-10. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 15. that State Housing Departments make every effort to use locally available materials and appropriate building methods to cut the costs of 'imported' houses and so enable more houses to be built. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> When suitable local materials are available and are cheaper than imported materials these are usually used. The State housing authorities have their own conventions and standards under which economies are sought but cheapness is not the supreme value. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 16. that State and Federal Governments involve Aboriginal communities in the planning, locating and designing of houses to be built in their communities. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> As for I, 11. </PARA>
<PARA>EDUCATION</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 17. that State and Federal Governments involve Aborigines more fully in the formulation and implementation of policies on Aboriginal education. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> As for I, 12. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 18. that State Governments involve Aborigines in curriculum formation and introduce Aboriginal culture and languages into school curricula. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> In recent years there have been a number of initiatives taken by State Departments of Education and Commonwealth agencies to promote the teaching of Aboriginal studies programs in schools and to increase the availability of resources. </PARA>
<PARA> My own Department provides extensive financial support for curriculum development for Aboriginal education. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 19. that State Departments of Education develop curricula that more adequately prepare children for life in a multi-cultural society. Departments of Education should seek to eliminate all racist bias in the interpretation of history and to encourage greater understanding of the culture of Aboriginal people. Positive steps need to be taken to create a climate of awareness of the need for racial justice and mutual acceptance. </PARA>
<PARA> As for 18, above. </PARA>
<PARA> In most States, Aboriginal Education Consultative Groups have been increasingly involved in providing advice on existing materials and listing priorities for further development. </PARA>
<PARA> State Ministers for Education have endorsed the principle of the integration of learning about Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders into existing school curricula for all grades, including the development of appropriate specific studies. </PARA>
<PARA> The South Australian Department of Education has an Aboriginal Studies Curriculum Sub-committee responsible for the development of programs. The Queensland Department of Education has recommended to schools the ''Guidelines for Studies about Aborigines in Queensland Schools'' produced by the Queensland and Torres Strait Islander Committee advising the Queensland Department and Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 20. that State and Federal Governments adequately fund Aboriginal initiated schools and programmes for the teaching of Aboriginal culture and tradition. </PARA>

<PARA> As for I, 13. </PARA>
<PARA>EMPLOYMENT</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 21. that the Federal and State Governments provide a fixed percentage of work places for Aborigines within the Public Services. A minimum of 1% would be an appropriate figure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Trade and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The points at issue in the negotiations remain confidential to the two parties.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes; I refer the honourable senator to my statement of 1 February 1979, in which I made it clear that, 'companies which have received Commonwealth approval to develop uranium deposits will be allowed to negotiate sales contracts with prospective customers which provide that delivery is conditional on safeguards agreements being concluded with the customer countries before delivery takes place.'</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Australian nuclear safeguards policy requires that before shipments of uranium to Japan under contracts concluded since December 1972 can take place, a nuclear safeguards agreement with Japan, consistent with the safeguards policy announced by the Government since the Ranger Inquiry, must be in force. Without such an agreement there can be no such shipments.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No. All elements of Australia's nuclear safeguards policy will be maintained in agreements with potential customer countries. I refer the honourable senator to the joint statement made by myself and the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, on 31 July 1981, entitled Nuclear Safeguards Negotiations with Japan.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) As explained when the model safeguards agreement was tabled on 25 November 1978, the document was a negotiating tool which simply reflected in draft treaty form the Government's nuclear safeguards policy. The actual safeguards agreements concluded to date incorporate all of the requirements of the Government's nuclear safeguards policy. Variations in points of detail in these agreements reflect particular concerns of Australia's negotiating partners and the need to take account of differing aspects of national fuel cycles and national safeguard systems characteristics.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Yes; Australia's nuclear safeguards agreements with the United Kingdom, France and Euratom envisage retransfers between Euratom countries.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Under Australia's Uranium Export Policy announced on 1 June 1978 uranium can be exported provided that a safeguards agreement is in force between Australia and the customer country, that the uranium is exported from a project which has the status of Government development approval and where the export is in performance of an approved contract.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am aware that the income tax law does not provide a deduction for maintenance paid by divorced persons to their former partners.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The present income tax law provides exemption in respect of amounts received by way of periodical payments in the nature of alimony or maintenance, to a woman from her former husband, provided that for the purpose of making such payments the former husband has not diverted from himself any income producing assistance or diverted from himself income upon which he would otherwise have been liable to tax. This exemption has been a feature of the income tax law for very many years and, although it has been examined on a number of occasions, successive Governments have not seen their way clear to change the law.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) To amend the law in the direction suggested would require a provision to allow a deduction to eligible taxpayers for alimony or maintenance payments to their former partners. This would be contrary to the basic principle of the income tax law that deduction is only allowable for expenditure incurred in gaining or producing assessable income. Expenditure of a private nature is precluded from deduction. Furthermore the proposal would place divorced persons who pay alimony or maintenance to their former partners in a more advantageous position than a married taxpayer who contributes to the maintenance of his or her spouse during a year and who is limited to a concessional rebate of $800 in respect of that maintenance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The system of income tax rebates for the maintenance of dependent children under 16 years of age or of dependent student children between the ages of 16 and 25 was terminated in 1976 when the present scheme of family allowances was introduced. Little entitlement existed under that system to claim a rebate for a child engaged in full-time employment because the rebate was reduced by $1 for every $4 by which the child's separate net income exceeded $170.</PARA>
<PARA> The allowance of an income tax deduction for children who are apprenticed would necessitate a reconstruction of the personal income tax system. It could not be considered in isolation from the question of an income tax deduction for dependent children generally. Consequently, it would be difficult to justify an amendment to the law solely in the direction sought.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 31 March 1981 (Hansard, page 885) Senator Jessop asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Has the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations noted a Press statement indicating that the maritime unions have imposed what they consider to be an effective ban on the shipment of uranium through the port of Darwin? Is it a fact that a large number of unionists in Australia are in favour of exporting uranium in the interests of overseas trade and the consequent benefit to the Australian economy? What is the Government doing to ensure that this valuable overseas trade is safeguarded? Is it a fact that under section 51 (i) of the Constitution the Commonwealth has the power to legislate in respect of matters that interfere with interstate or overseas trade? If these unions persist with their current attitude, will the Government consider introducing appropriate legislation to deal with the situation?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government's commitment to the mining and export of uranium is well known and it is continually reviewing options open to Government and the industry to ensure Australian producers are able to meet their supply commitments with overseas utilities. Australia values its reputation as a reliable supplier of resources and the Government has no intention of seeing that reputation marred.</PARA>
<PARA> In this regard you will be aware that on 19 June, Mary Kathleen Uranium effected shipment of export contracts through Brisbane notwithstanding certain union action. Similarly Queensland Mines Ltd and Earth Resources of Australia arranged shipment through Darwin on 10 July to meet their obligations to overseas buyers. In both cases, the Government was in close consultation with the companies concerned and was determined to demonstrate that Australia's uranium would be transported by established commercial means.</PARA>
<PARA> Despite the attitudes of some members of unions such as the Seamens Union of Australia and the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, and the current policy of the ACTU which is opposed to uranium mining and export, development of the industry in the Northern Territory has proceeded without major difficulty and current mining operaions at Mary Kathleen in Queensland have not been unduly affected. This demonstrates that a significant sector of the trade union movement is prepared to co-operate in the development of the industry.</PARA>

<PARA> Is the Minister aware that, due to the increasing popularity of subscriber trunk dialling calls, it has become very difficult to make such calls between the hours of 6.30 and 8 each evening and that this results in the first 0 digit in such calls consistently returning an engaged signal during this period? As 000 represents the emergency number for citizens to call the ambulance, fire brigade and police, does the Minister recognise that failure to reach that emergency centre because of the heavy use of the digit 0 could result in tragedy or suffering?

However, the acquisition of real estate by an individual foreign person up to a cumulative value of $350,000 is not subject to review if the transaction does not fall within the scope of the Foreign Takeovers Act 1975. Accordingly, a person who is not an Australian resident may be in a position to acquire real estate up to a total value of $350,000 without the need to obtain approval under the Government's foreign investment policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The exemption from review was introduced in order to simplify the administrative procedures, against the background of experience which indicated that many transactions involving the acquisition of real estate valued at less than $350,000 were made by intending migrants and Australian citizens living abroad.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is aware of comments made in the press and elsewhere expressing concern at the effects of foreign investment on the Australian real estate market. It is, however, important to place in perspective foreign investment in Australian real estate. In 1979-80, New South Wales was the State which attracted most interest regarding investment in real estate by foreign interests. Foreign Investment Review Board and Reserve Bank statistics indicate that in that year there were 269 foreign acquisitions of urban real estate in New South Wales involving a total consideratoin of $97m; figures provided under the Real Estate and Property Act of New South Wales show that in the same year there were in total over 200,000 transactions with an aggregate value of over $9,000m. These data are not strictly comparable but the orders of magnitude implied are not likely to be misleading.</PARA>
<PARA> Hence, while the Government does not have specific data on the number of houses owned by persons who do not reside in Australia, the above-mentioned statistics indicate that foreign investment in urban real estate in Australia comprises only a very small proportion of the total.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not clear what would be gained by adopting the honourable senator's suggestion regarding social security numbers. Proposals that come before the Government are those involving acquisitions of property by foreign residents. If there are cases in which the question of whether a person involved is an Australian or foreign resident, the advice of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is obtained.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 19 August 1981 (Hansard, page 52) Senator Walsh asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice concerning the availability of finance for farmers in drought affected areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The States provide carry-on loans at concessional rates of interest to assist primary producers within their areas affected by drought. A State's expenditure on carry-on loans is eligible to attract Commonwealth assistance under the terms and conditions of the natural disaster relief arrangements. Under the arrangements the Commonwealth is not involved in the detailed administration of relief assistance. The States, in line with their overall responsibility for natural disaster relief, administer the provision of carry-on loans and determine the eligibility for assistance of particular primary producers, subject to guidelines agreed to with the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> While detailed information regarding the provision of such carry-on loans would need to be obtained from the States, the guidelines for such loans, while varying in some details from State to State, in general restrict the availability of such loans to primary producers who are:</PARA>
<PARA> in necessitous circumstances as a result of the drought;</PARA>
<PARA> unable to obtain finance through normal commercial channels;</PARA>
<PARA> in working occupation of their properties and who derive their main income from such properties; and</PARA>
<PARA> considered to have a potentially viable enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA> Following the decision to raise the maximum interest rates which banks can charge on overdrafts drawn under limits of less than $100,000, with effect from 3 December 1980, the Treasurer reached an understanding with the banks that any resulting increases in interest rates would not apply to farmers and others adversely affected by the drought in drought-declared areas for the duration of the drought. The concession is administered by banks on a case by case basis on application by individual borrowers to the respective banks. That understanding was extended to include the further increase in the permitted maximum rate which took effect from 17 August 1981. This concession does not apply where the overdraft limit equals or exceeds $100,000.</PARA>
<PARA> These arrangements are intended to provide relief to those who are suffering from the severity of the drought and they are essentially temporary in nature. The majority of farmers pay the same interest rates as other borrowers for their finance, depending, inter alia, on whether the loan is above or below $100,000.</PARA>
<PARA> The maximum interest rate for loans of less than $100,000 by trading and savings banks for owner-occupied housing is, as the honourable senator noted, 12 1/2 per cent which is itself a concessional rate when compared to the great majority of other bank lending.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 23 September 1981, (Hansard, pages 895, 897-898), Senator Hearn asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Communications, a question without notice concerning the possibility of Telecom making the Porta Printer available on a rental basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Porta Printer, like many other devices available for use by the handicapped, is but one of a wide range of products approved by Telecom for connection to the network and marketed by private enterprise. In the case of the Porta Printer, Telecom is acting as a distributor for the importer-Intercept Communications Pty Ltd-to make it easier for deaf people throughout Australia to obtain and utilise this new product.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom has given consideration to the Honourable Senator's suggestion of making the Porta Printer available on a rental basis but regrets it is not in a position to include in its range of customer facilities special equipment of this type, for which at this stage there is a fairly limited demand. Moreover, even if it were practicable to offer the unit on a rental basis, the level of rental to cover provision and maintenance would be such that it would not be an attractive alternative to the outright purchase of the equipment. It will be appreciated that there are very significant costs in establishing and maintaining the national telecommunications network. It is necessary therefore that the charges for services provided by Telecom be set at rates which enable it to operate as efficiently and economically as practicable. In general, this requires that charges for services be set at rates which reflect the cost of their provision and maintenance.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom is mindful of the needs of the handicapped and is contributing resources and expertise towards increasing the range and availability of products for the handicapped generally. The Government's position on this matter is that financial assistance to make these facilities more readily available to the handicapped should be funded by taxpayers generally through the Government's social security program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 27 August 1981, (Hansard, page 378) Senator Townley asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Communications, a question without notice concerning public telephones.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Public telephones are considerably more costly to provide and maintain than subscriber telephone services for which Telecom receives annual rental, and the extra revenue derived from the marginally higher call fees presently paid by public telephone users; 10c compared to 9c falls far short of meeting operating costs. Currently, the loss on the public telephone service is of the order of $37m annually, which means that effectively it is being subsidised by telephone subscribers to the extent of about $7 a year per subscriber's service.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom does not expect the public telephone service to be self-supporting and even with the proposed increase in the public telephone local call fee from 10 cents to 20 cents, which is in line with the CPI increase since 1 October 1974 when the fee was last increased, the service will still operate at a loss.</PARA>
<PARA> Against this background, the decision to increase the fee to 20 cents was based on the amount needed to make up at least part of the financial shortfall in public telephone operations rather than on the conversion costs or the level of the public telephone fees overseas. In regard to the latter, in the United States of America the unit fee ranges from 20 to 25 cents, in Canada from 10 to 20 cents, while in the United Kingdom local calls are timed-8 cents for three minutes. It should be noted too that local call areas in Australia are large by world standards.</PARA>
<PARA> An increase in the fee to 15 cents was justified some years ago but, at that time, the resources necessary to effect the conversion would have diverted effort from the public telephone modernisation program. That program, commenced in 1976 and involving the progressive replacement of a variety of older type instruments with the Japanese manufactured CT3 multi-purpose units, is nearing completion.</PARA>
<PARA> The result is that most areas now have a modern and considerably more reliable public telephone service, and by deferring a fee increase, public telephone callers have enjoyed cheaper calls than would normally have been the case. At the same time, Telecom has avoided the high costs that would have been involved in converting the coin mechanism of a variety of instruments for 15 cent operation and minimised the cost of converting to 20 cent operation. Conversion of the CT3 instruments, a number of which have been modified to accept 50 cent coins for trials of ISD in high usage areas such as international airports, is simpler than many of the older type units.</PARA>
<PARA> No public telephones will be made obsolete by the increase in the local call fee. On the other hand, the changeover of public telephones to 20 cents operation will not enable Telecom to liberalise the provision of new installations. It will continue its present policy of providing public telephones where there is a researched need for such facility and where it can expect a return from the facility to cover, to a reasonable extent, the costs associated with its provision and maintenance.</PARA>
<PARA> The CT3 units, although relatively costly, have proved considerably resistant to vandalism and for this reason, coupled with the fact that they cater for both local and STD calls as well as telegram lodgements. Telecom prefers to continue its policy of providing these units in all installations in street locations. Because of the vandalism problem, wherever practicable Telecom seeks to meet community needs by leasing to business people coin telephones installed in protected and supervised locations. In these situations less expensive units (Red phones) can be used, though for user convenience it is desirable that they should cater for STD calls as well as local calls. In this regard, tenders are currently being evaluated for a new leased coin telephone which will provide STD facilities, a feature currently not available on Red phones.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom continually monitors technological developments and consideration will be given to introducing any less expensive public coin telephones that become available and which would be suitable for use in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 8 September 1981 (Hansard, page 498) Senator Townley asked the Minister representing the Treasurer, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In view of the prevailing high interest rates, will the Government examine the possibility of adding interest to taxation refunds at the same interest rate as the Taxation Office charges on overdue payments? In other words, if a refund is mailed out at the end of August, the taxpayer could expect to receive two months' interest added to that refund. Secondly, if the Taxation Office objects to an item which has been deducted by a taxpayer but which it eventually allows, will the Government consider adding interest to the refunded amount so that the taxpayer is treated in a fair way?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> As indicated when the honourable senator's question was asked, the matter of interest being paid by the Taxation Office has been raised previously. I am advised that there is no legislative authority for the payment of interest by the Taxation Office. The matter has, however, been considered by governments from time to time over many years. On each occasion the conclusion has been reached that, because the cost of administering the scheme and paying the interest would need to be passed on to the general taxpayer, incorporation of the concept in the law would not be generally advantageous.</PARA>

I undertook to check the factual contents of the Press article and have the relevant Minister look at the question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment has supplied the following information in response to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no substance in the media reports that the Commonwealth and Victorian governments have agreed to develop the international standard motor racing circuit in Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA> Since the Prime Minister announced in his policy statement on 30 September 1980 that the Commonwealth Government would help establish an international standard motor racing circuit in the Australian Capital Territory, a number of representations proposing alternative sites for the circuit have been received. In the light of these representations, the whole question of the location of the racing circuit has been re-examined by the Government in consultation with the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport (CAMS). A decision on the location of the circuit will be made by the Government in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth's contribution to the development of the circuit will be under the International Standard Sports Facilities Program for which the Government has provided $25m over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA> The responsibility for programming races at circuits throughout Australia is a matter for the respective motor sport bodies and I am sure that they would take into consideration the significance of the Easter and October motor racing events at Bathurst when determining the timing of any World Driver's Championship event in Australia. As the level of attendance at any sporting event in Australia is beyond the Government's control the question of compensation for the Bathurst City Council is not relevant.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia Post is required, under the terms of the Postal Services Act 1975, to meet all of its operating costs and to provide at least half of its capital expenditure from revenue. In this context, unless otherwise determined by the Government, postal charges are set so that users of the services generally pay the cost of providing them.</PARA>
<PARA> The financial burden placed on Australia Post as a result of the very generous concessions provided for registered publications is of particular concern. For 1980-81 the deficit incurred as a result of registered publication concessions has been assessed at around $19 million. A deficit of this order is equivalent to about 1c on each standard letter posted.</PARA>
<PARA> Higher registered publications charges, to take effect from 14 December 1981, are not expected to prevent the loss currently generated by the service from rising by nearly $2 million in 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> Eligibility requirements are set out in the Australian Postal Commission Postal By-Laws. Unless publications satisfy the special conditions prescribed in the Postal By-Laws for inclusion in Category A, publications eligible for registration are classified as Category B publications.</PARA>
<PARA> Classification as a Category A publication is restricted to four types of organisations and registration is determined according to the dominant aims, intention or conduct of the person or organisation involved. Moreover, the dominant intention of the organisation in publishing the publication is significant.</PARA>
<PARA> Category A registration is restricted to publications which are:</PARA>
<PARA> published by an organisation, the dominant purpose of which is the investigation or relief of particular disabilities of individual persons. Additionally, the publication must consist mainly of articles relating to that dominant purpose;</PARA>
<PARA> published by a religious organisation and containing articles which relate to the interests of members of that organisation. (Publications reflecting social, recreational and scholastic activities are excluded);</PARA>
<PARA> A 'returned servicemen's' publication; or</PARA>
<PARA> a 'country interest' publication.</PARA>
<PARA> (Note: Specifically excluded from registration as Category A publications are the publications of the following types of organisations: social, recreational, motorists, employer/employee, business (other than primary production) and professional.)</PARA>
<PARA> Lions, Apex and Rotary publications are classified as Category B publications. Cateogory B rates offer a very generous concession on ordinary postage rates. (In most instances, Category A registration would provide only a further two cents per copy reduction.)</PARA>
<PARA> Australia Post has examined the constituent documents and activities of the Apex, Lions and Rotary organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> It is recognised that these organisations are interested in and carry out worthwhile work in respect of the relief of disabilities of individual persons. However, activities of this nature do not rank as the dominant purpose and function of these organistaions. Furthermore, their publications generally reflect the wider-based interests of the organisation and are concerned largely with administrative and social matters.</PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the publications of Lions, Apex and Rotary are not eligible for Category A registration. They will continue to receive significant concessions, however, as Category B registered publications.</PARA>
