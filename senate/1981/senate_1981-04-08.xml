<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4N7">Senator O'BYRNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer the Minister to a question I asked him a month ago, on 10 March, about an accident near Port Macquarie which involved radioactive material. The Minister will have noted that today two Sydney newspapers carry front-page stories on the subsequent illness of policemen and journalists who were on duty during the clean-up after the road accident. I refer to the Daily Telegraph which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The township of Laurieton, with a population of 8000, could be poisoned through its water after a truck accident last December, says Dr John Mackay, of Port Macquarie.</PARA>
<PARA>Another article which appeared in the Sun Herald refers to policemen being exposed to radiation. As the Minister undertook to provide me with further information about the lines of communication between police headquarters and the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, I ask whether any attempt has been made to trace the food which was on the truck. I further ask whether his Department has now provided him with this information. Has the Minister looked at the State laws and regulations and decided whether they are as comprehensive as he would desire?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1202" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I read with some concern the reports in the newspapers today. As Senator O'Byrne will know, I sought to find the best expert advice on the matter when he raised it with me. He will recall that the incident happened on the day I left Australia to go abroad, so I did not have personal and immediate information. I do not have any reason to change the information I gave him at the time. As a result of this morning's newspaper articles I have been in touch with my officers. I have asked them to ask the Health Commission of New South Wales, which is the body to which the doctor apparently refers, whether it has done any sampling of the water supply, which can be done very readily, and also whether it has done any medical tests. Indeed, I asked my officers to request the Commission to carry out such tests if it has not already done so. The advice we received was, as the honourable senator may know, that there was an accident. Blood tests were carried out on two policemen who were at the site and who reportedly showed radiation illness. Tests showed that reported symptoms could not have been caused by exposure to radiation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a need, I think, to clean up a few matters of detail. The accident happened on 4 December 1980. The Atomic Energy Commission has advised that its records show that the State police telephoned at 8.20 a.m., not 7.30 a.m. as has been suggested, seeking answers to two specific questions. There was confirmation that an Atomic Energy Commission officer who was already at the scene of the accident was competent to advise on safety measures, and that was so. The officer was on vacation at Port Macquarie and had responded to news reports of the accident. There was a determination of the likely nature of the material in the drums. These questions were referred to safety officers at 8.40 a.m. who initiated appropriate action including consultation with the State Health Commission which requested that the Atomic Energy Commission officer at the accident site undertake an investigation on its behalf. The State police did not seek emergency assistance from the Atomic Energy Commission. There was no breach of procedures.</PARA>
<PARA> Regarding the foodstuffs involved in the accident, all damaged items were buried while undamaged items were forwarded to consignees after notification to the State health authorities. The goods were in transit to Queensland. So those damaged items would have been buried. I note that it is reported in the News Digest this morning that the New South Wales Minister for Health, Mr Kevin Stewart, denied claims of a massive cover-up over an accident involving a truck carrying highly dangerous radioactive material. Whilst I believe that to be true, because of the public responsibility for all these matters, I will pursue the matter further.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find that it is desirable to allow time for interjections because often they assist in the journey. The fact of the matter is that the Australian Atomic Energy Commission had diagnosed the nature of the radioactive material. That information has been made available. I understand that also on the truck were some herbicidal and fungicidal materials, I think DDT and other materials. They in themselves could be contaminants. That has to be recognised. All of these matters are essentially and primarily matters for the Health Commission of New South Wales, which accepts its responsibility. I will pose the questions to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Earlier in my answer today I indicated that I would ask my officers to get in touch with the Health Commission to pursue the matter and to check whether a sampling of water has been carried out. We will consult the New South Wales Health Commission about what steps it has taken to determine, in conjunction with the local doctor, the possible nature of the illnesses involved. The important thing is that the correct diagnosis be made. It is possible that the symptoms are from other causes. If they are caused by radiation we want to know as much as any other Australian.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T7">Senator TOWNLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It relates to South Africa. I ask whether the Minister saw the article in yesterday's Canberra Times by Mr Bremer Hofmeyr, a former South African Rhodes Scholar, in which he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But there is a deeper strategy in the minds of the real ideologists of boycott. For them economic development that improves the lot of the blacks is not to be supported but to be blocked.</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on further to impress that an effective boycott would contribute to mass misery and unemployment, mainly amongst the blacks, and therefore would help to create a climate for all-out black violence.</PARA>
<PARA> Does the Government recognise that trade between South Africa and some of the black African states increased by about 60 per cent last year, to about $1,120m? Does the Government recognise that nine black African states, including some Commonwealth countries, now fly their aircraft regularly into South Africa; and that the Mauritius Government, which frequently in the past led attacks on South Africa at the United Nations, is considering exchanging ambassadors with South Africa as well as allowing its aircraft to fly into the country, after a break of some four years? Finally, in the light of these matters, is the Minister aware that the only people really missing out by our boycott and by Qantas Airways Ltd not resuming flights between Australia and South Africa are the non-whites in South Africa and the Australian people? When will the Government cease allowing itself to be blackmailed by some African states, many of whom are flying in to and increasingly trading with South Africa?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I did notice the article referred to by Senator Townley, but I am not able to provide answers to the several questions which he asked. Perhaps it is appropriate to state in a more general way that there have been increased calls for the application of sanctions against South Africa. The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to meet later this month to consider the question. If the Security Council decides to implement sanctions under chapter VII of its Charter, these would be mandatory and all members of the United Nations would be obliged to observe them. In considering the issue, members of the Security Council will obviously assess carefully the full implications of sanctions for the black majority population of South Africa and for the states which neighbour South Africa. The number of questions raised will be referred to the Minister for Foreign Affairs for appropriate information.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate or to whoever the appropriate Minister may be. Has the Minister seen the latest survey of international trade prospects by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which points out that a key factor in the present international malaise is the widely held belief in industrialised countries that the problems of adjustment in problem industries such as the textile industry should be left until their economies achieve a higher growth rate? The GATT report points out that because the future of these industries is inherently doubtful they cannot generate a decisive investment momentum, even behind increased protection, and that at the same time protection lowers the prospects of more promising national industries. The report goes on to comment that protection inhibits industrial investment opportunities in the less developed countries and their export potential. Does the Government accept the views of GATT? If so, why do we continue to afford high levels of protection for labour intensive industries accepted as being unsuitable for developed economies, thereby reducing the capacity of less developed countries to generate export income essential to meet the problem of high oil prices and to develop economies essential to a stable world economic situation?</PARA></TALK.START>

The fact is that there is a very real reason for concern about the quality and quantity of water flowing to South Australia. It is because of that that the Commonwealth Government has been expediting the new agreement for the River Murray waters. It is also because of that that the Commonwealth Government has been looking not only to quantity but also to quality and has been consulting all States, and specifically New South Wales, in that regard. Yes, we are aware of the situation. It is a very important problem indeed. The Government believes a proper finalisation of that agreement will go a very considerable distance towards the regulation of quality and quantity of water in the River Murray.</PARA></TALK.START>

With the appointment now announced of the new Director of the Bureau, and with its operations due to commence this month, will the Minister table all the papers relating to the formation of the Bureau which was announced on 6 February? Does the Government still claim, as it was certainly claiming last year, that the establishment of the Bureau is in accordance with the recommendation of the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs, chaired by Mr Justice Williams, when it knows, or it ought to know, that such recommendations of that royal commission related only to intelligence associated with drug offences and not to criminal intelligence generally? What steps, if any, have been taken to ensure that adequate safeguards will be produced to surround the creation and operation of this Bureau, especially to meet the concerns of the Australian Law Reform Commission relating to the dissemination of information obtained by it and procedures whereby persons can check information about them in certain circumstances to see whether it is misleading or untruthful?

This opposition has been frequently stated and the French Government is well aware of the Government's position on this matter. However, it is not our practice to lodge a protest with the country concerned whenever a nuclear weapons state carries out an underground explosion. Since 1975 all the French tests at Mururoa Atoll have been conducted underground. The Government does, however, make formal approaches to the country concerned whenever an atmospheric test is conducted. The last such occasion was when approaches were made to China in October of 1980. Our information is that in recent years France has conducted about 10 underground tests each year. Australia has long been committed to the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty which would bring about an end to nuclear testing by all states in all environments. Such a treaty would clearly increase international pressure for an end to all testing and leave those states which continued to test in an isolated and exposed position.</PARA></TALK.START>

No matter how authoritative these newspapers may be, I still think the conclusions that Senator Mulvihill has drawn are beyond what is established even in the articles. The fact of the matter is that Mr Bennett, who was apparently employed in the intelligence section of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police some years ago and who was retired on medical grounds, came to Australia, as far as we know, in 1973. The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs informs me that it has no record of his arrival. The position is that in 1973 a British or Canadian citizen was not required to have prior approval to enter Australia. The visa requirements and other requirements that Senator Mulvihill has mentioned did not come into force until 1 January 1975. Now, of course, the checks required to be made on anybody from Britain or the United States who wishes to come to Australia are the same as those made on people from other countries. I do not think there is any real support for Senator Mulvihill's concern that Australia is likely to become some new twentieth century Botany Bay to which people can come without having any checks at all made on them.

Inquiries I have made since then indicate that the material spilled from that drum, an isotope of americium 241, is regarded by experts as highly dangerous material. Whatever the facts of the incident involving the lorry turn out to be, whether people have radiation sickness or not, will the Government consider introducing legislation, in consultation with State governments, to establish a register to record imports of radioactive material and the movement of that material within Australia? Could such legislation also provide for clear labelling of containers of radioactive material to avoid risk of injury or contamination of persons or property and so that people can assess containers and the message on them from some distance away? Could such legislation include, and I regard this as being most important, provisions for the nuclear industry itself to pay for the cost of such regulation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the nature of the radioactive materials, it is acknowledged that they were of significant radioactive quality. It has never been suggested otherwise. I also mentioned today that two other toxic materials, DDT and fungicide, were involved, and perhaps there is some misunderstanding as to the material spilled. The understanding I have, based on advice both from the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, bearing in mind that that would be from a technical officer on the spot, and from the New South Wales Health Commission, is that no radioactive material escaped. That is the advice I have been given and I see no reason to quarrel with it. It ought to be possible to determine whether the drums were secure. The honourable senator will know that there are State health regulations on radioactivity to cover the nature and protection of the packaging of materials. I have not determined what was the packaging, but the Commission has not advised me of any infringement of regulations in any way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I direct myself to the substantive nature of the question having put the matter in perspective, as I understand it. If there is any more information on the incident which would alter what I have said, I am eager to know it. Having said that, there are very strong rules regarding the packaging and movement of containers, and I think-I would need to check it-there is some registration within the States. For my part, as a responsible Minister, I certainly have responsibility for the maintenance of a register of radioactive materials in the wider sense. The Australian Safeguards Office, of course, exists in the wider sense. One of the problems that we have-and Senator Mason would understand this-is that with the growing industrial use of radioactive isotopes and materials there is much more movement of them and therefore much more likelihood of some accident.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the specifics, such as the nature of the materials being printed clearly, my understanding is that warnings are printed. If they are not large enough, I will look into the matter. As to the owner bearing the cost, which I think is the latter element of the question, I will look at that again. Let me say that whenever an accident occurs-one or two have happened at Mascot in the last few years-we have looked very closely at the regulations that exist, both State and Federal. It is our sole goal to try to eliminate or, if not, to mitigate to the ultimate degree any kind of accident.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under existing legislation the Government would not have the power to direct the form of investment of life offices in the way that might have been suggested in the question by Senator Watson. Apart from the provisions of the Income Tax Act relating to the 30-20 provisions for holdings of government securities, the life offices are presently free to make investments in the interests of their own policy holders on the basis of their own best judgments commercially. To require the redirection of these funds would accordingly cut across the responsibilities of the offices to their policy holders and to their shareholders. In any case, I do not see advantage flowing from a direction of the kind that was implied in the question from Senator Watson. Such a direction would not ease the demand for finance or the pressure on interest rates. If finance from one source, the life offices, is forcibly directed away from companies such as those listed on stock exchanges, then those companies will simply have to compete more forcibly for funds from other sources, with consequent upward pressure on interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If there is a concern about the availability of finance for home building and small business, that concern can be answered in the end only by ensuring that the relevant interest rates reasonably reflect market realities. This factor was instrumental in the Government's decision last December to remove the restrictions on interest rates applying to bank deposits. Alternatively, if there is concern about the level of interest rates, that concern can be answered in the end only by a policy which reduces inflation and hence reduces interest rates.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Mr President, I think that extends considerably the matters that I was outlining in my answer to the question. The capital formation market is one that is heavily influenced by the investment of life offices and other large institutions, but I refrain from comment on the suggestion that an extension of any policy that may have been discussed would necessarily lead to an opportunity for nationalisation of all industries. I think it is fair to say that the portfolio investments of the large life houses and other large lending institutions is very influential in capital formation in this country, but as far as further legislation from this Government is concerned, that is not in contemplation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, refers to merchant seamen, the Repatriation Act and, in particular, the case of Mr Meredith who has for some years made important submissions to Ministers, including the present Minister, claiming entitlement under the Repatriation Act for disabilities incurred while he was a prisoner of war in Japan from 1942 to 1945. The Minister may recall that he recently told Mr Meredith that he is not entitled to benefits under the Repatriation Act. As I understand it, at the same time, the Minister has received deputations on this matter and has promised a review of it. Does the Minister's reply to Mr Meredith claiming that Mr Meredith has no entitlements represent the final view on that matter, or is the Minister considering the general matter at present? Is he likely to make some announcement in the near future?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry that I am unable to recall exactly the circumstances of Mr Meredith's case. The situation is that if Mr Meredith was a merchant seaman and a prisoner of war in Japan, I understand that he would be eligible for treatment benefits in the normal way. On the other hand, if he was a merchant seaman who does not so qualify he would perhaps be seeking a Service pension in the same way as a number of other merchant seaman are at present. If he is in that circumstance he does fall into the general category. That is a Budget matter and something which the Government will be taking into account in the lead-up to the Budget this year.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment. Is it a fact that the World Heritage Committee will be holding its annual international conference in Sydney in October this year? Is it likely that the chairman of the conference will be an Australian? Is it true that the Australian Heritage Commission has taken a leading part in organising this conference? Is it also true that the Register of the National Estate, which is a monumental task undertaken by the Heritage Commission and the most important record ever produced in Australia of our natural and cultural heritage, will be published as an illustrated 1,200-page volume in time for the conference as the world's first comprehensive record of this kind?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator has sought information on several matters relating to the World Heritage Committee and the Australian Heritage Commission. The fifth session of the World Committee will be held in Sydney on 26-30 October this year. I understand that it has been the practice at previous meetings for the host country to provide the chairman, but a final decision will be made at the meeting. So it is not possible at this stage to give a definite answer to that first part of the honourable senator's question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The meeting in Australia is being organised by a local committee which is chaired by the Chairman of the Australian Heritage Commission and which also includes the Director of the Commission as a member. Four places have been nominated by Australia for the world heritage list and the nominations will be considered by that meeting to be held in October. The four places are the Kakadu National Park, the Great Barrier Reef region, the Willandra Lakes region and the Sydney Opera House in its setting with the Harbour Bridge and surrounding waterways.</PARA>
<PARA> By coincidence, as the honourable senator advises, the Macmillan company plans to publish in late August 1981 a book entitled The Heritage of Australia-The Illustrated Register of the National Estate. This 1,200-page book will contain an entry for each of the 6,000 or so places in the Register and photographs of most of these places. The Australian Heritage Commission has supplied much of the material on which the entries have been based. I am informed that no other country has compiled and published such a comprehensive record of its national and cultural heritage. I believe the events of this year and the publication of this book reflect great credit upon the Australian Heritage Commission.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some information on this matter for Senator Kilgariff. I understand that the basic situation is that Northern Airlines approached the Minister's Department some weeks ago proposing that the Department assign the coastal surveillance contract to Transecutive Pty Ltd. Since that approach, the advice we have received from the companies involved and from officers of the Northern Territory Government indicates that that Government has been developing an arrangement with Ansett Airlines of Australia to provide a range of regional regular public transport and contract aviation services. Temporary arrangements have been made with Transecutive to carry out surveillance operations on a subcontract basis for Northern Airlines until 10 April. These interim arrangements were established to allow the Northern Territory Government and the companies concerned to agree on suitable long term arrangements. I should stress that at no time has the contractual situation been allowed to hinder the operation of the coastal surveillance program. The Minister hopes that he will be in a position very soon to announce a longer term arrangement as to the contracts.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Archer asked me a question about benefits for twins and triplets. I gave him an answer which is correct but I want to refer to it again because of a quite extraordinary report on this morning's national news on the Australian Broadcasting Commission which put an interpretation on my answer which I found extremely puzzling. For the benefit of those who have children who are twins or triplets, or who anticipate doing so, I would like to clarify my answer. I suppose the thing that looked out at me this morning in the ABC report was that I was quoted as saying: 'There are unfortunate additional costs for couples who have multiple births'. Any suggestion that additional costs are unfortunate in that circumstance I utterly reject, and it cannot be drawn from my answer. I think one child is very nice, two children are even nicer, and three are even better. I certainly said nothing in my answer to suggest that I thought the costs were unfortunate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I did not refer, as the ABC report suggested, to payment of special benefits. The expression 'special benefits' relates to a particular benefit administered by my Department. What I said was that the Government would consider financial assistance to the parents of twins and triplets when it formulates this year's Budget. I did not say there was already a provision for special payments to the parents of quadruplets. What I said was that it is normally the practice for an act of grace payment to be made for quadruplets and that this payment is made by the Department of Finance. I did not, as was suggested by the ABC, make any connection between a payment which might be made for twins and triplets and the Department of Finance.</PARA>
<PARA> I make that explanation because when the rather odd report was raised with the ABC this morning my office was told simply that the comments would be noted, and the noting of comments privately in the Press Gallery is unlikely to ensure that the people of Australia get accurate reports.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The subject of this matter of public importance is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Government to support and foster the development of Australia's major public enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA>In a sense that is an understatement of the sorts of matters with which we wish to deal. In the past few weeks and months the situation regarding Australian public enterprises, or government enterprises, has become worse and worse. A variety of attacks on government enterprises have been made. The attacks have been based not on any sound principles of government but on knee-jerk ideological rhetoric. It is because of that that we raise this matter today, in the sense that we hope to flush out some debate on these issues rather than our having just the sort of blinkered approach which has been apparent in statements made by Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer at the beginning of my remarks to a number of quite hare-brained propositions which have been floated around on the Government side of this Parliament. They have been propositions of the utmost banality, if I may so describe them. The first of these propositions is that government enterprises are, almost by definition, inefficient. The second proposition is that the cure for inefficiency is, in all cases, competition or, alternatively, turning government enterprises into private enterprises. All that is based on a number of ideological cliches to which I shall refer in the course of my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> At the beginning I want to examine some of the fundamental weaknesses in those sorts of arguments, if they can be described as arguments, which have been put forward on the Government side of this Parliament. As I said, there has been a lot of talk about inefficiency in government enterprises. From the suggestion that government enterprises are inefficient, the conceptual leap is taken to saying that, conversely, the opposite of government enterprises-that is, private enterprises-are necessarily efficient. I find that an extraordinarily strange argument to come from a government which feather-beds inefficient private enterprises by imposing high tariffs and by providing an across-the-board investment allowance, all funded out of taxpayers' moneys, and applied irrespective of the efficiency or otherwise of those private enterprises. The Government does that as a matter of policy. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not find people such as Senator Lewis raising their little social consciousness and screaming their heads off about that aspect of private enterprise, many inefficient sectors of which are totally dependent upon government support, provided either by tariffs or allowances such as the investment allowance, in which millions of dollars of taxpayers' money are spent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, he does not. He asks about alleged errors in the telephone bills of peope in Warrnambool. The second point I make-it is a simple point-is that government enterprises report to this Parliament. Their reports are made available to the Parliament, but they are not very frequently debated in a detailed way. I pay a tribute to Senator Rae because he is one of those honourable senators who are prepared to debate the reports of government enterprises in a detailed and, in many senses, a constructive way. I do not always agree with him in the approach he adopts. That is the sort of thing that this Parliament ought to do. Also, the accounts of government enterprises are always audited. The audited accounts are available for constructive comment in the course of debates on those matters. Those reports provide an opportunity for us to see where inefficiencies lie in those public enterprises. When inefficiencies are alleged and revealed it should be the Government's business and the business of this Parliament to do something about them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third point which often is raised is the suggestion that competition is the great virtue. Competition is said to be the virtue which ensures efficiency. Need I remind honourable senators that this is the Government which says that it believes in that great virtue but has watered down the provisions of the trade practices legislation which encourages competition. It has done that as a matter of conscious policy. It is also a government which talks about competition but does not allow competition where it does not suit its friends in private industry. I refer, for example, to the airlines and the broadcasting system. Senator Lewis will have his opportunity, when that legislation comes into the Senate, to show his colours and how much he believes in competition in that area. These are the sorts of areas in which the debate has been pitched at an absurdly banal, ideological level. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What were those words again?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They were 'banal' and 'ideological'. I will provide the honourable senator with a children's dictionary if he wants one. Both words would appear in a children's dictionary. I come to the details of some of these propositions which are bandied about in this glib way. Let us look at some of the facts. I assert, quite frankly, that public enterprises, under governments of all political persuasions, have served Australia well. I use as examples institutions such as Telecom Australia, Australia Post, Trans-Australia Airlines, the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the Australian National Line. We can deal with some of them in greater detail later. All these public enterprises-great Australian enterprises-were developed for two basic reasons: Firstly, private enterprise capital was generally not available to go into the areas in respect of which these government enterprises were developed; and, secondly, public enterprises were seen by all governments in this country and in other countries to be appropriate in these areas. I give an example of recent origin in West Germany. West Germany set up a razor gang-I do not know how to say that in German-which looked at some of the public enterprises in West Germany. One of its recommendations was that the Bundespost, or sections of it, be hived off to private enterprise. The West German Government said no, that as a matter of policy the postal services of the Federal Republic of Germany were appropriately in the hands of the Government and the public sector. That Government, of course, is much admired in many ways for its efficiency by people on both sides of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The futures of these great public enterprises are at risk because of an unhappy conjunction of two bizarre events. The first is the fact that some of these enterprises which operate for the Australian people are now operating in areas of high profitability. The entrepreneurs, who at all times are concerned to get their hands on profits, look with their beady eyes at the profitable government enterprises such as Telecom and say: 'Aha! Just a minute; that looks a little profitable for a government enterprise. We should have that'. They say that not in the interests of the Australian people but in their own interests. I think it is very important to point out the levels of profitability which some of these government enterprises have attained. </PARA>
<PARA> The second unhappy event is the crude ideology of the Fraser Government, the sort of thing to which I referred earlier-sloganeering about the private sector's taking up the slack from the public sector and so on. That is supported by a series of petty complaints, dripping complaints about telephone bills being wrong and things like that. The inference that we are supposed to draw from all of that is that if the Myer organisation or the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd had a monopoly in the telephone business in Australia such errors would not occur. That is bunkum. Monopolies of government and private enterprise have many of the same charateristics. It is about time that we in this Parliament looked at the efficiencies or otherwise of the great private monopolies in Australia which benefit greatly from government moneys-taxpayers' moneys. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course there is, but I ask the honourable senator not to interrupt me. Let us deal with that matter on another occasion. I have said frequently in this chamber-I will say it again and again-that we ought to be debating not these petty, ideological issues but the nature of the mixed economy which would best serve the interests of the Australian people. When I refer to the Australian people, I mean all the Australian people. I take those words from the 1975 policy speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). He said that this was to be a government for all the people. I illustrate that point and the pettiness of some of these attacks on public enterprise by quoting Hugh Stretton. He describes a situation in these terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Day after day I sat around coffee tables and conference tables with public servants and private consultants who banked Commonwealth, flew Qantas, British Airways and TAA, enjoyed high speed trains and geometrically designed super highways, trusted the radio beams in the sky and the admiralty charts at sea and the ordinance maps in the bush, used Government loans to buy Government houses, framed and lined with government softwood, preferred public to private superannuation, shot their children with Salk and Sabin, smoked gauloise, and fuelled their Leylands and Renaults with BP, but still knew in their bones as a fact of life beyond any rational dispute whatever, that the private sector is the only productive sector, and that public ownership and management are always, everywhere, incurably inefficient. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, as I said a minute ago, I am concerned about enterprises which serve the whole of this nation. I refer the Senate to a few brief facts about some of those enterprises. For example, Telecom is the largest enterprise in Australia. It has enormous fixed assets of over $7 billion. In 1979-80 it added $1,003 million to those fixed assets. It installed more than half a million telephones. In that year the telephone network grew by 66 per cent, telexes by 14.8 per cent and the data networks by 34.3 per cent. It has a total full time staff of 88,000 people and a great research capacity. It made a return on assets of 2.8 per cent after payment of interest and 7.7 per cent before payment of interest. It has not raised telephone or telex charges since September 1975. There is no other enterprise in Australia, public or private, which can say that. If, after looking at that situation in a corporation such as Telecom, we say that it should improve its performance then there are all sorts of processes that can be set up to see that it does that. I will point to one of the factors in Telecom's incapacity to provide the services that it would like to provide. It is mentioned in the last report of the Chairman of Telecom. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> Despite these record connections to match consumer demand, there are some high growth areas where the number of people waiting for a telephone service is unfortunately increasing. This trend has been commented on in recent Annual Reports. It flows from having to balance the Capital Investment Program too finely to match the Government's desire for a limitation on investment in the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>Generally we have a good standard of service-</PARA>
<PARA>But Telecom cannot deal with the peak load problems until that limitation on investment, imposed by the Government, is dealt with in a satisfactory way. So the Telecom report simply says that the inhibitions on its capacity to deliver are dictated by the Fraser Government. The Fraser Government says: 'Telecom is not operating as efficiently as it might and for that reason it ought to have some of its activities hived off and that will make it more efficient'. We have heard that silly argument from some honourable senators also. The defects in Telecom are basically those of Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The sort of problem which the Government is creating for public enterprises is illustrated by the new Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh), who in a recent speech said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the public sector has grown too large to the detriment of the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The public sector is fulfilling roles and meeting needs in areas where the private sector could assume the responsibility. In addition, it could do so at a reduced overall cost in a way which would be more sensitive to the needs that have to be met and which would encourage one of the enduring principles which I feel should always be uppermost in any consideration of the performance of both the private and public sectors-the principle of choice. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of off the top of the head, hare-brained remark of a man in the Government who recently has been appointed a Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lewis, as a senator from the country, has all the properties of raw sugar-crude and unrefined-in his interjections in this place. If he went back to his country electors and espoused in detail some of the policies of bunkum that he elaborates on here in interjections, he would have a very interesting reaction. I refer honourable senators to TAA, which the Government proposes to sell. What did the Chairman of TAA say the day after the TAA decision was announced? He said: Beaut! It will be a public company so we will be able to cut out our Fokker Friendship service. That means no air services for the people in the outback of north Queensland, parts of Tasmania and so on. Sir Peter Abeles will not run unprofitable services if he does not have to. Private enterprise will not run unprofitable services if it does not have to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Telecom, has not increased its charges since 1975. Telecom, on a year by year basis, finances the development of the country network of telephone services to the extent of in excess of $200m. If we take away the profitable areas of Telecom-take the cream off the cake-it will surely go bad and some of the friends who donate to the Liberal Party will go well because they will get the profitable business of Telecom. But what will be left for all the citizens of this country? What will be left in the provision of services to the outback and the country areas which Telecom subsidises at this time, day after day, week after week and month after month? If we are to talk about the inefficiencies of Telecom and the need to make Telecom competitive in some way by pinching its more profitable services on which the beady eyes of entrepreneurs have already been fixed, it will be to the detriment of a vast majority of the Australian people. The argument about choice in this context is pure rubbish. </PARA>
<PARA> The essential argument for public ownership of these basic services is the same as it has always been-that there is a social, public and national interest imperative in many areas of their operations. Cross-subsidisation is an essential element of the Australian telecommunications service. It benefits country people enormously. The situation is similar with air services. In the United States of America no government television services were provided for years and years and country communities there went without television. It was only recently, after the coming of community aerial television, that these communities were served. In Australia there has been a deliberate policy of serving all Australians through instrumentalities such as the Australian Broadcasting Commission, Telecom, Trans-Australia Airlines, Australia Post and so on. Of course what is happening now, as I said, is that the beady eyes are fixed on the profitable areas of Australia Post, which is denied the right to compete in a real way with its courier services. Yet these people talk about competition. The beady eyes are fixed on the profitable areas of Telecom, which is denied the right to compete in the installation of PABX terminal facilities. Telecom has been denied the rights to compete by this Government-the great protagonist of competition. Why is this so? This is so because funds have been donated to the Liberal Party by companies which have an interest in getting into this profitable area of Telecom. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again I acknowledge the silver tongued oratory of my colleague from Tasmania, Senator Button. I am running out of words in praise of his dextrous use of language. It is a pity I cannot say the same about the substance of his oratory though. He talked about inefficiency in private enterprise and referred to my ideology. Let me make it perfectly clear to Senator Button and to anyone who happens to be listening to the debate that one of my philosophies is a belief that the larger the enterprise the more inefficient it is. In my book that applies to governments and to public enterprises-by which I understand Senator Button to mean statutory authorities or quasi-autonomous national government organisations-and to private enterprise. It has been my experience that the larger the enterprise the more inefficiencies in it. I do not mind publicly proclaiming that as far as I am concerned the smaller the better for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite Senator Button's oratory today he is clearly running into difficulty because he failed to apply his speech to the substance of the matter which he submitted for discussion, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> The failure of the Government to support and foster the development of Australia's major public enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA>The first point I make is that public enterprises-these quangos-are still part of government. In another form they are the taxpayers of Australia. Just because they are separate entities there is no reason to treat them separately. Their expenditure is government expenditure; their losses are the losses of the Australian taxpayer. These losses may be hidden in the initial stages but ultimately they have to be borne by the taxpayers of Australia. Consequently, they are treated in a way similar to that of all other government expenditures. One of the reasons that this Government was returned to office in 1980 was that the people of Australia wanted us to cut back government expenditure. Public enterprises have shared in this process as have other public sector activities. I indicate to Senator Button that I hope that this cutting back will occur even more, following the so-called razor gang report. On the other hand, let it be openly acknowledged that the Government has endeavoured to make this public sector of Australia much more efficient. For example, we have had the Dix inquiry into the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Airfares, the proposed inquiry into the deregulation of the air transport industry, the formulation of the Australian National Railways corporate plan, the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council, the Myers committee and currently, the Cabinet Review of Commonwealth Functions, which is the correct name of the razor gang which is expected to report in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the subject under discussion-the so-called 'failure' of my Government to 'support and foster the development of Australia's major public enterprises'-let us also look at the innovative use of public enterprises by this Government. I refer in particular to multicultural television, which seems to upset so many members of the Australian Labor Party but which has certainly been welcomed by Australians whose origins are in other lands. The national communications satellite will also be another public enterprise. I cannot say that I am greatly keen on these public enterprises being expanded but certainly, where the Government will operate in these fields, I recognise the need for the creation of such authorities. Let me look at some of the public authorities spoken about by Senator Button. Let us look, for example, at Trans-Australia Airlines. In its thirty-fifth annual report it speaks of one of its major problems. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Until 1972 the regular evaluations by the Australian Government Actuary of the fund maintained by the Commission revealed surpluses; for example at 1972 the surplus was $3.124m. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation was drastically changed by amendments to the Commonwealth legislation relating to Commonwealth Superannuation, particularly a change in 1973-</PARA>
<PARA>This was change clearly brought about by the Australian Labor Party when it was in government-</PARA>
<PARA>providing for annual pension adjustments, which is believed to have made the Commonwealth Scheme the most expensive retirement benefits scheme in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>That scheme, described as the most expensive retirement benefits scheme in Australia, was a scheme imposed on TAA by the Labor Government in 1973. Let us recognise that my Government is financing TAA's expansion into wide-bodied jet aircraft through government backed funds. The Government is going to review its opportunities for deregulation of the industry, as it should, and until the airlines agreement has been renegotiated TAA will continue to operate in a protected market. Let us look at Telecom Australia which was heavily praised by Senator Button. I will cite some of the figures from its 1979-80 annual report. I will cite the highlights. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The volume of business as measured by earnings at constant prices rose by 11 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>Compare that statement with the following:</PARA>
<PARA> Costs rose sharply with payroll up by $130.3m. </PARA>
<PARA>That represents an increase of 12.5 per cent. Here is an Australian Government authority which is increasing its payroll faster than its earnings. No private enterprise can be involved in that area and last very long. But, of course, a government backed authority is able to do so. The suggestion in the matter being debated at present is that this Government is not helping these authorities. I will cite further highlights from the report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> More than $1,003.1m was spent on the capital program and more than half-a-million new telephone services were connected. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Profit increased from $190.5m to $211.5m and was re-invested to finance network expansion. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me make it perfectly clear that I am not suggesting that efficiency brought about this profit. What has brought the profit about is the monopoly market situation, because Telecom has no competitor and is able to impose the charges it believes necessary to make these sorts of profits. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me relate to the Senate just one of the sorts of stories I have heard-and I have heard countless stories along these lines: After waiting weeks and weeks for our new line to be put in, one Friday morning about 9 o'clock six people in four vehicles arrived. They lighted a fire and made tea. I found out later that officially they start at 8 a.m. but that is at their depot, about 12 miles away. About 9.30 a man driving a trench digger arrived. After he had his morning tea, he started to dig the trench. All others stood watching. When he had finished, two men laid a line in the trench-that was their job. All others stood watching. At some stage they broke for lunch and afternoon tea, the fire with the billy on was kept going all day. Two other men joined the wire to the main line and to my house. Everyone else stood around watching. Then they packed up to go home. I asked why they were leaving when the job was so close to being finished; I was told that it was 4 o'clock and it would take them an hour to get back to the depot and clean up and they had to be finished by 5 o'clock. Needless to say, some of them came back next day, Saturday morning, at time and a half and finished it off. </PARA>
<PARA> That story was told to me some years ago by a farmer who was struggling at the time. He was running his whole property without any hired labour. He told me that he had no doubt that with that trench digger he would have been able to do all the work that those people performed by himself in the same number of hours that it took the seven of them to do the job. I especially ask all listeners today not-I repeat, not-to send me similar stories because I know that if I asked them to send me stories I would be absolutely inundated with such stories of inefficiency. Having asked them not to send me such stories, I will probably still end up with a desk full of them. This is the sort of inefficiency which socialised monopolies bring us. I hope that I do not have my telephone cut off as a result of telling this story. I will hold my breath.</PARA>
<PARA> If Telecom had even one competitor in the field does anyone think that we would have to suffer this sort of nonsense? Of course we would not. What keeps Telecom going is its ability to fix its own prices and to persuade governments that the prices fixed are the sorts of prices that it needs to charge. What other aid would the Labor Party give Telecom within this monopoly situation which, unfortunately, it is able to have under our operations?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Australian National Railways Commission. The Government continues to subsidise the Australian National Railways' operating losses. I repeat that that is an actual out of pocket cost to the taxpayers of Australia. They may not see it in the initial stages but somewhere along the line they will undoubtedly have to pay for these losses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Rae informs me that they pay annually at the moment. The Chairman's Review states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This year saw revenue fall short of expenditure by $64.8 million, an improvement of $7.6 million over last year. </PARA>
<PARA>I acknowledge that the railways throughout Australia run at a loss and I recognise that the Australian National Railways, under the encouragement of this Government, is improving its performance. Again, the Chairman's Review states:</PARA>
<PARA> Revenue increased by 20 per cent whilst expenditure increased by nine per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>I congratulate ANR for doing that. It has increased its revenue by 20 per cent and has managed to hold its expenditure increase to only 9 per cent which is, of course, about the same increase as that of the consumer price index. The Chairman continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The result was more than satisfactory when viewed in the light of wage and salary increases flowing from Arbitration Commission awards and National Wage Case decisions which will cost almost $16 million in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>I certainly congratulate ANR for that report. But I point out that that is happening under my Government and the policies of encouragement that it has been able to introduce. I turn now to another statutory authority-the Australian Shipping Commission, the Australian National Line. In its annual report for 1980 the Chairman's Review states:</PARA>
<PARA> The consolidated result of the Australian Shipping Commission for the financial year ended 30 June 1980 was a loss of $7,989,000. Whilst this was a very unsatisfactory result it must be looked at against the background of international trading which continues to be depressed in volume and freight rate terms, reflecting the general world scene. </PARA>
<PARA>I come now to what I consider to be a most important matter. The Chairman goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Line sustained crippling losses from the unusually high incidence of Australian industrial stoppages throughout the year. In fact, 793 ship days, at an estimated cost of $11.50 million, were lost in 247 individual delays to the Line's vessels arising directly from industrial disputation. </PARA>
<PARA>This point is then made:</PARA>
<PARA> Of these losses, 76.8% were through disputes in which the Line had no direct employer/employee relationship, . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is a cost to all Australians. This body is wholly owned by us, the people of Australia. If it makes such a loss, we have lost. No matter that it does not appear directly to come out of our pockets during that year, indirectly it will ultimately come out of our pockets. So individual disputation in which the Commission had no direct employer-employee relationship has cost the people of Australia almost $9m in this one enterprise alone. I hope that even senators opposite might be prepared to acknowledge that these figures are not insignificant. Would anyone in this place argue that this Line could not exist without Government support or guarantees? It is carrying these substantial losses and it is many years since it paid any dividend to the people of Australia in relation to its activities. I come back to the subject of the debate today. The Opposition alleges that this Government has failed to support and foster the development of Australia's major public enterprises. I have another case that I will mention towards the conclusion of my remarks. I refer to the annual report of the Australian Tourist Commission. I am delighted to be able to read Captain Ritchie's letter to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) dated 20 October 1980. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>My dear Minister, The year was a satisfying one for the Commission with a number of major achievements.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is quite happy to take issue with the Liberal-Country Party Government on our public enterprises. One would have thought that Senator Lewis, leading for the Government in the debate, would have put forward a stronger defence of the Government's attitude to our public enterprises. One would have thought that in this debate Senator Lewis would have defended the Government's ideological and philosophical reasons for ignoring the great problem that faces public enterprise in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators should be aware of the fact that there is great unease, great uncertainty and great concern in the enterprises known as Trans-Australia Airlines, Australia Post, Telecom Australia, the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the Australian National Line, and the Australian National Railways Commission. They would be aware also that the Government announced, in an offhand and stealthy sort of way, its decision to sell off TAA. It was not done after any careful analysis or informed discussion in the party room, or even in the Parliament itself. The Government agreed to take this step as a result of the relentless pressure and prodding by a particularly rabid section of the Government's own back bench-the hardliners, the twentieth century Adam Smiths, the extreme Right of the Liberal Party-who want to hive off those profitable public sectors of our economy that are performing a very valuable service to the Australian community. This group of free-for-all enterprise fanatics have achieved a rare coup in establishing this uncertainty. In respect of TAA, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) made a pre-election promise not to interfere with that organisation. It was also the avowed intention of the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) and the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) that there would be no decision to sell off this important enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> The reasons for the change are simple. First of all, the owners of capital are interested in getting their hot little hands on those sectors of our economy that are profitable. The economy is not in a healthy state; something has to be done, and that means we have to con the Australian public into believing that this Government is acting effectively and positively and that action will be taken to rectify the concern felt in the Australian community. The threat, therefore, is to be seen as a counter move to the Government's inept responsibilities in governing this country. Suddenly phrases have appeared in so many quarters to the effect that we have to relieve business of regulation burdens, that there has to be deregulation, that there have to be new approaches so that we can establish the revitalisation and regeneration of our economy. We recognise that businesses are going bankrupt in their thousands and, believe it or not, this Government suggests that somehow it is the fault of enterprises such as TAA that that is taking place. So TAA is to be sold. Who suggested that TAA should be sold? Certainly the proposition was put forward some time ago by Senator Rae but, in respect of the current propositions, it was the Murdoch and Abeles submissions to the Ansett organisation that set about the movement to close down this important public instrumentality. We have already seen the reaction that that has caused. It means, of course, that those sectors of the TAA enterprise which are unprofitable obviously are in for the axe. </PARA>
<PARA> Trans-Australia Airlines will be sold out to the major corporations so that this Government, through the communications unit it has established, can conduct a public relations exercise to reassure the Australian people, or to reassure the back bench, that this Liberal-National Country Party Government is really committed to the principles of free enterprise. In fact, what is happening is that it is steadily becoming socialist. It is socialising the costs of business, giving it cheap power, lower taxes, cheap roads, infrastructure, whatever it can give, as well as the incentives and subsidies so ably referred to by Senator Button in introducing this matter of public importance. At the same time, the dogs of big business are barking at the heels of this Government, asking for more offerings, and they have their eyes on all the public enterprises. Telecom is forbidden to compete with private enterprise in areas where it has an advantage. What a joke that is. First the Government sells off operations because they are hindering free enterprise; then it does the same thing when those operations are competing too well. The conclusion is obvious. The private sector is sacred. It can do no wrong in the eyes of so many members of the Government, and no one can transgress this holy, if poorly ploughed, ground. Free enterprise may rip off consumers, sabotage economic policy, sack workers, damage the environment, and generally harm the community, but on no account can the Government intervene. That is the philosophy of so many members of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Are we to draw the conclusion from the decision about TAA that the ANL the ABC, and all the other organisations referred to are also in for the chop? We listened to what Senator Lewis had to say about the Australian National Railways, the criticism he made of that organisation. Who would want to buy the Australian National Railways? It provides a service. It is not a profitable enterprise, it is an organisation deliberately designed to provide services to very many sections of our community. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look closely at the specifics of the Government's treatment of public enterprises. The mentality and philosophy which is producing today's reactions could be seen at work many years ago when the conservative government of the day sold off the publicly owned Commonwealth Oil Refineries, which was part of the Menzies madness of the 1950s. The extent of that shortsightedness can be seen today when we have so little control over determining our own energy policies through the lack of expertise and leverage which public ownership of COR would have brought forward. Since the advent of the Fraser Government we have seen a further steady undermining of community ownership of key enterprises. In September 1979, for example, the Commonwealth brickworks in Canberra was sold off to its only competitor. So much for the posturing of Senator Lewis. The brickworks was not permitted to compete with the private sector. It was sold for a song and in circumstances which can only be called corrupt and scandalous. The justification for that sale was simply that it was uneconomic. Yet when the divestment of the highly profitable public Housing Loans Insurance Corporation was mooted last year, the argument was quite the opposite, namely, that the enterprise had been so successful there was no further need for it. We know that the Government backed off only because there was an outcry within the community, and even amongst sections of the insurance industry. Here we have a situation in which one enterpirse is sold off because it is not profitable, and yet justification is sought for the proposal to sell off another enterprise that is too profitable. Selling off the community's properties and wealth is part of the philosophical position of this Government. It is contradictory, it is illogical, it is unnecessary, and it is unnerving to those important public enterprises that have been and are performing a public function. </PARA>
<PARA> Two more of the people's investments were quick to follow the proposals to which I have already referred. The Ranger uranium stake went, despite reluctance and even opposition from the private enterpreneurs who make up the other Ranger partners. They opposed the Government's abandonment of this project. That most highly contentious area of energy resource is now completely in the hands of multinational private capital. The one stake we had there was sold off to suit the mental gymnastics of the Liberal and National Country parties. Simultaneously, the coalition handed back on a platter to the overseas multinationals the monopoly of the lucrative pharmaceutical industry by selling off Fawnmac the pharmaceutical group bought for the Australian people by Dr Everingham during the period of the Whitlam Government in 1975. In the four years after the purchase, that company had consolidated its position and was preparing for a major expansion in that industry. Its profitability had therefore dropped temporarily, and its sale at the time was a gift to those forces which control the pharmaceutical industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In the fields of energy, building, insurance, communication, and pharmaceuticals, the Australian people are being sold short. They are being sold down the drain, but worse is to come. The growing confidence of those free-for-all enterprisers in the coalition is getting to the stage of overreaching itself. The more rational, logical and reasonable Liberals who can admit the value of public enterprises and can perceive the advantages of such enterprises for the people are now coming under major attack. The public's most valuable and powerful enterprises are now being eyed off by the elitists in the private sector of the Australian economy. In January of this year the Chairman of Qantas Airways Ltd, Jim Leslie, a corporate soul if ever there was one, accused the Government of so weakening the airline, which we all know and have been told too often is the one we all own, that the way was open for an easy takeover. He outlined nine steps that could weaken an airline and pointed out that six steps had already been taken by this Government. We had the spectacle of the Qantas board of directors traipsing to the Government to plead for Qantas' survival only to be pushed off with an assurance from the Minister for Transport that Qantas would not be sold. We know what happens if Mr Hunt's assurances are put to the test because he gave us the same assurance in respect of TAA. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then, of course, we have heard nothing from Mr Leslie and his fellow directors. They have been put in cold storage; they have been silenced. But we have seen a confrontational and bloody-minded attitude from the Government towards Qantas and the role of Mr Hunt over the sale of TAA. Not content with half measures, the Government's attitude towards Telecom Australia and Australia Post reflects its general attitude towards public ownership. Last year the responsible Minister refused to allow Telecom to expand into new fields of technology and at the same time permitted private companies into the profitable areas of Telecom's business. Now there are pressures from within the Liberal Party to continue to strip Telecom and Australia Post of their major operating assets and to reassign the profitable aspects of their operations so that the greedy, the big corporations in our society and the very wealthy can reap enormous profits. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, the Government increased its pressure on Telecom by restricting its ability to borrow sufficient funds to provide essentials such as telephone connections-it did that because of what it said was the inefficiency of the organisations-while it is the Government which is wilfully and carefully planning and causing the problems. A prime example of the Government's determination under factional pressure to undermine Telecom is the proposed communications satellite due to begin operating by 1985. We all know how the Packers, the Murdochs, the Abeles and the other big tycoons of Australia will try to get their hands on that important new technology. Telecom's major trade union, the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association, is aware of those threats to the statutory body and has organised a reasoned and sensible defence. Can we expect to see the same confrontational policies that the Government has adopted towards Qantas and TAA turned towards Telecom as well?</PARA>
<PARA> We come now to the latest of these misappropriations, one which obviously demonstrates the conflict which has developed in the coalition's own philosophy. Despite explicit assurances that TAA would not be sold off, the Minister last week bowed before the pressures in the party room and announced its future sale. No doubt Lynch's razor gang has much to do with that also, as it will with so many public enterprises. Is the razor gang so powerful that it can cut the throat of our public enterprises? Other pressures are evident as well, and we need do no more than think about the pressures that are obviously being exerted by the tycoons in the Australian private sector. The Government has given no valid reasons for creating this unease in the public enterprises of Australia. It has given no valid reasons for the sale of TAA. In fact, there is every commercial reason to suggest that TAA has been more successful in every way than its private counterpart. The fact is that the Government has no reasons and no excuse. It is merely reacting to those forces within the party which are becoming irresistible, too vocal, too strong and too tied to the big corporations in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion let me say that the Australian Labor Party and the Australian community will be happy to take up the challenge in defence of our public enterprises. We will be happy to go to the hustings. We will be happy to go everywhere throughout our country to indicate to the Australian people that our public enterprises are profitable and are efficient as long as we remove the restraints that so obviously are placed upon them by the Government's own philosophical position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; We are debating a matter of public importance raised by Senator John Button, the Leader of the Opposition, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Government to support and foster the development of Australia's major public enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA>I have taken part in many discussions on matters of public importance here previously and usually I have had some idea of what they were all about. But this would be one of the most nebulous subjects we have ever had before us. I thought if I listened to the Opposition I would have some idea of what it was about. Having listened already to two Opposition speakers, I still do not know what it is about. Senator Gietzelt spent most of his time either talking shares up or down or talking of the morale in some of our public enterprises. At Question Time in this chamber we heard allegations of Ministers talking up and down the shares of private enterprise. We have just heard some fairly outrageous statements from Senator Gietzelt. As a matter of fact, recently I followed him in a debate on transport when he growled about how little time he had to speak but spent half of his speech talking about what the Government has said it is not going to do, namely, sell off Trans-Australia Airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> The sooner we nail that furphy, the better it will be for everybody. The Government has not said that it will sell TAA. Indeed, even the proposition put some time ago by Senator Peter Rae was not to sell TAA. There has been talk of making it a public company. As I mentioned recently, this is now the Government's intention. Indeed, Qantas Airways Ltd is a public company. Senator Rae's proposition, as I understand his previous statements, was along the line that some shares may be sold to some of its staff. I think I am correct in that assumption. Indeed, there is much merit in that. It would give the staff a fair bit of interest in the company for which they work. I think Senator Gietzelt referred three or four times to the selling of TAA. Of course, the Australian airline industry has gone through enough trauma in the last few weeks as a result of our trying to sort out a report on it and as a result of pressure on some of our Western Australian colleagues from a body in that State which thinks it knows more about how to run an airline than anybody else does. The talk now about selling TAA is certainly doing nothing for the morale of the staff of TAA which, to my way of thinking, operates one of the best airlines in one of the best airline systems in the world. I say here and now that the Government's whole intention is that TAA be made into a public company so that it can become more competitive and thus take a better place in the market place. I do not think there has been any failure on the part of the Government to support and foster the development of Australia's major public enterprises. As a matter of fact, many honourable senators on this side would argue that there has probably been too much support. </PARA>
<PARA> Public enterprises were basically set up to fulfil a purpose. I guess that the purpose of setting up TAA was a little different from that. It was the child of a Labor government and was run in what was possibly a most unreasonable atmosphere vis-a-vis competition with the then struggling private enterprise sector. The two-airline agreement was brought about so that there could not be that sort of government support for its own entity and so that private enterprise would be able to compete on equal grounds. For instance, all members of parliament travel on government warrants and are quite at liberty to travel with whichever airline they want to. Many of the other public enterprises were set up to do a particular job and they are doing that job. </PARA>
<PARA> In times past I have had cause to speak about Telecom Australia and Australia Post, and it is quite significant that those two instrumentalities once came under the umbrella of the old Postmaster-General's Department. My recollection is that the last Labor Government set them up as two separate statutory authorities. I make no complaint about that and have no argument with that. Indeed, since then they have done a fairly good job, but it would be the utmost folly and irresponsible for any government to say 'there you are, away you go', and not keep an eye on them. We have a responsibility to ensure that our public bodies operate in an efficient manner. After all, they belong to the taxpayers and the taxpayers have helped to set them up. The taxpayers, I think, have every right to get a dividend, if possible, whether it be in the form of a good service, or Consolidated Revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Bodies such as Telecom and Australia Post obviously still need to expand their networks-particularly Telecom. Far too many people are still without telephone communications. It is obviously necessary that Telecom, instead of paying a dividend into the Government coffers, plough that money back into new services. I have no quarrel with that proposition and I doubt whether anybody in this chamber would. The more money we can plough back the more we can extend service and provide communications to those people who need them most. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Lewis referred to Telecom's profits. He said that one reason for that profit was the fact that it is a monopoly; it does not have any opposition. That may be so, but I think the records would also show that right down the line since it became a statutory authority, with astute businessmen on its board, Telecom has been attempting, quite successfully, to apply business principles to its operations. Men have to account for their time and for the use of machinery and that sort of thing. There is obviously still a lot of work to be done in that regard. We owe it to the people of Australia to insist that it be done. The fact that it is being done with some success and that there is an increase in productivity means that Telecom has been able to reduce some charges and to hold other charges at a time when increased costs in private enterprise have been passed on to customers. The Government has that responsibility to consumers-that is, the telephone subscribers and the taxpayers-to ensure efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Gietzelt spoke at length about selling Telecom. He did not mention Australia Post so much. There is no doubt that they have profitable areas. Once again, I think it would be the utmost folly of a government to sell off the profitable areas of Telecom or Australia Post. There is a fair bit of cross-subsidisation. Dare I mention that word which has caused so much discussion over the last few weeks in regard to airlines? There is massive cross-subsidisation in Telecom and Australia Post. Why should there not be? It is working quite well and it is providing for services and the expansion of services in rural areas. If we sold these instrumentalities-not that I have heard Government senators talk about it; it is mainly in the mind of Senator Gietzelt-there is no way in the world that anybody would want to buy the country services. It is not the Government's intention to sell them. It is the Government's intention to make them as efficient as it can. Anyone looking at buying an airline-for instance, Trans-Australia Airlines-could see from the profitability or return on invested capital that he could do much better with his money elsewhere. He would probably buy it for reasons other than sheer return on invested capital. That proposition applies to domestic and international airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lewis mentioned the fact that the Commonwealth Government has imposed certain criteria on the running of Australian National Railways and that its board is applying business principles. It is meeting certain goals. The Commonwealth Government, as I recall, about two years ago suggested to ANR that within 10 years its revenue should exceed its operating expenditure. My last discussion with its General Manager revealed that he thinks it will achieve that. I think it will be quite some achievement if it can do that. It is a pity the State railway systems could not do the same thing. Last year-I may be wrong-we probably went pretty close to the railways of Australia losing $1 billion. We really cannot put our finger on any of that money. We do not know where it goes; the taxpayers continually pick up the tab. It is only the Commonwealth instrumentality, ANR, which is giving any credence to business principles. It is only ANR's governing body-that is, the Parliament of Australia-which has said: 'You have to meet certain criteria,' and ANR is attempting to do that. That shows that we are serious when we say that our public enterprises not only have a job to do but also should be efficient. </PARA>
<PARA> The same principle applies to the Australian National Line. As I understand the situation, ANL certainly has not paid a dividend to the Commonwealth for some considerable time and it has some mounting losses. But by the same token it also has been told how to operate. ANL hopes that it can turn the corner pretty quickly. One of the problems with ANL-this relates to what I said about the railways-is that we as the Parliament have to ask it to operate in a business-like manner, and yet it is competing with railways around the coastline of Australia which make fare or freight decisions without any commercial consideration. I think that some of the State governments have to look at their own operations and have to recognise that they owe to the taxpayers of Australia an accounting for where that money is going. I have no quarrel with subsidising a public utility-such as a railway if there is a social need for it. But let us identify the need. Let us get the system on a commercial basis, as we are doing with our public enterprises. If there is a loss let us identify whether there is a social need for the service being provided before we subsidise it. </PARA>
<PARA> I was quite interested to hear Senator Gietzelt criticise Government assistance to new industries in private enterprise. He referred to cheap electricity, cheap water and those sorts of things. The members of the Australian Labor Party seem to be pretty short-sighted if that is their total philosophy. I am not so sure that it is. Quite often, if we can guarantee a certain amount of electricity usage a new power station can be established, albeit at a contract rate. That ultimately means more work. It means that the industry is developed, and that means more work. There is more work in the associated industries, for instance, the fabrication and construction industries. I think the Opposition has a very short-sighted attitude. As a matter of fact, I think Senator Gietzelt is probably out of line with his own government in New South Wales and what it is doing in regard to aluminium smelters. I do not think there has been any failure by the Government to support and foster the development of Australia's major public enterprises. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collard, in opening his remarks by dealing with Trans-Australia Airlines, of course hit on the point which is the immediate reason for this general matter of public importance being brought before the Senate today. It was only a couple of weeks ago that the Government announced that it intended to make TAA a public company. The Opposition and members of TAA with good reason, suspected and in fact are now sure that what the Government in fact intends to do is to sell TAA. Senator Collard denied this today. He said that the Government has no intention of doing that. We may, of course, do what Senator Rae wants to do and hand over control of TAA's shares to its employees under the Kelso plan. We really cannot rely on Senator Rae and we cannot rely on Senator Collard in this matter. I suggest we can rely on the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The day after the announcement was made that TAA was to be made a public company Mr Fraser did an unusual thing: He held a Press conference. At that conference a well known journalist in this town, Mr Laurie Oakes, asked him a question. He said to the Prime Minister: 'Several times during the election campaign recently held you promised you would not sell TAA'. The Prime Minister's reply was not to say: 'We are not going to sell TAA. We are just going to make it a public company like Senator Rae wants us to do or we are just going to make it a public company with all government shares as Senator Collard wants us to do'. He did not deny that. In fact he said: 'Sometimes we have to make promises which we have to break under different circumstances'. He did not deny after several questions that in fact the Government's intention is to sell off TAA to private interests. Of course that is the intention of the Government and it is the view of what should happen of so many members of the Government parties. </PARA>
<PARA> I am always reminded in debates on this subject of some years ago when I was a member of the Senate select committee looking at a national compensation scheme. The evidence given to that committee by the head of the Life Officers Association was that his principle and his company's principles were that if a business is profitable it should be in private hands and if it is not profitable it should be in government hands. It seems to me that that is the attitude of so many members of the Government parties in this place. It is the attitude they take to the great public enterprise that Senator Button spoke about earlier. If they do not make a profit, they are condemned as inefficient by people like Senator Lewis. If they do make a profit, the first effort made is in fact to restrict their activities because profits made by private enterprises are so foreign and so much against government philosophy. If they continue to make profits every attempt is made in the long run to flog them off-something that has been advocated for TAA by Senator Rae and others for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> I initially mention some of the public enterprises that have been so important to this country and the attitude of the predecessors of the present Government. For instance, one remembers that after the war there was a great need for the development of power and, secondary to that, irrigation facilities. The government of the day decided to develop the Snowy Mountains scheme, a scheme which incidentally since then has been praised by Government supporters for its imagination, for the efficiency with which it was built and for the efficiency with which it has been operated. That project was opposed vigorously by the Liberal-Country Party Government of the day. It was opposed to the extent that when the Snowy Mountains scheme was started every member of the Government parties, with the exception of Senator George Rankin from Victoria, boycotted the opening. They condemned it as an evil socialist enterprise which should never have been started. We never hear that sort of thing from the people who were in government at the time or who were the logical successors to that Government. We do not hear that sort of thing now and we have not heard it since then. But it was a typical demonstration of the attitude of the Government parties then and of the Government parties now. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only was that a great power scheme developed by public enterprise in that country but also one must remember that the development of the aluminium smelting industry in my own State of Tasmania started off as a public enterprise by a combined effort of Commonwealth-State governments, which held the majority of the shares, and private companies. As soon as the Liberal-Country parties took government they sold out with obscene haste the Commonwealth's share of the Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation. At roughly the same time they sold out the Commonwealth's share in the Commonwealth Oil Refineries. In doing so those parties did us a great disservice and they did the people of this country a great disservice because I suggest that public enterprises of this type have very important functions to play in this country in the development and the maintenance of our high standards of living. Firstly, such public enterprises are used to develop our resources which otherwise would not be developed. A typical example of that, I suggest, is the Snowy Mountains scheme. Another example, of course, is the Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason for developing such enterprises is to provide services which otherwise would not be able to be provided in this country. Of course the classic example of that-Senator Collard, being a Country Party member in this place, quite clearly alluded to it-was the effort of Trans-Australia Airlines in keeping, developing and maintaining what otherwise would be unprofitable air routes, particularly those in north Queensland, as a function of its operations, which function incidentally is vigorously defended by Senator Collard's party colleagues in Queensland in a most unusual way. Similarly the development of the Australian Broadcasting Commission has provided radio and in more recent years television services for areas of this country which otherwise would not have been provided by private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> The other important function, I suggest, of public enterprises like these is to give the people, through the Government of this country, a say in and a knowledge of what is happening in the development of some of our own crucial industries. I think it is a great tragedy that we have no direct knowledge, no direct idea of what is going on. For instance, one such industry in this country is the oil industry in which we would have been involved through our own Commonwealth instrumentality. The same thing could have happened if in fact we had a direct knowledge of what was happening in the aluminium smelting industry. We would have had that if the government of the day had not in fact sold off the Commonwealth Government's share. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason Senator Button has raised this discussion as a matter of public importance is that in the public eye, in the Opposition's eye, in the eye of the Press and certainly in the view of those people who are involved, those enterprises are seen to be under threat. In the case of TAA, we have the obvious threat to sell that public enterprise, a threat that was admitted by implication by Mr Fraser at his Press conference soon after the announcement was made. As Senator Gietzelt has said, in the case of Telecom, that most successful and most efficient organisation, there has been a limitation on its expansion in various areas of communication into which it would like to have moved and at the same time other organisations have been allowed into those areas. This has restricted Telecom's ability to develop in those areas. In the area of the pharmaceutical industry the Government sold off the Fawnmac group which was involved in the non-biological pharmaceutical area, an area which it was terribly important to develop. It was sold off for no reason other than that the previous Labor Government had bought it. Senator Gietzelt also mentioned the fact that the Government sold off the local brick works in Canberra merely because it was in fact a public enterprise. There is also the less publicised factor that the present Government is refusing to fund national roads in the various States if those roads are built by public authorities such as the Department of Main Roads in my own State of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> There is in the Government's actions an attitude against the development of public enterprises. It is an attitude which has continued since the Government came to power. If we add to that attitude the sort of rhetoric that we hear particularly from people like the new Minister for Home Affairs and the Environment, Mr Wilson, from the Prime Minister himself, and from other Government members, on both the front and back benches, about the need for the public sector to keep out of areas like this and the need for the Government to develop only those areas which are controlled by private enterprise, there is set up an atmosphere in which the public enterprises of this country are in danger. One would think from hearing the rhetoric that comes from the other side of the chamber that public enterprise always had been bad for this country, yet we know that in so many areas-in hospitals, in health, in education, in communications, in the development of transport through the railways and through the national shipping line-the development of this country would have been greatly impeded; it would have been less efficient and the standard of living and the lifestyle of people in this country would have been greatly restricted if we had not had these efficient public enterprises operated by public servants who had the good of this country at heart. </PARA>
<PARA> It is disappointing in a debate on a general subject such as this to find that the best Senator Lewis can do is to give an anecdotal story about a group of people employed by Telecom-he admits he heard it some years ago-about how they were apparently relatively inefficient in laying the telephone wires at one farm that he had heard about. One can repeat anecdotal tales such as that over and over about public and private enterprises, but it gets us nowhere. No one on this side of the chamber is suggesting that we should in fact allow our public enterprises to be inefficient. We believe that enterprises, both public and private, should be efficient, that they should be carefully controlled and that they should do the job as economically and efficiently as they can. We will hear similar stories later on, I suppose, as we have heard in the past. We heard one from Senator Lewis about how nationalised industries are inherently inefficient. I am surprised that we have not heard about the losses made by, say, British Leyland in Britain; but, at the same time, we never hear about the losses made by General Motors-Holdens Ltd, for instance, in this country because it is not done to criticise private enterprise in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear from the Prime Minister of this country that it is wrong for the Government, and the Government through public utilities, to enter into the development of the resources of this country. Therefore the Government sold off its share of the Ranger uranium mining enterprise. But, at the same time, the Government welcomes, and particularly our friend Senator Carrick welcomes, the investment in and the development of resources in this country by BP Australia Ltd, itself 46 per cent owned by the British Government, admittedly by Mrs Thatcher's conservative government. But it seems to us that to this Government Australian public enterprise is bad; public enterprise which comes from overseas is good and welcome. It is for this reason that Senator Button brought up this matter of public importance, first of all to try to get from the Government-and I am afraid we are not going to get it today-some clear idea of its attitude to the immediate problems which we see facing us. I refer to the immediate problem of Trans-Australia Airlines and the threat of selling it off, a threat which, as I say, was confirmed by the Prime Minister. We hoped to get some sort of answer to that problem and some sort of rational defence of the Government's general attitude to all our large public enterprises. It seems that we are not going to get this. I suppose it was a bit much of Senator Button to expect that we would get a response such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> In bringing up this motion we are confirming our belief that public enterprise has a place in this community, has had a place in the development of this country and in making it what it was in the past, and will have a place in the future. A future Labor government will not take part in the destruction of these efficient organisations which have done so much to make our standard of living what it is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have spent some time now on a debate of a matter of public importance, the topic of which, given by the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Button, is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Government to support and foster the development of Australia's major public enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA>We were treated to the quite usual picture of Senator Button stridulating away as he is wont to do without really getting down to telling us what it was that we had not done or what it was that we had done wrongly. In fact we had to wait until Senator Grimes was speaking before we really found out what was the main concern of the Opposition in raising this matter as a matter of urgent public importance. I will therefore try to reply by putting the matter in context. What it really boils down to is that the Government has, it is alleged, failed to support and foster the development of major public enterprises because one or two of them have been sold. Some of the others, it has been suggested, should be restructured to make them more efficient and more effective. It is also alleged that in some other ways the Government is responsible for some loss of confidence among the employees and those associated with these operations. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is the complaint, let us look at the facts. The fact is that since the Second World War, that is, 35 years ago, there has been a Liberal-National Country Party Government for 29 years. A cynic could say, looking at Australia today, that the reason that the Australian Labor Party cannot get into office to implement its policy is that the Liberal-National Country Party coalition has been too busy getting in there first. So many areas of activity can be demonstrated, I think, by a story which used to be told by a former Prime Minister, Sir John Gorton. He used to tell the story of his having attended an international conference where he sat down to dinner with one of the leaders of one of the new socialist developing states. That gentleman endeavoured to persuade John Gorton that Australia was foolish in not adopting and applying socialism to all its industry and its basic economy. John Gorton said: 'Well, what sorts of things do you think should be nationalised? What sorts of things should be socialised? Transport?' The other fellow said 'Yes, of course', and John Gorton said: 'Well, we've already done that'. And we have. We have nationalised rail and shipping and two-thirds of our air transport-the other third is only operated under a big brother arrangement. Then John Gorton said: 'What about things like power and water supply and the distribution of them, and atomic energy and those sorts of matters?' The head of the new socialist state said 'Yes, of course', and John Gorton said: 'Well, we've already done those'. He finished up by going through the list-our sea ports, our airports, our communications, Telecom Australia, Australia Post, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission, Australia Post Courier and the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Our banks are effectively nationalised, law and order is conducted on a State basis, which one would expect it to be, and our primary industry is substantially socialised, shall I say, through primary industry marketing schemes. If we go on to look at what has happened in relation to insurance, housing, scientific development, in fact almost any area, we see there is either a significant, a major or a total government involvement when one takes the Commonwealth, State and local government levels and adds them together. The fellow said to John Gorton: 'But you are already so far ahead of us'. And we are. </PARA>
<PARA> What this country needs to be doing is reviewing whether that is really the stage that we wish to reach or whether some of those things which were desirable and which were important for the reasons outlined by various speakers are still appropriate to be conducted on a public enterprise basis today, or whether the stage has been reached at which we should be saying: 'No, the case for that being conducted on a monopolistic public enterprise basis no longer exists'. This is what the Government is doing today. It is reviewing, as it should review from time to time, the operation of public enterprise in Australia to determine whether it is the most appropriate, most efficient and most cost effective way of providing the types of services that are required in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> It might be taken that when I was saying that we had already done the job for the Australian Labor Party in socialising this country, I was saying that it was a disastrous thing to have happened. I am not saying that. I am saying that the coalition Government believes in a mixed economy and has practised a mixed economy effectively and with a recognition that nothing is permanent and that no aspect of public enterprise should be regarded as forever embedded irretriev- ably into one section, using one method for the performance of that function. It believes that, rather, we should ensure that questions are continually raised as to the efficiency and effectiveness of that enterprise and whether it is warranted. </PARA>
<PARA> I think one of the important points to make is that the more resources which we as a nation devote to public enterprise the more accountable we must ensure that public enterprise is. We must ensure that it is accountable, that it continues to be efficient and competitive and that its performance can be understood and compared with other means of achieving its objectives. I believe that each of the Opposition speakers in this debate has overlooked and mixed up two separate questions. One is: Should we have any government enterprises at all and if so, how many and in what areas? The second question is: Insofar as we have government enterprises, how should they be structured and funded, how should they be accountable and what performance indexes ought to be applied? I believe that Opposition speakers have been confusing two separate questions, endeavouring to paint some examples of what the Government has done in relation to the second question as if they were part of the answer to the first question. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree that in principle the Government parties espouse the cause of a private enterprise-based economy, but the record of the last 35 years shows that that cause is espoused, or perhaps honoured, more in the breach than in the observance. I think it would be very difficult to show that this Government-or its predecessor governments of the same parties-has not been very solicitous of the interests of public enterprise in Australia. In fact, the more attention that has been paid to this area by this Government, the more safe have been the positions of some public enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer again briefly to the Australian National Railways Commission which, as a result of the encouragement, enthusiasm and push it has received from this Government, has done what I believe to be an excellent job in restructuring and reorganising to the stage where it is far more efficient and far more cost effective for the provision of a necessary service in Australia than it appeared would be the case or, on the worst of projections, it looked almost certain would be the case. Its losses have not mounted as have the losses of British Rail whose losses have mounted because of the way in which that organisation is structured and managed and the lack of encouragement it has received. I think British Rail lost $1,000m last year. It might have lost a little more. That is a massive loss and it is increasing. But the Australian National Railways Commission has reduced its projected loss of over $100m for next year to $58m. That trend line is certainly encouraging for the sort of management approach which has been supported by this Government in relation to one or two public enterprises. I name just ANR as one example. </PARA>
<PARA> We have as a major question: What sort of structure is appropriate for public enterprise? Do we adopt the bureaucratic Public Service approach to a commercial or quasi-commercial enterprise, or do we give it a structure which is appropriate to the commercial environment in which it is expected to operate? I suggest that the second alternative is the answer. If we want public enterprise to engage in a commercial area of activity we should give it a structure which will enable it to operate in a way which is appropriate to the area in which it is to operate. Some of the bureaucratically minded socialists on the other side-I am not suggesting that that description applies to every Opposition member; I refer to some of the people who make noises on this issue-want to see a huge bureaucracy which the Government directly controls and manages, rather than public enterprise conducted through an appropriate structure in the most efficient way possible. Public enterprise should not have the dead hand of bureaucracy bearing down on its operation, but should have some opportunity to deliver the services or goods which it has been established to deliver in a competitive and efficient manner which can be regarded by everyone as an example. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have the time to go into as much detail as I would like. I am glad that we have had an opportunity, and I hope that we will have further opportunities, to debate what I regard as a most important issue; that is, the continuing review to determine whether public enterprise is an appropriate means of achieving a national objective or whether it would be better for that service or function, at the current stage of development, to be carried out in some other way. The type of public enterprise which runs unchecked and the structure of which is inappropriate for its performance can create economic distortions-distortions of demand, distortions of cost and the remainder of the economic distortions which are the subject of a great deal of examination and writing. There is no need to argue as to whether they exist. The only question is whether they exist in each of the enterprises or only in some of them. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take the problems of British Leyland and the British Steel Corporation. Last year over $2 billion was lost in the United Kingdom through what I believe is very largely a structures problem. That is one of the reasons why recently in this chamber I defended the idea of the Australian National Railways Commission changing its image, calling itself Australian National in the same way as the Myer Emporium became Myer and the Shell oil company became Shell in order to have a corporate identity with which people, the public and employees identify-an identity of which employees are proud and which can help to boost the confidence and enthusiasm with which people apply themselves to an enterprise. This is the sort of step which this Government has been encouraging so that we do not have the problems of British Steel, British Leyland and British Rail. I believe that far from being criticised for the steps the Government has taken it should be congratulated for recognising that in some areas of activity in Australia it is necessary to preserve public enterprise and that in other areas it may be possible and necessary to review and to sell. Where the case for public enterprise no longer exists, such as in the examples that have been given, a decision was taken that no public purpose was being served by continuing to have a particular undertaking carried out on a public enterprise basis. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the Government has done a great deal to lift morale, the competitive capacity and the competitive enthusiasm of public enterprises. It has done a great deal to lift the dead hand of bureaucracy from public enterprise at the same time as ensuring that public enterprise is fully accountable-as it must be-for what it does.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Freedom of Information Bill is a profound disappointment to those of us who hoped, perhaps naively, that at last after nine years of trying we were on the threshold of producing effective freedom of information legislation. The case for such legislation is overwhelming, and indeed it has been documented in overwhelming detail in the 1979 report on freedom of information by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, one of the most substantial and comprehensive reports ever presented by any committee to this Parliament. Stripped to its essentials, the argument for freedom of information is simply this: On the one hand, effective freedom of information legislation is necessary to improve the quality of decision-making on both policy and administrative matters in the public sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is necessary to remove the unnecessary secrecy which can be used to conceal weak or inappropriate or sometimes even improper grounds for decision-making. It is necessary to enable groups and individuals to be kept informed of the workings of the decision-making process as it affects them and to have access to that process so far as that is appropriate and possible. It is necessary to enable groups and individuals who are affected by Government decisions, for example in the welfare and the legal aid areas, to know the kinds of criteria that will be applied by government departments and agencies in making those decisions. And not least, freedom of information legislation is necessary to maintain and improve the quality of our political democracy. That is the point the Senate Committee made very succinctly in a very early paragraph of its report. Paragraph 3.7 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The essence of democratic government lies in the ability of people to make choices: about who shall govern; or about which policies they support or reject. Such choices cannot be properly made unless adequate information is available. It cannot be accepted that it is the Government itself which should determine what level of information is to be regarded as adequate. </PARA>
<PARA>It is true that the quality of democracy ought not to depend, as it tends to at the moment, on the quantity of leaks. The leaks system, as it presently operates in the political process, might be very satisfactory for the insiders in that particular political process, including the Press, but it is not satisfactory as a basic operating rule for everybody else in the community, who all too often is unable to penetrate the barriers posed by that decision-making process. One of the nicest descriptions of the general public policy role of freedom of information legislation is that its object is to make the outsiders in the political process insiders, to put them, in effect, in the same position as those who have access to this system by virtue of privilege, commercial position or things of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA> The other quite different rationale for freedom of information legislation-it has little, on the face of it, to do with general public policy considerations but is an equally important consideration-is that it is necessary to enable individuals, except in very limited and exceptional circumstances, to have access to information which is held about them on government files: So that they know the basis on which decisions which can fundamentally affect their lives are made and so that they can have an opportunity to correct those files where the information contained is untrue or, as is equally often the case, misleadingly half-true. So freedom of information legislation has far-reaching implications in a civil liberty sense, from the point of view of personal individual issues and interests. And it also has crucially far-reaching implications so far as the whole conduct of public administration and government is concerned. It is for these reasons that this Bill is among the most important pieces of legislation ever to have been introduced in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Good freedom of information legislation-legislation which is genuinely worthy of that name-must satisfy a number of characteristics. For a start, it must ensure that a maximum amount of publicity is made available as to what kind of information will actually be available under the Bill and how access to it can be obtained in practice. It is all very well to have elaborate procedures technically available, but if at the very threshold considerations militate against a person knowing how to utilise those procedures, then they may not be worth having. Next, good freedom of information legislation is that which would set a minimum of procedural obstacles by way of delay or complexity or cost, and afford the maximum of practical assistance to those who are pressing requests for access to information. Again, such legislation would contain an absolute minimum of exceptions and exemptions. </PARA>
<PARA> A further characteristic of such legislation is that it would contain effective and easily utilised machinery for the review of and appeal against initially adverse decisions. It is also the case-I readily acknowledge this and I am sure that other members of the Senate Committee would do so-that, as a practical matter, good freedom of information legislation should not involve massive claims on the Public Service's or public sector's administrative resources, whether those resources be of time, personnel, or sheer dollars cost. It is also the case, and I and others, imagine, would readily accept it as a kind of combined practical and principle point, that good freedom of information legislation is that which is compatible with the basic principles of the Westminster or the parliamentary system of government we presently have, paying due regard to the role of Parliament and especially Parliament's relationship with the Executive branch and the Ministers who sit within the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The trouble with the 1981 Bill now before us is that whilst it has had undoubted regard to the last two factors I have mentioned-the resource question and the question of compatability with the present system of government-in fact it has had a manifestly excessive regard to those sorts of considerations-it has fallen over so far backwards in its attempt to avoid placing any extra demands on the Public Service and to avoid intruding in any way on the present very cosy relationship that exists between Ministers and public servants that the Bill and those who have drafted it have simply lost sight of all the more basic and fundamental characteristics which have to be satisfied, before this kind of legislation is worthy of its name. The basic reasons that I for one am profoundly disappointed with this Bill now before us are essentially twofold. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first place, despite the very extensive and elaborate character of the report of the Senate Committee, to which I have referred, the Bill simply does not adopt more than a relative handful of the recommendations of that Committee. Those who presented it have not done the Parliament and the nation the courtesy of giving a fully argued, careful response to all the very detailed provisions and arguments in that report which have been rejected. The other ground for disappointment, to summarise it, is this: Not only is the new Bill not a really significant advance on its 1978 predecessor, despite the hopes which many of us had that the Committee's recommendations would be picked up in this way, but in fact it goes backwards in a number of significant respects, with a whole series of new exceptions and exemptions and procedural obstacles contained in it which were not contemplated, and certainly not contained, in the original version. </PARA>
<PARA> One can be left in no real doubt that all these problems-both the sins of omission and the sins of commission-have come about as a result of a continuing rearguard action fought by the Public Service, the senior echelons of which have fought this legislation in both its conception and execution every inch of the way. It is important to appreciate that the fight which lies ahead to improve this legislation is not really a struggle between the Government and the Opposition, in the traditional familiar sense that we are all used to. No doubt we, as an Opposition, will go on being critical about the way in which the Government, as a government, has handled some aspects of this matter. Indeed, one of the recurring themes in the whole history of freedom of information around the world is the way in which, for obvious reasons, it tends to be espoused as a concept rather more passionately by oppositions out of office than by governments sitting in office. The real battle that has to be fought out is between Parliament on the one hand and the Executive on the other-more particularly between Parliament and that arm of the Executive constituted by the Public Service. Many honourable senators on both sides of this chamber have been increasingly critical of the increased powers and perogatives of unelected bureaucrats in this country. Indeed, on the Government side of the chamber, we have heard a large number of speeches in the last couple of hours addressed to that theme. Freedom of information symbolises in a very graphic way the kinds of issues and principles at stake. If this battle is lost by the elected representatives of the people one can expect us to lose a great deal many more such battles in the future. These are the kinds of themes which are, in fact, picked up in the amendment which I have circulated. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add</PARA>
<PARA>', but the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) expresses its concern at the failure of the Executive to explain adequately its rejection of most of the arguments and recommendations for legislative change contained in the unanimous 526-page report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) regrets the excessive deference to bureaucratic influence that appears to have been involved in the rejection of significant Senate Committee recommendations and in the incorporation of significant new limitations on the scope and operation of the original 1978 Bill;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) expresses its hope that the Executive will in the course of the Committee stage debate give close and sympathetic consideration to the need for substantial amendment of the Bill if it is to be worthy of its name; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) reaffirms its continuing commitment to the principle of effective freedom of information legislation, in the belief that such legislation is indispensable to both administrative justice and sound and effective public sector decision-making in the national interest'. </PARA>
<PARA>It will be noted that the reference in that amendment is to the Executive and not to the Government. That, of course, is to emphasise that my quarrel, our quarrel, in this debate is not so much with the Government as with the Executive arm of Government. That is to say, what this debate essentially is about is a parliamentary exercise rather than a partisan exercise, in the traditional, familiar sense. The other point I draw to honourable senators' attention is that the amendment does not, of course, oppose the second reading of the Bill in the sense of requiring that the Bill be withdrawn and redrafted or that it be sent off for yet another period of committee deliberation by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs or some other select committee. We have been there and we have done that. The task now simply is to improve the Bill that we have before us, and I for one look forward to getting on with the job. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer in a little more detail to the paragraphs of the amendment and draw attention to some of the themes contained within it. The first paragraph of the amendment draws attention to the failure of the Executive adequately to explain and argue for its position in rejecting significant numbers of Senate Committee recommendations for improvement of this Bill. The Government's explanations of its reaction to the Senate Committee report were contained primarily in a set of documents tabled in this place on 11 September last year. They are also contained now, I suppose, in the second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) made last week accompanying the Bill. It has to be said that the arguments offered in these documents, at least when compared with the detail and scope of argumentation in the Committee report, are at best superficial and at worst derisory. They will need to be a whole lot more persuasive in the Committee stage of the debate if there is to be any legitimate ground for continuing to accept the Bill as it presently stands. </PARA>
<PARA> I will take as just one example the kind of argument which was made by the Senate Committee and which has clearly been rejected in nearly everything written by the Executive branch in responding to that Committee report. I take it also as an example because of its central character in underlining the whole thrust of the Executive reaction. The recurring theme in all this Executive response-is that there is something special about the Westminster system of responsible government that makes it inherently incompatible with far-reaching freedom of information legislation. It is suggested that a kind of transmission belt operates from public servants to Ministers, to Parliament and then to the public which it is absolutely wrong to bypass or to seek to intercept along the way; if we do this then the neutrality and anonymity of public servants and perhaps, even more importantly, the traditionally independent quality of the advice they offer will be put at risk and so too, it is argued, will be the responsibility, both individual and collective, of Ministers. What the Committee pointed out, indeed what it devoted a whole chapter to in its report and what indeed it was very concerned to do throughout the report, was to establish that this sort of sweeping preoccupation with the special character of the Westminster system as a bar to effective freedom of information legislation was totally misconceived. It is just not a good argument. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of points were made in support of the Committee's position. The first such point was that the traditional model of the transmission belt Westminster system is in fact idealised and bears very little relationship to what happens in the real world about us. In particular, the notion of individual ministerial responsibility is now, for all practical purposes, dead. Ministers simply do not resign on the basis of proven misbehaviour or proven maladministration within their own departments-although, of course, the traditional Westminster theory would have it that the responsibility of the Minister to Parliament for whatever happens in his department extends that far. Again, it is the case, as we all know, that senior public servants are no more anonymous than parliamentarians, some of them-John Stone of Treasury, I suppose, is the best current example-are much better known than most parliamentarians. Anonymity can remain a convenient shelter behind which to hide on occasion, but it is also something from behind which all too many public servants are all too happy to step as the particular occasion demands. Certainly, very few senior public servants these days-I do not criticise this in any way-feel any inhibitions at all about going public and putting propositions and statements down in the public arena. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Senate Committee argued in considerable detail, there is absolutely no reason to suppose, although some have continued to claim otherwise, or to suspect that freedom of information, and the prospect of ultimate disclosure that goes with it will affect the quality of the advice-the independent and professional quality of that advice-rendered by public servants to the ministry and to the public at large. I think the point was acknowledged by the Committee on the evidence before it that, if anything, the quality of that advice would be likely to improve. The point is simply that the overwhelming majority of public servants will go on being responsible, maintaining full and proper records and putting forward as best they can the best available information and advice. This is so simply because their own integrity and credibility and the efficiency of the whole public administrative system depend on it. </PARA>
<PARA> The adoption of the freedom of information legislation does not, of course, affect the basic element of responsible government, the presence of Ministers in the Parliament, in any way at all. It might be thought to have the potential for effecting the principle of collective responsibility or Cabinet solidarity if the freedom of information concept was taken into the Cabinet room to require the revelation of the details of Cabinet deliberations. But nobody, certainly not the members of the Committee, certainly not I and certainly not anyone on this side of the Parliament, is claiming that this Bill should extend that far. In other words-I think the point can be amply made at much greater length than I have time for now-there is nothing indispensable to the present parliamentary system of government which in any way is put at risk by the kind of effective, far-reaching legislation we are contemplating. </PARA>
<PARA> The real point that has to be made, which again is made very vigorously in the Senate Committee report, is that what matters when considering freedom of information is not whether a particular country has a United States of America style Presidential style of government or a United Kingdom style Westminster system of government, or anything in between; what matters is simply whether there is good government in that country. There is very little doubt that effective freedom of information legislation can contribute very substantially to that good government. Of course, nobody argues that all operations of government can or should ever be conducted in a goldfish bowl. Of course they cannot. Of course some matters must remain confidential at the time they are being discussed and negotiated. And of course it is true that some other matters-a lesser quantity-must remain, for practical governmental considerations, confidential for a good deal of time after that. But by and large there is not the case for maintaining confidentiality on anything like the scale that is contemplated in the terms of this Bill as it presently stands and in terms of the way in which the Executive has continually responded to the arguments that have been put forward by proponents of effective freedom of information legislation. There is very little in government that cannot be improved by letting a little bit of sunshine in. That is essentially the public policy motivation for this kind of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> The failure to respond adequately to the arguments that have been put up for changes in the Bill has led in turn, of course, to a rejection-on occasion a cavalier rejection-of a very large number of specific Senate Committee recommendations. Of course I am not suggesting that everything recommended by the Senate Committee has been rejected. There were 93 specific recommendations with respect to this Bill, of which 71 sought specific legislative changes to the text of the Bill and another 22 sought administrative changes not requiring changes to this Bill. Of those 22 administrative changes the overwhelming majority of them, in fact, have been accepted. I think there is only one on which the Government is currently dragging its heels. So far, so good. </PARA>
<PARA> But when we turn to the 71 recommendations for legislative change-even if one gives the absolute benefit of the doubt to the Government in describing as an acceptance every merely partial acceptance of a Senate Committee recommendation-we find in this present Bill the adoption of only 21 of those 71 legislative recommendations and the explicit rejection, the non-appearance in the Bill, of another 50 of them. Of those accepted by no means all of them are or have been of an insignificant character. But it is clear that by and large the more important recommendations, the ones that really make a difference if we are to have effective freedom of information legislation, have been rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> In this area I am in complete agreement with what Senator Missen has been saying, particularly in his recently published list of 'seven deadly sins of omission'. I have no doubt that he will expand upon that in what he says. The main areas of the battleground clearly, in terms of the things that are out of the Bill but ought to be in it, are, for a start, those provisions recommended by the Senate Committee which would go to limit the practical effect of conclusive ministerial certificates, not least in the area of internal working documents-a description wide enough to include just about any piece of paper in government departments except that which comes in rolls, and perhaps even that as well. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the question of the extension of the legislation to cover existing government records as well as those that are simply created in the future. There is the problem as to the overblown list of the grounds for exemption contained in the Bill as it now stands which needs to be much whittled back. There is the question of personal records and the necessity for there to be a right of individual correction where those records are wrong or misleading. There is the question of the multiplicity of specifically now exempt government agencies and classes of documents the number which needs to be drastically cut back if the Bill is to have any credibility. There is the question as to the role of the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the conciliatory, counselling and monitoring function, which ought certainly in the view of the Senate Committee, to be part of the Bill's explicit provisions. There is the question of secrecy provisions in the legislation. At the moment all other existing secrecy provisions are pretty well picked up and adopted in the explicit language of the Bill. They have in effect, an overriding role in making impossible, by virtue of their operation, access to documents which might otherwise be available but which are covered by those specific statutory provisions elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to those sins of omission the failure to correct deficiencies that were explored in the 1978 Bill, there is, as I have indicated, a rather more startling and unhappy list of sins of commission; that is, a whole series of new provisions which have appeared more or less from nowhere, certainly unexpected, and which have the role of imposing substantial additional limitations. I will simply list them for reference. They relate to clauses 32, 33, 38, 39, 35, 23 (2), 21 (1), 8 (6), 9 and the Schedule. I regret that I do not have the time to explore them fully. However, I can assure the Attorney that there will be ample time to do so at the Committee stage of this Bill. I will have no hesitation-and I imagine that many other senators in the chamber will not hesitate-in seeking explanation as to why, if anything, the Bill has not only not gone forwards but also gone backwards by the incorporation of new measures of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> The main thrust of the second paragraph of the amendment which is now before the chamber is to draw attention-as in fact I have already done in general terms-to the sins, in particular, of the bureaucracy in producing the kind of Bill we have at the moment. There appears to have been undue deference to the whims and wishes of senior public servants. Indeed, that has extended all the way back with only a handful of honourable exceptions-and by and large I would put the Attorney-General's Department in that category-to the original conception of this Bill before 1972. The role of the Public Service was made very evident in the contents of the original interdepartmental committee reports of 1974 and 1976, which are the best demonstrations I have heard of the accuracy of that definition of committees generally as culs-de-sac into which good ideas are lured and quietly strangled. </PARA>
<PARA> That was made equally evident in the oral evidence given before the Committee by a number of senior officials from a number of senior departments-most memorably perhaps by John Stone of Treasury-and also in some of the extravagant and overblown claims about the resource implications of proposed amendments which were made by some departments and agencies in their written evidence. It has been evident again in the campaign which largely has been conducted not publicly but in back rooms and in the Commonwealth Club by a number of senior public servants and departments involving, in particular, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Treasury, but with the leader of the pack undoubtedly being the Public Service Board and Sir William Cole, who I have described elsewhere in this context as being a kind of Gordon of Khartoum figure, determined that freedom of information will be won only over his dead bureaucratic body. </PARA>
<PARA> The third paragraph of the amendment makes obvious the point that substantial amendments are necessary if this legislation is to be worthy of its name. It has become a cliche to say that a more appropriate name for this Bill, like its 1978 predecessor, is not the Freedom of Information Bill but the Freedom from Information Bill. That cliche conceals a very real truth and that is the very real danger that this kind of legislation in practice will not become a gateway for giving access to information hitherto denied but rather will constitute a check list of reasons why information should, in fact, be refused. There is ample evidence of the way in which public servants are now-even before this Bill has any statutory force-in fact, using the formulae in the earlier drafts of this Bill to justify refusals to give information. Perhaps the most succinct, available list of such exercises is Senator Missen's collection of 35 responses to answers for questions which is contained in the appendix to the Senate Committee report. </PARA>
<PARA> The final paragraph of the amendment contains a reaffirmation of the basic principles of freedom of information which I-and certainly I believe a number of other senators all around this chamber-believe it is crucial to make at this time so that it will act as a kind of touchstone which we will not lose sight of in all the detailed debate which will undoubtedly follow in the next few weeks. It is the case that freedom of information legislation is, as the paragraph of the amendment states, indispensible to administrative justice for individuals. And it is the case that it is indispensible to sound and effective public sector decision making in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Bill, despite all the time, effort and controversy that have gone into its preparation, is not a good, effective, Freedom of Information Bill. It is our task, not as an Opposition or as a collection of unhappy individuals around the chamber, but rather as a Senate, as a Parliament, as elected representatives of the people, to make it a good, effective, Freedom of Information Bill. The extent to which we succeed, as a co-operative legislative exercise, in improving this Bill will be an excellent measure of the seriousness with which we are entitled in the future to describe ourselves as legislators and as parliamentarians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One speaks on the Freedom of Information Bill for the first time with somewhat mixed feelings. After campaigning for nine years for a Bill such as this, one finds a Bill of which one must be very critical. It is a Bill which introduces into this Parliament, for the first time, the concept of freedom of information. This is the first debate on that concept. Unfortunately it is a Bill with many defects-many of them have been explained by Senator Evans and many will be touched on by other honourable senators-and one realises that there is a very big task ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been interested in this subject for many years. I have been overseas to study the success which freedom of information has brought in the United States. After certain false starts and after overriding the will of the President on occasions, the Americans have been able to make freedom of information a very important addition to the democratic system and really to transform the situation. I and others have seen that in this country and in other countries there has been a growing interest in the need for freedom of information-that is, the opening up of government documents and material, the making available to ordinary members of the public and to members of parliament and to others a lot of material which for a long time has been retained by the Public Service and in the executive domain and which has not been allowed to be seen by the ordinary members of the public. </PARA>
<PARA> That public interest has grown in this country. It was demonstrated by the great deal of interest shown by the people who gave evidence before the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. It was demonstrated also by the many organisations which have been campaigning for a genuine freedom of information Act in this country. We have seen this interest growing during the term of office of different governments. Freedom of information is not a party political question. I have been campaigning for this Bill during the term of office of governments of different complexions, and I must say that one finds that there is resistance-perhaps not so much by governments but by those in the top echelon of the Public Service who have a great deal to hide. By that I mean in the sense that they want to keep a comfortable situation continuing unchanged. Unfortunately, we seek to tear down that veil.</PARA>
<PARA> One significant factor is that the Public Service in this community-that is, the people who work for the Government and who produce and receive documents for the Government-has grown enormously in the 80 years of Federation. At the time of Federation, something like 5 per cent to 6 per cent of the work force worked for the Government. It is now near to one-third. This has translated itself into an enormous amount of material held by the Government in the form of reports, advice, specialist activity and correspondence. All of these documents remain in the Public Service. Consequently freedom of information becomes even more important in a community in which we recognise that government activity has so much involvement in the affairs of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we are engaged in the second reading debate on this Bill. I will be supporting the motion for the second reading of the Bill. I believe taken all in all it is better to vote for the Bill. But I expect that when we consider the Bill in Committee we will need to do a great deal to make it worthwhile. We will need to ensure that in curing the defects in the Bill we avoid the situation where the public of this country will become cynical because they see no real results in relation to freedom of information. That is the danger with which we face and which we must overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have this situation: There is something of a struggle so far as the committee system of this Parliament is concerned, in the handling of this matter. As Senator Evans has said, the Senate Committee, of which I have the honour to be the Chairman, spent some 15 months studying this question, calling evidence, travelling across the country, trying to find out what were the needs and worries of various people, what were the worries of public servants-and we had many public servants before us. I base my attitude on that Committee's report, which was unanimous and which stands unchallenged in the public debate in this country. I stand behind the recommendations that our Committee adopted. Some 93 of them refer to this Bill. I believe the recommendations were based upon fact and sound argument. I await any consideration and any argument that shows that any of our various representations and conclusions were unsound. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee received 168 submissions and took evidence from 129 witnesses. As I say, it had many public servants before it, and it examined the various problems which were put to it as fundamental difficulties to be faced by a freedom of information system in this country. Reference has already been made by Senator Evans to the claims which were made-they were made repeatedly-that somehow the development of the concept of freedom of information was contrary to the fundamentals of the Westminster system of government. This has often been said but it has not been established. We heard a lot of evidence and had a lot of submissions to this effect. We concluded that there was nothing fundamental in the Westminster system which would in any way be harmed. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, we concluded that certain features of that system would be strengthened by the establishment of an effective freedom of information system. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to the conclusions contained in paragraph 4.62 of the Senate Committee report. After hearing all the evidence the Committee said:</PARA>
<PARA> We value the Westminster system of government; we do not seek to change it; nor do we believe effective freedom of information legislation would change it. A great deal of the talk about the Westminster system and how it would be altered by freedom of information legislation has been obscure and misleading. To a great extent the term 'Westminster system' has been used as a smoke-screen behind which to hide, and with which to cover up existing practices of unnecessary secrecy. Very often people have alleged that the Westminster system is under attack by freedom of information legislation when what is actually under attack is their own traditional and convenient way of doing things, immune from public gaze and scrutiny. We are indeed seeking to put an end to that. </PARA>
<PARA>We are certainly aiming to put an end to that. That, I think, is the cause of the considerable background criticism and resistance to this Bill. It is not more than criticism in the background, because when we read the newspapers, or if we read the correspondence to the newspapers, if we listen to the radio and television commentaries and statements, if we listen to the public in the street, there is nowhere to be found any defence of the Government's very limited Bill. Indeed, there is a great deal of criticism of the Bill and a great deal of support for the recommendations of the Senate Committee. That is the strength which those of us who support the amendments to the Bill have. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the second reading of the Bill. I also support the amendment which Senator Evans has moved this afternoon. It is a very moderate and sensible amendment which calls upon the Executive to reconsider its decision, to look again at the recommendations of the Senate Committee, and, in the Committee stage, to adopt a sympathetic consideration for the need for substantial amendment to the Bill. I cannot imagine that people could oppose or object to that. I think it is very important that we not only complete this debate but also adopt that amendment. Let us hope that consideration will be given to improving the system. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said that one of the matters which we dealt with at great length in the report-we stand by that-was the Westminster system. Second to that was another matter which has also been mentioned to some degree by Senator Evans, and that is the resource implications of the Bill. It has constantly been put, either against any freedom of information Bill at all or against the proposals which we now espouse, that somehow there would be an enormous amount of demand on the resources of the community. When one looks at the situation in different countries, particularly the United States of America where there is considerable demand one finds that it is possible for countries to cope. People talk about the enormous expenditure involved. In the United States the costs involved over the last few years were something like $35m a year. But the cost of public relations activities by the United States Government totals about $1,000m a year. The same type of situation applies in this country, where a great deal of money is spent by government on public relations, including the presentation of glossy publications. All governments do that. But the amount that will need to be spent on freedom of information is unlikely to be anything like that amount. </PARA>
<PARA> We commented on that aspect in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. In the course of our hearing we heard a lot of evidence on claims that excessive costs and excessive demands would be involved in instituting freedom of information. In our report we pointed out, among other things, the following in paragraph 6.19:</PARA>
<PARA> Although the Government has not promised to provide specific resources for freedom of information legislation, it has approved the allocation of some of the resources of the public service to the reform. We believe that the public service has the capacity to use this mandate with vigour and with success, and that it can do so, by and large, at less cost than critics of the proposed legislation assume. </PARA>
<PARA>We saw areas in which existing resources in the public relations field could be used in providing freedom of information. It is true that there is a difference between the two fields: Whereas governments like to publicise matters which are pleasant and supportive, providing freedom of information tends to permit the exposure of matters which are awkward, untimely and embarasssing for governments. However, such information is needed by people who are desirous of entering into public debate and of being informed on issues covered in that debate. </PARA>
<PARA> On the matter of costs, the Committee stated further, in paragraph 6.46 of its report:</PARA>
<PARA> When this question was last publicly examined . . . the direct cost of the government information sections amounted in all to some $51 million: early in 1975, some 800 staff were employed in special information sections in departments, and further large numbers were employed in the statutory authorities. Agencies responding to our own question, asked in the Public Service Board Survey, as to the number of people employed at present in preparing manuals and supplying information to the public, confirmed that some hundreds of public servants are engaged in this work. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, we drew attention to the 1976 interdepartmental committee report, which observed:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . part of the apparent 'freedom of information' workload of departments could perhaps more properly be regarded as a continuation of existing departmental services of providing information to the public. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are the words of the government IDC which advised on the matter. In our report we went on to recommend:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the task force to which we have referred should take our findings and recommendations into account so that the procedures associated with freedom of information and with the provision of governmental information can be properly brought together and savings made. </PARA>
<PARA>A great deal of consideration was given to the resource implications. We believed that our recommedations were moderate. We moderated them for the very reason of keeping costs down and keeping down the level of demand resulting, in the early years, from the implementation of freedom of information legislation. I believe that it is accepted not only here but also in Canada and other countries that it is possible, by phasing in certain elements, including time limits and matters of prior documentation, to take into account resource demands. Therefore, we believe that the Senate Committee's recommendations should have been accepted. In formulating them we took into account the very major considerations and objections which were raised by the people who came before us. Unfortunately, most of our recommendations have not been accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting I had traced to some extent the history of the effort which we in this country have made to obtain freedom of information. I have spoken of the support which I am giving to the second reading of the Bill and to the amendment moved by Senator Evans. I also said that the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs believed that its report really faced up to the real problems, the real questions that have been asked about freedom of information, and had contained recommendations which the Committee felt had covered those important questions. But we now find ourselves in a situation in which many of those most important recommendations have been rejected and are not in the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now, therefore, to the 1981 Bill which contains some minor changes made to the Bill which was introduced in 1978 but which was never debated. The new Bill has picked up some of the recommendations of the Senate Committee, but unfortunately, with one or two exceptions, they are relatively minor ones. Certainly the new Bill takes up the suggestion that commercial interests and commercial secrets should be protected and that people with genuine interests ought to have the right to be heard before the Tribunal and to appeal against decisions to release information. The new Bill incorporates other useful suggestions, but at the same time incorporates a number of other procedural hurdles, difficulties, for people to overcome to get information from government. All in all, it is very doubtful whether much improvement has come from the changes. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently I took the opportunity of writing what I have described as the seven deadly sins of omission in the Bill. In the document I set out what I consider to be the major defects of the Bill. For the sake of convenience-I have spoken to the responsible Minister and to the Leader of the Opposition about this matter-I seek leave to incorporate that document in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS OF OMISSION</PARA>
<PARA>from the</PARA>
<PARA>Federal Government's 1981 Freedom of Information Bill</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>(1) Conclusive Ministerial Certificates The Government refuses to abandon the provisions which deny any right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against refusals to disclose government documents in many important areas and the Bill provides that the Minister's certificate is to be final and unchallengeable. The major areas affected are: documents relating to national security, defence, international relations, relations with States, cabinet and executive council documents and the determination of what is 'contrary to the public interest' in relation to 'internal working documents'. Internal working documents are widely defined as covering the 'deliberative processes' involved in the functions of an agency, Minister or Government and therefore are likely to cover a vast majority of government records. Any material marked by a State government or official as 'confidential' may be denied to the public without any right of challenge. One State Government has already indicated its intention to mark all its communications 'confidential'. </PARA>
<PARA> Compare the Canadian FOI Bill, now triumphantly passing through the Canadian House of Commons, where all parties insist on a right of appeal, in these areas, at least as wide as the Australian Senate Committee's proposals for a review on the proper categorization of the document. </PARA>
<PARA> (See Clauses 28, 29, 30, 31 and 48 of the FOI Bill and the Senate Constitutional and Legal Affairs Report on Freedom of Information '(Senate Committee Report)' Chapters 13, 16, 17, 18 and 19 and Paragraphs 5.10 to 19 and 27.9 to 22)</PARA>
<PARA>(2) Existing Government Records With one minor exception, the FOI Bill will not apply to or give access to prior or current documents in government hands but only to documents created after the Bill comes into operation. Thus the vast array of existing reports, correspondence and other records, compiled at the taxpayers expense, will remain secret. The Bill makes no provision for the phasing in of existing records (many of them of current significance) over a period of years as proposed by the Senate Committee Report. Compare, again, the Canadian Bill which provides for a phasing in of existing records over a period of five years. </PARA>
<PARA> (See Clause 11 (2) of the Bill and Paragraphs 6.34 to 38 and 14.1 to 19 of the Senate Committee Report). </PARA>
<PARA>(3) Grounds of Exemption of Documents The Senate Committee recommended substantial amendments to the grounds for rejection of access to documents that were set out in the 1978 FOI Bill. It proposed the deletion of three grounds and the clarification of the language of others. Experience has regrettably shown that senior bureaucrats will take advantage of vague powers and loose expressions to refuse access to documents. The 1981 Bill substantially rejects those Senate Committee proposals, adds a number of further grounds of exemption and, in redrafting exemptions, adds to the documents that may be withheld. Furthermore, new provisions increase the administrative powers of officials to deny access. </PARA>
<PARA> The 'right to know'-the access to government records-is thereby further reduced. The accompanying Archives Bill extends the same exemptions on access absurdly to documents more than thirty years old. </PARA>
<PARA> (See Clauses 8, 15, 20, 21, 23, 28 and 43 of the Bill and Chapters 15 to 26 and 33 of the Senate Committee Report)</PARA>
<PARA>(4) Personal Records The new Bill makes no provision for the Senate Committee recommendations that individuals should have a right to know what information is held in government records about them, to have access to and to inspect records and have them corrected, where the information is false or inaccurate. Protection of individual rights and privacy should go hand in hand with freedom of information. </PARA>
<PARA> (See Paragraphs 24.16 to 18 of the Senate Committee Report)</PARA>
<PARA>(5) Exempt Government Agencies The new Bill is improved by the inclusion, in the Schedules, of the various agencies which the Government proposes to exempt either entirely from the FOI requirements or to exempt as to specific classes of documents, for example 'documents in respect of its competitive commercial activities'. What is alarming is the number and range of exempt agencies proposed (and which can be added to by subsequent regulations). </PARA>
<PARA> Twenty-four agencies, including the intelligence agencies, banks, TAA and a miscellaneous selection, are to be totally exempt, and nineteen other agencies are to be exempt as to certain classes of documents. </PARA>
<PARA> The exemptions are excessive and some that are totally exempt should merely be exempt as to specific classes of documents. It is a further unnecessary inroad into the public's right to know. </PARA>
<PARA> (See Clause 6 and Schedules Part I and II of the Bill and Chapter 12 of the Senate Committee Report)</PARA>
<PARA>(6)Ombudsman's Conciliatory, Counselling and Monitoring Roles in FOI The Bill substantially rejects the Senate Committee's proposals for an effective involvement of the Ombudsman in the practical utilization of FOI. Since the right of successful applicants for reimbursement of costs incurred in enforcing their rights was rejected by the Government, there was even more reason to employ the Ombudsman to assist applicants, by negotiations with government agencies, by representing them before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and generally in monitoring the effective operation of the FOI Act. Those proposals are almost totally ignored in the 1981 Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Canadian Bill creates an equivalent office of Information Commissioner to assist the citizen in exercising his rights, and the same practical assistance, through the Ombudsman, is called for in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> (See Clause 47 of the Bill and Paragraphs 6.42 and 3, 9.11 and 12, 13.8 and 9, 19.26, 27.4 and 5, 27.23-28, and generally Chapter 29 of the Senate Committee Report)</PARA>
<PARA>(7) Secrecy Provisions in Existing Legislation The Senate Committee drew attention to the vast array of secrecy provisions in existing Commonwealth legislation, prohibiting disclosure of information. These are contained in the Commonwealth Crimes Act, and in 109 Acts of Parliament, 85 other Commonwealth Rules, Ordinances and other legislation. (Listed in Appendix 6 of the Senate Committee Report). </PARA>
<PARA> Many existing provisions are inconsistent with FOI principles and the 1981 FOI Bill. The Senate Committee proposed that a list of the secrecy provisions that are to be retained, be prescribed in the FOI Bill that they be brought into line with the criteria contained in the exemptions in the Bill, and that other secrecy provisions be repealed. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposals have been rejected and apparently no action is to be taken to reconcile the new FOI rights with inconsistent existing laws. </PARA>
<PARA> (See Clause 33 of the Bill and Chapter 21 of the Senate Committee Report)</PARA>
<PARA>A Freedom of Information Attitude</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Taken together, these deficiencies remove a very large part of government information from public use. Yet I have dealt only with some major objections to the Bill. A Freedom of Information law which contains these defects will make a nonsense of public expectations for the opening up of government documents, will provide ready weapons for senior bureaucrats in denying access to inconvenient facts and will add to public cynicism. </PARA>
<PARA> Two statements are worth repeating:</PARA>
<PARA> Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser said (22/9/1976)</PARA>
<PARA> 'If the Australian electorate is to be able to make valid judgments on government policy it should have the greatest access to information possible. How can any community progress without continuing and informed and intelligent debate? How can there be debate without information?'</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament's duty now is to create a FOI Act that does make the greatest access possible and which accords with the true expectations of those to whom it has been promised in repeated election campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA> The second statement is that of the Canadian Progressive Conservative leader (Mr Clark) when, as Prime Minister, he introduced a Freedom of Information Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> 'The starting point for a freedom of information law is a freedom of information attitude.'</PARA>
<PARA>This is the time to find out whether Australians have that attitude and whether they will insist on an appropriate FOI law. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. In that document I have set out the seven major defects. Of course, I will not go into them in any detail, but I just want to repeat what they are, in my view. In the first place, the conclusive ministerial certificate stands out as probably the worst defect in the present Bill because it covers a great many of the documents that ought to be released and because it gives Ministers the absolute right, by certificate, to refuse to disclose documents, and thereby denies to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal any opportunity to investigate whether they are documents of the sort that should not be released or whether in any way the exemption claimed for them is justified. It covers a great many areas. It also covers such a wide area of 'internal working documents'-the deliberate processes of government or of a department-that it is my estimation that the great majority of documents in the Government's hands may well be covered by that one exemption alone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It also covers documents which the State governments and their agencies sent to the Commonwealth and which they may claim are confidential. One of the problems which the Senate Committee faced in the evidence it took was that presented in the material placed before it by Sir Charles Court, the Premier of Western Australia. He claimed that by the Bill, which remains unaltered today, the State governments would be placed in a difficult situation. I want to read a small extract from his submission to the Committee. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> In all these appeals, there is no provision in the Bill for the State Government to be consulted or participate in the decision-making process leading to the disclosure or non-disclosure of State Government documents. </PARA>
<PARA> I firmly believe that the Bill should be amended to provide for State participation in decisions as to whether a certificate should be issued under Clause 23 (2)--</PARA>
<PARA>That is now clause 28 (2)-</PARA>
<PARA>and, in cases where such a certificate is not granted, as to whether State Government documents should be disclosed. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Bill is presently drafted, the State may have to mark all of its correspondence to the Commonwealth 'confidential' so as to bring its documents within Clause 23 (1) (b). </PARA>
<PARA>That is now clause 28. </PARA>
<PARA> I would hope that this need not occur and that the Bill can be amended as I have suggested. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill has not been amended as Sir Charles Court suggested. So we may be in the ludicrous position in which all documents coming from some of the States will be marked 'confidential', will be confidential and will not be disclosed thereafter because of certificates given by the Commonwealth; and a great deal of information which ought to be within the public domain and which ought to be known by the citizens will not be available. Moreover, the States will not have the right to approach the Tribunal to suggest that there are good reasons for non-disclosure. The conclusive ministerial certificate is just one problem, and it is a very bad one indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The second omission concerns existing government records; a great mass of material will not be made available to the public. Of course, that will mean that much of this legislation will not be in real and active operation for many years. Access will be denied to all existing records, many of them personally involving individuals. I come to the third omission. The grounds of exemption, which the Senate Committee claimed were much too wide, have been extended to some degree in the new Bill. There have been some redrafts and some improvements. At the same time the Committee's idea that three of the grounds were unnecessary has been ignored and three other grounds have been added. If we look at the lengthy exemptions, we find a very interesting situation. In the very excellent and successful United States Freedom of Information Act there is one page of grounds, but in Australia six pages are needed to describe the grounds for exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the fourth omission. Personal records are not to be made available, nor will there be any right of correction of records which are ill-advised, wrong, false or just misleading. The fifth omission concerns the position of exempt government agencies, as described in the Schedules. I say little more than that there are too many of them, that some of them are given exemption far beyond the needs of the community and that we must examine them very closely. Next, the Ombudsman has been denied his conciliatory, counselling and monitoring roles which the Committee recommended. This is of great significance. In Canada there is to be an information commissioner with all the necessary powers. The Canadians, under their Bill, as I will tell the Senate, have managed to give powers which are denied to the Ombudsman here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the secrecy provisions in the law-those that apply to 109 Acts of Parliament of the Commonwealth and to 85 pieces of legislation-are not to be reviewed or reduced. Many of them will stand there in contradistinction to the freedom of information law. This new legislation is analagous to a good looking apple from which four or five pieces have been eaten; it is only a core and is not of much use. I do not know that our job is to restore the apple, but our job is certainly to restore to the public the 'right to know'. I have said that the Canadians are doing it differently. The Canadians are in a parallel position to us. They live in a very similar federal democracy which regards the Westminster system as very important. In Canada all the parties are agreed on a very significant and important freedom of information Bill. On 29 January of this year they unanimously adopted the second reading of that Bill and are now considering it clause by clause in the Committee stage. Senator Durack, in his second reading speech, after discussing the various countries which are either passing or trying to pass freedom of information laws, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Each of the proposals I have mentioned has incorporated the same basic approach as is in the present Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>I have to say that I do not think that is so. I think there are great differences between the proposed laws in these other countries, and particularly in Canada, and this one which we have before us. Senator Durack went on:</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, there are differences in the nature of the parliamentary institutions in each country, which affect the relationships between Ministers and the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I have to say again that I do not think there is any real difference at all between our country and the Canadian nation, which I think will have a very good freedom of information law in a little while. In addition, the Canadian provinces, as they are called, and the Canadian Government have an impetus towards freedom of information. The Ontario Government has in fact had an inquiry going into freedom of information for some years, and now has an excellent report and will soon have an Act on the statute book. When the report came down, the Government of Ontario gave the order that public servants were to obey it immediately as though the legislation were already in operation and that they were already to apply the spirit of the recommendations. In Australia we have not done so. Likewise, unfortunately, our States have not taken initiatives. They are waiting until the Commonwealth has finished dealing with its law. Unfortunately, there has been something of a different spirit in the governments of Australia compared with the governments of Canada which are prepared to experiment and to go forward. The present Leader of the Opposition in Canada, Mr Clark, when he was Prime Minister, referring to the freedom of information Bill which he introduced in the House at that time, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The starting point for a freedom of information law is a freedom of information attitude. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is important that we develop-in the next few weeks I hope we develop this much more in this community-a freedom of information attitude not only by governments and by public servants but also by people and by organisations which really want to see this law operate. We have had a habit of secrecy in this country for a long time. Even people who have come to this country have noticed it. In 1969 the Canadian Government task force looked at Australia, among other countries, and concluded in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> Totalitarian capitals apart, only official Canberra comes close to matching that special air of furtive reticence which marks the Ottawa mandarins off from other men. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think there has been a great change since 1969. The rather successful efforts to date of the mandarins of Canberra have managed to keep this Bill from being very effective. It has been mentioned by Senator Evans already that a couple of years ago I put down some 35 parliamentary questions and got answers. An analysis of those questions and answers is to be found in our Senate Committee report, at pages 481 to 484. The report contains answers which public servants gave before the Bill was even tabled, to all these relatively minor requests for information. Of course, we see the answers some of them 'would be prejudicial to international relations' and others were 'internal working documents'. They used the very phrases which are in this Bill. We may be sure that if those phrases are loose and widely used as excuses for denial of documents they will also be used by public servants to deny access to much information after the Bill is passed. </PARA>
<PARA> We know also that in respect of the local scene there has not yet been a great deal of effort to get ready for freedom of information. The Australian Consumers Association, in a report which it made in the last few days, noted:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there was great variation between the departments in their state of readiness for the implementation of FOI legislation and also, apparently, in the attitude adopted towards requests for information. </PARA>
<PARA>The Association further noted:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the majority of Departments had not appointed staff to positions specifically dealing with the implementation of FOI legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>We must come to the conclusion, therefore, that we have a battle on our hands and that in fact we must prepare and complete a Bill and an Act which will be watertight and which will not allow loose ends. We cannot afford to have enormous sweeping exemptions. We cannot afford to cut a lot of people off from their rights. We cannot afford to have undue costs and undue requirements which will stop people or which cause them to lose enthusiasm in their attempt to improve the level of information and public debate in this country. It is for these reasons that we fight on in this battle. Though I hope this Bill will pass the second reading stage, I hope it will be enormously improved in the Committee stage and honourable senators on both sides of the chamber will do their best to ensure, with the help of the public and of organisations which see the value of having really informed public information and public spirit in this country, that this is a good Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore say that if open government is to mean something in this country, this is the one opportunity. It is not good enough to pass a weak Bill now and hope that it might be improved in ten years' time. The lack of enthusiasm, the crushing of the spirit of the people who have endeavoured to do something about the state of public discussion will be such that we will probably take a long time to improve it. I say that we must therefore ensure that today and in the weeks to come we create a good, strong Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I applaud Senator Missen for his closing remarks because I think they set the keynote for all those people in this country-there is an increasing number of them-to whom this has now become a vitally important issue. It is perhaps as important as any issue in the country, even to people who are concerned with the cost of health care, the cost of bringing up a family, inflation, unemployment. All those things are important, but I suggest they have an involvement with the Freedom of Information Bill. I should like to commence my comments in the second reading debate on the Bill with two quotations. The first is from the High Court judgment on the Fraser Government's application for an injunction regarding the book Documents on Australian Defence and Foreign Policy 1968-1975 which will be well known to honourable senators. In that judgment of 1 December 1980 Mr Justice Mason said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is unacceptable in our democratic society that there should be a restraint on the publication of information relating to the Government when the only vice of that information is that it enables the public to discuss, review and criticise Government action . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I should like to stress those final words 'the only vice of that information is that it enables the public to discuss, review and criticise government action'. So far as the Australian Democrats are concerned, those words could not put the situation better. That is what we want. We want a Freedom of Information Bill which will allow that to happen-continuous discussion, review and criticism of government action-because that is the only way in which a free and independent society can preserve itself. The second quotation I wish to give is from Mr Alan Renouf, former Australian Ambassador to the United Nations and now an almost passionate advocate of open government. He says that it is because of his experiences as a public servant that he is such an advocate of open government. On 3 December 1980 he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the theory behind the classification of documents is often . . . the less you reveal to the public . . . the less opportunity the public has to review your actions. Keep them in the dark as much as possible and when there is any doubt, classify!</PARA>
<PARA>There I think we have Mr Justice Mason's cri de coeur of what should happen and then an experienced diplomat's view of what does happen. I think we ought to be guided by the views of those two men. The debate on the so-called Freedom of Information Bill presents me with an extraordinary temptation. I am almost tempted to move an amendment to the actual short title of the Bill. Maybe something like the Public Secrets (Preservation) Bill would be appropriate. If I wished to devise legislation which would make it as difficult as possible for journalists, researchers and the public to gain access to the vast bulk of official information in this country, I would regard this information as it now stands as a promising beginning. Indeed, that is the vast irony, the vast tragedy of the situation with this Bill which has been in gestation for so long-almost a decade one way or another-and which pretends to provide the Australian community with adequate freedom of information law in fact does exactly the opposite. Its almost constant preoccupation is with definitions of what information may not be given and what organisations are immune from the giving of information. As both Senator Evans and Senator Missen have said-I think this will come up time and time again during the Committee stage of the Bill-very few reasons are given for this. There is no rationalisation for a great deal of this. It is arbitrary. It is very important to note at this stage that the Government has not really tried to justify this Bill. It has said the Bill does a certain thing but it has not really explained the gaps and the holes in it and the reason why it is the way it is. The Australian Democrats suggest that this is because the Government has come under the strongest possible pressure from the bureaucracy and that it has yielded to that pressure. Not only has it yielded to that pressure but also it has done so in the teeth of a reasoned investigation by Senator Missen's committee of this matter with evidence being given by virtually everybody in this country who might have an important contribution to make and also in the face of a degree of public interest in the issue which has led not to one but to several organisations of citizens being founded purely to see that the Bill is changed as much as possible along the lines recommended by Senator Missen's committee. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an extraordinary fact-the fact that we become blase about these things in this place should not blind us to the fact that a strange thing is happening in a democratic country-that a government should allow this process to go ahead, knowing that virtually every person in this country who might have had an important input to this legislation and was motivated so to do has done so, and then look at the recommendations that have resulted from that inquiry, probably as heavy and as intensive a piece of community consultation as has ever taken place in this country and then largely ignore what the committee recommended. I think that indicates the degree to which the Government is under constraints. It has been told by someone in some place or some group of people that there is not to be effective freedom of information legislation in this country. The Bill in its present form, like the earlier one, if it is eloquent about any one thing it is eloquent about that. </PARA>
<PARA> I say that because the degree to which immunities have been given from giving of information, the degree of exceptions and exemptions on the types of documents, is so great, so extensive, such astounding overkill, that it is no joke at all to suggest that the real motivation of the Bill is to preserve the processes of secret government in Australia. Over the next few weeks, perhaps even months, the long battle over individual clauses in this Bill in the Committee stage will go on. Many thousands of words will be spoken. At many times those discussions will revolve around what might appear to be relatively minor and technical points but they will all be important points. The Democrats will play what part we can in the Committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> But let me say at this point that I believe there is nobody in this country-certainly it is not I or anybody in the Democrats and probably it is no other senator-who could claim to have in his mind or at his finger tips the encyclopedic knowledge of the implications of this matter that Senator Missen has. That is why I was glad to hear him speak earlier in this debate and say the things he did say. I believe he spoke with a degree of integrity and a degree of devotion to the public cause which we in this place can only admire. I hope that Government senators will emulate him and see this matter as it truly is-a matter which should be beyond party politics, which is very close to the ideal we were elected to this place to preserve. That is, the idea that this country shall remain not only a democratic country with its shows and forms of democracy but also a country which is demonstrably so free and so open in its government as to be a good example to other countries around us. </PARA>
<PARA> We are seeing now that the democracies which were founded in former colonies in much of South East Asia and South Asia have not survived. A few have. In India democracy has survived. In Singapore it has survived after a fashion with grave constraints. But everywhere in the area around us, which is important to us, democracy is at threat. Every year the number of countries that have reasonable representative governments diminishes. Every year a country is taken over by military force or by its own military junta. Unfortunately after a while one becomes almost attuned to these things and one accepts them. I think it is terribly dangerous that one should accept this situation. I wonder too whether constant association with these things blunts one's own perception. In other words, we may be in danger of accepting that certain things should happen in this country because they are happening in other countries. This is a tendency of human beings, a sort of process of habituation. Perhaps we should look at ourselves more carefully and consider whether what I suggest is possible in this country. If it comes about it could be the beginning of the road which would lead this country in the direction those other countries have taken. Democracy, which all of us here should try to preserve because it is our business to preserve it and that is the reason for our being here, has been shown not to be all that strong. It is fragile. It is a growth which can be maintained and prosper in the community only if it is nurtured and only if those of us and the others who believe in it and who feel that it should be perpetuated make sure that at all times the conditions in which it can persevere continue. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is important in this second reading debate to define the broad importance of this legislation to the Australian community, what it will do for the Australian community and what it might be able to do if it were constructively amended. Honourable senators such as Senator Missen and Senator Evans who are lawyers have already got down to a degree of detail. I respect their reasons but perhaps that makes a more general overview a useful preliminary. I reiterate as a cardinal first point that the Bill is not what it pretends to be. The Australian public is being sold a pup. The Government, firmly under the control of its senior bureaucrats, will have to be carried kicking and screaming eventually into providing adequate freedom of information legislation, and it knows that full well. I cannot believe that honourable senators on the other side of the Senate are so unintelligent as not to appreciate at a glance, as most other people can, the inadequacies of this legislation. That is why the Australian Democrats believe that a proper public appreciation of this matter and its importance is absolutely vital to the future health and freedom of our society because I believe it will in the end be an enlightened and vociferous public opinion that will win this battle-and a long and notable battle it will be. In the end it will bring truly open government to Australia. This is a bench-mark type of situation. This Bill is of great importance. It will be historic. It will be looked back on. Perhaps the vote on this amendment will be looked back on as something of vital importance and something by which history will measure people's views and integrity. I say that to honourable senators opposite not in any spirit of criticism but because I honestly believe it to be a fact that this is an issue beyond politics and one which requires an enormous degree of courage on their part. I believe they will get their rewards for their courage if they are prepared to exert it. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is important to the ordinary person because governments create legislation, regulations and the whole fabric of law within which people must carry their day to day lives. People very much take this for granted. A law comes in, some new thing happens and people say: 'Yes, I have got to do this and I have got to do that'. But I wonder how many people understand that it is a constant process on a battlefield where many various groups in the community contend against one another to gain some sort of advantage, legal or financial. All honourable senators know this because we regularly come into contact with these pressure groups and we know how strong they can make their representations at times, how unfair those representations can be at times and how some will stop at nothing to press their point of view. These pressure groups are not necessarily dishonest in their view although they sometimes are in fact-and of course the two things are different. But in either case, whether or not they believe they are dishonest they do believe they deserve their advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> All of us are a little like that where our own interests are concerned. That granted, it becomes extremely important to know where and how influence is being exerted on the process of government. Just as those influences are continuous, so must the monitoring process also be continuous. That is why in recent years-perhaps recent decades would be a more accurate statement-in most of the larger free societies, the democracies, a major demand for good freedom of information legislation has built up in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it has been due, at least in part, to the growing complexity of government and the growing awareness of the community that it gets the kind of laws that it deserves, that more community involvement is required, that it is not good enough for members of parliament and representatives to be left merely to fight off pressure groups. For a variety of reasons, they cannot always do that effectively. They have things called elections which happen every three years in which unfair pressures can be brought to bear. I refer to such pressures as were exerted by the Right to Life movement on certain Victorian members of parliament in the last election. I believe such pressures ought not to be placed on members of parliament. I think it is essential that the community realises that they are exerted. Because of that the community must play its part in the process of government. To do that a community has to have information. Its line to information is normally the media. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not much sympathy with those honourable senators who have said in this place that the media people would like to see the Freedom of Information Bill go ahead as the sort of tame pussycat that we now see before us in the form of this draft legislation-I call it draft legislation for good reason-because they like the system of leaks and obtaining information secretly, something which falls off the back of a truck. I dispute that claim absolutely. I have many good friends in the media. I am an ex-journalist myself. I say that that is not the way in which these people like to work. They like to work in an ordinary, reasonable and open way, as does everybody else in pursuing a career. The fact that there have been so many leaks in our society and the fact that so many documents fall off the back of trucks is due to the refusal of the Government to provide the means whereby fair information can be obtained fairly. That situation will get worse-much worse-if this Bill is passed. There is no reason in the world for the Government to expect anything else. </PARA>
<PARA> I reject totally the claim that journalists do not support the concept of good freedom of information legislation. Those journalists I have met and discussed the matter with do support it. Those newspapers that I normally read have made it very plain in their editorials and elsewhere in the last week or so that they certainly are in favour of good freedom of information legislation. If injustices-perhaps injustices affecting thousands of people-are to be avoided, there is a need for a free flow of information about what government is doing. The media know that. At the moment I am personally involved in two or three issues which could be advanced much more quickly if freedom of information legislation existed in this country. I have been trying to investigate things that are going on at present and I have come up against a blank wall. The point was made earlier-I think it should be made again-that this situation is beginning to infiltrate Question Time in this place. Recently I have read a number of answers to questions on notice. There is no doubt that whoever drafts the answers-after all, there is a responsibility on the honourable senator or honourable member who signs or creates a reply to see that it is honest-is including a remarkable degree of double talk. Those people often resort to evasion, gibberish and anything at all to avoid giving an honest answer to a request for information. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does the honourable senator not agree that it is important that the public realises this? They will not know unless somebody tells them, will they? It is important that government and senior public servants know that at any time the basis on which they make decisions could become public. That would give them a healthy respect for public opinion which they lack at present. A Bill such as this, which contains a whole myriad of provisions allowing public servants to avoid disclosure of their methods, and even of their inadequacies, is against the general public interest. That may seem to some honourable senators to be a truism, but it is of the most fundamental importance. I refer to a Japanese proverb. It goes back a long time in history. It means: 'People despised, official exalted'. It epitomises the attitudes eventually engendered by the processes of secret government. It grew up through those long centuries during which Japan was under complete autocratic government. This tendency towards official concealment is notoriously part of human nature. Probably everybody listening to me tonight has had some experience of it in Australia. Indeed, as Senator Missen has said, secret government has become a habit at all levels of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most Australians-I know this applies to many people to whom I have spoken-regard it as an inevitable evil, something with which we have to learn to live, and something with which we will have to go on living. I suggest that if that view is becoming current in the community it is most unfortunate because it is not the case. If we could get good freedom of information legislation it could never be the case. Another reason why I think the Government should be castigated-indeed, we do castigate it-is that it has come back to the Senate with this absurd, posturing imitation of a freedom of information Bill which differs, as Senator Missen said, so little from what was presented to us years ago. We are actually expected to have a continuation of the kind of Gilbertian situation in which it was the freedom of information law in another country-the United States of America-which made important revelations about Australian official activity, such as the circumstances in which we became involved in the Vietnam War. The truth, which had been a casualty within the Australian official scene on that subject, was revealed only by enlightened and adequate legislation in another country. It has been said in the United States-and indeed, it is true-that if good freedom of information legislation had not existed in the United States the Watergate situation would never have been revealed and probably Richard Nixon would still be President of the United States. What we are talking about has that degree of importance and significance. </PARA>
<PARA> What would be good enough, just good enough, would be legislation which could establish the truth as fully as possible while still being consistent with national security-the Australian Democrats see the need for that security-and fair and reasonable commercial and privacy considerations. Legislation based only on those considerations is something a healthy community needs as much as it needs schools, traffic regulations, a good police force and the means of ordinary justice. We should be able to take freedom of information about the processes of government as much for granted as the air we breathe. Why should we not be able to do so? After all, Australia is supposed to be a democracy. Sadly, tendencies in Australia are more and more towards secret government. Why is that so? I sincerely believe it is because we have a deeply entrenched secret government-a group of senior bureaucrats who believe they have the Government in their pockets. The tendency of parliaments to waste so much of their time on confrontation and inter-party bickering has given these bureaucrats the opportunity they needed to entrench themselves more and more. A Minister who regularly defends himself against attacks is inclined to leave most of the detail of the running of his department to his public servants. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact that most political parties are not able, for one reason or another-partly for financial reasons and because of the difficulties of research-to carry as much work into policy as they should. Perhaps it would be easier when a party came to government to have a well-researched policy group-a group of people who knew about a particular area and who followed developments in it regularly-which could test ideas that are put to a new Minister by the bureaucrats. I put that idea to the other parties as something that they might work towards. The Australian Democrats use that procedure as best we can. We do not say that we are uniformly successful but we do have these policy groups. We realise that in any government a new Minister is very much at the mercy of bureaucrats. He has a vested interest against him not to break with them. I think the nature of the Cabinet system tends to support and accentuate that situation. These people, the bureaucrats-here again, they probably have the best of intentions; they probably think they are doing a damn fine job for the country-want their actions, past, present and future, to remain secret. That is why this Bill is drafted in its present form. It is as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA> This Freedom of Information Bill is not merely a legalistic academic Bill. Although many times during the debate it may appear to be that, in reality it deals very much with a gut issue connected closely with the daily lives and the welfare of the people. The Bill provides its refuges for the bureaucracy. It gives it several ways and means of ducking out on providing important and significant information. One of these ways is the ability to certify documents as being exempt. The way in which it may be done is quite simple. It will not be done with mirrors or anything like that. Under the legislation we can exempt as many documents as we feel might be embarrassing. We have enough blanket provisions to make sure that whole areas of documents, or virtually any document, can be made exempt if we wish to do so. Of course another way is to exempt whole organisations from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Bill 1981 so they will never be concerned with freedom of information. There is no question whatsoever of their having to account in any respect. That is a vital point because, as I will say later, a large number of organisations are exempted completely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And 19 in the other category. Of course, there is another method of exemption. The Minister, or even a public servant by delegation, if he thinks that it will take his department too much time and trouble to give information, can make a subjective judgment and say that he will not provide information. That is a provision under clause 8 (6) of the Bill, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . modify compliance with a request for information on the grounds that it represents too great a workload on staff of a government department. </PARA>
<PARA>One area of exempt papers that I will deal with in a little more detail is internal working documents. It is an intriguing example of the way the people who devised this Bill-I do not blame the draftsmen-the politicians, go about it. They have used the phrase 'internal working documents'. These are not available for disclosure in the terms of the Bill as it stands. What is an internal working document? I would have thought that in the broad sweep of the total business of government very few documents of any great basic importance would not be considered in one way or another by some area of government as matters to be taken into account in policy forming. But even that is not of great importance. It is not necessary that a document actually is an internal working document; it is enough that it can be said that it is. I think that that is one of the more serious aspects of this legislation. All that is required is a decision by an official not to make a certain document available and that somehow it can be presented as an internal working document at some stage, at some time and in some sort of operation and it can be exempted for that reason. I suggest that that blanket provision would make it inevitable that very few documents of importance will be got through to the people who will use this Act, even if they are prepared to go through the incredible degrees of difficulty which will be involved in going through the process. A newspaper recently published a diagram which looks rather like Hampton Court maze. This is a flow chart for instruction drawn up by public servants on how they are to handle approaches on freedom of information from the public. One look at that chart would put off all but the most determined inquirer. But even when the most determined inquirer gets through, the government has got him or her in other ways. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn very briefly to a few other major flaws. The Bill will apply to documents created after its proclamation. Therefore everything that has happened in the past will remain secret. Conclusive decisions of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) on exempt documents are not subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal so it is in the Minister's hands to decide. This is supposed to be a freedom of information Bill. Regulations may be used to create-not legislation; it will not come before Parliament-more exempt agencies and classes of documents. Search and inspection fees could be so high as to deny reasonable access of people to documents. Most exemptions are so vague and broad, as I have said, they could encompass a whole range of innocuous information. There are grave procedural barriers, especially where a journalist tries to write a story, because 60 days may elapse before a request must be answered. This situation is absurd. If somebody wants something quickly he should be able to get it quickly and not have public servants say: 'Come back in two months time and you might get it'. There is no requirement that indexes of major types of documents be prepared in the publication of information from agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> I will look briefly at these exempt agencies. I think that anybody who listens will ask: Why should authorities such as the Aboriginal land councils and trusts, the Australian Industry Development Corporation, the Australian Overseas Projects Corporation, the Australian Shipping Commission, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Commission, the Pipeline Authority and the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation be entirely exempt? In Schedule 1 they are exempted. The Australian Democrats say that those authorities should go to the second category at least in which people are exempt only in relation to particular documents. We will be looking very carefully at this whole area in the Committee stage of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, is a bad law to be regarded as better than a worse one? It is a question worth asking. Our view is that after almost a decade of preparation and detailed painstaking work of our Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, and the huge input from the public, this legislation is not good enough. We support the second reading amendment. We oppose a pious, minor cosmetic effort as not good enough. Once again, I exhort honourable senators opposite for once to use their consciences and exert their duty as members of parliament, rather than as politicians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Freedom of Information Bill 1981 and I rise to support the second reading amendment so ably moved by my colleague, Senator Evans. At this stage of the debate I would like to make some general remarks because our specific reservations about the Bill and our improvements to it will be dealt with in the Committee stage. This debate provides one of the most disappointing episodes that I have experienced in all my time in this Parliament. I am sure that when I say that I am speaking for many senators in this place. Why should this be? The importance of freedom of information legislation has never been disputed. The legislation has been long awaited and, unlike most other legislation that comes into this place, its introduction in this form has been preceded by long and thorough preparation. Through the work of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs the public has had a rarely extended opportunity to contribute to the preparation of this legislation. The general public took advantage of this opportunity in a most energetic and constructive manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As well as contributions from individual members of the public, there was a wide range of contributions from politicians, government departments, statutory authorities, professional associations, academics, trade unions, researchers, public interest groups and newspapers. The long and thorough preparation culminated in the Senate Standing Committee report on the Freedom of Information Bill 1978 and aspects of the Archives Bill 1978 printed on 6 November 1979. I congratulate all members of that Senate Committee for providing this chamber and this Parliament with such an excellent document. In the preparation of this document and in the debate on the freedom of information issue there was an unusually high level of unanimity about the importance of freedom of information and the form it should take, an unusually great degree of bipartisanship, yet the legislation in the form in which the Government has finally presented it is a total disappointment. In the debate and inquiry preceding the introduction of this Bill there was also widespread recognition of the fundamental importance of access to information to the proper workings of our democratic system. I quote from the Senate Standing Committee's report paragraph 3.7 which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The essence of democratic government lies in the ability of people to make choices: about who shall govern; or about which policies they support or reject. Such choices cannot be properly made unless adequate information is available. </PARA>
<PARA>It ought to have been a very heartening development that the essence of our democratic system was so clearly re-affirmed in relation to freedom of information legislation. After all, we ought not to take our democratic freedoms and our democratic system for granted. As other contributors to this debate have already pointed out, democracy is a relative concept and in Australia we enjoy a relatively high degree of democracy. In some places such as Russia, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Chile it has been totally destroyed. In El Salvador it is not even one of the issues at stake in the current violent struggle. In Poland democracy is trying, against hostile and enormous odds, to emerge. Here in Australia we do enjoy a relatively high degree of democracy, but there are dangers to our democratic system. Those dangers are not the threat of potential military invasion, civil war or the anarchy caused by widespread poverty and despair; the dangers are more like complacency and ignorance. We have a complacent electorate, a complacent bureaucracy, a complacent corporate sector and, it must be admitted, on many occasions a complacent parliament. We suffer from the widespread ignorance of the general public and indeed of all those elements of our system which I have just enumerated. Ignorance and complacency are the results of the difficulties of access to information about the workings of government. It was these dangers to our democratic system, the dangers of complacency and ignorance, that the Freedom of Information Bill was expected to counter. </PARA>
<PARA> When the 1978 legislation was examined by the Senate committee many inadequacies and weaknesses were exposed not only by the able contributions of my own colleagues such as Senator Evans and Senator Tate but also by the contribution of Government senators such as Senator Missen, the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. We expected that the legislation when reintroduced in its new form would be strengthened. As my colleague Senator Evans established in his opening speech in this debate, the legislation is actually a great deal worse in many significant ways than its predecessor. Those inadequacies have already been enumerated in the course of this debate. I will not go over that ground again. I want to say that there is no excuse for the inadequacies in the legislation. Although the new Bill has incorporated 21 recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee another 51 recommendations have been left out. Worse than this, there are at least 10 major new restrictions and prohibitions which the Government has produced. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the Opposition is speaking in the interests of the entire Australian public when it says that it cannot accept the Bill in its present form. To do so would break faith with all those who have contributed to its preparation and would be to forgo a most significant opportunity to strengthen our democratic system. Hence the Opposition has moved a wide-ranging second reading amendment and, as has been foreshadowed by Senator Evans, has prepared some 51 amendments which we hope to have accepted during the Committee stage of this Bill. The three basic justifications for freedom of information legislation were spelt out in the report of the Senate Standing Committee. I would like to repeat them here. The first is the right of the individual-that is, the right to know what information is held in government records concerning that individual. The second is the accountability of the Government to the electorate. The third is public participation in the process of policy-making and the Government itself. In not one of these three criteria is the Bill before us satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an accepted truism in our society that knowledge is power. Governments have a lot of power because they have a lot of information. If citizens could have access to that knowledge they would be able to share in the power. As I have said before, although Australia relatively speaking is an advanced democracy in the area of citizens' access to information Australia is peculiarly backward. Already the United States of America, Canada and Scandanavian countries have freedom of information legislation. I think every honourable senator and probably every person listening to the debate is aware of what advances in domocracy and freedom have been possible in the United States of America because of the action people have been able to take under freedom of information legislation. In other countries such as the United Kingdom and New Zealand there are moves to establish freedom of information legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Alone among Western nations Australia had no fixed rules governing the release of official records for the purpose of historical study. Even now the 30-year rule prohibits altogether the release of material within that time span. I will not at this stage advert to the Archives Bill which the Senate will debate following the conclusion of the discussion on the Freedom of Information Bill. I simply wish to point out that the Government in that area is still obsessed with secrecy; the Government is placing an unjustifiable number of exclusions and restrictions, even after 30 years, on the material that will be available to the public. Current information is treated in an even more restricted way and those restrictions will not be eased in a significant way by the Bill in its present unamended form. Examples of Government documents withheld from the public over the last few years include the Bland report on the Public Service and large sections of reports such as the Hope Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security, the Holmes report on Medibank, recommendations of the aviation industry review committee and the Government's proposal to revise agreements for transferring some Tasmanian and South Australian railways to the Commonwealth. Very recent examples include the failure of the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) to release information concerning toxic shock syndrome and the use of tampons and most recently the failure of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to release information about the discovery of legionaires disease in the air conditioning service in Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe every senator could add his or her own experiences to that list. I can give some examples of my own. For example, in recent weeks in my capacity as shadow Minister for that part of Home Affairs covering the Australian Government's involvement in the film industry I have continually sought information about the Government's announced decision to allow massive tax incentives for investors in Australian film. Seeing that that commitment was made during the last election campaign in October and since it has been followed by an absolute assurance from the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the previous Minister for Home Affairs that the legislation would be introduced and that it would apply-it has been costed at this stage at something up to $20m-I thought I would have been able to get some information from the bureaucracy as to how the system would work. I have not been able so far to get that information so I have not been able to answer adequately either the questions of my colleagues concerning the operation of this matter or the questions coming from all sections of the industry. It seems to me at this stage that I am complaining not only on my behalf but also on behalf of many people in the film industry who are not able to decide whether or how to take advantage of the Government's announced policy because the information is unavailable. </PARA>
<PARA> In other responsibilities within my shadow portfolios I experience similar on-going frustrations. Today the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) asserted that the report evaluating reports on Aboriginal health will not be made public. One would think that such information would be crucial for all those people developing and delivering Aboriginal health services or attempting, as I and my colleagues are doing, to support these services. Yet, the Minister blandly assured us that it was never his intention to make this information public. Presumably, at some date chosen at the Government's convenience a response to these reports will be available but not the information on which the Government's response is based. How are we, from this side of the chamber, to assess the value or relevance of the Government's response? As shadow Minister for women's affairs I have received repeated representations from women whose only source of income is the supporting mothers' benefit. From time to time, as every honourable senator in this place must know because I have often raised the matter, women living on the benefit have their entitlement withdrawn without explanation. They are then subjected to weeks or even months of investigation into their personal lives. The benefit may or may not be re-established. Such women are denied access to the reports on which decisions determining their livelihood are based. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the denials of information I have listed-it is only a random selection from an endless list-none can be justified in terms of the security of the nation, the rights of citizens or the stability of our society. None will be adequately redressed by the legislation in its present form. As well as the rights of individuals and the rights of members of the public to information that affects them there is another kind of right not dealt with in the Bill. This concerns the right of interested citizens such as business managers to get from the Public Service information beneficial to them. For example, there seems to be no reason why businesses should not have ready access to the vast amount of information on trade and commerce currently held within the bureaucracy. However, in the debate about access to government information it is important to stress-I must stress it at this stage-that we are arguing for the right of the public to know and not for the right of the Government to inflict information it has selected on citizens and on the Parliament. Let me be quite clear: I am not complaining that in quantitative terms there is a shortage of information coming from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent days in this place there has been serious criticism by the Opposition of the Government Information Unit. This outfit, honourable senators will know, has been set up by the Government to propagate to the media and to the public information or views which the Government wants people to have. This exercise has cost to date $276,000 and by the end of the financial year this figure will have risen to the order of $500,000. This is taxpayers' money which is being spent on information that nobody has asked for and, quite possibly, nobody wants. It is something of an irony that while we are being denied the right of access to information by the Fraser Government we are having such expensive unwanted items of government propaganda inflicted on us. </PARA>
<PARA> If we add to the expenditure on the Government Information Unit the cost of preparing, printing and distributing the avalanche of government papers that descends on us every week in this place-ministerial speeches, ministerial Press releases, ministerial statements and so on-we can see that our complaint is not that we are suffering from a lack of information but that we have no right to decide what will be available to us. It is the right of access that this legislation ought to provide and does not provide. It is that right of access that the Federal Opposition and other senators will seek to put into the Bill at the Committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Legislation guaranteeing the right of access is particularly important to the Australian Labor Party because of our egalitarian philosophy. We are strenuously opposed to the current prevailing, elitist practices concerning access to information. Because of the unequal nature of our society citizens at this stage are, in fact, unequal in their access to information which is of great importance to them. For example, much legislation consists of broad rules and citizens are not equally well placed to take advantage of broad rules. This is clearly seen, for example, in income tax legislation which permits the wealthy to engage in tax evasion procedures which are simply not relevant to the poor. Government senators might argue that the tax law applies equally to all citizens. Of course, we would point out, rightly, unarguably, that all citizens do not have access to tax accountants, tax lawyers and, most significantly, to the level of income that makes these schemes so extravagantly advantageous to the elite. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not suggesting that the inequities of the taxation system will be addressed by freedom of information legislation but it is very important to remind ourselves that even in the operation of legislation there is not equal access in this country. I raise that point at this stage in the debate to persuade Government senators that it is of the greatest necessity in the drafting of effective freedom of information legislation that the procedures for access are carefully formulated so as to place, for example, the unemployed person, the Aborigine, the migrant with little English or the supporting mother living on a pension, at the smallest possible disadvantage compared with other citizens. The legislation before us fails to meet this necessity but the Federal Opposition is committed to the view that freedom of information legislation should be drafted and should so operate as to help to create a more just and equal society. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I must acknowledge that it is not possible to have freedom of information legislation that eliminates all secrecy entirely. That is not our view. We are not being idealistic and we are not being unrealistic on this point. We do not believe that even if all our amendments were accepted we would eliminate secrecy within the bureaucracy and we would establish absolute equality of access to information for all citizens. We are not aiming for an impossible objective. What we are aiming for is modest and reasonable. It is something which has had bipartisan support throughout this chamber since the earlier legislation was first introduced into this place. It is clearly supported throughout those sections of the community which have concerned themselves with this matter. We are asking for a modest, democratic measure, one that already exists in other countries with which we like to compare ourselves, one for which there is a very adequate model in the United States of America and one by which I believe this Parliament would distinguish itself if it would only support it. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, even if all Opposition amendments are accepted, there will remain areas of secrecy within the Government and the bureaucracy. Some of these areas, such as those concerning defence, security and individual privacy, will properly remain secret. We have acknowledged this all along. Other areas, of course, will remain secret because of the nature of the bureaucracy. It is simply not possible to devise access machinery which will open up the bureaucracy entirely to the citizens or the Parliament. What we want, and what we believe is perfectly possible and most desirable, is freedom of information legislation which will reduce the amount of information currently kept secret and which, in doing so, will ensure a more democratic and egalitarian operation of our system of government. That modest but important objective will be achieved if the Senate supports our second reading amendment and if, in the Committee stage, this chamber accepts the amendments which will be moved in a spirit of bipartisanship and constructive co-operation. That is the course of action I urge on the Senate this evening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this Freedom of Information Bill. It is one of the most significant Bills ever to come before the Australian Parliament because it gives effect to one of the most important rights of a democratic society-the right to know. It also affects fundamentally the relationship between the Executive-that is the Ministry and the Public Service-and the Parliament. The right to information and the need for its legislative expression were well summarised by the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) when, in 1976, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Australian electorate is to be able to make valid judgments on government policy it should have the greatest access to information possible. How can any community progress without continuing an informed and independent debate? How can there be debate without information?</PARA>
<PARA>Freedom of information, the right of the electorate to have access to information of its servants, is not a party matter. The Prime Minister has publicly committed the Liberal Party of Australia and the present Government to bringing in freedom of information laws. The Australian Labor Party by its platform of 1979 is also committed to:</PARA>
<PARA>the enactment of effective Freedom of Information legislation granting the public full entitlement to the disclosure of government and administrative decision-making, subject only to the requirements of essential security and individual privacy. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats are committed to a Bill of Rights that 'will guarantee freedom of information' in a list of other freedoms. So there is no dispute about the need for freedom of information legislation, nor would there, I think, be any dispute about the objects of the present Bill as expressed in clause 3, though perhaps a little pompously. Clause 3 reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The object of this Act is to extend the right of the Australian community to access to official information in the possession of the Government of the Commonwealth by-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) making available to the public information about the operations of departments and public authorities and, in particular, ensuring that rules and practices affecting members of the public in their dealings with departments and public authorities are readily available to persons affected by those rules and practices; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) creating a general right of access to official information in documentary form in the possession of Ministers, departments and public authorities, limited only by what is necessary . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (i) for the protection of essential public interests, and the private and business affairs of persons in respect of whom information is collected and held by departments and public authorities; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) for the proper conduct of public business by Ministers, departments and public authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 3 goes on to state that it is the intention of the Parliament that any discretions conferred by the Freedom of Information Act be interpreted, as far as possible, so as to facilitate and promote the disclosure of information. By the way, this provision was inserted on the recommendation of the all-party Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, though we did not recommend the use of quite such a long sentence. So far so good. What, then, is the trouble with the present Bill? The trouble is that this Bill as presented to us is a Public Service document. As far as I have been able to ascertain, every significant decision in it comes out of a series of Public Service interdepartmental committees. Although these decisions were of course endorsed by Cabinet, there was no political input at all in the sense of forcing the Public Service to go further than it wanted to-and it did not want to go very far. </PARA>
<PARA> In discussions before our Senate Committee, it became obvious that most senior public servants regard freedom of information as a peculiar political foible and that their duty is to limit the availability of information as far as they can get away with it. As an argument, they used a very self-serving concept of the Westminster system in relation to which some of them were astonishingly ill-informed and out of date. It is up to parliament-it is up to us and not the Public Service-to see that the Freedom of Information Act goes far enough. One of the main beneficiaries of a decent Freedom of Information Act will be members of parliament, and we can then get away from the situation whereby the Press Gallery, through selective departmental leaks, is better informed about what goes on in government than we are. That is why most of the members of the Press Gallery are not very keen on freedom of information. They prefer the present system of cosy leaks. Of course, if we are happy with that situation, we will not be too upset about the present Bill. But I am not happy with that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee made many recommendations to improve the Freedom of Information Bill 1978. Most of the important ones have been ignored in this present Bill. One that has been accepted in the present Bill overcame a glaring weakness which the original Bill had inherited from the American freedom of information Act on which it had been largely modelled. In America a high proportion of freedom of information requests are designed to gain confidential information about commercial rivals. We recommended-the Government, I am glad to say, has accepted our recommendations -a procedure to give protection to commercial information given in confidence to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There are five, or perhaps 5 1/2, areas in which I should like to see this freedom of information legislation strengthened so that it is internally compatible with its own clause 3, which I quoted earlier, and also matches the admirable statement made by the Prime Minister in 1976. The first of these concerns is the use of the so-called conclusive certificate by which a Minister or certain public servants can certify that a document is exempt from disclosure because its release would adversely affect national security or Commonwealth-State relations, or because it is a Cabinet document or an Executive Council document, or that it would not be in the public interest to release an internal working document. If such a certificate is given, that is the end of the matter; there is no appeal to anyone. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make my position quite clear. I have no desire to see the release of documents which would harm national security. I do not think documents which are truly and exclusively Cabinet or Executive Council documents should be released. That would, in my view, seriously damage the working of our present system of government, which has been done enough harm already by self-serving Cabinet leaks. I am not for a moment advocating the release of internal working documents when their release would harm the public interest. Of course, no one in his right mind would do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The only question is: Who decides whether the documents should be released? The Bill says that the relevant Minister, or in certain cases the public servant, should decide. The Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee says that the decision should be reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which is the review body in other areas of dispute on freedom of information. I am not advocating, nor did the Committee advocate, an unrestricted right of review in all cases. In the case of Cabinet, Executive Council or national security documents, it is recommended that a single judge, a Federal Court judge who is a member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, should have a strictly limited review role. He should merely check that the documents are as described, with no irrelevant attachments. If they are properly classified as national security documents, or if they are Cabinet documents, that is the end of the matter. No question of countervailing public interest arises. In the other cases-that is, documents affecting Federal-State relations and internal working documents-the review should concern whether the balance of public interest dictates disclosure. Federal Court judges are scarcely wild-eyed radicals. They can be trusted to give full weight to the Government's arguments against disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA> So far I have heard no sensible defence of the Government's position in this matter. The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has said that Ministers are better qualified than judges to make such decisions. With respect-those words are an almost infallible sign that something most disrespectful is about to be said-that is utter rubbish. A Minister may well be closely involved and have a strong political interest in concealment. Party political interests are not necessarily identical with the public interest. Let us remember that President Nixon was prepared to certify that all the illegal Watergate actions were concerned with national security. To bring the matter closer to home, an Attorney-General-not the present one, admittedly-certified that the Khemlani loan was for temporary purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot understand the Government's attitude in this matter. We have set up elaborate procedures to review ministerial decisions in other areas; for instance, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Security Appeals Tribunal. Why has it not done so in this field? Information release is surely the most important area where justice must be seen to be done. Surely it would be in a Minister's interest, if he is challenged when his decision is right, to have it supported by an independent judicial review. If he is wrong-there is a hell of a lot of grossly over-classified material in the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs-it would be a good thing to have the material released, and the possibility of an appeal would make departments much more careful about what they slap security classifications on. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Government's refusal to allow appeals against conclusive ministerial certificates, as the Canadians do in their recent freedom of information Bill, is indefensible-or at least I have heard no sensible defence of it yet. I shall be moving an amendment in the Committee stage to put this part of the Bill in better shape. </PARA>
<PARA> My second concern is the width of the exemptions by which whole classes of documents are excluded from release. We all accept that some types of documents-for instance, documents containing information about proposed changes in the exchange rate-would have to be exempt. But the exemptions in the Bill as it stands are far too wide. The Bill leans well over the far side of reasonable caution and shows obvious evidence of its Public Service origin. The Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee made some sensible suggestions for the responsible narrowing of these exemptions so that what should be released will be released. In Committee I will support amendments to give effect to these suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA> My third concern is the Government's rejection of the role of the Ombudsman as proposed by the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee. As the Bill stands, if a person is refused access to a document he may appeal for an internal review. This is carried out by a separate group of public servants in the department that refused access in the first place. If the refusal of access is confirmed, he may then appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The trouble is that for the average citizen the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is an intimidating and possibly expensive place. It is supposed to be an informal, inquisitorial body. But there have been suggestions that sometimes it is more formal than the High Court of Australia. In any case, as a matter of principle, should not conciliation precede arbitration? The Ombudsman, with his prestige and his power to examine documents, is admirably placed to sort out these matters and to see that the applicant is not given the well known bureaucratic run around. In appropriate cases, if conciliation fails, the Ombudsman should exercise the general counsel role that was originally intended for him, and should represent the mistreated applicant before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I shall support amendments in Committee that will give an effective role to the Ombudsman in freedom of information matters, as is done, by the way, in equivalent Canadian legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> My fourth concern is the handling of the secrecy provisions which are in existing legislation. There are such secrecy provisions in the Commonwealth Crimes Act and in 109 other Acts of Parliament and 85 rules and ordinances. The Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee recommended that the existing secrecy provisions which should be continued should be listed in a Schedule to the Bill and amendments to the Schedule should be made only after affirmative resolutions of both Houses. The Government has rejected this and has maintained the present mishmash of security provisions in other legislation, much of which is quite incompatible with the principles of this Freedom of Information Bill. I shall support amendments to correct this chaotic situation. </PARA>
<PARA> My fifth concern is the way in which new agencies may be exempted from the operation of the Freedom of Information Act by prescribing them in regulations. The trouble is that they would then not come before Parliament but come only before the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, whose criteria are limited to matters such as whether the regulations trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties or unduly delegate parliamentary authority. It would be difficult for the Regulations and Ordinances Committee to refer the exemption of an agency from freedom of information back to the Senate on the grounds that the power should not have been delegated when the Parliament had passed an Act specifically directing it to be done by regulation. The Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee recommended, in order to bring these important matters of the exemption of new agencies from the freedom of information legislation automatically before Parliament, that such exemptions should be done by affirmative resolutions of both Houses of Parliament. The Government has stuck to doing it by regulation. I am sure that the Government is wrong in this and I will support in Committee an amendment to bring in the recommendation of the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The final issue is the question of documents that exist at the time the Freedom of Information Bill comes into force. By the present Bill, with relatively trivial exceptions, they will not be eligible for release. The Attorney-General has said that he will look again at the situation after three years' experience of the Act. I think everyone agrees that estimates of the Public Service work load which would be imposed by the Freedom of Information Act are pure guesswork, and most of us sympathise with the Government's desire, staff ceilings being what they are, not to promise more than it can perform. We, the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee, proposed a gradual phasing in of these prior documents, with the timing laid down in the Act. I can sympathise with the Government's dilemma in this and if I could get an unequivocal assurance from the Attorney-General that he would genuinely tackle prior documents within a reasonable time, I would not press for inclusion of the timetable in the Act. Three years is far too long though. The pattern of the effort imposed on the Public Service by freedom of information will be clear within a few months of the implementation of the Freedom of Information Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I mention two security matters. The Committee recommended that a system for automatic declassification of national security documents should be instituted on an administrative basis. We had in mind the American model, which seems to work very well. Under the American system, most classified documents are automatically declassified after a maximum period of six years unless a specific decision is made to continue with a security classification. In November 1979 we recommended the adoption of a similar system in Australia. On 11 September 1980 the Government replied that it would be the subject of further study. Seven months later nothing has happened. We also recommended that Cabinet documents should be distinctively marked but should not carry a national security classification unless such classification were justified by their contents. Here, too, nothing has been done. Cabinet documents, even over dealings on matters such as the slaughter of pigs, are still classified 'Confidential', and I remind the Senate that the Government's own test for assigning the classification 'Confidential' is whether the disclosure of the document could reasonably be expected to cause damage to the national security. Slaughter may cause damage to the pigs but scarcely to the national security. Some departments which have nothing to do with national security also seem to be equipped with 'Confidential' stamps which they use freely on quite inappropriate documents. If freedom of information is to work properly, the Public Service will have to tighten up its thoroughly sloppy administration in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are seeking is information that will make our Parliament and our democratic system work better. Public servants are cautious and have a vested interest in secrecy. They really think, or most of them seem to think, that what the public should be told is what they, the bureaucracy, think they ought to be told. It is up the the Parliament to press for the best balance between the right of the public to know and the requirements of efficient administration. We are the ones who must do it, not least because members of parliament will be among the principal beneficiaries of effective freedom of information. It is worth remembering that the American Freedom of Information Act, on which ours is largely modelled, was not an act of grace by the Executive to make information more freely available but was imposed by the Congress over a Presidential veto. Everyone in our Parliament-Government, Opposition, Ministers, back benchers-must work together to create effective freedom of information legislation. I appeal to Ministers to recognise that, so far, all their advice has come from the Public Service, which could hardly be said to be disinterested. Now look at it from the other side-after all, you are parliamentarians as well as Ministers-and join with us in creating a Freedom of Information Bill of which we can be justly proud and which will meet the desire of the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Australian electorate should have the greatest access to information possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to speak briefly in support of the amendment to the Freedom of Information Bill. I think many honourable senators who have spoken have made the points necessary in their criticism of the Bill as it stands. My concern is for the quality of democracy in this country. I think secrecy belittles the intelligence, the rights and the human dignity of the people of a nation. It produces apathy in the community and citizens are deprived of information. If they are deprived of information, they lose interest in government. They become apathetic and they necessarily then lose their rights of participation. A better informed public can examine the problems of funding for various community services with a better understanding and critical judgment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If people are to participate democratically in the affairs of their nation they have a right to the information which is presently withheld from them in many cases to enable them to make responsible judgments and wise decisions. Why should public servants and government have more knowledge than the people's representatives in the Parliament and the people themselves? Why should matters which affect the lives of the men, women and children in our community be kept secret? Why should people not participate and have their intelligence and their concerns broadened so that they can feel a part of the nation and the community?</PARA>
<PARA> Throughout history the withholding of knowledge has been an indication of dictatorial regimes because governments and rulers have considered that an informed public could be dangerous to their power and unsettling for the population. It is indeed a form of censorship to deny people the opportunity to criticise and to judge the actions of government. Fire in the past has been used as an agent to combat contrary opinions; men and books have been burned when their teachings have been distasteful to the prevailing authority. One of the Seven Wonders of the World-the Libraries of Alexandria-was destroyed by fire. Books were burnt during the Chin dynasty in China. There has been the recent example of the burning of books in nazi Germany. But today we have more subtle and more powerful means of supressing information-media controlled by a few and government secrecy. </PARA>
<PARA> When we talk about the public interest, what does it really mean and how do we define it? Is it in the people's interests for them to be ignorant of the things that are done in their name? Citizens should know what their government is doing and they should be free to criticise it and to add creative suggestions and contributions. Democracy can exist only as long as its citizens have the right to knowledge and the right to contribute their ideas and to participate in the shaping of the decisions that are made. Governments which, through secrecy, deprive people of that right already have the odour of decay, and it is a threat to our parliamentary system if that secrecy continues. I think the public cynicism at present shows a recognition of the fact that there are dangerous currents in this area. We must not belittle the input or the intelligence of the people of our country. There are at work in the world today forces which are opposing democracy-the forces of materialism, of economic power and of people who put pure gain as the measure of all things we do. We must be careful and we must encourage the community to be alert to those forces which, to their benefit, would instil apathy in the community. If we are to have in our society that equality which gives recognition to the human spirit and to those aims of mutual aid and human caring, we could perhaps remember the words of Milton when he said that the first freedom was the liberty to know and to argue freely according to conscience and human reason. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> We should be wary therefore what persecution we raise against the living labours of publick men, how we spill that season'd life of man preserv'd and stor'd up in Books; since we see a kind of homicide may be thus committed, sometimes a martyrdome; and if it extend to the whole impression, a kind of massacre, whereof the execution ends not in the slaying of an elementall life, but strikes at that ethereall and fift(h) essence, the breath of reason itselfe, slaies an immortality rather than a life. </PARA>
<PARA>We must remember too the words of John Stuart Mill, who said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is always hope when people are forced to listen to both sides. It is when they attend only one that errors harden into prejudices and truth itself ceases to have the effect of truth, by being exaggerated into falsehood. </PARA>
<PARA>I want simply to say to all honourable senators in this place that they should consider carefully how their decisions on this Bill will affect the dignity of our people and the development of those human capacities of reason, critical judgment and creative participation which can enhance the quality of democracy in our nation, which can give inspiration to our young people and which can give our country the opportunity to demonstrate what a democracy is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is certainly not possible to cover the whole of the field of freedom of information in the time available to honourable senators this evening. There is certainly not the opportunity during the second reading stage to go into the complexities of this subject, which are best left to the Committee stage of the Bill. This Bill touches on certain fundamentals. It touches on the fundamental rights of at least four groups in our society as we know it. It touches, first, upon the rights of the public. It touches, secondly, upon the rights of politicians and members of parliament. It touches, thirdly, upon the rights of the Parliament as an institution itself; and it touches, fourthly, upon the rights of the Public Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the rights of the public, it amazes me that anybody should seek to erect a system which finds some basis in legislation and which says: 'Here we are, servants of the public, responsible to the public, telling the public that we and not they will be the arbiters of what they ought to know'. I have yet to hear a persuasive argument from any member of the Ministry or of the Government which touches upon the question of from where we in the Parliament or the Ministry derive the right to deny the public access to information which is legitimately the property of the public. It cannot, I suppose, have passed unnoticed that from a speakers list consisting of the names of 10 senators, including three Government senators, there is not one member of this Senate prepared to defend this Bill as it currently stands. One would presume that if this Bill were in fact the nonpareil that it proposes to be, there would have been at least some eloquent champion on the Government side, or indeed some eloquent intervention from the Ministry, to defend it. But in 10 speeches that will be delivered on this Bill there will not be one speech that does not say that this Bill is not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill has been a long time in coming. Its genesis goes back at least to 1972, to an election promise made by then Prime Minister Whitlam. In 1973 the then Attorney-General, Senator Murphy, took certain initiatives to start the debate on freedom of information. In 1974 there was an interdepartmental committee. In 1975 there was an election in which Prime Minister Fraser made clear his commitment to freedom of information legislation. In 1976 there was another interdepartmental committee. In 1978 there was a Bill. In 1979 there was a Senate committee report. In 1980 there was a Government response. In 1981 there is a new Bill, and presumably in 1982 somebody will start to do something about it-presumably. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two issues, and two issues only, to which I will confine my remarks this evening. The first is the question of the public's right to know and the definition of the term 'public interest'. The second is the meaning-indeed, the twisted meaning-that some people have given to the phrase 'the Westminster system'. The first of those, as I said, is the right of the public to know. This is largely a debate on the public versus the Public Service. It is quite clear that the Public Service-certainly at senior level; I certainly do not try to put it on the Public Service as a whole because those persons at a lower level of the Public Service who came before the Senate Committee gave every evidence of seeking to co-operate and of being willing to co-operate- suddenly announced that the public servants had derived somehow, mystically, by a process of constitutional osmosis, a right to deny the public access to information. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a record which is clear-Senator Ryan has mentioned it, others have mentioned it-of people attempting to get information in the teeth of a record of hostility, frustration and secrecy imposed by the bureaucracy. The fundamental premise which I put to the Senate is simply this: If we believe in a free and open democratic system of government, how do we believe that can be achieved if the public is not in possession of the facts and the evidence which will allow it to judge whether a government is a good government or a bad government, a corrupt government or an honest government, an efficient government or an inefficient government, a government which honours its commitments or which breaks its commitments or a government which trusts the people or a government which distrusts the people? This was drawn to attention as far back as 1822 when the American President, James Madison, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps, both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance; and a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives. </PARA>
<PARA>In a more latter day expression of this philosophy, I quote as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> But just as fundamental are two further requirements. First, people and Parliament must have the knowledge required to pass judgment on the government. Secondly, the Ministers and government must themselves be in control of public policy so that those who the Parliament and people can call to account are indeed those responsible. To the extent that responsibility is diffused beyond that elected government-other than by legislative intent-to that extent is effective, popular control diminished. These two conditions for effective responsibility in government are complementary, but there are also areas where they compete. </PARA>
<PARA> The clearest area of competition is the appropriate extent of confidentiality in government. Too much secrecy inhibits people's capacity to judge the government's performance. </PARA>
<PARA>Those very wise and very learned words are to be found in an article published in the Australian Journal of Public Administration of March 1978, the Garran Oration, entitled 'Responsibility in Government', the author and speaker J. M. Fraser, Prime Minister. Those are the touch stones of what it is that we are supposed to be about. An editorial in one of the Sydney afternoon newspapers states:</PARA>
<PARA> Freedom of information is a vital core of any democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Without it bureaucracy can run unbridled-complacent, corrupt and contemptuous of the rights of the individual. </PARA>
<PARA>I said that I think it is important to explore the concept 'public interest'. Therefore, let me give a couple of definitions which I think are useful in that sense. Stephen Bailey states that public interest is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the central concept of a civilised polity. Its genius lies not in its clarity but in its perverse and persistent moral intrusion upon the internal and external discourse of rulers and ruled alike. </PARA>
<PARA>It is that. It is a moral imperative. The right of people to know has a moral quality about it. It is not a matter of precise legal definition. Pendleton Herring writes:</PARA>
<PARA> The public interest is a concept that leads open the way to change, as general acceptance for new policies is won and officials remain accountable for their decisions. Since there are many ways for seeking public acceptance and for safeguarding administrative responsibility within a democratic polity, it is doubtful that anything would be gained by insisting upon a precise definition of the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>The courts have turned their attention to this matter. Let me reflect on what the courts in the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia have said about the term 'public interest'. Viscount Simon, in the case Duncan v. Cammel Laird and Co. Ltd made a long statement on this. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> In this connection, I do not think it out of place to indicate the sort of grounds which would not afford to the Minister adequate justification for objecting to production. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, production of documents. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not a sufficient ground that the documents are 'state documents' or 'official' or are marked 'confidential'. It would not be a good ground that, if they were produced, the consequences might involve the department or the government in Parliamentary discussion or in public criticism, or might necessitate the attendance as witnesses or otherwise of officials who have pressing duties elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> Neither would it be a good ground that production might tend to expose a want of efficiency in the administration or tend to lay the department open to claims for compensation. In a word, it is not enough that the minister or the department does not want to have the documents produced. </PARA>
<PARA> The minister, in deciding whether it is his duty to object, should bear these considerations in mind, for he ought not to take the responsibility of withholding production except in cases where the public interest would otherwise be damnified, e.g., where disclosure would be injurious to national defence, or to good diplomatic relations, or where the practice of keeping a class of documents secret is necessary for the proper functioning of the public service. </PARA>
<PARA>In the famous Crossman diary cases, Lord Chief Justice Widgery, in ruling that the Government must allow the publication of the Crossman diary-that was the argument which the courts could not decide-said:</PARA>
<PARA> On the contrary, it must be for the court in every case to be satisfied that the public interest is involved, and that, after balancing all the factors which tell for or against publication, to decide whether suppression is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>The United States faced up to this problem in the famous Supreme Court case of the United States v. Nixon, the famous Watergate tapes case. The Supreme Court said:</PARA>
<PARA> But this presumptive privilege--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the executive privilege of the President-</PARA>
<PARA>must be considered in light of our historical commitment to the rule of law. This is nowhere more profoundly manifest than in our view that 'the twofold aim [of criminal justice] is that guilt shall not escape nor innocence suffer'. </PARA>
<PARA> Only recently the Court restated the ancient proposition of law, albiet in the context of a grand jury inquiry rather than a trial, '' 'that the public has a right to every man's evidence' except for those persons protected by a constitutional, common law, or statutory privilege'' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In Australia the High Court has twice recently ruled on this matter. In the case of Sankey v. Whitlam the present Chief Justice, Mr Justice Gibbs, said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is in all cases the duty of the court, and not the privilege of the executive government, to decide whether a document will be produced or may be withheld. The court must decide which aspect of the public interest predominates, or in other words whether the public interest which requires that the document should not be produced outweighs the public interest that a court of justice in performing its function should not be denied access to relevant evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>His Honour summed up his views in these words:</PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons I consider that although there is a class of documents whose members are entitled to protection from disclosure irrespective of their contents the protection is not absolute, and it does not endure forever. The fundamental and governing principle is that documents in the class may be withheld from production only when this is necessary in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, a High Court judge, Mr Justice Mason, in ruling in the Commonwealth v. John Fairfax and Sons Ltd, the defence papers case, came back to the same thing. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The equitable principle has been fashioned to protect the personal, private and proprietary interests of the citizen, not to protect the very different interests of the executive Government. It acts, or is supposed to act, not according to standards of private interest, but in the public interest. This is not to say that Equity will not protect information in the hands of the Government, but it is to say that when Equity protects Government information it will look at the matter through different spectacles. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> The court will not prevent the publication of information which merely throws light on the past workings of government, even if it be not public property, so long as it does not prejudice the community in other respects. Then disclosure will itself serve the public interest in keeping the community informed and in promoting discussion of public affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, in terms of judicial authority in Australia, the Administative Appeals Tribunal in the case of Palmer v. the Minister for the Capital Territory dealt with the right of a person who has been disadvantaged by a bureaucratic or ministerial decision to know what evidence it was that was before the public servant or the Minister that caused him to come to the conclusion that he came to. The Tribunal said:</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore the reasons which have actuated the mind of the expert in making his recommendation or giving his opinion, if material to the decision of the decision maker, should be included . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is to say, included in the material given to the appellant. The Tribunal states:</PARA>
<PARA> If it was permissible for the decision maker merely to indicate that he had relied upon the advice of a named expert, the intention of the section could be by-passed. Additionally, the benefits to the citizen in the obtaining of reasons which in our view are fundamental to the whole scheme of administrative review embodied in the Act would be set at nought. </PARA>
<PARA>The Tribunal quoted Lord Denning and other authorities on that matter. The Tribunal said that it was the right of people to know the information which was used by a public servant or a Minister in coming to a decision. Let me give the Senate a practical example of the sort of withholding of information. I happen to agree very strongly with the Government decision on the Fraser Island dispute. I happen to agree that the decision that was made to prohibit the mineral sands exports was a good one but the firm, Murphyores, was substantially disadvantaged and sought from this Government evidence as to what it was that had led the Government to make up its own mind. The then Treasurer, Mr Lynch as he then was, wrote to Mr Murphy of Murphyores indicating that evidence was before the Government other than Press statements and speculation and reports. Mr Lynch, in his letter of 25 March 1977, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, that decision--</PARA>
<PARA>That is the decision to withhold the export licence-</PARA>
<PARA>was based on extensive advice and documentation and not, as you suggest, simply on the Commissioners' report. </PARA>
<PARA>Murphyores wrote to the Government and said: 'You say your decision was based on ''extensive advice and documentation and not just on the public report''. Can we have a look at that because we think it may have been in error?' The then Minister for Finance, Mr Robinson, wrote to Murphyores and said: 'No, you cannot have the information'. In a letter on 9 January 1981 this was repeated by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, who wrote to Murphyores and said:</PARA>
<PARA> However, as far as advice and reports provided by Ministers and government departments are concerned, I can only reiterate my predecessor's response when you previously sought access to the information, that such advice and reports, and the relevant background work, have long been held by successive governments to be confidential to government. </PARA>
<PARA> In the circumstances I regret I am also unable to agree to your request for access to the information you seek. </PARA>
<PARA>Although that company was substantially prejudiced in its economic operations it was being told by the Government that the decision was based not just on public reports but on reports and advice made available to the Government. The company wrote to the Government and said: 'Can we have a look at the evidence upon which you have based your decision?' The Government wrote back to the company and said: 'No. The basis upon which your economic situation will be severely prejudiced is not a matter that we can allow you to have a look at so that you can make any comment or see whether the facts that were put to us were in fact facts or fantasy'. </PARA>
<PARA> From where does any government derive its right to deny its sovereign masters, the people, information necessary for their own well-being or for them to make a decision about government? Surely the only answer that can be given is that such material can be withheld if it is genuinely in the public interest to do so. If that is correct, the question arises as to who should decide what the public interest is and who should balance the competing claims of the public interest. The answer surely cannot be that that decision is to be left in the hands of the people who are already resisting giving out that information. Surely the answer must be that there is an independent tribunal somewhere. In the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs we have talked about the role of the Ombudsman and the role of a presidential member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, that is, a judge. The Government surely cannot be saying to us that those people are not competent to balance competing public interests, that those people are not competent to determine what the public interest is in the release or otherwise of a document. But that in fact is what the Government is saying-that the judges are not competent to do this; that the Ombudsman is not competent to do this; but that some clerk three parts of the way down the Department of the Treasury is competent to do it. The Government is saying that he can go around with the knee jerk reaction and stamp 'Confidential' on any piece of paper that comes across his desk and he can say, if he happens to be the officer handling the appeal: 'Here am I, a clerk in the Third Division and I say this is an internal working document and I say you cannot have a look at it and I will be blowed if I am going to defer to some old judge or ombudsman to second-guess the opinion that I as a third grade clerk have decided to put on this matter'. If Mr President, you think that attitude is simply an overstatement let me quote to you from the transcript of evidence given by the Chairman of the Public Service Board to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. At page 886 of the transcript a question was put to him as to the views of Mr Justice Mason on public interest. Mr Cole, as he then was, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I have seen statements including Mr Justice Mason's and I wondered at the time how they would know. I think one really has to have lived in the system. </PARA>
<PARA>After all, Mr Justice Mason was only the Solicitor-General. Mr Justice Mason is only a judge of the High Court of Australia. 'What the hell would he know about it?' said Mr Cole. That is precisely the same sort of attitude that comes through all of the evidence given by senior public servants from departments other, I would say, than the Department of the Attorney-General. The evidence given by that Department, I think, was of a far more liberal and open nature. But the evidence from the Department of the Treasury, from the Public Service Board and from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet was characterised by the sort of obstructionism to which I have referred. Mr Stone was asked a question by me about freedom of information in Sweden. Mr Stone said:</PARA>
<PARA> We are aware of some information on that and the experience is not encouraging but we do not necessarily translate that experience into our own experience because the mores of the Australian people may prove to be different in this regard from those of their counterparts in the United States, but I do not know. </PARA>
<PARA>I then asked Mr Stone:</PARA>
<PARA> What do you mean when you say that the experience is not encouraging? Not encouraging to whom?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Stone said:</PARA>
<PARA> To the efficient working of the departments concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not that it was not encouraging to the public of Australia; not that it was not encouraging to the Parliament of Austraia; not that it was not encouraging to the public interest in Australia; but that it was not encouraging to the Department of the Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA> The Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee has analysed this whole question of public interest at length. I refer only to paragraph 5.25, in which we discussed public versus private interests; paragraph 5.26, in which we discussed the contemporary relevance that a public interest test brings on board; paragraph 15.24, in which we discussed the proof of public interest; paragraph 19.23, in which we discussed the criteria for public interest; paragraph 19.24, in which we looked for the skilled application of the test of public interest. In paragraph 19.24 we referred to the role of the courts and others. We said:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Public interest' is, as we indicated in Chapters 5 and 15, not a phrase which should be applied conclusively by a person who has administrative experience only, but one which should be susceptible to application in any individual case by an adjudicator, skilled at weighing and balancing competing interests, who had presented to him differing views as to what result the public interest requires in any given case. </PARA>
<PARA>In paragraph 19.29 the Committee said that these rules should not become fixed and rigid. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Hamer mentioned the way in which people do not have access to files about themselves to see whether the information on them is correct or needed correction. I have mentioned the Murphyores example. The latest report given to the Government by an independent inquiry came from the Holcroft inquiry. Recommendation 31 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Disclosure to the regulatory authority and to the public be required, preferably on a uniform basis, of data concerning technical and financial performance of the airlines sufficient to monitor costs, pricing and performance. </PARA>
<PARA>The latest report we have says that in the airline industry there ought to be disclosure of the sorts of data that we are seeking. As Senator Missen has said-I will not repeat the conclusion of that chapter of our report which deals with the Westminister model-we are seeking not to subvert, not to undermine, but indeed to strengthen the principles of Westminster government. The remarks of Lord Croham, a former head of the Civil Service in Great Britain, was reported in the Times of 17 August 1978. The article was headed:</PARA>
<PARA> Less Secrecy in Whitehall will lead to a strengthening of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>The Canadians have found, by allowing their freedom of information Bill to have widespread appeals to administrative review, to the courts and to ombudsmen, that there is nothing prejudicial to the Westminster system in Canada. The Globe and Mail, a Toronto newspaper, reported on 18 July 1980:</PARA>
<PARA> Secretary of State Francis Fox surprised and silenced his Opposition critics yesterday by introducing a freedom of information bill which is in many ways more progressive than its Tory predecessor. </PARA>
<PARA> The bill reverses the Liberal Party's long-standing opposition to judicial review by establishing a process which gives the courts the ultimate say over what information should be made public. </PARA>
<PARA>The Canadians are not frightened about the possibility of subversion of the Westminster system by freedom of information. In New Zealand, the Committee on Official Information under Sir Alan Danks reported on the whole issue only recently. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We propose that the Ombudsman should deal with individual complaints about the disclosure and non-disclosure of information, including those arising in respect of a wider range of Government agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>It also stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We have already made plain our view that decisions about disclosure of information taken by departments and agencies must be subject to test by an independent arbiter. The next element in the system we are proposing is therefore a mechanism for reviewing these decisions and for receiving and investigating complaints from the public. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal is also compatible with the principle of ministerial responsibility. Procedure would be informal rather than formal. As at present the Ombudsmen would not have powers of decision; they would investigate, and, if appropriate, recommend a different decision or practice. </PARA>
<PARA>That report indicates that the New Zealanders are not afraid that freedom of information is subversive to the Westminister system. As long ago as 1954 when the House of Commons was looking at the question of ministerial responsibility in the famous Crichel Down case, Mr Herbert Morrison, a former Minister in the Labour Administration, said:</PARA>
<PARA> There can be no question whatever that Ministers are responsible for everything that their officers do, but if civil servants make errors or commit failures the House has a right to be assured that the Minister has dealt with the errors or failures adequately and properly, or that he will do so. That is a duty that falls on Ministers as well, and it would be wrong for a Minister automatically to defend every act of his officers or servants merely because they belong to his Department. Therefore, the House has to be satisfied that he is dealing with the matter adequately. </PARA>
<PARA>How can a house of parliament be satisfied that a Minister is dealing adequately if it has no information upon which to base its judgments. We will come back to all of these matters and many others in the Committee stage of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the fundamental points to make at this stage are as follows: No government can demonstrate comprehensively or effectively that it has the right to withhold information from citizens unless it can prove that there is a real public interest in withholding that information. If there is a dispute between the right of the public to know and the right of the government to withhold, and the test of whether a document should be withheld is whether the withholding of that document is in the public interest, that is not a matter for governments alone to decide. The fundamental principle that we have operated under in parliamentary democracies is that judge and jury are separate, that it is not the right of the Government to receive the appeal, nor to decide whether the appeal should be granted and then to adjudicate on appeal against a request. If the court system in this country means anything and if the status of judges in this country means anything, surely they are trusted sufficiently to balance competing public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The final thing to be said is this: The Westminster system rests with the base of the pyramid at the top. One can almost look at it upside down. The people have the right to judge governments and parliamentarians, and the system of democratic government cannot work in a community which is ignorant of the facts. An attempt to maintain the sovereign public, vox populi, in ignorance is a denial of the fundamental principles which we have been elected to this place to preserve and defend and for which people for the last thousand years have been prepared to lay down their lives. I would not be prepared to see it set at nought by some bureaucratic conspiracy to make freedom of information a meaningless term. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Freedom of Information Bill. I have little to add to the comments which have been made by members of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs which considered the predecessor of this Bill in very great detail and made a number of recommendations which go to its fundamentals. I wish to contribute to the extent of supporting the amendment moved by Senator Evans, the shadow Attorney-General, and particularly the remarks made by Senator Hamer, Senator Missen and Senator Puplick who are members of that Committee. I think Senator Puplick summed up the principle very well in the final stages of his remarks when he said that no government can withhold information from the public unless there are demonstrable public interest reasons for its so doing, and in that circumstance it should be a judge who decides whether there are such demonstrable reasons. I would have thought that that was a principle that the Government accepted in part, even in relation to the Australian security legislation and in respect of appeals, for example, under that legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A couple of months ago the Swedish Press Ombudsman was in Australia. I was fortunate enough to attend a luncheon at the Melbourne Press Club which he addressed. He was asked a number of questions about the operation of freedom of information legislation in Sweden, which goes back to 1976. He was asked in particular: What was the effect of the legislation on public servants in the day to day carrying out of their work? The Swedish Press Ombudsman said that he had been a public servant for a number of years and that no advice which he had given or documents of advice which he had prepared had in fact been called on under the legislation. He said that public servants in the preparation of advice were constantly conscious of the existence of the freedom of information legislation. It certainly affected their work. It made them much more careful and much more conscientious in preparing advice. Perhaps that is the nub of the situation as it concerns Australia. Perhaps that is one of the fundamental concerns. All sorts of criticisms have been made of the level of operation of the Australian Public Service and the level of advice which it gives in various matters. Many of them are unjustified, but perhaps that is one of the major areas of concern. </PARA>
<PARA> As other speakers have pointed out, many countries have freedom of information legislation which goes far wider than the legislation which is now before the Senate. I cite the examples of Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, France, New Zealand and the United States of America. I cite also the example of two Canadian provinces and the fact that the Canadian Parliament is currently dealing with legislation which is much more liberal than the legislation which is before the Senate. I refer to the United States. It is strange that many senators, who for reasons which will probably not be revealed in the course of this debate will probably vote against the amendments to this legislation and against similar amendments to other legislation, are very keen to tell us how much they admire the quality of democracy in the United States. I do too. </PARA>
<PARA> Often one reads American newspapers, watches on television and listens to American programs of one kind or another which relate to current events in which the United States as a society is embarrassed by actions which have been taken by its officials or politicians. But the discussion about those national events in the United States always comes back to people who are even very critical of the United States. They say: 'My God you have to admire them because in no other society or in very few other societies would those sorts of matters be public knowledge'. What has been unearthed regarding the Central Intelligence Agency operations would not, by the wildest stretch of the imagination, be unearthed under this legislation. In a sense one admires the vitality of American society in that it is prepared to take even the most controversial issues on board and make them available for public discussion. One wonders what is so important about decisions of the Australian Public Service and Australian governments which distinguishes them from those of the Government of what is sometimes regarded-rightly or wrongly-by many people as the greatest democracy in the world. What is so important here that distinguishes us in this situation? The situation can have its ridiculous manifestations. For example, I refer to the operation of secrecy in government in Australia compared with that in the United States. I quote from an article in the Melbourne Age of 7 January this year. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that United States military documents are readily accessible to Australians even though the comparable material is not available from our government. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> One US document arising from that rethinking was a manual on land battles titled 'operations FW100-5'. Australia prepared a similar document adjusted for local needs. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Keith Suter, a defence expert and a prominent member of the United Nations Association of Australia (New South Wales) disarmament committee attempted to obtain a copy of the Australian manual. He was told it would not be made available because it was a classified document. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Suter then wrote to the Pentagon asking for a copy of the US version of the manual. The Pentagon replied saying that of course Dr Suter could have a copy. It would cost $8. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Suter sent a cheque for $8 and received a copy of the manual plus 50c change due to exchange rate differences. </PARA>
<PARA>That relates to a document which perhaps falls in a quasi-defence category. I am not disposed to argue here as to whether it is an area which, in a general sense, should be exempt from the provisions of freedom of information legislation. But it is an interesting example of the sort of situation which exists in the United States compared with the situation which exists here. I do not want to approach this debate in a partisan spirit. Not to put too fine a point on it, the present Government is quite obsessed with secrecy. There have been many ludicrous examples of that fact. Let me state again, as Senator Puplick and others have done with such eloquence, that the right to know is a vital part of any democracy and is increasingly so as the so-called information revolution proceeds apace. </PARA>
<PARA> In that process the role of Parliament, the right of parliamentarians and the right to know of members of the Press-the so-called Fourth Estate-is a vital part of any democracy. According to one survey 82 per cent of the Australian people regard this Government as being too secretive. Not only is it secretive towards the people of this country but also it is secretive towards the Parliament of this country. This comes back to discussions that we have had in this Senate over the years about the role of Parliament as the watchdog of democracy and the role of the Press, the Fourth Estate, as the watchdog of democracy. We are pleased to call it the free Press even though it is owned by about half a dozen people in this country. We have discussed the right of the Parliament and the Press to have information. </PARA>
<PARA> Senators on the Government side, who may for some reason which has not yet been revealed vote against the amendments which will be moved to this legislation, on the recommendation of members of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, often talk here about the writings of Professor Gordon Reid and his warnings about the excessive secrecy of government and the role of the executive in totally dominating Parliament. Again and again he has warned about that. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that Senator Chaney and others have expressed concern about that fact in this Parliament-of course before they became Ministers in the present Government. Suddenly that concern, which they expressed about the domination of Parliament by the Executive, seems to have become limp or lukewarm. That is one of the unfortunate characteristics of the way in which this place operates. Parliament is denied much information. Question Time in this place is a farce in terms of obtaining information on behalf of constituents and members of the public. The process of government dissemination of information is a farce in terms of the process of obtaining information on behalf of citizens in this country. The role of the Executive is totally dominant in the operations of this Parliament. That is undesirable whichever party is in power. A Senate committee, one of the watchdog committees of this Senate, one of the committees which would strengthen, according to Professor Gordon Reid and others, the function and role of this Senate in performing its duties as a House of review, unanimously agreed that the freedom of information legislation proposed in 1978 was totally inadequate for a modern democracy. It recommended many amendments which will be discussed in the course of debate on this legislation. That is a sad situation. It is a pity that that is happening. All citizens ought to be concerned. As I said, survey material indicates that a very substantial majority of people are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the information which has been kept back from the Australian people in the last few years. I again refer to what Senator Puplick said. It is the right of the public to know information unless it can be established by those who would refuse knowledge of the facts that a very substantial case exists for its not being released in the public interest. People who say that they have the right to refuse information and knowledge should put their decision to the test. It should be judged by somebody who is impartial, somebody who is a member of the judiciary. I refer to some of the information which has been withheld. The financial directive to Qantas Airways Ltd given in 1947 again and again has been asked for by journalists and others. Only a few months ago we had the dreadful situation arising from an industrial dispute in which Qantas's affairs were very much in the public limelight. The Chairman of Qantas came to Canberra. He said that government restrictions on that airline had prevented it from doing many of the things which it wanted to do. He then said that he would not say any more about it. The financial directive to that airline is the government limitation or restriction on the capacity of that airline to operate-in terms of such things as loans. This is essential to its economic viability. Why are not Australians, who are the shareholders in that company by virtue of its structure, entitled to know that information? Why are they not entitled to know? Why have governments consistently refused that information?</PARA>

That is absurd. That is absurd, not only in terms of the sort of schoolmasterly attitude which is adopted by government towards citizens in this country; it is absurd also in terms of the fact that many citizens who are concerned about these things read overseas newspapers and sometimes see films from overseas dealing with these subject matters.

What is the justification for that denial in terms of the operation of a free society, as Malcolm Fraser put it on 5 December in that seminal speech made in Adelaide on his behalf by Senator Chaney? What is the justification for that under cover of either umbrella-the democratic society, the free society, as Malcolm Fraser talks about it, or alternatively, the conservative society, about which he also talks? There is no conservative society with any conserving in any sense of decent traditions-the decent traditions of 18th century liberalism, for example-which would deny that sort of information to the citizens of a country. In more recent terms, what is the justification for denying access to documents on Australian defence and foreign policy and going through that absurdly embarrassing farce at the High Court over those documents? What is the justification for that in terms of discussion in a vital democracy, in terms of a free society and the free flow of information upon which any such society is dependent? As the United Nations General Assembly Declaration of 1945 put it:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . freedom of information is a fundamental human right and is the touchstone of all the freedoms to which the United Nations is consecrated. </PARA>
<PARA>That sort of freedom, that sort of fundamental human right, just does not appear to be available in Australia for all sorts of quite silly reasons, for all sorts of quite patrician reasons, for all sorts of reasons which, as I have said on previous occasions, suggest that governments have some particular God-given right to determine what the people of this country will know, even what they will know about things they pay for through their taxes, about things such as government instrumentalities and services which they allegedly own. Other things have been refused to the Australian Consumers Association; for example, things such as the right to look at product tests of the National Acoustic Laboratories, the Department of Transport, and the Materials Research Laboratories. Why should not Australians know the results of product tests made by government instrumentalities such as the Acoustic Laboratories? Is that some additional concession the Government makes to private enterprise? If the Acoustic Laboratories say that a particular hearing aid or piece of equipment is no good, are the people to be denied that knowledge and allowed to go ahead and buy it, perhaps because the manufacturer gave a sling to the Liberal Party at the last election, or something like that? Is that sort of information to be denied?</PARA>
<PARA> Those are the sorts of things which were denied Australian citizens in the past and are still being denied Australian citizens on a day by day basis. They result from petty, narrow-minded, patrician attitudes by politicians, who take themselves too seriously in terms of what they feel they have the capacity to decide about the rights of the Australian people, and by senior bureaucrats who also put themselves in very much the same category. That is not the sort of society which matches the rhetoric of anybody in this place on a day by day basis. It is not the sort of society which lives up to the concerns of commentators on the way government operates in Australia-that the Senate, for example, should be a watchdog on the Executive Government. How can the Senate be a watchdog on the Executive Government if the Executive Government produces freedom of information legislation of the quality of this document now before the Parliament?</PARA>

<PARA> I join with my colleague Senator Evans in supporting the amendment he moved to the motion for the second reading of the Bill. We are concerned at the failure of the Executive, the Government, to explain why it has rejected the arguments put by a unanimous decision of a committee of this Senate, the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. That Committee recommended that Australia should come into the ivy league, into the second half of the 20th century, and join those other countries which are numbered amongst the vital democracies of this world, and there are not too many of them. It has recommended that this Parliament should adopt legislation consistent with the standards of freedom of information legislation adopted in all those other countries to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment moved by Senator Evans to the motion for the Senate second reading of the Bill regrets the excessive deference to bureaucratic influence that appears to have been involved in the rejection by the Government of significant Senate Committee recommendations. It refers to the incorporation of new limitations on the scope and operation of the original 1978 Bill. In the third paragraph it expresses the hope that the Government will adopt a little more imagination on this. When we talk, as the Prime Minister does, about the better society we are trying to create, we should ensure as one of the linchpins of that better society the right of every Australian to have such information as is available and should be available to all citizens, unless there is some fundamental public interest objection. That is not so with this legislation. We also, of course, reaffirm the continuing commitment to freedom of information legislation and the belief that it is indispensible to proper administrative justice and the national interest in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly join with the other speakers who have spoken in support of the amendment, in commending it to the Senate and to those honourable senators who perhaps have not thought very much about the legislation. What we are saying in relation to this matter is consistent with all the rhetoric day after day in this chamber about the sort of society in which we would like to live. I ask Government senators to examine this legislation closely and to tell us in debate what is wrong with the legislation and what is wrong with it in terms of what they believe a democratic society should be like and in terms of their beliefs on the importance of parliamentary control or checks on the power of executive government. I hope that honourable senators supporting the Government's view will be forthcoming in telling us what they feel about those matters if they are going to vote for the legislation in its present form because we should not just sit here like highly paid dummies putting up our hands at the right moment. If we really believe the legislation is dangerous to the public interest we should say so. I would be fascinated to hear what sorts of arguments might be advanced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is now eight years since Australians were promised a freedom of information law. In that time the Public Service bureaucrats with the endorsement of the Cabinet, have fought a hard and successful series of battles to ensure that no such legislation is ever enacted. No excuse, no matter how fanciful, was overlooked to discredit the concept of the legislation . . . yesterday-</PARA>
<PARA>I will explain in a moment why the word 'yesterday' is used. </PARA>
<PARA>saw the triumph of this campaign with the introduction of a freedom of information bill into the Federal Parliament which is nothing more than a cosmetic fake. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will realise that I am quoting from a newspaper which is not noted for its radical impact on Australia's social and political life. I am quoting from the editorial in the Sydney Morning Herald of 3 April 1981. It is quite clear that that newspaper and that editorialist, as did almost every editorial I had access to at the time of the introduction of this Bill, perceived that over some eight years we had a process-it will not be too fanciful to call it a deliberate process-of frustration such that, as we waited for the Bill to emerge, at the end of each period of delay we were merely presented with a proposal for a Bill which, far from streamlining or making access to information more assured and cheaper, has indeed made access to government information less assured to the general Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> The process of delay is the first point to which I wish to draw attention. This is the amazing feature: Given the necessary consultative processes and necessary deliberations within government and the fact that that might have been expected to entail some two or three years of debate within the Australian community, one would have thought the least the Government could do on the introduction of this Bill-in the Government's view, in its final and acceptable form-would be to have a provision permitting access to documents at least from the time at which the Bill was first put into the public arena. One of the grave defects of the Bill which will be taken up no doubt at the Committee stage is that it does not grant access to documents-except in one minor instance-created before the passage of this legislation into law. That means, indeed, that every week, every month and every year of delay and frustration by the bureaucracy has had the effect in the main that another week, another month and another year of information has been denied to the Australian public. I think that in itself would give cause for concern and would perhaps encourage honourable senators to come to the conclusion that in fact the Government is not fair dinkum in the series of deliberations and consultations which preceded the introduction of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course the Bill is flawed by far more than the process of deliberation which has brought it into the chamber tonight. In the view of very many honourable senators the Bill does not capture the true spirit of freedom of information that has emerged in representative democracies particularly since the Second World War. It is not for me to go over the matters so eloquently expressed by Senator Evans and Senator Missen and other honourable senators in the debate tonight, except to say that it is quite clearly crucial for the penetration of truly democratic ideals into our society, where the Government of this nation is concerned, that some Bill such as the one recommended by the State Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs be introduced in this country. Those democratic ideals of participation and of knowledge by the people in the society of what government records may hold about them or about policy options need to be guaranteed. I speak of government information which ought to be available in two different types of categories-for example, government information when government has carried out some surveillance or assessment of an individual to determine whether that individual ought to have access to certain, for example, social security rights. I believe my colleague the shadow Minister for Social Security, Senator Grimes, will elaborate when making his contribution to the debate. Surely where access to rights or where the imposition of liabilities by government is concerned, Australians should have access to such information. I do not deny that the Bill goes some part of the way to achieving that. I am saying that this is one of the ideals which ought to be achieved by the freedom of information legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps more critically, it is the Government's formulation and execution of general political policies which create the whole society wherein we live as free people. It is the documentation which preceeds and embodies the making of those decisions which ought to be available to the general community, except in those instances in which it can be demonstrated to an impartial body that for reasons of national security, defence or commercial secrecy the supression of that document might be required. How free are we really as a society if documents containing assessments by government officials on individual applicants for benefits are not available to the individual? A deficit in the Bill which is a matter of concern to me is that the individual does not have the ability to seek to correct within a government document a misstatement of fact which concerns him and his access to a benefit or right or his being subjected to some sort of liability. Of course these are not minor matters, but they are matters which concern the livelihood of people. Their access to benefits may very well be crucial not only to themselves but to their families. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is believed by honourable senators and by people in the community generally that a good freedom of information Bill would ensure that the individual Australian not only knows exactly what his Government has on file about him but also is able to correct misstatements of fact or so put the statements of fact in proper context that any misleading impression that might be gained by the bureaucracy concerning that individual can be corrected. In any case, that is one category where information ought to be as freely available as possible and access ought to be assured and cheap. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Bill is important in a far wider sense, as I said earlier. Does anyone in this chamber doubt that the power of knowledge is crucial whether it be in the industrial, commercial or trading sphere-that is well known-or, of course, in the social or political spheres? Those who have the knowledge tend to have access to power. Of course, they can disseminate, use and manipulate it in order to preserve their positions of power. In Australia we have our guardians of the knowledge-the bureaucrats and the Ministry-retaining to themselves as much as possible the facts and the policy options upon which government decisions are made. They jealously guard those internal working documents, those documents protected by conclusive ministerial certificates. They do so with all the language which creates the mystique of a bureaucracy which is so secretive and so unresponsive to the demands, as I have said, of a truly participatory democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> They talk of internal working documents with the emphasis on 'internal' as though they are not simply documents which are available to government and which ought to be equally available to the general community so that a proper assessment can be made of the validity of the facts and of the range of policy options open to government. They speak of a conclusive ministerial certificate with the emphasis on 'conclusive'. One would not object to the fact that a Minister might claim that a matter is sensitive in the national security sphere or may have an impact on our defence readiness or preparedness. If he has such a claim it ought to be weighted most carefully by an appointed tribunal that is competent to do that task. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have the mystique of the Westminister system which has been adequately dealt with by many of the speakers earlier in the debate. A mystique is conveyed by that phrase which I think needs to be very clearly rebutted. The essence of the Westminister system is, of course, simply that the Ministry is drawn from the elected representatives within the Parliament. That is in no way touched, impaired or hindered by the freedom of information legislation as conceived, for example, by the Senate Committee. In no way is access to information the enemy of representative democracy based on the Westminister model such as has evolved in Australia. One might think that because the Ministry is indeed drawn from the elected representatives and is not created by some sort of patronage system as it is in the United States, the Ministers would be keen to see that the other elected representatives-their fellows within the Parliament-and, indeed, the people whom they represent should have as much access to information within the possession of the Government as is compatible with our national security. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not go into the Bill in great detail. I simply emphasise, for the sake of honourable senators who may be wondering whether they should support the amendment to the second reading moved by Senator Evans, that the amendment is moved in order to give senators an opportunity to express their disappointment with the Bill as it has emerged from this deliberative process and to enable honourable senators to indicate to the Government that it would have been preferable had the Bill been more closely aligned with the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee inquiring into freedom of information. I believe that that Committee in many ways embodies the essence and the integrity of Senate standing committees. The report in its 500 pages, argues the matter, very exhaustively and tightly. The point is that it is an unanimous report. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Alan Missen chaired the Committee most ably with a degree of knowledge of comparative and international law on this subject which was most invaluable. The contributions of Senators Hamer and Puplick were in the real traditions of liberalism in the English sense of that word. The contribution by Senator Evans was, of course, incisive, penetrating and comprehensive. It would not amaze other honourable senators to be told that his capacity for work was one of the factors which enabled this tremendous project to come to fruition. Senator Keeffe made his customary contribution and I was present on most occasions. That report, as I have said, concluded after the most exhaustive and fair-minded taking of evidence on a Bill of this nature to take place certainly within the Australian Parliament and very probably in any parliament throughout the world. The conclusions have been spoken of in detail, as I have said, by Senator Evans. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that while the Senate Committee, a committee of elected representatives, was coming to its conclusions that a much more elaborate, stringent Bill was required in order to enable assured and cheap access to government records, at the very same time as this perception of what was required within our democracy by elected representatives of the people was going on, in another forum-in many ways a much more powerful forum of non-elected persons who have the power, indeed, to hold void legislation which this Parliament passes-the non-elected justices of the High Court of Australia were coming to the same conclusion. I refer to the case of Sankey v. Whitlam. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is most interesting and it should be of some help to honourable senators to realise that that case involved a situation very similar to that which is the concern of this Bill. On the one hand there were the claims that government documents, some of which were Federal Executive Council decisions and some of which were internal working documents, ought not to be disclosed even though they were required by a person in the course of litigation. There was a conflict. The whole case really boiled down to a conflict between the claim on the one side that the efficient working of government at the highest levels would be impaired by disclosure and the claim on the other side that for justice to be done disclosure had to be made. The point really is that the High Court of Australia, the non-elected Bench of justices, decided in the late 1970s that the Executive should not make the final decision on how those competing claims should be resolved, and it was proper for the High Court to make that decision, that the Executive should not be the final arbiter of what government documents ought to be withheld from public disclosure in the interests of not impairing some matter of public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> I have dwelt on that case for a few moments because I believe that the Court, like the Senate Standing Committee, reflected a mood within our democracy far removed from that prevailing during and at the end of the Second World War. One cannot but feel that perhaps many of the attitudes of the men in the later years of their lives at the heights of the Public Service within Australia are attitudes which were appropriate in the late 1940s and the early 1950s but which are totally inappropriate and out of tune with the demands for a truly participatory, representative democracy that are being made in Australia at the moment. Indeed, the acceptance by the Government of the decisions in the Sankey v. Whitlam case and the fact that it brought no legislation into this place in order to undo that decision or to make it impossible for it to recur in the future seems to my mind completely to undermine any continuing claim by the Government that where a conflict arises between the public interest in competent administration which may be served by some secrecy on the one hand and the public interest in disclosure to interested members of the public on the other hand the Government must be the final arbiter. The Government has accepted the High Court decision in the Sankey v. Whitlam case and I believe that in the spirit of that acceptance it should have gone much further in the Bill which it has presented to this chamber tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that it has not gone as far as it should in curtailing the use of conclusive ministerial certificates is of course mentioned by Senator Missen as one of the seven deadly sins of omission in the document which he has circulated. I think it is very important for honourable senators to note, in Senator Missen's words, this fact:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government refuses to abandon the provisions which deny any right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against refusals to disclose government documents in many important areas and the Bill provides that the Ministers certificate is to be final and unchallengeable. The major areas affected are: Documents relating to national security, defence, international relations, relations with States, cabinet and executive council documents and the determination of what is 'contrary to the public interest' in relation to 'internal working documents'. </PARA>
<PARA>To state the position shortly, and I hope not too crudely, it is not that the Senate Committee, nor indeed the High Court, would want to make available every document about which a claim can be properly made that its disclosure would imperil national security or defence. It is not our intention that such documents should willy-nilly be made available to those who request them. But it is our contention that the Executive and the bureaucracy behind the Executive should not be the final and conclusive arbiters of whether a document is in fact such as is described. Indeed, when one reads the Bill that has been presented one finds some amazing provisions. Proposed section 23 (2) reads:</PARA>
<PARA> An agency or Minister may refuse to grant access to documents in accordance with a request without having searched for or identified the documents if the nature of the documents, as described in the request, is such that any such document would be an exempt document. </PARA>
<PARA>If that is not a catch-22 clause, nothing is. The agency-that means some government department or the Minister; at least he could be held responsible in a forum such as this at Question Time, or in debate-can refuse to search for a document if it believes that the document would be exempt. But how is it to know the nature of the document if it has not searched for it, precisely delineated or ascertained its contents and put them up against some set of criteria? It is that sort of refusal to come to terms with the real spirit of providing the Australian community with access to government documents in an assured and cheap manner which is the reason that Senator Evans has moved the amendment in such mild terms as he has in this second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I would not want to give the impression that the matter is of concern only to Senate committees which have 15 months in which to go around Australia exhaustively collating evidence and opinions from not only government departments but also a broad range of persons within the Australian community. Nor is this merely a matter of concern for a High Court which brought its judicial integrity and impartiality to bear on questions of the nature with which we are dealing tonight. But the editorial comment around Australia has been to express uniform disappointment, to put it at its very mildest, in the Bill which has been presented to this chamber this week. </PARA>

Once again, that is not a journal of radical opinion within this Commonwealth; it is a responsible, one might say, conservative newspaper published in Senator McLaren's home State of South Australia. The article is entitled 'Rationing information', which I think is the editorialists answer to Senator Durack's question. The article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The so-called Freedom of Information Bill introduced by the Federal Attorney-General, Senator Durack, last week is a desperately disappointing document. Nor is the disappointment eased at all by the fact that it is by no means surprising. It had been widely and, as we now know, accurately conjectured for some time that the Government would decide to ignore most of the more important amendments recommended to the earlier 1978 Bill . . . </PARA>
<PARA> That the principles embodied in those amendments have been so firmly rejected suggests that the Government has no real commitment to the notion of making information more readily available. </PARA>
<PARA>It is because of that lack of real commitment that Senator Evans's amendment to the second reading has been moved in the terms in which it has. I commend that amendment to honourable senators. The editorial in the Advertiser concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> If it can do no better than this--</PARA>
<PARA>It is speaking of the Government's action in introducing this Bill-</PARA>
<PARA>in an area so closely concerned with democratic principles the Government might have been well advised to do nothing. Its critics now see it as being as much concerned with its own as with the public's welfare in the matter of freedom of information. It is to be hoped that the Senate will apply sufficient pressure to bring about much needed improvements in the proposed legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>I could go on to quote from the Age of 4 April. I will not quote at great length because time is so short. It makes this point:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that our governments have grown so large and remote that they no longer understand their basic relationship to society. </PARA>
<PARA>It points out that the Federal Government and its senior bureaucrats seem to have failed to come to terms with that real relationship between government and society, namely, that the Government collects information at the expense of and on behalf of the public and that therefore, as a matter of sheer logic let alone democratic decency, that information should be available to the public unless very strong arguments can be mounted for its suppression. According to the Age the Government must accept 'abandoning the present practice of secret government', such as is epitomised in this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise simply to seek information from the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson) in regard to the Government's intentions with regard to a survey entitled 'Appraisal and implications of a survey of Abbott's Booby on Christmas Island' by Professor Ovington, Professor Cullen and Dr Nelson. I took the trouble, as I did last night, to alert Senator Peter Baume to that fact that I expected him to be in the chamber when I made my submission. I even went to the extent of sending him a letter that I received from Mr Buckingham, who is the Chairman of the Australian National Section of the International Council for Bird Preservation. I hope that Senator Durack, who is at the table, will have a look at the document I sent to Senator Peter Baume. The document virtually speaks for itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 15 September 1980 I raised in the Senate a question concerning what the Government contemplated doing to protect the habitat of the booby bird. As a result of that Professor Ovington and his colleagues were appointed to undertake a survey. Subsequently the results of the survey were published. Paragraph 3 on page 25 of the survey states:</PARA>
<PARA> We believe that with a revised mining plan, jungle clearing for phosphate mining can be compatible with the conservation of Abbott's Booby . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The important thing is that the survey indicates that there can be a spirit of co-existence. On pages 26, 27 and onwards it lays out the plan to be achieved whereby phosphate can be produced and at the same time the habitat of the booby bird can be protected. The Australian National Section of the International Council for Bird Preservation, in its communication to me, asked four questions. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We are most anxious to elicit a public statement on:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The findings of the study. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. The appraisal of those findings. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. The intended action by the Government in response to the study and its appraisal. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. The degree of commitment by the Goverment to ensuring the survival of Abbott's Booby as a viable endemic breeding species on Christmas Island. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave for that communication to be incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA>Sydney, NSW 2000</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator</PARA>
<PARA> May I express the appreciation of members of this organisation for your concern over the fate of Abbott's Booby at Christmas Island. The threat to its continued existence is very real indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer in particular to your question in the Senate to the Governent Leader, Senator Carrick, on 15 September 1980. In reply Senator Carrick advised that an expert panel would appraise a detailed survey of the size, distribution and viability of the population of Abbott's Booby and report its finding on 31 January 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The report has been published and a copy sent to me in my capacity as Chairman, Australian National Section, ICBP. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear from the report that some restraint to rain-forest clearing for mining is necessary if the Booby's survival is to be ensured. The report makes a number of very reasonable proposals and offers an optimal solution to otherwise conflicting mining and conservation interests. I do not have information on the appraisal of the study. </PARA>
<PARA> Would you please raise the matter again in the Senate at the earliest opportunity? We are most anxious to elicit a public statement on:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. the findings of the study,</PARA>
<PARA> 2. the appraisal of those findings,</PARA>
<PARA> 3. the intended action by the Government in response to the study and its appraisal,</PARA>
<PARA> 4. the degree of commitment by the Government to ensuring the survival of Abbott's Booby as a viable endemic breeding species on Christmas Island. </PARA>
<PARA> Hopefully, in view of Senator Carrick's comments in Hansard on the Prime Minister's practical attitudes towards the conservation of flora and fauna, we shall not see the Booby go the way of the Dodo or the other 180 or so species of oceanic island birds now no longer in existence. </PARA>
<PARA> I would much appreciate receiving from you a copy of the extract from Hansard when the matter is raised and answered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have all seen the recent posters dealing with Christmas Island and illustrating crabs and various bird varieties. The survey prepared by Professor Ovington and his colleagues was dated 23 January 1981. So I think it is time the Government, through the wisdom of the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, indicated what the Government's plans are and whether they are an adequate response to the International Council for Bird Preservation in view of the very lucid communcation which I have had incorporated in Hansard and which bears the signature of Mr Buckingham, who of course is the Chairman of the Australian National Section of that organisation. I leave the matter in the hands of Senator Durack in the hope that I will get an early response with regard to the Government's intentions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) As advised by the Minister for Health in reply to a question without notice on 25 March 1981 the outbreak was diagnosed on a property near Timaru on 11 February. The property was declared an infected place at about 4.30 (pm) New Zealand time on that day. The New Zealand Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries issued the first Press release of a suspected outbreak at 9.30 a.m. New Zealand time. Unofficial reports in Australia of this suspected outbreak were confirmed with New Zealand authorities by officers of the Department of Health in a telephone discussion which took place at approximately 11.15 a.m. on the 12th. This further confirmatory advice on the suspected outbreak was contained in a cable received by the Department of Health from New Zealand authorities at 1.43 p.m. Australian time.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Any answer to this question would be speculative.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) No. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs has no power to grant special purpose leases, which are issued under Northern Territory legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 11 March 1981 (Hansard, page 488), Senator MacGibbon asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources, the following question, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In view of the Minister's statement on 9 March to the Conference of Combined Rural Traders that the Australian Government expects even heavier damage to the sugar export trade by the European Economic Community's continuing refusal to sign the International Sugar Agreement, what additional steps will the Government take to ensure that Australia's sugar producers are not harmed further by the Community's intransigent policies?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Trade and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government intends to continue to seek to have the EEC adopt sugar export policies that do not disrupt the world sugar market. The Government will continue to pursue this matter through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and by other multilateral and bilateral means.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia is continuing to press the EEC in the GATT to modify its sugar regime. In 1979 a GATT Panel found that the EEC's system of sugar export subsidies had prejudiced Australian trade and constituted a threat of prejudice to world trade. Subsequently, Australia held bilateral consultations with the EEC on its sugar regime. As there was no progress in these consultations a GATT Working Party was established to consider ways by which the Community might change its system so as to place limits on its export subsidies. The EEC was not prepared, however, to make any changes to its system and the Working Party was forced to conclude that the Community's export subsidies would continue as a source of uncertainty in world markets and would continue to prejudice world sugar trade. The Working Party's report was adopted by the GATT Council which adopted a decision maintaining Australia's complaint and providing for a further review by the GATT of the new EEC sugar regulations and the 1981-82 sugar intervention price.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia will continue to bring maximum pressure to bear on the EEC at future GATT meetings in an effort to bring about meaningful changes to its damaging sugar regime.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia also continues to seek to persuade the EEC to enter negotiations for EEC membership of the International Sugar Agreement. It is important that the EEC accept its international responsibility along with other sugar importers and exporters and join the ISA under terms and conditions, including export quotas, comparable with those accepted by all other members.</PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, however, and despite pressure from Australia and other ISA members, the EEC has taken little action to join the current Agreement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 31 March 1981 (Hansard, page 877) Senator Evans asked a question concerning the Australian Legal Aid Office in Victoria. I said that I would investigate the matters raised by Senator Evans and that I would provide a detailed answer after I had an opportunity of doing that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's budget for legal aid for the financial year 1980-81 allows the Australian Legal Aid Office to refer a certain number of matters to private practitioners. A proportion of that number is available to the Australian Legal Aid Office in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA> There has been a high level of demand for legal aid in Victoria in this financial year. That demand has been met, but it is not possible to continue at that rate for the remainder of the year without exceeding the budget limit. However, a number of steps have been and are being taken within the Australian Legal Aid Office to meet, as far as possible, the continuing demand for legal aid in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA> One means of doing this is to increase the capacity of salaried lawyers to provide the legal services directly, so as to compensate, as far as possible, for the limited number of referrals available in the last quarter of the year.</PARA>
<PARA> The arrangement under which a duty solicitor attends the Family Court each morning in Melbourne has not been axed but suspended only for a short period. The temporary suspension is to enable the office to utilise the duty solicitor to provide legal services within the Office. However, there will still be lawyers 'on call' to attend at the Family Court to help persons needing urgent legal representation in family law matters; in other cases, legal advice will be obtainable from the Melbourne Office, which is located close to the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA> Before dealing with other matters raised in the question, I wish to repudiate the allegation that a policy of deception has been implemented in the Melbourne Office. The staff of the Melbourne Office have responded well to the high demand for legal aid, and I am sure that they will make even greater efforts to cope with it.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the rest of the question, I make the following observations and comments: No arrangements are in hand for increasing the contributions required of those granted legal aid; this course would not, in any case, increase the number of matters which could be referred to private practitioners. No arrangements are in hand to redefine the notion of merit to exclude applications which would otherwise be within the guidelines; the merits of applications, of course, have to be considered in accordance with the Office guidelines to ensure that matters without legal merit are not publicly funded and that available funds are allocated to those matters where the need for assistance is greatest. No arrangements are being made to reject outright any applicants who satisfy the guidelines. Late last month there was a period of six working days during which the referring of approved matters to private practitioners was deferred and a final decision on some other applications was also deferred. This was to enable the overall position to be reviewed. Urgent matters, however, were not deferred. The reference of matters to private practitioners has now been resumed subject to the annual limit applicable to Victoria under the Budget. In view of that limit, matters are being referred in an order of priority which takes account of need. Priorities are being re-assessed each week by the Office.</PARA>
<PARA> The administrative steps described above are necessary to ensure that the Australian Legal Aid Office operates within its budget for the financial year. I shall be monitoring the situation to see whether any further action becomes necessary.</PARA>
