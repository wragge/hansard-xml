<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T7">Senator TOWNLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a question of the Minister representing the Treasurer. I preface it by saying that I am one of those who believe this country should follow such energetic countries as Hong Kong and Switzerland and establish a tax rate that is constant no matter what income a person works toward because I believe the present tax rates do remove incentive. Is the Minister able to say how much money would be lost to the Treasury if the maximum tax rate were reduced from the present 60c in the dollar to 50c in the dollar, something that would be at least a step in the direction of an even tax rate? If the Minister is not able to let me know the exact amount at this stage from his notes, I would be grateful if, when he can, he would also advise the percentage loss to revenue of such a reduction. Finally, will the Minister advise the Treasurer that many senators and members do believe that a flat tax rate is possible and that the proposition should be examined again in discussions leading up to the Budget?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the actual quantum of money that would be lost to revenue by the reduction of the ceiling from 60c to 50c I am not able to say, but I will invite the Treasurer to give me the information for Senator Townley and indeed, to express it in the percentages which Senator Townley seeks. As to the final part of Senator Townley's question, the Government has made it quite clear that it opposes the concept of a flat tax. It believes that a progressive tax scale is the equitable one. The Government, of course, is striving to reduce the impact of all taxation upon the community. That can only come about either by reducing the size of government spending-and that implies both State and Federal government spending because the States absorb 39.87 per cent of personal income tax revenue-or by cutting functions. The Government is very keen that there should be the maximum restraint on Commonwealth and State government spending. I have no doubt that that will be a matter heavily before the governments in their future meetings at Premiers Conferences.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister: Is it a fact that under the Administrative Arrangements Order issued by the Governor-General and the Prime Minister the Minister for Transport administers the Department of Transport? Under whose authority was the name of that Department changed to Transport Australia? Is it not a fact that documents have been overprinted showing 'Department of' in fine print over 'Transport Australia' in large letters?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe it is a fact that the Administrative Arrangements Orders state as Senator MacGibbon says. I am aware that a subtitle, or what is in modern terms a logo or a logo title, 'Transport Australia', has been developed. I am able to say that it has been developed with the full authority and support of the Minister concerned because I have heard him say exactly that. I am unable to say what the cost is.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer is emphatically no. Basically I think what was sought was a logo type of title which could identify the Commonwealth role in transport as distinct from the role of the six States and some territorial roles. My understanding-I am subject to correction by the responsible Minister-is that what was sought was a simple phrase which on vehicles or letter heads identify the Commonwealth or Australian authority for transport as distinct from these individual State authorities. I will refer the general question to the Minister concerned, and if he desires to add anything further, including anything on the question of costs, I will let the honourable senator know.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health refers to the Government's decision applicable as from yesterday to exclude from the medical benefits schedule items covering so-called cosmetic surgery. Is the Minister aware that in many cases the implementation of this ruling from yesterday is likely to have a severe retrospective effect as several patients about to undergo operations such as breast augmentation have already purchased the surgical implants, prostheses, at considerable expense. As they were legally entitled to claim medical benefits at the time they purchased the implants, will the Government consider delaying the effect of the ruling until, say, 1 May next?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Are cosmetic surgery items to be removed only from the schedule of medical benefits or from the hospital benefits schedule as well? Does the Minister realise that a seemingly cosmetic operation often results in a marked improvement in the psychological health of the patient? How does the Minister propose to draw the line between purely medical and purely cosmetic surgery in cases such as these? Will the Minister add a rider to the decision stating that medical benefits will still be payable in surgical cases where the reduction or removal of psychological trauma is involved?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that it is correct that a number of procedures have been affected in the way that Senator Chipp has generally averted to. From my own professional knowledge I can indicate to the Senate that there are occasions when some of these operations are medically indicated. There is no argument about that. Reduction mammaplasty would be the obvious example. This is something I would have to check but it is my understanding that the Minister did not rule out the payment of benefits where particular medical indications exist. It is very hard to put, say, face-lift operations in that kind of category.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport has provided me with some information in connection with the questions asked about this matter by Senator Teague and also, I believe, Senators Young and Bishop. The Minister is aware of proposals by some international airlines to operate services to Adelaide Airport. I understand there have been discussions between the South Australian Government and some international airline operators on this matter. However, to date, the Minister has received no formal approach from any international airline for the implementation of such a service. In the event that an application is made he will give it very careful consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of the provision of facilities at the Adelaide Airport, including a new terminal, is currently being considered by the Department of Transport. When that consideration is complete, the Minister will place the submission before the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Teague also referred to the runways at Adelaide Airport. The Minister has advised me that the main runway has sufficient length, width and strength to enable an international aircraft such as Boeing 747 or a DC10 to fly to destinations such as Perth or Sydney, although with a somewhat less than maximum payload. However, the runway is not long enough to enable those aircraft to fly directly to such destinations as Tokyo or Honolulu. Let me assure honourable senators of the Government's firm intention to see that the people of South Australia receive the benefits of international air services to Adelaide. The Government will strive to see that this is done as soon as possible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce and relates to the settlement of the 35-hour week dispute at the Altona petrochemical complex in Victoria.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator has raised a question about the terms of settlement of the Altona dispute. My advice is that the terms of settlement are contained in an agreement between the unions and the six companies concerned. It is a very long and complicated document which covers in detail work practices and arrangements at each company. This morning I am not able to detail to the honourable senator the terms of settlement and the productivity gains. However, I will refer the question to the Minister for Industrial Relations to provide a detailed answer. The honourable senator would be aware that the Commonwealth intervened before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to oppose the Altona settlement. When the matter had been dealt with, my colleague the Minister for Industrial Relations issued a statement on 24 March. In noting the decision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission ratifying the agreement for reduced hours the Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must accept the decision of the Commission. Nevertheless it is disgraceful that the form of industrial pressure used by the unions concerned at the complex over such a long period of time has now brought about a settlement so costly to the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government intervened in this hearing and strongly argued against the settlement. It continues its opposition to the productivity bargaining concept in its application to reduce working hours.</PARA>
<PARA>Although I am unable to give the precise detail, and I think that a considerable amount of detail is required to answer the honourable senator's question, I make it quite clear that the Government is opposed to the concept in its application to reduce working hours. I think that it must be quite clear now that the Government is determined in the national interest to do what it can to prevent the campaign for a shorter working week succeeding. We believe that it will do great damage to our economy and to employment in this country. Accordingly, we will continue to take the sorts of steps that have been outlined over the last few weeks, primarily by the Minister for Industrial Relations, to resist this trend, which is not in the national interest.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, although I believe that it may also come under other portfolios. Is the Government aware of the recent failure of the suit of the Unification Church-sometimes known as the Moonies-in the United Kingdom, the longest in the legal history of that country, against the London Daily Mail and that the Church was consequently ordered to pay costs estimated to be in the order of $A1.5m? Has he been informed that this suit was a result of an article accusing the Moonies of brainwashing converts and breaking up families? Is he also aware that the jury said that the tax-free charitable status of the Unification Church in Britain should be investigated by the United Kingdom Board of Inland Revenue on the grounds that it is a political organisation? As this organisation has been operating in Australia since about 1973 and as senators and members have had their attention drawn to the fact that families have been broken due to the conversion of young people to this sect, will the Government initiate inquiries to establish whether similar practices are being employed by Moonies in Australia?

That is in Hansard and is not a total invention. While we are talking about these matters, yesterday at Question Time I was asked by Senator Button about a number of matters concerning junior Ministers in the Fraser Government.

<PARA> As we are talking about invention, I can assure the Senate that, as I stated yesterday, neither Mr Newman nor Mr Hodgman has a Press officer. They have never had Press officers, contrary to Senator Grimes's interjections yesterday.

He is located in the Commonwealth Government Centre in Hobart. In that location I understand Mr Montgomery will be closer to the new offices that Senator Grimes plans to take two floors below in the Commonwealth building than he will be to Mr Hodgman.

The Government exercises a great economy of staff, compared with the Whitlam Government. The Whitlam Government openly and notoriously used its ministerial staff and its Press officers for propaganda purposes. In other words, we have been far more economical. It is a fact that no Minister in the Senate employs a Press officer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, Senator Carrick has asserted today that Mr Power deals only with government business. The matter which Senator Button has raised is a Press statement which refers inquiries to Mr Laurie Power, giving telephone numbers both at work and at home-and at home-on the stationery of the Minister for National Development and Energy; so presumably it is with Senator Carrick's knowledge and approval. That statement reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Each new policy statement of Labor's Energy spokesman, Mr Keating is contradictory and utterly confusing.</PARA>
<PARA> His most recent statement in the Sunday Times, Perth, that a Federal Labor Government would freeze the price of petrol in its first year is a sign of further frenzy, no doubt inspired by the West Australian election.</PARA>
<PARA> Only a few days ago Mr Keating outlined Labor's policy in an in-depth interview with the Sydney Morning Herald.</PARA>
<PARA> He indicated then that Labor would not reduce the price of petrol as he had previously promised. On attaining office it would retain the pre-existing price and adjust it upwards according to variations in either the C.P.I. or import parity pricing whichever was the lesser.</PARA>
<PARA> He went on to reveal that Labor's proposed Resources Tax would yield more revenue than the existing levy.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Keating has shown that petrol under Labor would be dearer not cheaper.</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate to say that not only is that sentence which I have just read out a highly political statement-nothing to do with government business-but also it is objectively wrong. It is not only a political assertion but also a political assertion which is false. I continue to quote from the statement:</PARA>
<PARA> Since the Resources Tax would be imposed upon the oil producer, it must have the effect of stopping exploration.</PARA>
<PARA> Labor's oil policy must lead to dearer petrol and dry bowsers.</PARA>
<PARA>The statement is dated 11 February 1980 and it has the words 'Inquiries: Laurie Power' and gives both the work and home telephone numbers. I submit that the statement can by no stretch of the imagination be claimed to be a report of government policy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Several weeks ago both Senator Lewis and Senator Teague asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Education, questions concerning the employment of academic staff in Australian universities. I indicated that I would seek the information they required. I understand that the paper referred to by Senator Lewis is entitled 'Academic Staffing: The Research for Excellence'. Australian universities are autonomous institutions responsible for their own academic affairs, including the selection and appointment of staff. They aim to develop and maintain the highest standards of academic excellence. Consistent with this, their appointments procedures for filling academic positions are designed to select the best available qualified persons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most academic positions are advertised both within Australia and overseas. Applications for each position are considerd by an appointments committee which is appointed by the university governing body. It comprises members of the academic staff and, in many cases, other members from outside the universities-either from another university or the wider community. The appointments committee obtains referees' reports on the applicants and then interviews those who are placed on the short list. If the appointments committee considers that none of the applicants has the necessary qualifications and experience, it will leave the position unfilled rather than appoint a person who is not of the desired calibre. Also, universities always reserve the right to fill any position by invitation to ensure that a person of the highest academic quality is appointed. Unless the appointment committee has been given delegated authority to make the final appointment, the university governing body must ratify each appointment recommended by appointments committees before it becomes effective.</PARA>
<PARA> If statistics show that universities employ few female academic staff, or a disproportionate number with overseas qualifications, this is not evidence of discrimination against females or Australians. Indeed, it indicates that the female applicants have not been assessed as being the best available applicants for the positions and that applicants with overseas qualifications have been assessed as being the best available for the positions.</PARA>

I now have some further information on the matter which may help him. Veterans who were allotted special duty for service in a special area are eligible to be considered for repatriation benefits under the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. Qualifying service is conceded to persons who, while members of the forces, served on special service and were allotted for special duty in a special area as prescribed. In respect of the Vietnam conflict, a person had to be allotted for service in South Vietnam or in waters within 100 nautical miles of Vietnam. Special duty is defined as duty relating directly to warlike operations or a state of disturbance which resulted in an area being declared a special area. Land areas were proclaimed special areas from 31 July 1967 while coastal waters were proclaimed from 1 March 1967.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleagues and I on this side of the chamber again raise the matter of youth unemployment in this country and the problems facing the young unemployed. We are spurred to do so at this time by the kite-flying exercise which has been conducted by senior Ministers such as the Minister for Education (Mr Fife), the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and others plus many Government back benchers. I refer to the proposal to restrict unemployment benefit for those under the age of 18 years. The belief apparently is that these people are best cared for by their families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We believe the unemployed are carrying an unjust share of the burden of this Government's restrictive policies. Within the ranks of the unemployed the hardship is unequally shared between the generations, with three times as many teenagers being unemployed as adults. In the past the Government has blamed everyone in sight for that. The trade unions are attacked for protecting their members. The public is attacked for not spending enough. The families of the unemployed are attacked for not supporting them enough. The education system is blamed for not educating the unemployed enough. Mainly, the unemployed teenagers are being criticised for not getting up and magically finding work. Now we have the situation that repeated warnings have been issued by the senior Ministers I have mentioned-I am afraid that it may be less of a warning than foreshadowed legislation-that the out of work 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds are not only to be blamed for their plight but also are to be punished for being unable to find non-existent work by no longer being paid the unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has stated that the review of the unemployment benefit for 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds will be completed by May. It seems to us that the Government may be saying that it hopes to have the justifications for this illogical and callous measure-one it hopes will save some $100m-by May so that the legislation can be introduced. About 60 per cent of school leavers go directly from school to some sort of job and an independent wage. Almost 25 per cent of school leavers go on to further education and a proportion of these receive payments under the National Employment and Training System or receive tertiary assistance. Our problem is that it is conservatively estimated that 15 per cent of these people cannot find work. In May 1980 the figures showed that 20 per cent of those who left the education system in 1979 still had not found a job. </PARA>
<PARA> The most recent figures by the Australian Bureau of Statistics which are for February 1981 show that 128,000 teenagers were unemployed of whom half were looking for their first job. The percentage of 15-year-olds to 19-year-olds unemployed was 18.7 per cent. In December and January the percentage of unemployed in that age group was over 20 per cent. The under 20-year-olds represented 30 per cent of those unemployed. The figures exclude any young person who may have been employed doing a couple of hours paid gardening or baby-sitting. If young people do more than an hour's work they miss out on being counted as unemployed in the figures of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The figure of 18.7 per cent for the teenage unemployed will gradually reduce during the year to a hard core and unhappy 15 per cent. Teenage unemployment accounted for 12 per cent of unemployment when this Government came in and it has risen steadily in spite of every effort of the Government to fiddle the books. Who are the teenage unemployed? First and foremost they are people who, in spite of denigration from wealthy senior Ministers in the Government, want a job, stability, financial independence and a counter to the boredom and hopelessness of their present situation. Most Australians identify themselves according to the work they do. They do not have to make the painful admission that they have no job, work mates or weekly pay packet. Having made such an admission some retreat and others rebel. According to figures from the Department of Social Security, 32,500 teenagers aged 16 years and 17 years receive unemployment benefit. They represent 12 per cent of unemployment benificiaries. About 60 per cent of those have received benefits for more than three months which means that they have been out of work for five months at least. Their benefit is $36 a week. It is six years since it was last raised. In flying this kite that the unemployment benefit to the young 15, 16 and 17-year-olds may be removed the Prime Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The present payment of unemployment benefits may act as a disincentive to continue in formal education or training or to seek work. </PARA>
<PARA>I will take the second point first. No young person in his or her right mind would choose a $36-a-week dole payment when average junior earning rates will give them three times that amount and far better future prospects. Some of the $36 is needed to travel to work interviews, the Commonwealth Employment Service and Department of Social Security offices. Some of the amount goes on board at home or elesewhere. All of the amount will go on surviving. There is no way in the world those kids unlucky enough to have to go from rural areas to the cities to seek work because of the high rural unemployment levels can enjoy life on $36 a week. If the Government succeeds in cutting off the unemployment benefit for the under-18-year-olds the secondary effect will be to increase the extent of hidden unemployment in the community. The young jobless will be reluctant to register with the CES with the odds heavily stacked against them, as they are. They will not show up on Social Security statistics. In one stroke the Government will have saved money and concealed the problem as it has tried to do consistently. </PARA>
<PARA> On the figures, there is no incentive to be unemployed; there is a strong incentive to accept work, even at junior rates. The incentive to continue with education is the same as it has always been-young people who want to do so have the opportunity to learn more, to mature further and to improve their employment prospects. There is little short term financial advantage in education as compared with work. Junior earning rates are more than twice as high as the over-18-years unemployment benefit or the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowance. Unemployment benefit is not a disincentive to education. It is a payment which in the case of teenagers is picked up on the way from schooling to the finding of work. Lack of work is the root of the problem. All the phoney arguments from Government members about schooling versus unemployment benefit should not be allowed to disguise that vital point. The fact is that at the same time more young people are staying in school and more young people are unemployed. The paper presented by Mr Peter Kirby at the conference of youth in training on 23 February stated that between 1960 and 1970 the school participation rate of 15-year-olds rose by over one-third, from 57 per cent to 81 per cent, and that of 16-year-olds almost doubled from 28 per cent to 52 per cent. School retention rates are higher now than they were in 1975 while unemployment has in fact worsened. The school leavers of the 1970s and the 1980s have spent and will spend longer in school than their counterparts in the 1950s and the 1960s. But over the two decades of the 1950s and the 1960s demand for labour was so strong that a choice of jobs was virtually guaranteed for the yearly output of the expanding education system. But jobs themselves are missing now, let alone there being the choice to which Mr Kirby referred. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course it is the poorest, the least schooled and often the least capable who are at risk. They come last in the job race. They have the hardest time mastering the unemployment benefit system and they are the ones, I suggest, at whose collective head the Government is now pointing the gun. Their crime, it seems to some members of the Government, is that they have not found work when they have left school and they show up in the unemployment statistics. The Government sees them as an embarrassment and a financial drain and hopes to hide them, apparently by attempting to conscript them back into the education system. If the Government could be persuaded to look again at the problem it might be able to see these people as potential assets being wasted because there are no jobs, as unhappy young people who are often given little support by their families or society at large. I quote from a paper given by Mr Daryl Dixon, a well-known public servant in this country, from the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat to the youth in training conference. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> In leaving school and seeking employment a choice has been made in favour of independence-and if the community cannot find the employment he or she seeks then the community should bear the cost of maintaining that person until employment and independence is achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>It is no good the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs telling us or those young people that young people should not enter the labour market until they are properly equipped to enter or to obtain employment. The point is that until the 1970s there was employment for young people, people younger than the ones now leaving school, whether they were properly equipped. Now there is not. The position is further complicated by the fact that there is evidence that employers are taking advantage of an excess supply of applicants to shift apprenticeship recruitment to those with higher academic standards. This year, the State Electricity Commission in Victoria has taken on apprentices with the highest ever qualifications. So the less qualified kids have been left behind without jobs, without choice and increasingly without hope. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the factors militating against their employment in recent years has been the increasing practice of some employers to reduce their full time, unskilled and semi-skilled work force to take on teenagers on a part time or casual basis. The employer can often cut costs by paying below award rates and offering below award payments and, in fact, sometimes below award conditions. Between 1971 and 1980 males at school increased their share of part time teenage jobs from 39 per cent to 64 per cent and girls, from 28 per cent to 62 per cent. No one can blame them for taking these jobs. No one can blame them for taking advantage of these opportunities given to them but it has a severe effect on the older people seeking work after leaving school. The Government line, apparently, is that there should be for the under 18-year olds something better than the unemployment benefit and one cannot deny that this would be a good thing. There are certainly better ways of spending $106m than on the under 18 unemployment benefit. But the answer-and the answer seems to bother the Government-is that there should be work. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to us that this Government is a job-eliminator, not a job creator. It is about to take a carving knife to its own Public Service, the Commonwealth labour force that usually translates a service to the public. Jobs carved out of the Public Service will be jobs unavailable for school leavers in the future. There has been no automatic response to this reduction in the Commonwealth Public Service in the private sector despite the predictions of the Prime Minister in this regard. In the present system, even with the benefits as inadequate as they are now, the wealthier families, the wealthier teenagers, will be able to survive. They will be able to swim while the less wealthy, the kids from large families, the kids from an increasing number of families with adults unemployed will have a hard time keeping afloat. Some will sink. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, it repeatedly proclaims, has spent considerable time thinking of means of overcoming the problems facing the young unemployed. Yet it studiously ignores the possibilities of finding them work. It has greatly lauded its so-called transition to work and youth unemployment schemes. I think in a debate such as this, brief though it is, both of those schemes can bear closer examination. According to Senator Carrick, the school to work transition scheme, when it was introduced into this place, was to help young people who leave school every year with poor unemployment prospects. The bulk of the $22m in Commonwealth grants announced by the Minister for Education, Mr Fife, on 16 February last year is going to the education system as a topping-up of schemes already existing in schools. Curriculum development, teaching resources, career information services, link courses and evaluation, for which provisions have not been made in State Budgets, have been given the go-ahead. They are commendable and they are as valid in the school context as other educational subjects, but they have nothing to do with the provision of work. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last few years other payments have been devised which come under the heading of youth employment schemes, but as Mr Dixon, whom I quoted earlier, and others have pointed out, the numbers concerned in individual schemes are frequently small and some of the schemes are of short duration. The same percentage of gross domestic product-about 0.47 per cent-is being spent on all the schemes as was being spent in 1977, though unemployment is higher. Under the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training scheme there has been hardly any increase in the number of apprenticeships on an annual basis for the past three years. Fewer apprentices are now in training than in 1976 and 1977. Since 1977-78 there has been a drop in real terms in the Budget allocation for the Special Youth Employment Training Program, and the program itself represents a direct subsidy to the employer while he takes on a young person for what may or may not be training. There are no guarantees that those young people will receive work at the end of the training period, but it takes them off the unemployment list for some time; and in the Government's eyes that is a useful exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Education Program for Unemployed Youth, funds for which are now incorporated in the school to work transition allocation, is a worthy program but is small. The courses last for between six weeks and six months and have so far helped fewer than 5,000 people a year. The latest figures on teenage unemployment show 146,000 without work. A few weeks of EPUY training for 5,000 of them makes very little dent on the problem, while there are 149,000, or 29 in every 30 of those unemployed, for whom it appears to be irrelevant. The young participants in the Community Youth Support Scheme, like those undertaking EPUY training, remain in the registered unemployed tally, but the CYSS allocation has been cut in real terms recently, by 10 per cent in the last two years, and the numbers are down by some 23 per cent. This scheme will always have problems until its guidelines are re-evaluated and until we have a proper evaluation of the effectiveness of the whole scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that self-help programs are forbidden unless they conform exactly to the Government's determination to prove that there is no youth unemployment problem. The Government persists in being very reluctant to allow youth unemployment organisations operating under such schemes as CYSS to take positive initiatives or to receive any assistance to set up such programs. We have received continual complaints of the battle between the New South Wales Government and the present Federal Government to make funds available for those sorts of schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Repeated studies which one cannot go into in any detail now, have examined the problems associated with the size of youth unemployment and the social problems which result from it-the problems of increased drug taking, homelessness, increased alcoholism and petty and even major crime. Yet the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs admitted that the Government does not even monitor the social consequences of youth unemployment. It does not monitor the health problems of youth unemployment, the evidence of drug taking and the suicide levels within this group. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, in answer to a question by me, stated that the findings of people who make such reports are generally inconclusive. It seems to us that the Government is in fact unwilling to look carefully at the problem, to find out the truth, to look at the documentation of people who have looked at the problem or to make its own investigations. It is unwilling to look at the problem in a reasonable way so that we can have a proper manpower planning program for young unemployed persons. We raise this problem because it exists and because we are fearful that the Government, in its efforts to cut expenditure and to maintain its own firm ideological one-sidedness which it has had for some time, will take an unwise step such as removing the unemployment benefit from the 16 and 17-year olds, and therefore will throw a great burden not only on these young people but also on their families. We are fearful that the Government is taking a half-hearted approach to the youth employment and training programs which exist. We are fearful that the Government, as always, will try to push this problem under the mat--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I take part in this discussion of the matter of public importance, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The threat to the unemployment payments for the under-18 unemployed, and the failure of the Government to provide comprehensive youth employment and youth support policies. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that we enter into this discussion in a constructive manner. There could be nobody in this community who is not aware of the problems of unemployment and there surely would be no Australian who wants to see Australia advance-even if it were possible-with discontented and unemployed youth because the youth of this country will be the adults of the future. There can be no question that this Government would not be as greatly and sincerely concerned as any other association or government with the problems of unemployment in general and, particularly, youth unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Grimes, who has just spoken for the Opposition, mentioned that there was a tendency by the Government to blame 16 and 17-year olds for their plight. That is a totally ridiculous statement. Of course they are not to be blamed for their plight, but the determination of the Government, rather than to blame them, is to identify the causes of that plight and to seek solutions to it. I hope in the few minutes at my disposal to indicate that we are sincerely concerned with the identification and solution of the problems of the unemployed, and particularly of unemployed youth. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Grimes went on to mention that 30 per cent of the unemployed are in fact 20 years of age or under. That is indeed a sad circumstance but it is not as he appeared to portray it. It is not a totally unusual situation. Of course, the younger people are the ones who, consistently throughout history, are faced with unemployment problems because they are in that extraordinarily important transition stage. Having admitted that, it is our duty to find ways of overcoming those problems. Senator Grimes mentioned that people from rural areas were forced to go the the cities to find work. That occurs from time to time but I have observed that people from rural areas who seek work in metropolitan areas seem to find work very rapidly. I am not certain whether that is related to their determination to get a job but it certainly is a fact that they find work available in most of the cities around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Lack of work, Senator Grimes said, is the root of the problem. That is a very simplistic statement. Indeed, no one could disagree that lack of work is related to unemployment, but we in the Government believe that the ultimate long term answer to unemployment problems lies in the solution of the economic problems which confront this country. It is the solution of the socio-economic problems across the board that has concerned us so greatly. A little later I may have time to identify some of the efforts and some of the results of Government policy in this area. Of course, the economy holds the ultimate solution to the problem of unemployment in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment exists in Australia. Let me state briefly why that is so. It exists for two basic reasons. One reason is that it is a legacy which this Government has received. Without trying to identify the root causes of that legacy, let us remind ourselves that in 1975 when this Government came to office the unemployment level was in excess of 5 per cent. In 1972, when the Liberal and Country parties lost office, the unemployment level was 1.2 per cent. The legacy of unemployment had to be countered and controlled. The second reason is that employment was and has continued to be a world-wide problem. What is this unemployment due to? I suggest, because of the shortness of time available, just a couple of, in my view, obvious causes. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first place it was significantly due in a real sense to the wages explosion which was unaccompanied by any sort of massive or real productivity increase in the early and middle years of the decade of the 1970s. As a corollary of the wages explosion we saw a surge into the technological age. The development of the computer age in Australia, I believe, was accelerated by the wages explosion. The advance of sophisticated technology into our economy at a time when we were not fully and totally prepared to absorb it was one of the most significant causes of the unemployment problem which confronts Australians today. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, there is surely a real challenge to the Australian Government, and indeed to the Australian people. The first challenge is that we must take a measure of real responsibility in wage levels. The Australian trade unions, which have played a mighty fine part in the history of this country in many fields over many decades, have insisted totally in recent years on continuing wage rises without reference to productivity, to the capacity of an economy to pay and, I believe, to the need for younger people to move quickly into employment. Consequently we will have to observe in the future a real measure of restraint in the wage system so that amongst other things youth unemployed will have a greater opportunity to find a niche in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Another challenge that comes from the unemployment situation, a challenge that is well recognised-I believe the history of the Government's effort in the field of youth unemployment in particular is evidence of its understanding of this problem-is the problem of education. We have to fit an educational system to deliver people with the sorts of skills that our technological age requires. There are many important ways of attacking this problem. They are the constant concern of this Government, but it is not a situation, as anyone who thinks about it for a moment or two will realise, that can be solved overnight or indeed in less than a period of years. There is an enormous need to encourage a longer and more appropriate educational procedure. That is the very basis of the review that the Government is carrying out referable to young Australians between 16 and 18 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Among other deliberations that will come from this review will be the determination of a method of adapting the educational system to the requirements of the economy in which we find ourselves including the way of life or the social circumstances of all Australians. I often wonder how this sort of thing can be achieved. It may well be that our schools today should be looking at the last two or three years of education as a period that should be devoted more specifically to students identifying themselves with certain trades because it is clear that in this community we need skilled tradesmen across a whole range of areas. It may well be that two or three years of schooling in trades, for argument's sake, such as plumbing, electrical, carpentery, bricklaying or whatever and young people leaving school at the age of 17 or 18 years should go on to the technical and further educational institutions and after three, four or five years there become qualified tradesmen ready to take their place in the community. That might be a more simple and more direct method. It would be a method related to those that are applied virtually to all the professions which are taught at university level where one having completed his learning over the prescribed number of years comes out capable and ready to become a teacher, a doctor, an engineer, a dentist or whatever. It may well be that such a change to the educational system would make a significant contribution not only to the employment of young people but also to the productivity of the Australian people as a whole. Advantages are also to be gained from young people remaining somewhat longer at school than they normally do. A longer period at school does permit a greater measure of maturity and, many people think a greater measure of concentration and we should look at that suggestion only from that point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> I will mention only one or two sets of statistics because I think this sort of debate is concerned not so much with statistics as it is with the values that community holds, a real analysis of the causes of unemployment and the directions we must take to find the solutions. Total unemployment in Australia fell in the year to January 1981 by 7,400 people or 1.7 per cent of the work force. The full time unemployment rate in January 1981 was 5.7 per cent compared with 5.8 per cent one year earlier. I think it is also significant, relevant to this discussion, that the largest fall in full time unemployment rates over the last 12 months occurred in the teenage category-the 15 to 19-years-olds-where the drop was 1.4 per cent. I am not suggesting that we should throw our hats in the air and say hooray about those figures, but they do indicate that not only is there a real concern on the part of the Government in those areas of unemployment in particular but also it is achieving a measure of success. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me look very quickly at some of the programs and the progress made in them in the last 12 months. Two hundred and sixty thousand are to be assisted under the Commonwealth Government's manpower training and youth support programs for 1980-81 which is an increase of 40,000 people or 18 per cent more than in the previous year, 1979-80. The money allocated to the employment and youth affairs budget for the current year is $33m more than it was for the previous year. It now stands at the sum of $246m. The main reason for this increased expenditure and the increased number of people who will benefit is the added emphasis in the number of government schemes such as the National Employment and Training System, known as the NEAT Scheme, and the Special Youth Employment and Training Program, known as SYETP. This year some 75,000 people are being helped under SYETP. This scheme helps employers to take on and train young people who have difficulty in finding stable jobs because of a lack of experience or qualifications. From 1 February this year subsidies of up to $80 a week are available from employers of young people unemployed for eight out of 12 months. These young people would be in a serious position. This subsidy of $80 a week is available for 17 weeks and for a further 17 weeks a subsidy of $55 a week is available; a total of 34 weeks. This is a very significant contribution to the solution of unemployment in that category. Assistance available under the School to Work Transition Program has been raised to the unemployment benefit plus $6. The Education Program for Unemployed Youth will help some 13,500 young people this year to improve their employability prospects. The Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training Scheme, known as the CRAFT scheme, will involve no fewer than 80,000 young people in 1980-81 while an additional 50,000 will be assisted through the Community Youth Support Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I do not want to continue with a whole heap of statistics, but let me draw my remarks to a conclusion with one or two points that occur to me as being important. I do not want to see this unemployment situation, particularly as it refers to youth, become some sort of a political football. It is not something to be kicked around the place in an attempt to get some sort of emotional attraction from certain areas of the community. It is something to be recognised as a national problem which we all have an absolute responsibility to identify and to solve. We must come to grips with the problem. The solutions we are finding as time goes by are not the be-all and end-all but a continuing contribution. There is no straight-out stark threat to deny unemployment benefits to the teenagers in this country. The Government's determination is identified by the establishment of a committee by the Minister to review the circumstances pertaining to that group of people. It will determine in fact whether unemployment benefit is a disincentive to some people or is an opportunity, as it were, for them to get away from parental or teacher control. These matters will be examined with a view to overcoming the problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the economy holds the long term solution to the unemployment problem. The inflation rate is down to 9.2 per cent, the third lowest in the Western World. The growth rate in 1981 is up from 3 per cent or 4 per cent to 4 1/2 per cent. The resources boom offers exciting prospects. Finally, we must observe the problems and seek solutions, something which we are indeed doing with a real measure of success. There is responsibility on both sides. By generating pride and enthusiasm this country will overcome the problems that confront it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance submitted for discussion by my colleague Senator Don Grimes reads as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The threat to the unemployment payments for the under-18 unemployed, and the failure of the Government to provide comprehensive youth employment and youth support policies. </PARA>
<PARA>As the matter deals with unemployed youth I intend to outline, with reference to the State that I represent, the extent of the problem. The most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics figures released relate to unemployment in February this year. These figures were issued on 13 March. They indicated that in Queensland 15.5 per cent of those people aged 15 years to 19 years are unemployed. This is about two and a half times as high as the overall rate of unemployment in Queensland. I hold that the overall rate of unemployment for Queensland is totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that we have 15.5 per cent unemployment in Queensland for the age group 15 years to 19 years sometimes looks a little reasonable when compared with the figures for other States. Although Queensland has an unemployment rate above the national average the figures for this age group compare favourably with those of other States. Can one really say that to have 15.5 per cent of people within a particular age group unemployed is a favourable situation? I do believe not. I believe that it is unacceptable. What it really means is that many young people go to school for 10 or 12 years enthusiastic that when they leave school they will join the work force and take their rightful place in society, only to find when they leave school their prospects of entering that work force are extremely limited. </PARA>
<PARA> When I look at the figures for unemployed youth in Queensland and other States I am amazed that the figures evoke so little action. At this stage I would like to mention that the previous speaker, Senator Scott, suggested that the current unemployment levels were a legacy of the previous Government. He did not mention that Mr Fraser made a pledge in 1975 to provide jobs for all who wanted to work. Over five years have gone by and the unemployment figures, if anything, have increased. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred to the unemployment figures for juniors in the State I represent. I will indicate how bad the employment situation is in three of the 24 employment districts in Queensland. The latest Commonwealth Employment Service figures show that in the Rockhampton employment district 45 juniors were chasing every job listed as vacant by the Commonwealth Employment Service. In the Atherton employment district, in the northern part of my State, for every job listed as vacant for juniors 46 people were looking for a job. In the Maryborough employment district the position was even worse, fifty three juniors were chasing every job listed as vacant. </PARA>
<PARA> What do these people have to look forward to while they are waiting for a job to come along? We all know it has been nearly six years since there was an increase in the level of unemployment benefit for this age group. These people have to exist on $36 a week. The young unemployed have found it increasingly difficult to survive on $36 a week. However, the suggestion has been floated recently that it would not be a bad idea to cut out the unemployment benefit altogether for this group. What a novel situation this is; what a novel solution this is. If there were no unemployment benefit then there would be no arguments as to whether its level was appropriate or not. It is of no concern that these young people have to clothe themselves well in order to present themselves in the best possible light when they appear before a prospective employer. Apparently there is no concern that these young people have to find money for fares and telephone calls as they search for work. They need some unemployment benefit to be able to get out and seek work-work which is scarce and difficult for them to find. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the reason given for suggesting that perhaps unemployment benefit for this age group should be discontinued? The suggestion was that unemployment benefits may act as a disincentive for people to continue formal education or training or to seeking work. As my colleague Senator Grimes said, what young person in his or her right mind would opt to go on unemployment benefit at $36 a week when he or she could earn three times that amount if he or she gets a job. In relation to the argument that it might be a disincentive to get work I hear thousands of young people saying: 'What work?' How right they are. Most young people receiving unemployment benefit are unemployed because there are not enough jobs for them, not because they are stupid or lazy and not because the education system has failed them. There are simply not enough jobs. What the Government needs to do is to provide the stimulation which will create more jobs. If it simply drives youngsters back to school or retains them longer than it normally would the main effect will be to disguise the extent of unemployment in Australia and to produce a better educated and better qualified class of jobless young people. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to address my remarks to the second half of the matter of public importance raised by Senator Grimes. It concerns the failure of the Government to provide comprehensive youth employment and youth support policies. What programs are available in Australia at the moment? There are five major manpower programs. Only one of these really creates work. I am not being critical of these schemes themselves but I am critical of the lack of emphasis of work creation programs. The National Employment and Training System, or NEAT, as we often call it, concentrates on helping disadvantaged members of the work force to gain training and employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps that is a commendable aim, but it is not directed specifically at young people and it will not help young people get jobs. The Special Youth Employment Training Program is another program for young people. It pays a subsidy to employers to take on young people who have fulfilled certain conditions-they have to have been unemployed for a certain period- but there is no guarantee of permanent employment for these people. </PARA>
<PARA> Too often people have come to me and said that they have been taken on for a period under the Special Youth Employment Training Program, but at the end of their contract with the employer they are out of work. They are again seeking work and are back in the position they were in four months previously. This program may help for a certain period, it may give people some confidence for the little while that they are in work, but we do not have any real program to keep them in work once they have undertaken such a scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Another scheme I wish to deal with is the Community Youth Support Scheme. One cannot say that that scheme helps young people to get jobs. It provides activities to keep unemployed youth occupied while they are looking for a job. That in itself is commendable, but it does not create the jobs we want for young people in Australia. The Education Program for Unemployed Youth, or EPUY, helps to provide some skills, but it does not create work. This program has directed itself mainly to providing literacy and numeracy skills for those who find it difficult to obtain work because of the lack of those skills. Again, within this framework, such a scheme does have some commendable aspects, but can we really expect that in six months or so we can provide young people with the necessary skills to go out into the work force if they have not developed those skills in 10 years at school? The real problem is that when these people go out looking for jobs, the jobs are not there. I refer now to the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training scheme, or CRAFT. I like the concept of this scheme. It could be quite useful in helping to provide jobs for youth. However, when we look at the number of apprentices in training at the moment, we find that there are fewer than there were three years ago. Something is wrong if CRAFT, whose aim is to provide apprenticeship opportunities, is not giving us the apprentices we need and if the number of apprentices in training is declining. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, prior to the election campaign, the Australian Labor Party proposed a positive program to get young people working. We outlined a proposal for a community service corps which each year would create 50,000 jobs at the junior level. We outlined an apprenticeship scheme which would boost the apprentice intake by 20,000 a year. We also looked at the prospect of using the private sector to provide employment and training for young people. During that election campaign we outlined what we called a private sector employment and training scheme which would replace SYETP and employ 30,000 people in a full year. There is no reason why a resource-rich nation such as Australia cannot provide jobs for all young people. </PARA>
<PARA> I spoke last evening to a person who is not associated with this Parliament or with any particular political party. He put it to me that there are probably hundreds of thousands of jobs available in Australia for young people, and if we look around we will see that he is probably correct. He said: 'Why can we not put those people to work? Why do we have to be hidebound by a monetary policy that will prevent young people from entering occupations and taking up jobs just because the money is not available. Of all the resources we have in Australia, the monetary supply is probably the only man-made one, the only one we try to regulate, and at the moment we are regulating it in an inefficient way. He is probably correct. As I said, this person is not associated with a political party. He is not an economist or a person who usually looks at this area, but he is as concerned as I am about the lack of jobs for young people in Australia. He could see that if we used our initiative we might be able to ensure that those hundreds of thousands of jobs were available for young people. We should not, by doing nothing, create a system which breeds a generation of urban desperadoes. We must make sure that jobs are available for young people, and show them that we care about their future and are anxious that they take their rightful place in society. </PARA>

<PARA>We have not had that attitude in the debate in this chamber today. We have been told that the Labor Party did not create unemployment. Let me refer to its record. In 1974 we were told by the Labor Party, which was then in Government, that there was overemployment, to use the exact words, and it decided to do something about that situation. It was advised that its across the board tariff cuts would create unemployment, but it said: 'No worries. We have got overemployment!' The Labor Government fixed that situation in one year. </PARA>

They created a problem that is now a legacy from the Government that we succeeded? When this Government came to office in 1975 Australia had an unemployment rate of 5.2 per cent. The latest month's figure available is 6.3 per cent. That is the lowest figure for that month we have seen for three years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator said that the Government wrecked it. I have before me a statement made by the then Senator James McClelland. He said: 'No more money is to be given to the RED Scheme. It has to be phased out'. That was in 1975. Before this Government came to office Senator James McClelland said that the RED Scheme had to be phased out, yet the Labor Party is still trying to put across that we abandoned the RED Scheme. Never at any stage did this Government abandon the RED Scheme. The previous Labor Government introduced it and it abandoned it in 1975 before we came to office. Senator James McClelland stated that it was to be abandoned. That was the Labor Party's answer to the unemployment problem that it created in one year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is this Government's answer to the problem? I will come to that in a few moments. We have decided against introducing any band-aid system such as the RED Scheme. We have gone for permanent employment. Let us look at the employment figures obtained by the Bureau of Statistics in its labour force surveys. This Government was elected in December 1975. In August 1975, when the Labor Party was in power, employment dropped by 0.2 per cent in comparison with the previous 12 months. That was the legacy with which we were left when we came to office a couple of months later. Let us look at the figures for August 1980. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will tell Senator Gietzelt what we have done about it. In August last year, instead of a decrease in employment of 0.2 per cent, there was an increase of 3.4 per cent. Let us look at the figures. In August 1975, just before this Government came to office, employment fell by 0.2 per cent and last year there was an increase of 3.4 per cent. I do not think Senator Gietzelt should ask who created the situation. He knows darn well who created it. We have now achieved the best increase in employment that has occurred since 1970, or-I do not know the relevant figures-certainly before the Labor Government came to power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By January 1981 total teenage employment had grown by 23,300-an increase of 3.4 per cent. Total teenage unemployment fell by 5,900-a decrease of 3.4 per cent. So the teenage employment problem is gradually being coped with. There is not a simple answer. I could quote many sources. I shall pick just a few. Professor Peter Karmel said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there are other factors which have conspired against job opportunities for the young. These include the high level of juvenile wage rates compared to adult rates, the level of--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quoting Professor Karmel, who is the Chairman of the Tertiary Education Commission. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . a significant number of young workers partly through lack of skills and partly through attitudes to work, the increasing participation of women in the workforce, the high level of costs of on-the-job training for young workers, and the changing job structure whereby the proportion of unskilled and semi-skilled jobs has been steadily falling. These structural factors all make employers less willing to employ young and inexperienced workers. </PARA>
<PARA>Many people point to the same thing-the level of the junior wage. The Myers report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The inescapable fact is that the principle of equal pay, together with a decreasing gap between the award wages of adults and juniors, results in a strong preference by employers for people with work experience. While this condition and high unemployment continue to exist, intending new entrants to the workforce will continue to be a large proportion of the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>All these people are saying the same thing. The Schools Commission blames the schools to a large extent. In its report 'Schooling for 15 and 16-year olds' in November 1980, it states:</PARA>
<PARA> Secondary schools seem preoccupied with preparation for tertiary study, a future for only 15 per cent of students--</PARA>
<PARA>Only 15 per cent will be able to use that preparation. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Many students, a substantial minority, think they are unsuited to schools and leave early or passively endure their sentences. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a complicated matter. As a mother, I would not like my child to go on unemployment benefit. I would much prefer my child to get some additional education that will benefit him and make him more acceptable to an employer. The Opposition tells us so frequently that the system followed in Sweden is the answer to a socialist country's prayers, that Sweden has the answer to all the problems of socialism. An article in the Times educational supplement states:</PARA>
<PARA> New legislation in Sweden has placed the responsibility for all under-18's, whether they are in school or not, firmly in the hands of the school system. If a young person doesn't find a job he shouldn't be considered unemployed, but be seen as a pupil. An education that fits his needs must be designed for him. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what this Government is all about. Yet the Opposition says that Sweden is wrong. For the first time, that I can recall, it says that Sweden is wrong. It usually tells us how good Sweden is, but it does not like this aspect so it is ignoring it. This Government has said to the mothers and fathers of this country: 'If your 15, 16 and 17-year old children cannot get a job upon leaving school, the Government is prepared to re-educate them to make sure-as is the case in Sweden-that an education that fits his needs is designed for him'. The Opposition has misinterpreted the whole scheme. It has said purely that the Government is wanting to save money and that the Government is trying to cut down the employment benefit for the under 18-year-olds. The Government is prepared to spend additional money on training and educating these people so that-as Sweden advocates-they will receive education to fit their needs. </PARA>
<PARA>Members of the Opposition are saying to the young unemployed: 'Look, if you are at technical college or somewhere like that, look at your mates. They are getting money in their hands. You are learning and being educated, but you do not have money in your hand at the moment. You should think of the short term; do not think of the long term. Do not think that when you have this extra training you may be fit for a job. Just think of the moment'. I have had young boys come to me and say: 'You know, I am thinking twice about the technical college course I am doing. I am at college and I am studying. I know Joe, Jim and Bill and they have money in their hands. They have their $36 a week and they can go and enjoy themselves while their parents support them'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a temptation for those young people to go away from the education system and accept unemployment benefit. This Government realises that that is a temptation and I am ashamed to say that the Opposition is encouraging that thought amongst the young. I am disgusted that the Opposition is encouraging the young to think of the present moment, the $36 they could have in their hands, and not their future and the fact that they should have that additional education to fit them for their life and the career ahead of them. That is a summary of the supposed matter of public importance brought before this chamber today. The Opposition has deliberately misinterpreted the subject. Not one member of the Opposition has mentioned what the introduction of a 35-hour week would do. Not one of them has mentioned how that and strikes will effect unemployment. I move:</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I have so moved today because the procedure is that only papers presented by Ministers are put on the list which is circulated to the honourable senators and, as this report was one to the Parliament, it did not appear on the list on Tuesday. Thus it slipped us by. It is an important report, as are all Auditor-General's reports. It gives us one of the few opportunities we have in this place to note outside assessments of the administration of many departments. It is a pity in many ways that this report and the major Auditor-General's report each year come into the Parliament without warning to anyone in the Opposition and almost without warning to people in the Government as to its contents so that a proper debate cannot be conducted at the time. The annual reports of most departments-I suppose like the annual reports of most companies-understandably tend to be self-congratulatory. Therefore, it is important that we have a report such as this issued to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The report, as usual, deals with the finding of financial deficiencies in various departments. This report looks at not only financial deficiencies but also the suitability of and the adherence to the various financial practices of the programs which it surveyed. The report actually tries to evaluate the programs in terms of their goals as well as their financial accountability. Again, this is an important aspect and something that we do far too little of in this Parliament. Therefore, I believe it is worthwhile generating a parliamentary discussion on this report. </PARA>
<PARA> For instance, the Auditor-General looks at the Community Youth Support Scheme-CYSS. The audit detailed in this report was done to see whether the practice was in line with the guidelines, financial regularity and legal compliance necessary under the legislation which set up the scheme. Of course, in any scheme run by people with a concern for unemployed youth there will not be a complete understanding of the reasons for all the rules. It seems that in all schemes such as this there will invariably be deficiencies in meeting the accountng and reporting demands of government. In reply to criticisms in the report-that reports on final projects have not always been submitted, that there has been a publicity budget overrun, inadequate monitoring of insurance cover and other matters-the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs has reassured the Auditor-General that everything is now under control. So I found the most interesting the comments from the Auditor-General on this section which stated that the action taken by the Department was an improvement. However the report continued:</PARA>
<PARA> No evidence could be found at a regional office level . . . that criteria had been established for evaluating the effectiveness of programs in meeting the principal objectives of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>I think this is a criticism of CYSS which has been made by many people in this Parliament and by many people who are involved in projects. It is important that a comment such as that has come from the Auditor-General. It may be that too much detailed administration work is required of people working in programs such as CYSS while the effectiveness and the applicability of the program to the goals which are established for that program are ignored. Maybe in a proper evaluation we should have more concern spent on the establishment of proper goals and on the evaluation of the body's ability to meet those goals rather than on the great detail we require on an administrative level. </PARA>
<PARA> I think one of the most interesting sections of the report is that which deals with the Department of Health. The first section worth looking at in the part of the report dealing with the Department of Health is that section which refers to the collapse of a registered Tasmanian health insurance fund, namely, the Druids Hospital and Medical Benefits Fund, and the implications for other collapsed or potentially collapsing funds. In the Senate Estimates committee which met at the time of the collapse and in later debate in this place we noted the problems which faced the Department in trying to monitor what was happening to a fund. I think it is worth while looking at what the Auditor-General had to say about this matter. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department's comments were sought on the adequacy of procedures following the collapse of a registered fund in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department's Central Office advised that in monitoring the financial activities of medical and hospital benefits organisations it is heavily dependent upon the organisations providing timely information in a proper form. Only then is the Department able to make considered judgments regarding their solvency. In the particular case and despite considerable efforts, the organisation did not respond appropriately to requests by the Department for the provision of information and to the acceptance of advice offered. This attitude contrasts with that of other organisations. In addition the Department has recently instituted a more intensive monitoring program aimed at the early detection of organisations facing financial difficulties. A circular had been issued to all organisations advising of a more intensive program of reviews of the operation of funds and seeking their co-operation. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me-I am sure it seems to others who are involved in this unfortunate episode-that we are still in the situation where the Department is largely dependent on information from the funds to let it know how the funds are going. If an organisation such as Druids or a similar organisation in another State is unwilling to give proper information or, in fact, gives false information, it seems very likely that the Department would have no way of checking the information. We also have the problem of what the Government can do and what the Department can do when an organisation produces information which suggests that it might be in trouble. This is a dilemma which was faced and to which the Department addressed itself at the Estimates committee. From this report it seems that again the Department will be in that dilemma. If an organisation is going bad, does the Department warn the public? Does it warn the contributors and, therefore, be likely to cause a run on the fund? Whatever happens we have the situation that funds are in existence and are allowed to operate only when they are registered by the Commonwealth Department of Health. The responsibility is the Commonwealth Government's and we must ensure, I believe, that in future collapses of funds such as this do not hurt many people as, in fact, the collapse of this fund did the year before last. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am speaking to the motion that I moved to take note of the Auditor-General's report on audits, examinations and inspections. I have pointed out that the report is useful in that it refers not only to the financial requirements of departments and various programs of government but also to the need to evaluate those programs in terms of their goals. I think it is important that the Senate take careful note of the report. I think it is significant that the Auditor-General, who is charged with looking at the financial responsibility of departments and programs, should have drawn our attention to the matters set out in his report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to refer to two other short matters. One is that part of the report which deals with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the other is the section which deals with the lack of co-ordination which appears to have existed between the Department of Health and the Department of Social Security for some time. The report points out that the required cyclical examination of participating chemists' claims in Western Australia was not carried out. The reason given was staff ceilings. Given the high expenditure-more than $200m-on pharmaceutical benefits in this country, surely it is poor economy not to have experienced staff to watch these claims and not to have regular and proper reviews. In the same section the Auditor-General points out the other unsatisfactory features. The report states that as a result of a High Court challenge medical practitioners are not obliged to use the uniquely numbered prescription forms which do nothing more than facilitate the computer check of prescribing habits of doctors. We should examine the matter and see whether we can improve the efficiency of looking at one section of a department which expends some $200m of public funds each year. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter I wish to talk about is the apparent lack of co-ordination over many years between the Department of Health and Department of Social Security. The report contains several references to this sort of problem. One such reference reads:</PARA>
<PARA> A common feature noted during audits of pharmaceutical benefits and of bulk-billing arrangements under the Commonwealth Medical Benefits scheme has been the fact that an appropriate system has not been implemented to validate the pensioner health benefit numbers quoted on pharmaceutical benefit and Commonwealth medical benefits bulk-billing claims. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>This office has been aware for some time of representations by the Department of Health to the Department of Social Security on the need for a system to enable the Department of Health to check the validity of pensioner health benefit numbers quoted on claims lodged under the two schemes. The confidentiality of Department of Social Security records had evidently made it difficult to introduce an effective system of checking. </PARA>
<PARA>We have no real effective method to check the validity of the claims and prescriptions made under a system providing for the expenditure of large sums of public money. No one would want to see the confidentiality of the records of the Department of Social Security being attacked in any way but, by the same token, we must have accountability for the public funds spent by this Department in such volumes. The Auditor-General, as he has in previous years, requests that such a sensible system be developed and expresses concern at the lack of such a system in view of the expenditure involved. One can only echo the words of the Auditor-General when he expresses concern in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that honourable senators who are interested in the various departments and who have their own pet interests in these matters should take a close look at the references throughout this important report and seek to improve the efficiency of departments and the scrutiny that we have over them. I believe that the Government should consider having a proper debate on the report when we have had time to review the words of the Auditor-General in what is a relatively thin volume. The Auditor-General's Office is very important. It is important in that it assists us to ensure that public funds are spent efficiently and effectively. It assists us to establish whether government programs have been evaluated properly and proper goals set, an aspect of planning which a report of a Senate standing committee made much of a couple of years ago. In the hope that the Government will bring on a further debate on this important report, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Freedom of Information Bill is well known. It is described in clause 3 of the Bill as being to extend the right of the Australian community to access to official information in the possession of the Government of the Commonwealth. The Bill seeks to achieve this in two ways: firstly, by making available to the public information about the operations of departments and public authorities and, in particular, ensuring that the rules and practices affecting members of the public in their dealings with those departments and public authorities are readily available to those who are affected by those rules and practices; secondly, the Bill creates a general right of access to official information in documentary form in the possession of Ministers, departments and public authorities. This general right of access must, of course, be limited. The limitations are required for the protection of essential public interests, for the protection of the private and business affairs of persons in respect of whom information is collected and held by departments and public authorities, and for the proper conduct of public business by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will, of course, be familiar with the background of this Bill. I introduced a freedom of information Bill into the Senate on 9 June 1978. That Bill was subsequently referred by the Senate to the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. The Committee reported in November 1979, and last September I made a statement in the Senate setting out the Government's response to the recommendations made by the Committee both for changes in the Bill as introduced in 1978 and for a number of matters connected with the administration of the legislation. The present Bill has been drafted to give effect to the changes in the 1978 Bill which were described in my statement of last September. The Bill also incorporates some additional changes to the 1978 Bill which are designed to improve and clarify a number of provisions of that Bill. As well as the customary explanatory memorandum, a 'black-type' memorandum showing the differences between the Freedom of Information Bill 1978 and the Freedom of Information Bill 1981 will be distributed. </PARA>
<PARA> In introducing the 1978 Bill, I referred to the fact that the initiative taken by the Government in bringing forward the Bill was the first such initiative by a 'Westminster style' government. Since then, there has been considerable interest in the topic of freedom of information in countries which share that tradition. Two freedom of information Bills have been introduced into the Canadian Parliament. The first, which was introduced in 1979 by the then Canadian Government, lapsed when that Government was defeated. The second was introduced last year by the present Canadian Government. It has passed its second reading in the Canadian House of Commons and has been referred to a parliamentary committee for consideration. Two private members' Bills for freedom of information have been introduced into the United Kingdom Parliament. In New Zealand, the report of a committee established by the New Zealand Government to consider the question of freedom of information has now been published. </PARA>
<PARA> Each of the proposals I have mentioned has incorporated the same basic approach as is in the present Bill. There are, however, a number of differences in detail. The proposals in each country must be considered in the context in which they are intended to operate. Thus, the present Bill must be viewed in the context of the systems of administrative review which have already been established by this Parliament; namely, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and the Federal Court of Australia operating under the powers conferred on it by the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. In addition, there are differences in the nature of the parliamentary institutions in each country, which affect the relationships between Ministers and the Parliament. In particular I draw attention to the practice of both Houses in this Parliament with regard to questions without notice. Thus what is appropriate, or may be appropriate, for one country is not necessarily appropriate for another. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me to the contentious issue of the right of appeal against decisions to refuse access to documents. The Bill maintains the approach of the 1978 Bill that there should be no review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of a decision of a Minister or Permanent Head to withhold documents on certain grounds. The grounds are those which affect the most sensitive areas of government, namely, defence, security, international relations, and Commonwealth-State relations. These are all vital national interests where the improper disclosure of sensitive information can do a great deal of harm. The Bill provides also, as did the 1978 Bill, that a certificate by the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet or the Secretary to the Federal Executive Council is conclusive evidence that a document is a Cabinet document or an Executive Council document, as the case may be, and is therefore exempt from disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA> Likewise, the Bill provides that a decision to refuse access to an internal working document on the ground that disclosure of the document would be contrary to the public interest is not subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The category of internal working documents includes confidential communications between Ministers, between Ministers and officials, and between officials on matters of government policy. In respect of all of these matters, the Government does not consider that review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which is empowered to substitute its own view of what the correct or preferable decision should be, is an appropriate form of review. The Government remains firmly of the opinion that the final decision on the substantive issues should remain with Ministers and with officials responsible to Ministers. Where a decision is taken by a Minister, or by an official who is responsible to him, the Minister is answerable in the Parliament for that decision and can be questioned on it in the forum. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the question of access to documents which are already in the possession of agencies at the time the Bill comes into force. As I explained in the statement last September, the Government has maintained the view that the Bill should not give a general right of access to prior documents and that it should not include a firm commitment to do so after a certain time has elapsed. The extent of the demand which the legislation will make upon departmental resources is not predictable and the Government therefore believes that it is wise to adopt a cautious approach until there has been some experience of the operation of the legislation. The Government has given an undertaking that it will consider this matter again during the first major review of the legislation, which it sees as appropriate after the legislation has been in force for about three years. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1978 Bill provided that agencies might be exempt from its operation by means of regulations. Clause 6 of the present Bill, and the Schedule to the Bill, will have the effect that certain agencies are exempted by the Bill itself from its scope either wholly or as to specified functions. The Schedule is in two parts. The first part of the Schedule specifies those agencies which are totally exempt, that is, the freedom of information legislation does not apply to them at all. Part II of the Schedule lists those agencies which are exempt in respect of certain functions. The effect is that a request may not be made under the legislation for access to a document which relates to a function in respect of which an agency is exempt. </PARA>
<PARA> The intelligence agencies are to be exempt. Those that are separate bodies are listed in Part I of the Schedule. These are the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Office of National Assessments. Those which are part of the Department of Defence are listed in Part II of the Schedule, namely, the Defence Signals Directorate and the Joint Intelligence Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Also included in Part I of the Schedule are a number of government agencies which are engaged in commercial enterprises. In addition, the Part includes a number of agencies which are there for special reasons-the Aboriginal land councils and land trusts, the Auditor-General's Office, the National Debt Commission and the National Labour Consultative Council. The greater number of agencies to be exempt in respect of particular documents under Part II of the Schedule are agencies which carry on competitive commercial activities as part of their functions. In addition, the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the Special Broadcasting Service are to be exempt in respect of program material. The Reserve Bank is to be exempt in respect of its banking functions and its exchange control functions. </PARA>
<PARA> The inclusion of the Schedule in the Bill represents the present view of the Government as to what agencies should be exempt, either wholly or as to certain functions. To take account of the creation of new agencies, or changes in circumstances as a result of experience under the legislation, clause 6 of the Bill continues to provide that further exemptions may be made by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> Particular attention has been given in the redrafting of the Bill to the question of protecting confidential commercial information from disclosure. A number of private sector organisations have expressed concern to the Senate Committee at the possibility of disclosure of information of a commercial character which has been supplied to government. Ministers have given assurances that such information supplied by private sector organisations would not be subject to disclosure under the freedom of information legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two relevant changes in the present Bill, compared with the 1978 Bill. First, as recommended by the Senate Committee, provision is made for consultation with the supplier of information before a decision is made on a request for access to a document which contains commercial information. The supplier is to be given a right to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against a decision that the document is not an exempt document on the ground that it contains confidential commercial information. Secondly, the relevant clause of the Bill-clause 38-has been substantially redrafted to ensure that it does provide adequate protection for information of a confidential commercial character. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the clauses of the Bill defining exempt documents have been redrafted, in some cases to give effect to recommendations of the Senate Committee and in other cases after considering comments by the Senate Committee. The Government has not, however, deleted any of the clauses which were contained in the 1978 Bill. These clauses will no doubt be considered in detail during the Committee stage of the debate and the nature of the changes which have been made can then be explained. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 43 of the Bill contains a new exemption relating to documents arising out of the National Companies and Securities Scheme. As I explained in the statement I made last September, it is not appropriate that the administration of State company laws should be subject to Commonwealth freedom of information legislation merely because the administering agency is a Commonwealth body. The effect of clause 43 would be to exempt from mandatory disclosure records of the discussions and deliberations of the Ministerial Council on Companies and Securities, documents prepared by the States for the Ministerial Council and documents relating solely to the administration by the National Companies and Securities Commission of the laws of the States and the Northern Territory. Documents prepared by Commonwealth agencies including the National Companies and Securities Commission itself, for submission to the Ministerial Council and documents which involve a Commonwealth interest, such as the administration of the company law in the Australian Capital Territory, would not be covered by the exemption contained in clause 43. What should be the scope of the exemption is, however, still under discussion with the States. The present clause is, therefore, an interim measure and the Government will, if necessary, be proposing amendments to it to give effect to the agreement finally reached with the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Committee recommended that the Bill should make it possible to withhold information about the existence or non-existence of a document in circumstances where the disclosure of the existence or non-existence of a document would itself be prejudicial to a number of interests which the Bill would otherwise protect. In accordance with this recommendation, clause 24 of the Bill empowers the withholding of information as to the existence or non-existence of a document where disclosure of that information would be prejudicial to defence, security, international relations or Commonwealth-State relations. Such information may also be withheld where disclosure of the existence or non-existence of a document would prejudice the investigation of criminal offences or breaches of the taxation laws or the enforcement or proper administration of the law in a particular case, or would disclose the existence or identity of a confidential informant or would endanger the lives or physical safety of those engaged in law enforcement. To give full effect to the Senate Committee recommendations, some consequential changes have been made in respect of the giving of certificates under clauses 28, 29 and 30 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill maintains the time limit of 60 days within which an agency must respond to a request for access. Clause 18 of the Bill provides, however, for the making of regulations which would shorten that time limit. This is in accordance with the undertaking contained in my statement last September that the question of time limits would be reviewed after experience of the operation of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The authority of the Ombudsman to investigate complaints about decisions under the freedom of information legislation has been extended so that he is not precluded from investigating a matter on the ground that an appeal lies to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This is achieved by clause 47 of the Bill, which is a new clause. Where a complaint is made to the Ombudsman, and the Ombudsman undertakes an investigation, the right to appeal to the Tribunal is postponed until the Ombudsman has completed his investigation. It is desirable that the Ombudsman and the Tribunal should not both be dealing with a matter at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1978 Bill provided that the giving of access to a document might be deferred until the happening of a particular event or until the expiration of a specified time where it was reasonable to do so in the public interest or having regard to normal or proper administrative practice. This provision is continued in clause 20 of the Bill. There has been added, however, a power to defer access pending the tabling of a document in the Parliament. The purpose of this change is to recognise the special interests of the Parliament in being first informed of matters which have a substantial public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Committee recommended that the language of the exemption relating to defence, security and international relations should be brought into line with the language of the Protective Security Handbook. Consequent upon doing this, there has been a general revision of the language in other exemptions, to ensure consistency of approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Bill, a person requesting access to documents is entitled to define the documents concerned by reference to their subject matter, so long as the identification and collation of those documents does not result in an unreasonable work load on the agency concerned. Under the 1978 Bill, it would have been necessary for an agency receiving such a request to consider each document covered by the request separately even though it was claimed that all of the documents would be exempt documents. This might result in the doing of a substantial amount of work for no benefit to the applicant. The Bill now provides, in sub-clause 23 (2), that a request may be refused without the agency having to search for and identify all of the documents covered by the request if it is plain that they would all be exempt documents and that in no case would it be practicable to delete exempt matter and make a copy of the document available with the exempt matter deleted. A decision under this sub-clause is, of course, subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I mention two new provisions relating to the objects of the legislation and its interpretation. Clause 3 of the Bill sets out the object of the Bill and contains an expression of parliamentary intention that its provision shall be interpreted so as to further that object. Clause 27 of the Bill is intended to make clear that each of the exemption provisions is to be interpreted separately and not read down by the inclusion of other exemption provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Due to industrial problems in the Government Printing Office, it has not been possible to have printed for circulation today the explanatory memorandum and the comparative 'black-type' memorandum. It is expected that these will be available early next week. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> The Archives Bill was introduced into the Senate on 9 June 1978 and was then referred, like the Freedom of Information Bill, to the Senate Committees on Education and the Arts and on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. The Archives Bill, now before the Senate, incorporates the response of the Government to the reports of those Committees. The Government's response was outlined to the Senate on 11 September 1980. The amendments incorporated in the present Bill appear clearly in the memorandum showing the differences between the Archives Bill 1978 and the Archives Bill 1981. I draw the attention of the Senate to the following clauses. There follows a bit of detail which I think is contained in the explanatory memorandum.

<PARA>The Bill was amended to take account of progress by the Territory towards self-government and to exempt from its operations records created by the Northern Territory since the proclamation of the Northern Territory Self-Government Act 1978 and former Commonwealth records which will pass to the Northern Territory as the successor administration.

<PARA>Commonwealth/State matters</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Fears have been expressed by some States that the Commonwealth might require the return of Commonwealth records in the custody of State institutions under clauses 28 and 51 of the Act. These clauses are intended to apply only to Commonwealth records in the custody of a Commonwealth institution and no amendment to the original clauses was considered necessary by the Parliamentary Counsel to protect the States. However, the Government promised that immediately after the passage of legislation, the Australian Archives would seek to achieve administrative agreement with archival authorities of the States as to mutually acceptable procedures for the release of shared documents. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 25 makes provision for giving effect by regulations to such agreements as they affect existing records and also in future cases where archival arrangements need to be made for records arising out of activities in which the Commonwealth is involved jointly with another government. It will be applied in particular to the agreement to be reached on archival arrangements between participants in the Co-operative Companies and Securities Industry Scheme. Legislation is not necessary to permit the Australian Archives to contribute to making available records under freedom of information legislation. This can be achieved by making manuals, indexes and other information concerning records available in Archives reading rooms, by providing the assistance of archives staff in explaining the administrative arrangements of the Commonwealth, and by the use of Archives reading rooms for the examination of records.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is consequential upon the Archives Bill 1981. Its purpose is to provide for the Australian Archives to be the depository of certain material under the Copyright Act. The Bill will amend the Copyright Act 1968 to enable broadcasting and television organisations to deposit with the Australian Archives the so-called ephemeral recordings which the Director-General of the Australian Archives certifies as being of exceptional documentary character. The present provisions of the Copyright Act provide for deposit of these recordings with the National Library. </PARA>
<PARA> An ephemeral recording is a recording-whether videotape, cinematograph film or sound recording-made by a radio or television broadcaster for the purposes of broadcasting a copyright work. The Copyright Act entitles a broadcaster, who has a licence to broadcast a copyright work, to make such a recording without further permission, so long as the recording is either destroyed within twelve months, or such longer period as is agreed to, or delivered to the National Library for archival retention. The Berne Copyright Convention requires the destruction of such recordings unless they are preserved in official archives on the ground of their exceptional documentary character. Now that the Archives is to be established on a statutory basis, with rights of access to be defined, it is appropriate that the Archives, rather than the National Library, be entitled to receive this material, and that its Director-General be responsible for its certification as material of exceptional documentary character. </PARA>
<PARA> Particulars of all ephemeral recordings received by the Archives will be kept, under the provisions of the Archives Bill, in the Australian National Register of Records established by that Bill. Recordings received from government-funded broadcasters will be kept as appropriate in one of the repositories maintained by the Archives around Australia. With the consent of the National Librarian, recordings received from private broadcasters will be lodged by the Archives, under the provisions of the Archives Bill, with the National Library of Australia where they will be kept together with like material deposited by non-governmental bodies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill concerns arrangements for the taxation of dividend income payable to individuals and, to a less important degree, interest payments and royalties where those moneys are earned in one country but are remitted to and payable in another. The present legislation extends an agreement covering these matters to Malaysia and Sweden, which two countries are added to a list of, I think, 16 countries with which Australia already has what are commonly known as double taxation agreements. The arrangements made in this legislation for those two countries are not identical, nor is either of them identical with arrangements for the other countries; but they all follow a very similar pattern. Without international agreements of this type, a company which was operating, say, in Australia and which had foreign shareholders would be liable, in the first instance, to Australian company tax. Dividends paid to foreign shareholders could be liable, in the absence of such an agreement, to be taxed as individual income in Australia, the residue being fully taxable in the hands of the ultimate recipient abroad.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To overcome this problem there are basically two methods in these international agreements. One is an arrangement that the income will be taxed in one country only. The second and much more common arrangement is that the amount of tax which may be paid on such dividends will be limited in both countries. Usually, in agreements to which Australia is a party, taxation in Australia on dividends payable abroad is limited to 15 per cent; otherwise they could be taxed at very much higher rates. Therefore, some loss of revenue is entailed in what could be regarded as a concession to overseas shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA> Though it is impossible to quantify the net losses, it is conceivable that the losses from that source might be more than offset by the exchange of information on company business or the price of company products and profits between taxing authorities in the respective countries. That would make it more difficult for companies to indulge in transfer pricing activities; that is, working with related companies to arrange prices in such a way that profits are maximised in countries which have low levels of taxation, and little or no profit is recorded in countries which have higher levels of taxation. The information which the Australian Taxation Office can obtain from taxation offices of other countries with which we have agreements make it more difficult for transfer pricing arrangements to be used to evade tax on income which ought to be recorded and therefore payable in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It was shown in an action before the High Court earlier this year that the powers of section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which is intended to give the Commissioner power to levy tax in the circumstances in which unrealistic prices are charged by subsidiaries or are being recorded for exports by Australian subsidiaries of overseas corporations, are extremely limited. That section was interpreted by the High Court-ever eager, of course, to seize upon any loophole to provide some sort of spurious rationale for a judgment in favour of tax avoiders-to be inadequate for the purpose for which it was designed. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not entirely unexpected. I do not want to be seen to be excusing what was in this case an outrageous judgment by the High Court, but at least as far back as the Asprey Taxation Review Committee report of 1975 attention was drawn to the possibility of section 136 being inadequate for the purpose for which it was designed. To this stage, nothing has been done about amending section 136. If experience is any guide, one would not want to hold one's breath while waiting for the Government to do something about it now, even after the Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation case. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxation on income due to Australian citizens from investments abroad is uncertain and is liable to evasion because of the interaction of section 23Q and section 46 of the present Act. I think it is worth noting and putting on the record that the possibility for tax evasion by Australian citizens, who have investments abroad and to whom dividends from those investments accrue, is likely to be related to the recent moves by six of Australia's major trading banks to establish branches in the Cayman Islands, which is, of course, a notorious haven for tax evasion. All of these branches have been established since 1978, and five of them were established only last year. The Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd led by establishing a branch in 1978, followed in 1980 by the Bank of New South Wales, the Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd, even the Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia, I regret to say, the National Bank of Australasia Ltd and the Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney Ltd. All of those last five banks established branches in the Cayman Islands in 1980. Whilst I at least have no direct evidence of the reason for the banks establishing branches there, it is highly likely that the primary reason is to assist in anti-social tax avoidance activities by Australian citizens who have investments abroad and income due on those investments. </PARA>
<PARA> This potential for exploitation of what is morally theft was recognised as far back as June 1978 and was publicly acknowledged by the Treasurer (Mr Howard), who forecast legislation to deal with this rort. After an intensive campaign of lobbying by the would-be thieves, who of course wanted to continue their exploitation, the Treasurer, on behalf of the Government, was forced to repudiate his own forecast of four months earlier in October 1978 and he dropped the proposition to close those loopholes. We have heard nothing more since. It is yet another example of the propensity of this Government, as my colleague, Ralph Willis, pointed out in the House of Representatives, when faced with intense lobbying from vested anti-social interests, to cave in. </PARA>
<PARA> Other than the possibility of contributions to party funds-which, of course, is always a factor-I think the reason the Government is so vulnerable to this sort of pressure really goes deeper. Most members of the Government really do not see anything wrong with making arrangements to evade liability to pay taxation. An action which to many people-I suggest anyone who is not morally bankrupt-is tantamount to theft and which ought to be regarded as theft is not held in disdain by most of the members of the Government. They quite genuinely cannot see anything wrong with it. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), when questioned on the matter by the media a few years ago, revealed his belief. He said: 'Everybody has family trusts, don't they?' Fundamentally, members of the Government do not believe that tax avoidance is morally wrong. There are others who no doubt are much more cynical and who consider that it probably helps party coffers if the Government goes easy on some of these people and who probably are deeply into exploitation of the loopholes in a personal way. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is not opposing this Bill, but yet again I want to place on record our disgust at the Government's tardiness to take action in the area of closing the loopholes in the taxation legislation and stopping tax avoidance, whether it has international connotations or purely domestic ones. It is not good enough for Government spokesmen to say, as Senator Carrick frequently says: 'The Labor Party did not do anything about it when it was in government'. I will not entirely defend the record of the Labor Government between 1973 and 1975 in this area. In some instances it was demonstrably negligent, although in mitigation I think one could say that at least from mid-1974 to the coup of November 1975 it was a government under siege. Under those circumstances, not surprisingly, it was more concerned with week to week survival than with long term planning. It also ought to be said in mitigation that at that stage, although there was tax avoidance, there was not tax avoidance on the scale which now exists, nor had it been known for so long that tax avoidance was so commonly practised. Indeed, I suppose it was the infamous Curran judgment of the High Court in 1974 which opened the floodgates and in effect declared open season for raids on the public purse. It is not good enough for members of this Government to criticise a previous government-now out of office for five and a half years-for having been to a limited degree negligent in this area. That does not excuse the gross negligence of the present Government in allowing taxation avoidance to deprive the revenue of at least a billion dollars a year, as it has done for a number of years, and taking no action against it. </PARA>
<PARA> In the sphere of remittances between countries, the action forecast almost three years ago by the Treasurer and repudiated four months later ought to be resurrected. Likewise, for domestic tax avoidance there is no reasonable doubt that a credible threat of retrospective legislation would deprive of clients those parasitic, anti-social lawyers and accountants who devise these schemes. What would-be tax avoider no matter how larcenous his intentions, would contemplate paying huge commissions to the parasites who organise tax avoidance schemes when he knew that ultimately he would have to pay his tax liability in any case?</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is not opposing the Bill. We implore the Government yet again to do something about tax avoidance, to take effective action against tax avoidance on a much larger scale than it has shown any willingness to do in the past. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to allow Australia legally to implement the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. The text of the Convention is provided as a schedule in the Bill. The Convention was drawn up within the Antarctic Treaty Forum and finalised at an international conference in Canberra in May 1980. The signatories include all the Antarctic Treaty consultative parties as well as a number of other nations, including the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, which have recently entered the international Antarctic community. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia was honoured at the conference by being chosen both as official depository nation for the Convention, and as host nation for the headquarters of the new International Commission which is to be established to administer the Convention. The Convention comes into force when the 'eighth instrument of ratification' from a national government is lodged with Australia as depository nation. The passage of this Bill will facilitate ratification by Australia. The Government is also pleased to note that Hobart has been selected as the site for the Commission headquarters, and this will be an added boost to Hobart's role as the focal point of Australian Antarctic activity. This is a notable first for Australia as it will be the first international organisation based here. </PARA>
<PARA> The Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources is also a notable first. The Convention is based on a conservation standard which embodies an ecosystem approach to conservation; that is, it seeks to protect not only harvested species but also the entire ecosystem including species dependent on the harvested species. In this way it differs from traditional fisheries agreements which seek only to protect the target resource. The area of application of the Convention is the seas south of the Antarctic convergence, a natural physical boundary between the colder Antarctic waters and warmer oceans in temperate zones to the north. This is the first time an Antarctic agreement has had effect outside of the traditional Antarctic zone delineated by the 60 degrees south latitude. </PARA>
<PARA> This Convention is the third international agreement developed by the Antarctic Treaty nations in a series of agreements, designed to protect Antarctic wildlife and the Antarctic environment. The first was the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Seals which was finalised in 1972. The second was the 'Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora' which was given effect by the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980. The Treaty nations, including Australia, are currently working on the question of mineral rights and exploitation. It is likely that these discussions will lead to the development of another, fourth agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission provided for in Article 7 of the Convention is likely to be established in 1982 following a preparatory meeting to be held in Hobart later this year. The Commission will oversee the implementation of the Convention and will devise and recommend conservation measures for adoption by participating nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Conservation measures may take the form of catch limits or total bans on harvesting delicate or endangered species. Restrictions may be imposed on fishing in certain areas during periods of the year when the risk of permanent damage to the species is high. Conservation measures such as these are commonly used in the management of living resources in both the marine and terrestrial environment. The Commission will decide which ones are applicable to the management of the Southern Ocean ecosystem and make appropriate recommendations to member countries. The Convention also establishes a scientific committee. This scientific committee will undertake analyses of research related to the ecosystem and formulate advice on this for the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill itself is quite straight forward and establishes a permit system for research and commercial fishing in the area south of the Antarctic convergence. It provides for the adoption of conservation measures recommended by the Commission. The permit system to be established under the Bill gives the Minister power to regulate organisations and individuals in respect of activities involving marine life, including harvesting and research, and provides for penalties for failure to comply with these. The Bill also allows the Minister to appoint inspectors-including every member of the Australian Federal Police or of the police force of a Territory-and specifies their duties and powers. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian sovereignty in the Australian Antarctic Territory is in no way prejudiced by the Convention. The Convention, like the Antarctic Treaty itself, safeguards all national sovereignty in the Antarctic. The Bill covers both the activities of Australians anywhere in the Convention area and the activities of any national in Australian territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon), of course, has primary responsibility for the regulation of fishing activity in the Australian fishing zone and he will be consulted in the application of the Bill. Australia's policy towards Antarctica is based on the premise that the region is an important one for Australia. Therefore Australia has had a history of involvement and a range of interests and potential interests to protect. It is Government policy to maintain and strengthen that role and ensure that Antarctica remains both a zone of peace and of international co-operation. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence, Australia has maintained an appropriate level of activity there and, as one of the 12 original signatories of the Antarctic Treaty has played a prominent role in international discussions of Antarctic issues. International agreement on the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Living Marine Resources is another important step in this process. </PARA>
<PARA> It will help conserve the Antarctic heritage for future generations. This Bill represents the culmination of extensive and carefully considered efforts by many nations, including Australia, and is an important step forward in the protection of the Antarctic environment. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation extends the provisions of the Commonwealth Employees (Retirement and Redeployment) Act to cover employees of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. This Bill is not opposed by the Opposition. I understand that it was accepted, or even welcomed, by the employees of the Corporation, which is an ironic twist. The Bill has been portrayed by the Government which sponsored it and usually it would be accepted on these terms by the official Opposition and other opponents of the Bill, as a disciplinary measure which increases Commonwealth power to hire, fire and downgrade employees. No attention was paid to the increased options which the Bill made available to Commonwealth employees. If in fact the Bill had been adequately and accurately portrayed by the Government as something which increased its disciplinary powers over its employees we would expect employees to be unequivocally opposed to it, which has not been the case with its extension to include the employees of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. The reason for that, of course, is that insufficient attention has been paid to the other provisions of the Bill which widen the options for employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This became apparent when it was revealed that the former head of the Department of Social Security-the person who we were told always advised Senator Guilfoyle when she was giving incorrect information to the Senate as Minister for Social Security-had used the provisions of the Commonwealth Employees (Retirement and Redeployment) Act to get out of the Public Service at age 56, I think it was, on an indexed pension of $20,000 a year for life. Being a man of considerable experience and expertise in the area of taxation, he is believed to be setting himself up in business as a tax evasion consultant, thereby doubly punishing all the taxpayers of Australia. Firstly, he is taking a huge pension at age 56 when obviously he is quite capable of continuing to work. Although it may be not suitable for him to continue to work in the office which he previously held, he is obviously quite capable of continuing to work in some capacity. However, at the age of 56 he is drawing from the public purse an indexed life time pension of $20,000 a year. Then, just to add insult to the fiscal injury, he is adding to his income, no doubt enormously, by setting up in business as a private consultant to assist a favoured few wealthy people in avoiding their liability to the taxes which are required to pay, among other things, of course, Mr Lanigan's premature and generous pension. </PARA>
<PARA> It is perhaps a pity, and indeed it is not generally recognised even yet, that some aspects of the Commonwealth Employees (Retirement and Redeployment) Act have not been readily grasped by the general public. It is a bit late in the day to start worrying about that now. The extension of the scope of the Commonwealth banking legislation is minor in content and agreed on, apparently, by both employees and management of the bank. The Bill is not opposed by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is discussing the ministerial statement on the staging of B52 bombers through Australia for sea surveillance in the Indian Ocean and for navigation training; these B52 bombers, in fact, being staged at Darwin. This matter has been the source of considerable controversy in the last few weeks. Last night we heard a speech on this subject by Senator MacGibbon. I suggest that that speech should remind us that there are some things in this place and some things in this world that never change. Senator MacGibbon made what I believe to be an unfortunate speech in which he advocated, in fact, that the basis of the Australia-United States of America alliance should involve complete Australian compliance and complete Australian trust in everything said and done by the United States, in particular the United States State Department, in its dealings with Australia in its conduct of this alliance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I intend to show that we on this side of the House have every reason to wish that such an agreement should be based not on blind trust but that it should be a carefully thought-out partnership based on a carefully thought-out agreement so there is no room for the sorts of mistakes such as were made in the past. Senator MacGibbon, having made his point, proceeded to berate the Opposition and in particular, Senator Robertson, for suggesting that B52s may be used by the United States in raids in the Persian Gulf region. They may be used for such a purpose in view of the difficult situation existing in that area valuable to the oil supplies of the world. Senator MacGibbon's words were roughly to the effect that anyone who believed that the United States would use or intended to use B52s to bomb in the region of the Persian Gulf did not know what he was talking about and that it was a stupid concept. He suggested that persons who suggested that had no idea-in particular Senator Robertson-and really were quite ignorant of the problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the first thing I should do in speaking this afternoon is to refer Senator MacGibbon to today's Age, to an article written by George Wilson of the Washington Post. It is an article written by a distinguished journalist from a journal known for its accuracy. George Wilson referred to the fact that B52 bomber crews at the Strategic Air Command base at Minot, North Dakota, near the Canadian border have a new mission; being ready to drop bombs in the Persian Gulf to protect oil supplies. He then quoted Brigadier-General John Shaud, commander of the 57th Air Division which includes the Strategic Projection Force, SPIF, B52 bombers. SPIF planners said that a B52 carrying a load of conventional 227-kilogram or 340-kilogram bombs could make the trip from North Dakota to the Gulf and back with only two mid-air refuellings and that this could also be done with nuclear weapons. The slogan of the Strategic Projection Force is 'Any time, Anywhere'. Training for Persian Gulf missions has reached the point where full-dress exercises will be conducted soon. The Brigadier-General said the force had the capability to launch a strike to the Persian Gulf out of North Dakota. </PARA>
<PARA> A Brigadier-General and senior officer in the American Air Force, George Wilson of the Washington Post, and obviously the State Department in America, apparently agree with Senator Robertson that it is perfectly feasible and perfectly likely and reasonable that B52 bombers would be used to bomb in the Persian Gulf region. I suggest that Senator MacGibbon is the only person in this place, or anywhere else, who believes that such a possibility is not on and that such a thing would not be considered by the United States Government or by the United States Air Force. To return to the statement, I believe we must consider it in the light of other statements made in the last few weeks to this Parliament. The first statement on B52s was made by the real Foreign Minister in this country, Mr Fraser. The second statement was made by the nominal Foreign Minister in this country, Mr Street. The Labor Party has expressed disquiet over this statement on B52s; first about the ambiguity and looseness in the wording of the formal Notes of Agreement exchanged between Mr Street and Mr Haig and tabled in this Parliament on 11 March, and secondly, disquiet about the loose agreed form of words later produced by Mr Street which, as he admitted, has no legal status. </PARA>
<PARA> Previous speakers on this side of the House have expressed justifiable concern about the apparent looseness of the arrangements and the lack of firm safeguards in the so-called agreement. I am sure that my legal colleague, Senator Evans, who will speak later in this debate, will go into more detail on the exact legal wording and the difficulties we find with that. Our apprehension and concern on this matter can only be heightened by the fact that the matter of staging B52s and their associated tankers was in fact produced out of the hat during the pre-election period when the Government tried to drum up a khaki election. It tried to go back to the days when the best way for conservatives to conduct elections in this country was to dream up foreign threats and drum up the security issue to have an election based on fear. </PARA>
<PARA> If the agreements are loose and lack clarity, as we assert, the apprehension expressed on this side of the House can only be heightened further by the previous track record of General Alexander Haig and also by the track record of the State Department in its dealings with Australia and the rest of her allies. We were misled years ago over the bombing in Cambodia and other incidents in the Vietnam war. We were not informed about previous red alerts in 1973 at United States installations in Australia although we were assured that we would be informed of such alerts. The United States has a history of misleading us on such issues as the Australian Government has also. Mr Menzies, who was then Prime Minister, quite clearly lied to the Australian people when he said that our involvement in Vietnam followed a request from South Vietnam. The Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) clearly misled this electorate when in the pre-election period they said that permission to stage the B52s in Australia was in response to a United States request. Our leader, Mr Hayden, in another place quoted from an article, by Frank Cranston of the Canberra Times who quoted Mr Killen as having said:</PARA>
<PARA>the matter was raised by the Prime Minister and I raised it . . . it has been put to them that it could well be of assistance if those aircraft were staged through Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Killen replied with a typical, convoluted answer. He did not deny this fact and again quoted the Prime Minister as discussing ways in which we could help the United States. Quite clearly the approach was made and I do not believe anyone on the Government side has denied or can deny the fact that the approach to stage the B52s through Darwin was made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence and not as a result of a request from the American Government, as was suggested in the pre-election period and in the lead-up to the statement in this place. Last week's foreign affairs speech, the other statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) at this time, was a clear illustration, when viewed in conjunction with this statement, of the double standards which the Government demonstrates in this matter. On the one hand Mr Street's speech advocates a sensible, middle power independence for Australia, but it is full of advice that this Government has not taken in the past and doubtless will not take in the future on our role in the alliance with the United States and, quite clearly, the Government will not take it as regards the staging of these B52s in Darwin. Mr Street says that Australia is a middle power and that we do not give sufficient attention to what such a status implies. He quite rightly states:</PARA>
<PARA>a middle power has more opportunites than a small power. </PARA>
<PARA>Again he states:</PARA>
<PARA>how seriously they are taken and what impact they have on events will depend largely on the quality of human performance, on the skill, knowledge, maturity, determination and imagination of those who formulate and implement their policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is certainly written by Foreign Affairs, as Senator Sibraa says. It is certainly not written-not without tongue in cheek-by any Minister in this Government. These statements are true. They talk about the importance of a partnership. It is very sad that the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister do not fall into this category when they deal with our allies. Mr Street tells us that as a middle power we have an obligation to declare our position on all major issues-peace and war, freedom and oppression, racialism, development, poverty-because in some circumstances, he states, a middle power can be more effective than a great power. We have this Government doing what governments in this country in the past have done and that is to acquiesce completely with what is happening, despite what other countries say, to acquiesce completely with what happens for instance in El Salvador and to acquiesce completely with the present American Government's attitude to what should happen in the Middle East and the Indian Ocean. Why do we not attempt to put into practice, in our relationships with the United States in the American alliance, the principles which were laid out in this speech by Mr Street? Why do we not bring proper middle power, friendly pressure to bear on the Americans to modify their attitude on the Indian Ocean and the escalating arms race? Why do we not follow the example of western European allies of the United States and Canada to bring pressure to bear on the United States about its attitudes to the people and struggles in El Salvador? Mr Street admits:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>for a middle power like Australia which is allied to a superpower, the management of that relationship constitutes a particularly important part of its diplomacy. </PARA>
<PARA>Surely that relationship should not be as consistently servile as it has become under this Government and previous conservative governments. Mr Street, in his speech, is prepared to acknowledge that Australia's national interests and those of the United States do not always coincide. I presume he refers to the occasions on which the senior partner in our most important alliance deems it inadvisable to inform the Australian Government or the Australian people of defence initiatives that may not appeal to us. I go back to the most striking example of that, which was the occasion when the North West Cape station was put on red alert in the 1973 Middle East crisis. Despite agreements that the Australian Government would be entitled to know of any such developments affecting a base on our soil, we were not told until after the event. America has treated other allies in this way; for instance, when Oman was used during the abortive and potentially disastrous rescue attempt of the United States hostages in Iran. The most shameful of the recent episodes was the bombing of Cambodia during the Vietnam war. We were not let into that sordid secret and the American people were not let into that sordid secret. One of the main protagonists of that attitude of treatment by the United States of its allies was, in fact, Alexander Haig, who is now United States Secretary of State. In his confirmation hearings, just a few weeks ago, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> President Nixon's decision to bomb the sanctuaries of North Vietnamese troops along the Cambodian border and to keep that bombing secret, was made in March 1969. </PARA>
<PARA> I supported the President's decision to order those raids and I was involved in planning them. This operation was carried out as a secret military mission of the kind we have conducted historically and traditionally in time of conflict against enemy forces. </PARA>
<PARA>At the hearing he was asked whether these practices troubled him. At the time he replied:</PARA>
<PARA> No-one's perfect. No administration is impeccable and I don't suppose the Nixon administration was . . . But I also want to make it clear I didn't think it was either wrong or immoral, I'd be deceiving you if I suggested that. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the man with whom Mr Street has exchanged a form of words which purports to give an undertaking that the B52s will not carry nuclear arms. This is the man who drew up, with Mr Street, this exchange of notes which we understand are unsigned. This is the man who represents the Government that Senator MacGibbon and others claim we should trust implicitly, that we should not question and that we should have complete faith in because that is part of our agreement and part of our alliance. I just cannot believe the General, who was so deeply and personally involved in what was then the secret bombing in Cambodia, would think twice about breaking the very informal form of words that has been exchanged with Mr Street. Mr Street says that he gained the impression that the new American Administration means what it says. We can only hope that General Haig says what he means when he has confidential discussions with our Foreign Minister. The Labor Party is asking for a very firm form of words, a very firm agreement so that we can be absolutely sure that the B52s which will be staged through Darwin will not carry nuclear weapons. We must be sure and we must be able to make sure that we are told what is really happening. We ask no more than that. We can see nothing in the agreement drawn up by General Haig and Mr Street which gives us this feeling of safety. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me return to what the real possibilities are for Australia as a middle power, as Mr Street calls us, fortuitously placed between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. We are in a unique position to modify American views on the questions of escalation of big power rivalry and arms build-ups in the two regions. Mr Street dwells on the coincidental, shared concern of the Reagan Administration and the Australian Government on what he calls-I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>the grave implications of the remorseless military build-up by the Soviet Union and the need to maintain a military balance as a condition for stability and effective negotiations, about the need to improve consultation and co-ordination within the Western alliance. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Street is adamant in his belief that-I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>The possession of adequate power is desirable precisely because it reduces the chances of armed conflict. </PARA>
<PARA>He says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . preparedness and evident resolution diminish the prospect of war. </PARA>
<PARA>It is presumably this belief that has been and will be used to justify Australia's offer of the use of Australian bases to the United States to facilitate its deployment of forces in the Indian Ocean. It looks as though it is not going to stop at the proposition that B52 aircraft should use the Royal Australian Air Force base in Darwin. In the last week further evidence has come to light of the intentions of the United States in these regions where we so fortuitously find ourselves placed-the Indian Ocean, Asia and the Pacific. The United States Congress has been given an outline of the military umbrella proposed by the Reagan Administration for the region. It will involve an increasing obligation for Australia to toe the line. The Director of the United States Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs, Mr Richard Burt, told a House of Representatives sub-committee on international security that a United States presence in the area can provide the base for 'rapid response in many emergencies'. He suggested that allies with important military facilities and regional airfields and ports could 'provide access to permit deployments in times of crisis'. With obvious reference to Australia, Mr Burt said that the ability of the United States to deploy forces rapidly would depend on on-route facilities for refuelling and on overflight routes. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Some positive results have been achieved but much greater effort is needed if we are to approach our requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that the State Department intended to hold a 'frank dialogue' with countries in the region and particularly to make it clear that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . present arms control proposals for the Indian Ocean Area offer little prospect of enhancing security. </PARA>
<PARA>It is useful to know what the current thinking of the United States in relation to the Indian Ocean is. Australia, in the last decade, has taken a consistent line on the Indian Ocean in both the United Nations and the Commonwealth. This is an area in which, having a direct interest, we could usefully make our views known to the United States. We could actually make use of our unique position in the region and in the alliance by starting to practise what we preach. Since 1971 Australia has taken an attitude to the Indian Ocean which is recorded in our votes at the United Nations and, more recently, at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting in New Delhi in September last year. It is worth remembering that only six months ago the Australian Prime Minister signed a communique which seems to have been negated by our latest agreement on the use of Darwin as a base for B52 aircraft. The communique, which was signed by the Prime Minister in September last year, and which will doubtless be reaffirmed by Australia at the forthcoming Commonwealth Government Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne-unless other CHOGM leaders dissociate themselves from Mr Fraser's double speak on our behalf-states:</PARA>
<PARA> Heads of Government noted with concern that, despite the expressed wishes of the littoral and hinterland States, great power military presence in the Indian Ocean has increased and that there has been a deterioration of peace and security in the Indian Ocean area. </PARA>
<PARA> They further noted with regret that recent events in the region, together with the worsening international situation, have caused a further build-up of great power military presence. </PARA>
<PARA> While regretting the suspension of the bilateral talks on arms limitation in the Indian Ocean between the Soviet Union and the United States and reaffirming their commitment to the ultimate establishment of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean in accordance with the 1971 UN declaration, they called on the great powers to take active and effective steps to remove existing sources of tension in the area. </PARA>
<PARA>This, of course, was based on the United Nations declaration of 1971, which was also signed by Australia. This has been reaffirmed every year since, and I expect that it will be reaffirmed every year in the future. The declaration of the General Assembly calling for an Indian Ocean zone of peace states:</PARA>
<PARA> Calls upon the great powers in conformity with the Declaration, to enter into immediate consultations with the littoral States of the Indian Ocean with a view to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Halting the further escalation and expansionism of their military presence in the Indian Ocean;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Eliminating from the Indian Ocean all bases, military installations and logistical supply facilities, the disposition of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction and any manifestation of great power military presence in the Indian Ocean conceived in the context of great power rivalry. </PARA>
<PARA>Today we are faced with an escalation of that presence in the Indian Ocean. The Fraser Government has been voting at CHOGRM and the United Nations in favour of delimitarisation in the Indian Ocean, but at the same time it obviously has been actively encouraging our ally, the United States, to effect a further build-up here. In the light of the signing of these declarations we have invited the United States to use Darwin as a base for B52 aircraft and, what is more significant, for tanker aircraft-the KC135 aircraft. We know that the B52 aircraft is eminently suited to refuelling from such tankers, thus extending their range far across the Indian Ocean. </PARA>
<PARA> All we have is a loosely worded agreement. It is so loose that no one can take it seriously. The United States State Department now has the temerity, for the first time that anyone can remember, to warn the loyal Opposition in a democratic country to toe the line, to agree with United States policy in the area, to agree with the words of agreement which have been set down by General Haig and Mr Street. The United States State Department has the temerity to suggest that the Opposition in this country has no right to question the words in that agreement and to question whether that agreement provides sufficient safeguards for this country and particularly for the people of Darwin, and no right to make sure that in the future it is informed of what is being done in our own territory and in our own region by our own allies, of which we have not been informed in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party is asking that the agreement be made much tighter than it is now so that we can be sure that the use of this base and the deployment of these aeroplanes in Darwin by the United States is in agreement with our policy. We do not want to go back to the days to which Senator MacGibbon started to take us back. We do not want to go back to the days when Senator MacGibbon's predecessors were saying in this place that Australia was entering the war in Vietnam to prevent the downward thrust of China. We do not want to go back to the days when Australia was left in ignorance of the way in which that war was being conducted. Certainly, in relation to the deployment of these B52 aircraft, we do not want to go back to the days when we did not know what was happening on our own soil. We ask for a tighter agreement. We ask to be able to be absolutely certain that that base will not be used for nuclear weapons. The reassurances we have received have not been sufficient. The reassurance that Senator MacGibbon gave us yesterday, namely, that no one would seriously try to use B52 aircraft in the Persian Gulf, was answered today-the very next day-by a senior military officer in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> We ask no more than that Australia be treated as an equal partner in the alliance, that Australia use its ability, knowledge and influence occasionally to voice its disagreement with the United States when it does disagree, and not just act as a servile partner which does as it is told. We do not enjoy any more than anybody else partisan differences such as this one in the area of foreign affairs or defence. But, as we were never consulted, as we were never asked about the situation, as this staging of B52 aircraft was obviously drummed up before the last election as an election gimmick, and as the people of this country were obviously misled into believing initially that United States defence personnel would be here at the request of the United States, we see no reason why we should have faith in the words of agreement put down by the present Foreign Minister or in any future agreement between that Foreign Minister and the present Secretary of State in the United States. </PARA>

<PARA> No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia is an island continent; but, if we take on John Donne's words, we cannot continue to exist as an island in the area of defence or in the area of trade. We have realised over the last few years that we have to make trade arrangements so that we can maintain our standard of living. I think that anybody in his right mind would realise that when it comes to defence we have to make similar arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> If we looked into the future and tried to foretell the sorts of hostilities in which we might be involved we would realise that in any hostility other than a minor incursion on to our land we would have to be involved with a strong, reliable and powerful friend, and for that reason we make treaties. When Senator Hamer spoke to this paper he mentioned the treaties we have entered into. We know quite well that exercises take place regularly involving the defence forces of our nation and those of other nations with whom we have treaties. Indeed, a major exercise takes place every two years in the Shoalwater Bay area. Members of our Defence Force travel around the world to exercise with other forces, as do the ships of the Royal Australian Navy and the aircraft of the Royal Australian Air Force. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically, what we are discussing, and this seems to have been lost in all the rhetoric of the debate, is surveillance and navigational exercises. The Opposition has said, and undoubtedly there would be some argument, that it was not consulted beforehand. Unfortunately, I am not in a position to say that we should or should not do that. However, members of the Opposition have made a case that if they had been told a little more about the matter beforehand maybe we would not have had the claims and counter-claims which have gone on in the media to this point of time. It is unfortunate that that has happened, but I still do not see that as an excuse for some of the wild exaggerations that have been taking place. Basically, we are dealing with navigational and surveillance exercises, and those matters are covered in the agreement. The two points which mention that state:</PARA>
<PARA>the B52 flights shall be for sea surveillance in the Indian Ocean area and for navigation training. </PARA>
<PARA>the agreement of the Australian Government would need to be obtained before the facilities at RAAF Base, Darwin could be used in support of any other category of operations. </PARA>
<PARA>In the debate that statement has been termed as the form of words, and we have been warned by Senator Grimes that Senator Evans, who I understand will follow me in this debate, will concentrate on that form of words. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Really? Is that a threat or a promise? I make the point that the form of words used in the agreement states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>the agreement of the Australian Government would need to be obtained before the facilities at RAAF Base, Darwin could be used in support of any other category of operations. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that it is a surveillance and navigational exercise. The navigational part of that training is taking place over north Queensland, where low level navigational exercises are being carried out. Why on earth would these aircraft carry nuclear bombs or any other sorts of weapons on navigation and surveillance exercises? The reasons just escape me. We are worried about the capability of the B52 aircraft to carry nuclear weapons, but we do not seem to be worried about any other sort of aircraft. As I have mentioned, we take part in various exercises. Other aircraft which transit across Australia are quite capable of carrying nuclear weapons, yet to date we do not seem to have had any hassle about those aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer also to the cruise missiles coming on stream. I have read articles in the ordinary Press without reading any that are confidential, about the possibility of being able to carry on and deploy cruise missiles from the ordinary civilian aircraft which transit our airspace and use our air fields numerous times on any day of the week. To return to the aspect I was discussing, why would these aircraft carry nuclear weapons on surveillance and navigational flights?</PARA>
<PARA> The final B52 aircraft-the H model-was delivered in June 1962. That makes the youngest B52 almost 19 years old; there is nothing new about it. All the manuals have been written on its ability to carry bombs and on crew training. Obviously, every so often as new crews come on stream, the training of the crews would have to be updated and the planes would doubtedly carry a weapons load to simulate the weight involved, the fuel burn, and so forth. There would be no necessity to do that over Australia. It could be done over the ocean where nobody is worried. So there is nothing new about the B52s ability to carry bombs. All that has been done before. </PARA>
<PARA> Mention has been made of accidents involving aircraft carrying nuclear weapons, and indeed, that is a cause for concern. I think Senator Robertson mentioned that matter in his speech. Recently an article appeared in one of the national newspapers tabulating accidents involving aircraft carrying nuclear weapons. The significant thing about that article was that in not one case did the nuclear component of the bomb detonate. There were explosions of the high-explosive trigger, but I dare say if an aircraft carrying high explosive iron bombs had been involved a far worse situation would have developed. I suppose it is reasonably easy to sketch the main principles of a nuclear bomb, but a rather intricate device is required to cause the implosion which is necessary to cause the explosion. Thus we find that there have been minor explosions in all these accidents. Of course in the explosion of the detonating high-explosive material there has been a release of radioactive material, because that is what the bomb is all about. Nevertheless, because of the very nature of the radioactive material the explosion has been confined to a very small area and contained with no great problem and, as I have said, with not nearly the problems that would have occurred in the crash of an aircraft carrying high-explosive, large, normal, iron bombs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite significant that not once in this debate has it been mentioned that we now know that the Russian forces are deploying backfire aircraft at Cam Ranh Bay. Forgetting the missile part of it, that puts Australia well within range-I think almost without refuelling, but perhaps with one refuelling-of the backfire bomber deployed at Cam Ranh Bay which is capable of carrying nuclear weapons. That puts Australian targets well within the range of a normal, manned aircraft deployed by the Russian air force. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been said about prime targets, and Pine Gap, the North West Cape and Darwin Airport have been mentioned. These are relatively small targets, and I suppose that in the event of a war, if politicians had a hand in running it, we would probably try to do something on a cost effective basis. I think it is rather ludicrous to take out a target with a missile or a weapon which costs far more than the target which is being taken out. Although we know that there are too many nuclear weapons in the world today, they certainly are not being manufactured like lollies in a factory which are manufactured in the hundreds every day. If a country decided to use nuclear weapons it certainly would want to pick its targets, and a nuclear weapon certainly would not be needed to render inoperative a place such as Pine Gap or the North West Cape. It would be absolutely ludicrous to suggest that Darwin Airport could suddenly become a nuclear target. </PARA>
<PARA> We realise that any airport that is capable of taking defence aircraft obviously would be marked on the maps of the world powers as a possible target. We have to go back only as far as the Israeli wars to realise what can be done. Even if our own common sense does not tell us we can see that it certainly does not need a nuclear weapon to make an airport inoperative. The Israelis proved that just a few small well-placed iron bombs can render an airport quite inoperative without causing any large-scale destruction. It would be ridiculous to state that all of a sudden Darwin has become a nuclear target. </PARA>
<PARA> If hostilities broke out-it would be the unanimous opinion of honourable senators that they would not be looking forward to that day-what would we see as the role of the B52s which were carrying nuclear or normal ordnance? We know quite well that the aircraft are capable of being refuelled in the air. They are a long-range aircraft. This is one of the reasons why they have been slotted into the US Air Force for use as surveillance aircraft. The aircraft do have a tremendously long range, as Senator MacGibbon mentioned in his speech. With their normal look-down radar capability for targeting for normal bombing raids they have a tremendous capability for surveillance and keeping check on what the Russian naval forces are doing in the Indian and Pacific oceans. </PARA>
<PARA> If hostilities broke out and there were a need to deploy the bombers as a nuclear force why would the Americans want to use Darwin anyhow? It becomes a whole new ball game. As it is, Darwin is currently being used for rest and recreation-mainly rest. Senator MacGibbon mentioned the fact that Darwin is more suitable than many other airports because the runways are wide enough to take the outriggers. Can honourable senators imagine the scenario of an operational crew about to take off on a real bombing mission from Guam and, upon entering the operation room, the captain saying: 'Well, fellows, what do you say if we take off half an hour early and drop in at Darwin for tea and bikkies'? The whole thing becomes absolutely ridiculous. That is the sort of thing we are talking about. There is no way in the world that the bomber crews would be dropping in at Darwin for tea and bikkies which is what they are doing now. The crews rest there now so that they can go on a rather longer mission out over the Indian Ocean. Using the aerial tankers which have been mentioned, the bombers would obviously fly straight to the target. </PARA>
<PARA> I find that the whole argument has become ludicrous. As I said at the beginning of my speech, the B52s are being used basically for surveillance missions and navigational exercises. America is a friendly power. It is using our facilities. I, for one, welcome the Americans and congratulate the Government. I welcome the agreement which helps cement the relationship and the friendship which we have with the people of the United States. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whatever the degree of love, trust, affection, friendship or respect one has for the United States, everyone at least seems to be agreed about one thing, and that is that nobody in Australia wants to see, at present or in the reasonably foreseeable strategic future, US B52 bombers or other aircraft flying over or touching down in Australia while carrying nuclear weapons. Certainly that is the position of some 62 per cent of all Australians as indicated by the latest gallup poll which was taken in February and published in the Sydney Sun of 13 March. Certainly it is the position of the Australian Labor Party, as has been articulated by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hayden, the Deputy Leader, Mr Lionel Bowen, and every one of the speakers from the Opposition in both chambers who have entered the debate on the subject. Certainly it is also the position of the Australian Democrats as that position has been articulated by Senator Mason in this place. It seems, on the face of it, also to be the position of the Australian Government, but whether it is, or not, I suggest, requires a little closer examination. I will come back to this aspect in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reasons for that general attitude, if it is a general attitude, are clear enough. They hardly need to be spelt out in elaborate detail. In general strategic terms all of us, I think, would like to see Australia, the South Pacific area and the Indian Ocean remaining, as long as humanly possible, nuclear-free zones. That is the basis upon which we signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. We simply do not want to be dragged into the world-wide network of nuclear attack and counter-attack forces. We do not want to do anything which, as some people have said, will 'up the ante' in strategic terms. We do not want to create in Australia any new nuclear targets, especially in or near a major city. This, of course, is exactly what will happen when Darwin becomes a base for the use of long-range nuclear bombers or the tankers that can refuel them in mid-flight. </PARA>
<PARA> We are all concerned about the possibility of nuclear accidents, the possibility of which is obviously much enhanced with overflights of planes carrying nuclear weapons. I imagine that I scarcely need to remind this audience of the famous crash of a B52 back in January 1961 in Goldsborough, North Carolina, when a 24 megaton bomb was splashed all over the countryside and five of the six interlocking triggers on the bomb failed. Even if everyone's general position is as I have outlined, three important questions arise for us to look at as a result of the signing of this agreement. The first big question is whether the views that I have outlined are in fact shared by the present Australian Government. Is it the case that this Government does not now or in the reasonably foreseeable strategic future want to see B52s carrying nuclear weapons over, out of or through Australia? On the face of it that may seem to be the case but I, for one, am not so sure. I ask honourable senators to look at the terms of the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) which remains the first, and indeed still almost the last, word from the Government on the subject. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it has been agreed between the Foreign Minister and the Secretary of State that the aircraft staging through Darwin under the arrangements now agreed for surveillance flights and navigation training will be unarmed and will carry no bombs. </PARA>
<PARA>I am referring to the famous Street-Haig unsigned, unheaded piece of paper in the Washington safe. The Prime Minister then made a further statement to the following effect:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government has a firm policy that aircraft carrying nuclear weapons will not be allowed to fly over or stage through Australia without its prior . . . agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>It may be that at first blush that seems to be clear enough, but when we look at the statement we find that all it is really doing is saying that as a procedural matter we will have to agree before such flights are made. It does not say that we will not agree. It does not say that by the time the first flights come in we will not have agreed. It does not address itself to that question. It does not say that we will not agree if we happen to be asked by the United States about particular flights or flights generally in a year's time, a month's time, a week's time or even a day's time. The point is that there is no expression of concern at the implications of nuclear-armed bombers flying in or over Australia, an expression of concern that might have been expected in the Prime Minister's statement if the present Government really were opposed, absolutely and unequivocally, to this kind of development. All that has been made in the statement is the purely formal point that we will have to agree in the future if these flights are to be made. For all that we and the Australian public know, such agreement might already have been made or something in the nature of a contingent agreement might already have been made by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The surrounding circumstances of this whole affair, I suggest, give some weight to the possibilities I have mentioned. For a start, the Australian Government, it must be said, has been desperately anxious-puppy dog anxious in fact-to offer its support to the United States as the United States evolves its plans to establish a major new military umbrella across the whole Pacific and especially the Indian Ocean area. Of course, those plans are evolving with much greater rapidity with the new set of cowboys, green berets and Strangeloves that now are occupying the United States White House. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year we were falling over ourselves to offer home-porting facilities for the United States fleet in Western Australia. Indeed, there is some evidence of frustration on our part that the Pentagon in the United States clearly is not falling over itself in that respect, nor is the State Department. As was effectively admitted by the Minister for Defence, Mr Killen, in his answer to a question without notice from the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hayden, on 12 March, we are now falling over ourselves not to respond to a United States request to aid B52 flights, but rather to invite the United States to make a request of us in this matter. It is an exact repetition, which cannot help but be noticed, of the circumstances in which, as now has been amply documented, we were drawn inexorably into the Vietnam war. </PARA>
<PARA> It simply cannot be assumed that this Government, any more than any of its conservative predecessors, is in the habit of telling the truth concerning key elements of our relationship with the United States. It certainly cannot be assumed that the overt terms of treaties, agreements and statements can be left to speak for themselves. There has been almost a tradition of secret agreements and undertakings on key issues. Let me give some examples of that. One famous one was in 1963 at the time of the establishment of the North West Cape base when all sorts of public noises were made by the then Prime Minister about the maintenance of Australian sovereignty in the use of that facility, whereas in fact at the same time there was an extraordinary exchange of letters between the then Minister for External Affairs, Mr Barwick, and the United States Ambassador, Mr Battle, agreeing to what was in effect a complete abdication of Australian interests in the operation and conduct of that base. That exchange of letters-the Barwick-Battle correspondence-was revealed only in 1973 when the Labor Government renegotiated the terms of that agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> That correspondence and that historical example become particularly relevant because of the reference to consultation in paragraph (VII) of the present B52 agreement, it being remembered that the key expression in issue in the Barwick-Battle correspondence was just that same word. Barwick, on behalf of Australian interests, made it perfectly clear that he regarded consultation as requiring nothing in the nature of Australian control or second-guessing of anything the United States might do or might be minded to do in the operation of that facility. </PARA>
<PARA> Another example, a particularly clear one, emerges from Booker's volume The Last Domino, supplemented by a review by the former Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, in the Australian Financial Review of 24 August 1979. That related to the situation at the time of konfrontasi between Indonesia and its neighbours, when Barwick returned from the United States and announced that the United States would support us if our ships were attacked in any way by Indonesia as a result of the escalating conflict or likely conflict in our immediate neighbourhood. Barwick reported that he had received an assurance to that effect-again, lodged in a Washington embassy safe-from the then Secretary of State. </PARA>
<PARA> That arrangement or agreement, such as it was, subsequently was countermanded by President Kennedy with no equivalent publicity being given to that subsequent development on the basis that the ANZUS treaty contained no specific obligation to come to our aid in the circumstances contemplated. In fact, not only was no publicity given to that countermanding by President Kennedy, but also at least three times Barwick made public announcements that the United States would in fact come to our assistance. I am referring to these matters as examples of the impossibility of relying on public expressions of good faith about the kinds of agreements which are entered into by our conservative governments and our United States allies. </PARA>
<PARA> A third example of exactly the same sort of situation was, as I have mentioned already in passing, the highly secret series of steps by which we came to be involved up to our ears in the Vietnam war, with the Australian public being systematically deceived in the process about who was requesting whom to do what. That was an exercise which now has been amply documented in a number of books, most recently, for example, in Alan Renouf's book The Frightened Country. It may be that I am exaggerating these concerns. It may be that the Government presently is committed-indeed, firmly committed- to keeping nuclear weapons out of Australia unless and until a major international strategic crisis of a kind that cannot presently be at all foreseen erupts. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to Senator Puplick, who is attempting to interject, that if that is the case I, the Opposition and the Australian public would welcome an obsolutely unequivocal assurance to that effect from the Australian Government, an assurance which simply has not been forthcoming in anything that has been said by any Government spokesman on this issue so far. There is a large gulf between saying, on the one hand, that we will have to agree before any such thing happens and, on the other hand, that we will not agree. It is that latter step that no Government pronouncement has been prepared to take. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let those contingencies or possibilities be laid down. Let the Government refer to the kind of strategic circumstance, presently unforeseen, that might justify it. I am not saying necessarily that it would be appropriate for there to be an absolute, negative, binding statement for the future; I am saying only that it is very appropriate to say something that is a little more satisfactory in substantive terms as to the situation at the moment than is the statement that agreement will be necessary. I want the Government to come right out and say: 'We have not agreed on an absolute or a contingent basis so far and we will not agree in the present and reasonably foreseeable strategic circumstances'. But not even that small step has been taken. That is one of the reasons for the Opposition's concern about the terms of the agreement. But there are other problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second big issue I raise for discussion and express concern about is this: If we do not agree with nuclear-armed flights and if we are unlikely to do so in the reasonably foreseeable future, why is that not included in the terms of the treaty? It should be made absolutely clear to everyone who looks at the agreement, but the formal treaty, the treaty that is constituted by the exchange of notes-the only documentation that is enforceable as a matter of international law-is quite silent on that. The only reference to the question of whether B52s will carry nuclear weapons and, if so, under what circumstances is contained in the famous unsigned, unheaded piece of paper dictated to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Street, by Mr Haig, as representing appropriate language to go into the statement by the Prime Minister on the issue. Legally speaking and in every other way, one is reminded of Sam Goldwyn's famous statement about oral contracts: 'They are not worth the paper they are written on'. Neither is that document worth the paper it is written on. The agreement, if anything, specifically contemplates that in fact nuclear-armed flights will fly over or operate out of Australia in some circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite Senator Collard's dire prognostications, this is the only time I want to refer-I will do so very briefly-to the actual text of the agreement in order to make my point. On just looking at paragraph (I) of the agreement-I will not even bother to read it out-it is obvious that it refers only to flights using Darwin facilities. It states that those flights shall be for sea surveillance and navigational purposes only, with the agreement of the Australian Government being required before they are used for any other purpose. But there are several things to note about that paragraph. In the first place, it makes no reference to other flights over Australia being only for surveillance and navigational training. The only explicit reference to the limited purpose of flights is made in paragraph (I) and it is concerned only with flights operating in and out of Darwin. It does not refer to other flights over Australian territory. If we look at the second sentence, and even if we give it its full and unambiguous literal force, it means only that the agreement of the Australian Government must be obtained before Darwin can be used for other purposes. It does not say that this agreement itself, the documentary agreement constituted by the exchange of notes, must be renegotiated before that can happen. </PARA>
<PARA> The second sub-paragraph to which I refer to support this proposition that the treaty itself does anticipate that nuclear flights will in fact occur is sub-paragraph (VII), the language of which very clearly indeed contemplates that nuclear flights are envisaged. The language used is that of strategic developments, which, as I understand it, is a diplomatic term in common parlance as a reference to nuclear developments. Further, the language of sub-paragraph (VII), referring as it does to 'consultations' and 'full and timely information', could not be more reminiscent of the language that was central to the Barwick-Battle correspondence about the North West Cape base in 1963 to which I have referred. I am not saying, as I think some people rather too briskly have said, that sub-paragraph (VII) overrides sub-paragraph (I). I am only saying that the reference to consultations being conducted would be unnecessary if sub-paragraph (I) was far-reaching and covered the field to the extent that the Government proponents claim it does. </PARA>
<PARA> The other sub-paragraph to which I refer is sub-paragraph (VIII), the language of which again gives the game away, relating as it does to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty-a reference which only makes sense on the assumption that what is being contemplated is something like the transit of nuclear weapons on or over Australia, which may in fact amount to a breach of that treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite Senator Collard's predictions, I do not make too much of the linguistic points about the different sub-paragraphs of the treaty, about possible inconsistencies or ambiguities in its language. What I am concerned to do rather is to emphasise that its literal language, at face value, does clearly contemplate that, without there being any amendment of the specific terms of this formal treaty there will at some time be armed nuclear flights operating either out of Darwin or by way of overflying the country and not going near Darwin. All that is necessary for the literal terms of this treaty to apply is for the Australian Government to agree to the use of Darwin for nuclear flight facilities. The agreement of the Australian Government is not even necessary when it is overflights not involving Darwin that are being contemplated. That is what the literal terms of the agreement amount to. That is why we are unhappy with the literal terms of that agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The nub of the whole criticism then comes back to this: If the Government does not want, as Senator Puplick and others on his side of the chamber seem to be claiming, armed B52 flights and if it is not going to agree to armed B52 flights in the immediately foreseeable future, why did the Australian Government not insist on the insertion of a formal clause to this effect? It is just no answer to say that because we trust the Americans it is unnecessary, because if we trust them to that extent then surely we do not need formal agreements at all. If oral arrangements or semi-blank pieces of paper are enough, because of the nature of the trust, confidence, friendship and affection which subsist between our two countries, why do we have this formal treaty at all?</PARA>
<PARA> If we have some of the things in the treaty why do we not have the lot? If we felt that the treaty was necessary to formalise part of the agreement, why was it not necessary to formalise the whole of the agreement? Why is that one key passage which everyone has been looking for, which the Prime Minister has been asserting and which the United States has been asserting in non-treaty language been left out of the treaty itself? There are two possible explanations. One is that the Australian Government did not seek the incorporation of such a paragraph or put up any kind of a fight to secure it; that is, we did not mind, on this view, being in a position where we do not have to be consulted at all with respect to nuclear overflights and we can agree at a moment's notice without the agreement itself being renegotiated in respect of flights out of Darwin. That is consistent enough with the supine posture that we have adopted in terms of our relationships with great and powerful friends in the past and it may well be the explanation for the present absence of that paragraph. </PARA>
<PARA> The other alternative which has been mooted is that the United States Government was asked to insert such a paragraph but flatly refused to do so, either because it had no intention of honouring it, or perhaps more likely because difficulties would have arisen with those other countries, especially Japan and West Germany, where there are very vague agreements, not explicit on these matters, which are thought to be in everyone's interest. In Japan, because it is undoubtedly the case that all domestic political hell would break loose if it was known that the American ships and aircraft were carrying nuclear weapons, treaties are silent on these matters and the questions are simply not asked. But it is obvious that either way, whatever the explanation is and despite what credibility can be given to that latter explanation of the absence of such a paragraph, the situation is still thoroughly unsatisfactory from Australia's point of view. A lot better explanation has to be given for that omission than the nonsense which is being peddled about by the Government at the moment, not explicitly addressing itself to this omission, not even acknowledging overtly that there is a problem but simply repeating ad nauseam that we have to trust our great and powerful ally. </PARA>
<PARA> The third and final big question that I raise for consideration is that even if the agreement, read literally, does require Australian agreement in turn before nuclear flights are staged through Darwin and even if, beyond the literal terms of that agreement, the United States Government is making, as it seems to have been doing in the last day or so, statements amounting to assurances of that kind, can the literal text of that agreement or can the literal text of that statement or those assurances be relied upon? Is there not a potential that we will be exposed to straight-out deception by the United States? That is not a question which I ask lightly because I do have a profound respect for Americans and most things American and I do believe it is right, proper and in Australia's best interests to have a general relationship of alliance with the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of considerations which demand that that very sensitive question be asked nonetheless. The first such consideration is the sheer incredibility of the notion, despite what Senator Hamer, Senator Collard and other people on the other side of this chamber have been saying, that B52s will not be employed at some time for the purpose for which they were expressly designed; that is, long-range nuclear bombing. Certainly they do have and certainly they are capable of performing a surveillance function, quite effectively and efficiently in large tracts such as the southern Indian Ocean, but there are other effective means of surveillance such as satellites and mid-air refuel surveillance aircraft and there are certainly a number of other more specifically purpose-designed aircraft available for that purpose. If it is surveillance that we are talking about it may be an explanation, but can it possibly be the only explanation. If it is the only explanation why do we have six KC135 refuelling aircraft lined up on the tarmac, as is proposed, in Darwin servicing only three B52s coming in and out when, as it is apparently well known to people who know about these things, one such tanker aircraft can in fact service the mid-flight refuelling needs of two B52 aircraft? It seems that there is a substantial over-abundance of tanker flight facilities for the kind of surveillance function that is here being contemplated. </PARA>
<PARA> They are only questions. I do not have the answers for those questions, but they are questions which are certainly brought to mind by the facts so far made available to us. Similarly, one simply makes the observation that it is a hell of a long way to be flying simply for training purposes, even in the context of the Cape York type of exercises which are already a familiar part of our military relationship. It may be that the B52s are to be used to carry, if not nuclear arms, then at least, as has been suggested in recent Press reports, long range multipurpose non-nuclear missiles. That too raises very significant strategic questions for Australia because it involves the use of these aircraft in an explicitly military role-something very different from the non-military or non-hostile surveillance and training purposes we have been told about so far. </PARA>
<PARA> There is simply no doubt in all these respects that the United States is rapidly developing plans for the extension of its military umbrella into the whole Indian Ocean-Pacific Ocean area. Bryan Boswell's article in the Australian on 25 March made it very clear, on the basis of United States information on the public record, that this was so. It is being anticipated in the United States by senior military planning personnel that Australia will play a crucial role in these kinds of developments. For all these reasons, there is a simple incredibility for me and for the Opposition about the notion that the B52s are simply some kind of glorified Orion being used for surveillance and training purposes, with no thought whatsoever being given to their more hostile potential in projecting military force into the Indian Ocean. </PARA>
<PARA> Another consideration that has to be acknowledged when one is addressing oneself to the question of whether there might be deception now or contemplated in the language of the United States assurances, the language of this treaty, is that whether or not one likes it, United States administrations in the past have not always dealt kindly with the truth in military and foreign affairs matters. Some of the best known illustrations that should be mentioned in this respect are, of course, the 1964 Gulf of Tongkin resolution sponsored by President Johnson to give him the war powers he needed in Vietnam. That resolution was premised on a denial by Mr McNamara, the then Defense Secretary, to Congress that the United States had any part in the operations which precipitated the North Vietnamese attack on the United States destroyer in question. That was a classic case of deliberate deception by the United States Government of its own public and its own Congress. Again in 1966 there was the famous example of Dean Rusk telling the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the South East Asia Treaty Organisation committed the United States to its course of action in South Vietnam-a straightforward deceit of the United States Congress and the United States public. Another very famous example was the systematic deception in 1969 and 1970 of the American people by President Nixon and his Secretary of State Kissinger in relation to the secret bombing of Cambodia-one of the most appalling series of instances of such behaviour in modern military and diplomatic history. That sequence of events was brilliantly documented by William Shawcross in this book Sideshow: Kissinger, Nixon and the Destruction of Cambodia. If that is the way United States administrations in the past have been capable of dealing with their Congress and with their people, it takes a fairly large jump of faith to believe that they would have any serious scruples about deceiving a middle power of middling to minor significance in the United States view of the world, especially when that middle power has a government which has no mind of its own and which is generally pathetically anxious to please. </PARA>
<PARA> I have sought to identify a series of major questions on this whole B52 issue to which simply insufficient answers or no answers at all have been given by the present Government. If this Government wants, as the Prime Minister has claimed he wants, a genuinely bipartisan policy on these matters, it will simply have to take the Opposition into its confidence while such arrangements are still being negotiated and not just demand obeisance or treat acceptance by us of these arrangements after the event, after the negotiations are complete, as something to be taken for granted. The failure of the Government to take the Opposition into its confidence on this occasion and the failure to give satisfactory answers to the kinds of questions which I and the Opposition have been raising leave one able to reach no other conclusion than that this Government has something to hide over the whole B52 question. The Government had better rethink its position rather quickly on these matters, because if one thing is clear it is that the Australian public is now much too well informed and has a much too acute sense of history to allow an escalation of military involvement of the kind that has happened in the past. The Government had better get it all right because this is simply an issue which will not go away. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall speak briefly on this issue while at the same time wondering just what is the point of speaking at this stage of such a debate. The fact is that the Australian people have been presented with a fait accompli, and all the talking in the world will not alter it. We can talk here until the proverbial cows come home and the result will be exactly the same. Like my colleague Senator Evans, who has just resumed his seat, I am perturbed at some of the ambiguities, some of the double-talk, some of the gobbledegook in the document that the Australian Government is supposed to have agreed to. An example of such ambiguities is given in an article in this morning's Melbourne Age by Russell Skelton. He referred to a United States Government document approved by both the State and Defence departments and sent to the United States Ambassador in Canberra. According to Skelton, the document says that these aircraft will be unarmed; yet further on we are told that the aircraft will be equipped with a gun. How hypocritical can one be? How much double-talk can we hear. An unarmed aircraft armed with a gun! Quite frankly, it appears to me from this article by Skelton that the whole agreement is full of such gobbledegook. According to Skelton, the document also says that the agreement specifies that Australian Government approval be obtained before B52 missions are changed from reconnaisance and training, and before the facilities are used for any other category of operations. Skelton wrote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Furthermore, it remains the policy of this Government neither to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons on particular missions. </PARA>
<PARA>Does that mean that the Australian Government will not be told when these aircraft are equipped with nuclear weapons, or does it just mean that the Australian people will not be told? That is one of the reasons why I am particularly concerned about the way this matter has been treated. It seems to me that Mr Street was sold the proverbial pig in a poke while he was in Washington discussing the matter with the United States military. It is noticeable, as Senator Evans recalled, that we seem to have walked into this one in very much the same manner as we sent our first troops into Vietnam-lies, lies, lies all the way. It was not until some years later, after the death of some 400 young Australians, that we found out the facts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is to be congratulated on its handling of the debate on this matter because it played its cards fairly well. The statement was introduced in both Houses on 11 March. The other House was off the air and the Senate was on the air. My Leader, Senator Button, had the document in his hand for a few short minutes, and he and Senator Robertson were the only two senators permitted to speak that evening while the Senate was on the air. Both Senator Chipp and I were looking for the call when Senator Messner moved for the adjournment of the debate. I guess that it was part of the Government's intention to hide the debate from the Australian public as well as it could. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically, I do not want to talk too much about B52 bombers, but I do want to draw some analogies between the current situation with regard to B52 bombers and Australian history. I recall the history in this way: For many years the people and the governments of this nation perceived that if ever we were in trouble a foreign power would come to our aid. That foreign power, of course, was England-the mother country, as she was referred to in days of yore. Because of that belief the flower of Australian youth was sent to Gallipoli, to Egypt and to the fields of Flanders, and approximately 60,000 of them, largely under the command of incompetent English field-marshals and other officers, were slaughtered or massacred. Those officers had very little-if any-knowledge of the trials and tribulations of the men in the fields of Flanders or in Gallipoli, the horror of war, the mud, the slush, the snow and the rain. So Australia, as insurance against the day when we might be attacked, was prepared to lay down the lives of 60,000 young men and tens of thousands of men were wounded and mentally and psychologically crippled. They returned to Australia to take up their role in life as best they could. </PARA>
<PARA> That was the price which Australia was prepared to pay on the supposition that some day England would come to our aid. What happened? Of course we all know that in 1939 when the British Government declared war it was immediately followed by the Australian Government. As quickly as we could in Australia we rounded up tens of thousands of young Australians, some of whom had never worked because of the Great Depression which the capitalist system had forced on this country at that stage of the game, and marched them off to war. Many thousands of them had a one-way ticket. They were sent to England and to the Middle East and they were sent to Canada to train as air force crews. There was hardly an area of the early conflict in the 1939-45 war in which Australians were not in the field in some capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> Men were thrown into battle, because of the haste with which the operation was orchestrated, with very little training, very poor equipment and with little or no air support. There was early glee-I suppose one could say-back home when we were shown films of one Australian digger rounding up and marching off what appeared to be thousands of Italian prisoners of war. I think those films gave us all a fairly false impression. We had the impression that the Australian soldiers were as good as Australian soldiers had ever been and that they were well equipped. The Italians were the most cunning and perhaps the gamest people of the lot because when war came in 1940 they took the very wise decision of voting with their feet. Thousands of them spent the war in prisoner of war camps in Australia, but at least they went home alive. They had a two-way ticket to the war, unlike thousands of Australians who opposed them. </PARA>
<PARA> Then the war became fair dinkum and the Australians were put against the highly organised, highly mechanised troops of General Rommel. My colleague, Senator McAuliffe, was one of those troops. He now laughingly refers to himself as one of the Benghazi harriers because for the first time for a long time Australians were put to flight and many an Australian ended his one-way ticket trip to the Middle East at that stage. That was as far as some got in the war. I repeat: This is because this country and the Government believed that some great foreign power would come to our aid if ever we were attacked. Of course, it did not happen. When the chips were down in 1942 and Japan made her thrust southward-Senator Carrick will recall this as vividly as I do-the Australian Government called upon the English Government for help, and it was not there. So every Australian who laid down his or her life in war from the time this colony was founded until that day had in fact laid down his or her life in vain. Australia and its people had paid a premium and when the demand was made on the policy, the insurer was broke. The insurer was bankrupt in that regard. The Australian Government of the day, as we well recalled, had to go to another foreign power to seek assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Churchill said at the time: 'I am very sorry, but if Australia goes down, so be it. We will resurrect Australia after we clean up the mess in Europe.' Had it not been for the gall of the Prime Minister of the day, John Curtin, Australian troops would never have been allowed to leave the Middle East. Many of them hurried back home in an attempt to thwart the Japanese thrust towards this continent. As far as England and Churchill were concerned, they were prepared to allow Australia to go under. That was the best we could get, with approximately 70,000 to 80,000 Australians dead in colonial wars, after paying that premium on a policy which was never honoured. Of course, those of us who are old enough well recall the joy and the pleasure which we had when the announcement was made that America was coming to our aid. We all well recall the pride which we had in seeing American troops on Australian soil. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly-I do not deride any soldier-I suggest to the Senate and to Australia that if those American troops had been put to the test in the first few months they were in Australia they would not have been able to fight their way out of the proverbial wet paper bag because they were as green as leeks. That is no reflection on them because every soldier has to go through a period of training. Despite that, it did the Australian people's hearts no end of good to know that at least America thought something of us. Regretfully, it seems to me that we have lived under the false premise that because America came to our aid in 1942, she will always come to our aid and because of that we have this need to bend our knee, to dip our cap to America. On the same basis, Greece, Crete and the people of France and Belgium and goodness knows who would be forever and a day genuflecting and dipping their lids to Australians. But we do not expect that and I do not know why we take the opposite point of view in regard to America. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us be perfectly honest about this; America came to the aid of Australia in 1942 not because we were white Anglo-Saxons, or nice people or because we belonged to the British Empire. The American Government decided to send troops to Australia purely and simply out of a military consideration. The motivation was military. The motivation was that Australia was an ideal base from which to prepare for the day to roll back the Japanese tide to Tokyo. Let us be perfectly honest about that and not be caught in high-faluting nonsense about it or be carried away with rhetoric and all of the bull dust that has emanated surrounding the battle of the Coral Sea and 101 other silly damn celebrations which have been carried on in this country from that day on. </PARA>
<PARA> America sent army, navy and airforce troops to Australia in 1942 out of purely military considerations. Had Australia not been in this geographical position the Americans, in all probability, would have sent those troops somewhere else where it would have been to its advantage so to do. As I said, because of this false premise which we have lived under, this propaganda which has been pushed about by Prime Ministers and by governments in the intervening years, somehow some people in this country feel that we still owe a great debt to America. I do not think I am the last Australian nationalist, but it does irk me to find the Government of the country to which I belong continually genuflecting to a foreign power and I do not give a tuppenny dam whether it is Russia, China, England or any other power. I believe it is totally wrong. This silly damn, nonsense, pardon my French, has gone on to the point that Australian pride, Australian integrity and Australian ability to act independently have been submerged and in fact virtually suffocated by the Australian body politic. </PARA>
<PARA> The same sort of nonsense that was pushed around for all those years was one reason this nation was able to be slipped so easily in the ANZUS Treaty, the Pacific security treaty. I think Senator Evans had something to say about the ANZUS Treaty. It is not worth the paper it is written on, like all treaties. Those of us who are old enough will recall the way Adolf Hitler signed treaties, then tore them up like confetti as his armies raped central Europe in 1938, 1939 and 1940. Treaties were nothing to him. He realised what they were-pieces of paper-white paper, black words, two or more signatures, not worth a tuppenny dam, not worth the paper they were written on. To prove my point let me read Article I of the Pacific security treaty between Australia, New Zealand and the United States which came into force on 29 April 1952. The Article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Parties undertake, as set forth in the Chapter of the United Nations, to settle any international disputes in which they may be involved by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered and to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>Put that statement alongside our actions and America's actions in both Korea and Vietnam. Surely it proves that document is not worth the paper it is written on because in both those instances, just to cite two examples, the Treaty was broken. If America wants to come to Australia to defend us it will do so if it perceives such action to be in its interests so to do, not because we have a treaty. If it perceives such action not to be in its interests all the treaties in the world will be torn up or shot through with legal words by some clever lawyer in the Pentagon. He will say 'It really does not mean that at all; we are very sorry Australia' like Churchill said in 1942. He said: 'You can go under; we have got other fish to fry'. I do not know why Australian Governments continue with this cock and bull story about this great and powerful ally on the other side of the Pacific. Sure, it is a great and powerful ally but why has not this nation learned? We have been let down once. There is the old adage that I learned on my mother's knee-once caught, twice shy. Everybody learns that very early in life as I am sure you did, Mr Acting Deputy President. The first time one of your schoolmasters did you for a marble or an ice-cream you learned the lesson-once caught, twice shy. It seems to me that this nation does not want to learn that lesson. Let down by one big foreign power in 1942 we are prepared to carry on ad infinitum and put ourselves into a situation in which we could well be let down again. We have failed to learn the lesson. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me continue my speech about these B52 bombers with this theme. I have already said that we genuflect, we dip our lid to these people in America, to the Pentagon. I have a good deal of time for the people of America. There are times when, I suppose because one does not express oneself as clearly as one should, people are able to take a rise at, have a shot at or brand one as anti-American. Let me say that I served alongside American troops during World War II and I have a good deal of respect for them as I have for American people. I have no respect whatsoever for the Pentagon because of the lies which have been told-this was referred to by my colleague Senator Evans-and which have come out of that office in the last 15 or 20 years. Let us also be mindful of the fact that at the present time America is governed by a President who obtained only 27 per cent or 28 per cent of the voting public. That is his majority. Only 27 per cent or 28 per cent of the voting public of America voted Republican. I suggest in a situation like that it could be unwise to put down all one's cards in favour of a man who was able to get only that sort of vote. For that reason I am doubly sceptical of the way that we tie ourselves to this foreign power. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to paint a scenario as I see it. We, that is, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street)-I should not use the word 'we' because there are thousands of Australians who are just as concerned as I am about the deal that has been done; I guess I should say Australians; the Prime Minister and the Government are in charge-have tied ourselves to this situation in which there is a possibility, as I read the document, of American nuclear armed B52s landing on or passing over Australian soil. Without full knowledge of what the document I referred to earlier means, I would say that it is hard to know what might happen. Surely any Australian government that thinks any military commander, be he Russian, Chinese, British, Australian, American or whatever, is going to notify another power of the weapons which his machines of war are carrying, that he is going to telegraph his punches, really did come down in the last shower. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I want to make is this: With the refuelling aircraft based in Darwin, really there is no need for the B52s to come within Australian territorial waters. Let us envisage a situation in which there is some sort of scare. I say this without any qualms whatsoever. There is one very regretful fault, in my view, that the American people have and that is a tendency to panic. We have seen that happen. I have seen it happen many times in my life. They have a great tendency to panic. Let us suppose that something does happen-there have been some very near misses-and that they believe the balloon has gone up. The B52s would leave Guam loaded with nuclear missiles, nuclear bombs or whatever-as I have already said, there is no way any military commander will notify the Prime Minister of Australia of that fact-and head towards Darwin; at the appropriate time the refuelling aircraft leave Darwin and meet the B52s outside Australian territorial waters; the refuellers return to Darwin, refuel at the ground depot and stand in readiness for the B52s which have gone on with their mission to goodness where; the B52s are refuelled on their return, if need be, again outside Australian territorial waters. Surely that puts Australia in the position of being an accessory either before, after, or both before and after the act. As I have already said, in my view there is no reason why any military commander would notify us that those planes were carrying bombs. </PARA>
<PARA> I am utterly saddened to see the way in which my country has been sold out particularly by governments of Liberal and Country Party nature in the post-World War II period. We are now in a situation where we are the host or haven for military and intelligence gathering installations of all types and sizes, many about which we do not know as much as we should know. I put it to the Senate in this way: There would not be one red-blooded American who would allow a foreign base on American territorial soil; yet American governments and the Pentagon seem to expect Australians to acquiesce in every blasted, gimmicky death-threatening device they want to plant on our soil. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is Australian pride? Where are the Australians who would once stand up and say to America what they should do. I was going to use a derogatory term, Mr President, for which you may well pull me up. There are other terms for it. Such Australians would say something to the effect: 'Get back home to America. America, we owe you nothing. We paid the price in World War II; we fed you, we fought alongside you. No longer do we need to kowtow to you or to any other foreign power. Pack up your B52s, all your bases and take them back home and do what you goddamn well like with them but get them out of my country.'</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that any Australian government that had the guts to stand up and say just that would win the accolades of the vast bulk of the people of Australia. I believe that future generations of Australians would lift the skies in praise. I believe that we would strike that nationalistic note which this government is trying to drum up with all sorts of expenditure, flag waving and jingoistic slogans of 'Come on, Aussie, come on' and all the other bulldust which really only puts money in the hands of television station proprietors and nothing else. </PARA>
<PARA> Somewhere some day some Australian Government will have to stand up and say to every foreign power: 'Get back home. Australia is our country. We will run it the way we like. We want to be free to do the things we want to do. We refuse to have our hands tied in foreign, defence and economic policies by people who are not responsible to the government of this country. I believe that the day we do that, as I said earlier, we can forget about the jingoism of 'Come on, Aussie, come on', and every Australian in this country once again will be proud to be Australian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support the amendment moved by Senator Martin. I read the reasons the Senate Standing Orders Committee gave for believing that the proposal for House of Representatives Ministers appearing before Senate Estimates committees could not proceed. I cannot say that I thought the reasons had a great deal of weight. The Standing Orders Committee report states that there would be serious practical difficulties in arranging times suitable to Ministers. I would have thought of that as just one of the problems we already have. We have problems already with Senate Ministers appearing before Estimates committees. Arrangements would just have to be made, and I think they could be made satisfactorily. It may be that Estimates committees will take a little longer to conclude their hearings if, in fact, we have to schedule meetings to suit the convenience of House of Representatives Ministers. However they would be getting much more accurate information from the responsible Minister than they would get from another Minister not familiar with the matter in question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report states that there would also be difficulty in predicting when particular departments would be examined by Estimates committees. I know that that is a problem already. In fact departments are taken in a certain order and no doubt they can keep in touch with Ministers. The report mentions a third difficulty in predicting in advance whether questions to be asked during the hearings were such as to require the attention of the Minister concerned. I should have thought that the Minister would want to attend-perhaps some of the questions would not concern him-to hear matters which arose during the consideration of his Department's estimates. The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA> The proposal also raises larger questions which go to the fundamentals of the bicameral system, for example, whether Ministers should appear before both Houses for the purposes of answering questions and presenting legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>I regard that objection as quite absurd. There is nothing fundamental in the bicameral system which prevents Ministers from meeting people from the other chamber. They constantly do this at party meetings. Ministers have been known to give evidence and supply submissions to Senate committees dealing with various matters. There seems to be no reason for thinking that this has anything to do with the fundamentals of the bicameral system. I believe that this measure would improve the Estimates process in this House and is one that should be persisted with. I think that Senator Martin's proposal that something along these lines be drafted and tried is worth while. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not object to Senator Martin's motion. I think it would be a good thing for this area to be investigated. There are some observations about the general issues I would like to put before the Standing Orders Committee. I make it clear that I am all for the responsible Ministers appearing appropriately before the Senate and Senate committees. I would like to see the development of a system where they appeared here at Question Time, and I would certainly like them to appear before Senate legislative and general purpose committees when legislation affecting that Minister is being considered, and I hope they will do a lot more of that. I am far from impressed with the effectiveness and usefulness of the Estimates committees as at present constituted by this chamber. My concern is that Estimates committees were originally established as a device by the Executive to head off the establishment of the legislative and general purpose committees. In my view, they should have been subsumed long ago into the legislative and general purpose committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When Estimates committees or legislative and general purpose committees consider the Estimates, their role is very limited. Unlike a committee of the American Senate, for instance, there is no chance of the estimates being altered. There is no feeling that the people appearing before the Committee have to justify their program for fear that it will be totally rejected. All that is happening is that it is providing a place where senators, particularly Opposition senators, can establish facts on issues that concern them and also persuade and perhaps force public servants to justify their expenditure a little better, but it does not ultimately affect much of the expenditure. We have to recognise that what is done by Estimates committees is, in fact, very limited. We must ensure that we do not set up too elaborate a machinery to achieve a relatively small objective. We took on this role because it was being grossly neglected by the House of Representatives, which I think constitutionally should have the primary financial responsibility. It was totally neglecting its responsibilities in this area, although it has now taken steps to set up Estimates committees. In the light of the establishment of the House of Representatives Estimates committees, we should look at the continuing role of our committees which I hope will be merged into the legislative and general purpose committees before too long. </PARA>
<PARA> While both Houses have Estimates committees, we have a rather elaborate machinery for a fairly small objective. I am not in favour of setting up a joint committee to examine the Estimates. I think that that would be constitutionally awkward and adminstratively very difficult. However I think we should look at some rationalisation procedure. Perhaps it would be sensible to have a system whereby Senate committees question Senate Ministers-that is their responsibility to the Parliament-and House of Representatives Ministers are questioned by committees of the House of Representatives. In view of the very limited value which I believe is achieved by Estimates committees, I think that that would be appropriate and effective machinery. Each House would have the responsibility for questioning the Ministers who are responsible to it. I think that that would be appropriate machinery for us to establish. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not seek to extend the debate to any extent because we have been debating the Standing Orders Committee report for a long time. However, I would like to comment on a couple of points that have been mentioned in the debate, particularly one which was made recently by Senator Hamer. We all have views on how Estimates committees might be changed and improved, but this motion does not involve a question of change. It is a question of how to improve the present system, not what other system might be better. For example, at another time I would seek to debate with Senator Hamer whether the Senate should question only Senate Ministers in Estimates committees and the House of Representatives should question only House of Representatives Ministers in Estimates committees. I would not like to feel that senators were cut out of what is a valuable process of questioning and information seeking just by the chance of the portfolios Senate Ministers happen to hold. Senator Hamer raised some alternatives, and I think that they are alternatives all of us could canvass. The question of what might happen to Estimates committees has been canvassed before in debate in the Senate. I emphasise that my motion has nothing to do with a new system of Estimates committees. It is looking at the present system, not saying that it is perfect, and asking how we can make this system work a little better.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we debated this matter on 11 March I outlined at some length my reasons for moving the motion now before the Senate and I do not intend to recanvass those points. However, other points were raised by honourable senators during the debate, and I will comment briefly on a couple of them. It was suggested that it was not appropriate to have House of Representatives Ministers come to Senate committees, for example, that there was something a little strange in the notion that a Senate Estimates committee could call the Prime Minister to give evidence on the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Senator Withers, by interjection when Senator Missen was speaking a few minutes ago, raised the question of whether there would be any compulsion to attend. At present there is no compulsion that I am aware of for Senate Ministers to appear before Senate Estimates committees. I am not proposing that if for some reason a House of Representatives Minister chose not to come there would be any compulsion. Perhaps that is another issue the Senate might want to address itself to, but it is not one that I sought to raise. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, he could send the Minister assisting. I assume that some Minister would appear before the committee to save the Government. I could not see the Government allowing Estimates committees to operate without a Minister being present at the committee to speak on behalf of the Government's Budget and Estimates. I would expect somebody to be there, and I would expect that many House of Representatives Ministers would choose to come to Estimates committees. It may be that, for some good and proper reason, the Prime Minister may not appear before an Estimates committee. It may be that he does appear. I think a good, strong argument exists for saying that it is in the interest of the Ministers to come to Estimates committees and not to be represented by someone else, but that is another issue. As I said, Senator Withers raised that question by way of interjection while Senator Missen spoke, and it is a valid point. We are simply asking the Standing Orders Committee to present to the Senate an amendment to the Standing Orders to enable this to happen. The proof of its worth would depend on the way it worked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The essence of the debate on this area of the Standing Orders Committee report is the quality of evidence that is given to Senate Estimates committees. I do not think any one would debate that it is highly variable. In my opinion Senate Ministers who appear before the committees to represent their own portfolios give good evidence. They know the detail and they can answer quite detailed questions. The quality of evidence from Senate Ministers representing the portfolio of another Minister, and who rarely answer many of the questions personally-most of them are directed to the officers-is highly variable. It varies very much from department to department. </PARA>
<PARA> I sat on a committee which took evidence from the Department of Foreign Affairs. I said at the committee-it is on record in the Hansard and I do not mind saying it again-that it is a pleasure to go through the estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs because of the promptness of delivery and detail of the evidence that is given to the committee. Good witnesses are sent to the committee. That Estimates committee rarely has to ask for additional information. Most questions are capable of being answered in some detail at the committee at the time they are asked. That is welcomed. We seek an improvement in the quality of evidence, given promptly on the spot, with the opportunity for honourable senators to follow up immediately an answer given in a committee and to probe further for more detail where they feel it is warranted. I suggest that my motion would lead to a refinement of the Estimates committees which would be in the interests of advancing their present operations. </PARA>

It makes no difference to me as I will not be here if and when proceedings are televised. I think the Committee wishes to get the Senate's advice. Personally, I am against the televising of committee meetings. I do not know whether television crews would be anxious to attend, other than at the first one or two meetings, once the novelty had worn off.

We know there are some moves in the House of Representatives, which had been strongly supported by Mr Speaker, to take steps to have televised at least the proceedings of the House of Representatives.

I think this chamber must be very careful not to fall behind in this area. I trust that while it merely notes this item it goes along with an initiative substantially of the House of Representatives, and will ensure that something will be done soon towards the televising of parliament. I hope that we will not fall too far behind such countries as Japan and Canada. I have a particular concern that we should not be too far behind Canada which seems to lead so much these days in other democratic areas.

I have a view that if Parliament is to be televised the telecast should be extremely limited. My view is based on my experience during the Joint Sitting of the Parliament. I am not referring necessarily to the occasion when, during a division, about four of us were enjoying a joke-anything to enliven the deadly dullness of a division-and on the closed circuit television in Parliament House it looked as though something very different was going on, such is the power of the television camera at a certain angle. That is in the archives for all time.

I am yet to be persuaded that they want to be that informed if, indeed, informed is what they would be as a result of seeing Parliament on television. Those are just a couple of matters which I mention briefly. I hope that the Senate Standing Orders Committee, if it is seriously addressing itself to something specific such as the televising of Question Time, will make sure that that is done on the same basis as are the radio rebroadcasts of Question Time-that is, that certain things that happen during Question Time which are ruled out of order are not rebroadcast. I think those who are not happy about having television in the parliamentary chamber are concerned that it could indeed change the nature of the way the Parliament operates at certain times when cameras are filming.

I do not think that is good for the Parliament. All those constraints should be taken into account. The only reason people seem to suggest the televising of Question Time over and over again is that it is the time with potentially the greatest entertainment value or, conversely, it is the time of Parliament with the least boredom factor; so it is the one time that could safely be shown on a television screen. That is a reflection, I think, on the workings of Parliament-the fact that it is not meant to be public entertainment or television-style entertainment anyway. I hope that the Committee in its deliberations will bear in mind that there are many senators and members who do not support the televising of Parliament or who, if Parliament is to be televised, only support it on a very limited basis. I also hope that simply because some people who hold positions of prestige in this Parliament support the televising of Parliament that does not mean it has to happen.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly on this matter and to assure Senator Martin that I was not scowling at her. I was concentrating on her words, as I always do. I think much is said about the televising of Parliament which is misconceived because of our lack of experience in this area and particularly because of our experience during the Joint Sitting when, as Senator Missen said, we had the crazy situation that we were forced to turn up at certain times to pretend that we were all very interested. In the Canadian House of Commons and in some of the provincial parliaments in Canada the proceedings are telecast. I believe the problems Senator Martin sees are largely overcome in Canada by the camera being fixed on the speaker and no one else so, if we did that, we could not have cameramen panning around the chamber catching Senator Withers doing things he might not like to be seen doing. That gets over the situation of people putting on a turn in the chamber in an effort to get on television. Similarly, in parliaments such as the West German Parliament where each speaker speaks from a dias, a fixed position, that problem is overcome by the cameras being confined to the speaker and not panning around the chamber, filming all the skylarking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1981 it seems to me to be more appropriate to televise the Parliament than to tie up one radio station all day every day that Parliament is sitting, thus preventing me on some days from listening to some music programs I want to listen to. Sometimes we broadcast proceedings such as debates on the Standing Orders about which no one outside the Parliament has a clue what we are talking about or the procedures for the introduction of Bills which occurs endlessly throughout some days. We know that governments-this Government included-deliberately so arrange the program on broadcasting days that nothing controversial or unfavourable to the Government will be broadcast. Frequently there will be only very boring things to broadcast. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may be soothing for the honourable senator but, as someone once said, watching cricket is like watching grass grow. It is a bit like listening to Parliament. I agree with the honourable senator. I believe that in 1981-in the days of modern communication-it would probably be more appropriate to televise proceedings than to tie up a radio network around Australia at enormous cost when the number of listeners cannot be detected in any rating survey. I think we should seriously look at our priorities and decide the compulsory broadcast of the proceedings of this Parliament is justified or whether televised proceedings would be more sensible in this modern age.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only comment I want to make relates to how we can slot in the televising of the Senate at prime viewing time. Sometimes football and hockey teams are reduced in size to seven members. A similar approach could be applied in televising selected debates in this chamber. Excellent dramatic senators could then appear at their most aggressive best, say in the adjournment debate. We could pick the issues we wanted televised. I would be prepared to let an effective television producer pick a segment from the three nights the Senate sits each week. We have had some magnificent nights here. Some honourable senators could assume the role of Clint Eastwood. Perhaps Senator Martin and Senator Melzer could emulate Jane Fonda at her best in their across the chamber attacks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whatever people may say, I do not think that an honourable senator who speaks on the adjournment debate is other than imbued with somebody's cause. Senator Grimes would get a maximum billing from the Greek community if he pursued, to the considerable embarrassment of the Government, the alleged social security frauds saga. I think his raising of that matter has paid excellent dividends. I know of many other incidents that would be of great interest. I recall one or two lurid interludes I had with people in the Democratic Labor Party who are no longer members of the chamber. Working with the media we could choose segments on particular issues for televising to the voting public. I think that is a very fertile idea. I am sure the President has caught on to it. </PARA>

My stance might make Senator Grimes rethink his statement and have another look at what he said. When I heard what Senator Grimes said I had to rethink my views too. I still came to the conclusion that he is right. I believe that televising the proceedings of this chamber would be disastrous. I believe this place has a totally different atmosphere on broadcasting days as it is. I believe that debate on Wednesday, broadcast day, is totally different from debate on Tuesday or Thursday. On broadcast day honourable senators try to speak at certain times. A tremendous amount of grandstanding goes on. On non-broadcast day we can have a very good debate. It nearly breaks my heart to see the difference between broadcast day and Tuesday and Thursday.

The Joint Sitting gave the Territories representation in this chamber. Now we are faced with the problem of another Joint Sitting to elect a replacement senator. If we can believe what we read in the newspapers, there is some dispute as to where the Joint Sitting will be held. This report of the Senate Standing Orders Committee was brought down in this chamber in March last year. I hope that the Committee has given some consideration to whether television cameras will be allowed in this chamber, where I expect the forthcoming Joint Sitting to be held. In my view the Joint Sitting should be held here.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The carving is discreet. I would not say that it is a display. I have nothing against the insignia, but I do not think it adds very much to the Senate chamber. I am of the view that adding State Arms in an appropriate fashion, and there is room for them, would be something that would not only improve the appearance but also have some meaning in the chamber, given that we are elected on a particular basis related to the States. The report continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senators who favour the display of State Arms or insignia have stressed that this would need to be done with great discretion to avoid cluttering the Chamber. </PARA>
<PARA>There seems to be an obsession with discretion. I want to make it very clear that I am not opposed to discretion, just as I am not opposed to motherhood. On the other hand, in this context and particularly in this chamber, discretion does seem to mean drabness. I cannot imagine how a display of State insignia would clutter the chamber. It might brighten the chamber a little. It might provide something of interest on which members of the public who throng in their thousands to the public galleries every day might focus when the speeches are particularly boring and tedious. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee makes no recommendation on the matter, but the Senate will be asked to give its consideration to the subject. </PARA>
<PARA>What is not clear is whether we now are being asked to give consideration to the subject. If that is so, I just indicate that I think it is a good idea. I make the suggestion that, as a number of honourable senators clearly think it is a good idea, perhaps the Presiding Officers, particularly the President, may be able to obtain examples of what might be done or seek suggestions from honourable senators on what might be done and make those suggestions available to all honourable senators. We could then make a decision or could give advice to the President on the basis of something that actually had been shown to us. From one of Senator Evans's interjections and also from the reference in the report to 'cluttering the Chamber' I get the impression that there is thought of having banners fluttering from the ceiling. That is one possibility. I do not think it would be favoured. There are other possibilities which I think would enhance this chamber, and perhaps they could be put to us in a specific and detailed way. </PARA>

I think the dignity of this chamber is important. I know that the words 'discreet', 'discretion' and so forth are emphasised in the report. It is realised that something about the proposal is not very dignified and discreet. It would turn this place into something which looked like a glorified scout hall. A certain amount of dignity, form, robes and so forth is fine, but to hang on the walls insignia of the different States-I see it might even include flags-to my mind would be a backward step.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst I recognise the necessity for some protection, I often wonder whether we do not over-protect at times. We find ourselves in the position where what everyone can say privately was a bad decision by a judge or a biased decision by a judge or that there was some ulterior motive in the judge's decision, we cannot say that in Parliament although we are seen to believe it. Therefore, we are restricted somewhat in expressing our opinion of the judiciary which, after all, the Government appoints. That judge is then simply protected for the rest of his career without our having the right to condemn him publicly because the Standing Orders of this Parliament prohibit our doing so. I wonder whether there is anything amiss, anything wrong, in our saying that we think that the Chief Justice gave a frightful decision, or a decision which was influenced by his political motivation rather than the whole question of law. No one could ever say that there was justification for not permitting discussion and criticism of the Chief Justice's decision in the Webster case. No one can say that there was not justification for permitting the right to criticise the judge who made a decision in the case involving a member from Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; In taking advantage of the new method of dealing with reports, I intend to speak not at great length to at least four of the reports that the Senate is considering tonight. The four reports are all interwoven. I want to say at the outset that it was through the foresight of a Labor government in 1949 that the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority first came into being. Although our opponents often say during elections that the fate of this country could not be placed in the hands of the Australian Labor Party, when we look at most of the major public works projects in this country we find that they were all initiated by the Australian Labor Party. One of them was the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. Prior to that there was the construction of the east-west railway. I instance also the Pipeline Authority which was brought into being by my late colleague, Rex Connor. That Authority certainly came in for a lot of criticism at the time of its establishment, but is now proving to be a very worthwhile project. Even the people of Canberra will soon be benefiting from the natural gas which will come to this city as a result of the foresight of our late colleague, Rex Connor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most of the reports I want to speak to tonight -the annual report of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority, the annual report of the Snowy Mountains Council, the annual report of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation and the annual report of the River Murray Commission - are, I suppose, offspring of the initial piece of legislation which was introduced into the House of Representatives on 25 May 1949 by Mr Lemmon, the then Minister for Works and Housing in the Federal Labor Government of that time. I was able to get today from the Senate Records office a copy of the first annual report of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. I want to quote some comments from it. It was delivered to Mr Casey, as he then was. I do not know what his portfolio was, but it does not matter. He was the responsible Minister at that time because the Labor Party had been defeated in 1949 on petrol rationing-an issue similar to one which could well bring about the defeat of this Government. Mr Menzies, as he then was, went to the people on the promise to lift petrol rationing, which Mr Chifley could quite easily have done if he had been prepared to sell out the nation and to buy very dear petrol. The wheel could well come full circle and the Fraser Government too could well go out of office on the issue of petrol, more than 30 years after the Labor Party was thrown out of office on the issue of petrol rationing. That disturbed me very greatly at the time because many of the people who voted Mr Menzies into office on his promise to abolish petrol rationing did not own a motor car. That is how easily the people of this country can be fooled. But I am not going to deal with that tonight. I want to deal with some of the remarks made in the first annual report of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority, for the year ended 30 June 1950, nearly 31 years ago. In the introduction the report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In the early and middle twenties there were other proposals concerned primarily with the supply of water to Sydney and other country towns. In 1937, the former hydro-electric scheme of 1915-1918 was reviewed and further investigated by the New South Wales Government. The estimated capacity of this proposal was approximately 250,000 kilowatts . . . </PARA>
<PARA>As I will point out later, that capacity has been vastly increased. That 250,000 kilowatts of electricity was about one-tenth of the capacity of the Snowy Mountains project. I continue:</PARA>
<PARA> These proposals were all limited to regional interests rather than full utilisation of the water resources of the area in the interests of the Nation as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>I should go back in time and say that it was not the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority which was generating 250,000 kilowatts; it was a project which had been proposed by the New South Wales Government of the day. I continue:</PARA>
<PARA> Later, in 1944, a Special Committee appointed by the New South Wales Government carried out further investigations into the possible use of the waters of the Snowy River and stressed the need to divert the water inland to the Murrumbidgee for irrigation. However, the Commonwealth had certain rights conferred by the Seat of Government Legislation of the Commonwealth and of the State of New South Wales. Victoria also was concerned in the proposals because the lower reaches of the Snowy River are in Eastern Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> Effective action was taken for the first time in 1946 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We must bear in mind that we had a Federal Labor government at that time, just 12 months after the cessation of hostilities in World War II. I continue:</PARA>
<PARA> Effective action was taken for the first time in 1946, when Ministers of the Commonwealth and the Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria, with their technical advisers, met to discuss the utilisation of the Snowy River waters. As a result of this Conference it was agreed that an investigation should be made to determine the practicability of a proposal to divert the Snowy waters into the Murray Valley and whether such a proposal justified a complete examination. This investigation was carried out by the Department of Works and Housing in regard to engineering matters and by the Department of Post War Reconstruction in regard to agricultural and economic aspects. Experts of the two State Governments collaborated with the Commonwealth representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> A report on this investigation was considered at a Premiers Conference in 1947 and it was agreed that further investigations were fully justified. A Technical Committee with representatives from the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victoria, under the Chairmanship of Dr L. F. Loder, Director-General of Works and Housing, was set up for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> This Committee in a report of November, 1948, recommended a broader approach to the development of the area than was embraced by either the Snowy-Murrumbidgee proposal or the Snowy-Murray proposal and put forward a scheme for the diversion of the Snowy River waters and their use in combination with the waters of the Upper Murrumbidgee, Tumut and Upper Murray Rivers and their tributaries. </PARA>
<PARA> A conference of Ministers representing the Commonwealth and States of New South Wales and Victoria in February, 1949, considered this Report and generally agreed with the recommendations. The Conference also decided that the Committee should continue investigations. </PARA>
<PARA>That was in 1946 when the then Labor Government, in discussions with the Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria, first talked about a major scheme in the Snowy Mountains and about water supply. I understand from my reading that after the defeat of the then Labor Government, Mr Menzies boycotted the opening of the Snowy Mountains scheme because he said it would be a white elephant. We all know what a great benefit it has been to this country. It is a great tribute to the foresight of the then Prime Minister, Ben Chifley. If we cast our minds a little further afield, we find that it took 23 years before anything constructive was done by a Federal government about the quality and quantity of the River Murray water. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was speaking earlier this week on the first reading of a money Bill I gave credit to Dr Moss Cass who, when he was the Federal Labor Minister for the Environment and Conservation, set up a series of discussions and brought down a policy-I referred to it the other night-on the quantity and the quality of water in the River Murray. He set up the River Murray working parties. It can be clearly seen that the Federal Labor Government was cognisant of the need to do something to safeguard the River Murray water in the three States through which it flows and to do something about water storage. So never let it be said again that a Federal Labor government has not any foresight, cannot govern this country properly and never seems able to cater for the needs of the community. We must bear in mind that the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act came into being just 12 months after the cessation of hostilities in World War II. While a Labor government was left to carry out the war effort, it never lost sight of the fact that when the war finished there would be many things to be done on the local scene; and it set about doing them. As I said, on 25 May 1949, after that conference of Ministers representing the Commonwealth and the States of New South Wales and Victoria, Mr Lemmon introduced a Bill entitled the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Bill. In his second reading speech of 26 May 1949 he stated that the potential power from this system would be 1,720,000 kilowatts. At the end of his second reading speech-I think this is something which we ought to bear in mind-he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this scheme will be one of the greatest single factors that will make it possible for this country to carry a greatly increased population. It will also be one of the greatest factors to bring about a permanent and effective policy of decentralisation. Because of the great quantity of water that will be made available for irrigation, and the cheap power that will be generated, there is no reason why we should not see, in our time, inland cities in the Murray Valley and the Murrumbidgee Valley that should carry a population of 1,000,000 people. The Government faces this task of construction in the knowledge that it will encounter many problems. No doubt, at times, we shall meet with some disappointments, and the work will have many critics. However, those critics, in the main, will be people who have little faith. This Government has faith in its engineers, its people and the future of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>They were the words of Mr Lemmon in 1949, and those words were true. Those of use who travel between here and South Australia through the Riverina witness the great productivity in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, and that has been made possible only by the construction of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Scheme and all that goes with it. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable senators look at the 31st annual report of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority 1979-80 they will find that the total generating capacity now of the hydro-electric scheme is 3,740,000 kilowatts and that through diversion, regulation and control of the rivers an additional enormous amount of water is available not only for irrigation areas but also for domestic use. If it were not for this scheme many people in South Australia would not be able to use the Murray River and the people who live at Port Pirie, Port Augusta, and Whyalla and many people in Adelaide would not have an adequate water supply. The 1979-80 report of the Snowy Mountain's Hydro-electric Authority states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act 1949 established the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority which is constituted by a Commissioner as a corporation sole with perpetual succession. Under the Act the Authority is empowered to construct, maintain, operate, protect, manage and control works for the collection, diversion and storage of water and for the generation of electricity in the Snowy Mountains Area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Snowy Mountains Scheme is a dual purpose hydro-electric and irrigation complex located in South-Eastern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>It is one of the major wonders of the world today. When I read through some of the speeches made in the other place and some public statements made by opponents of this scheme, it amazes me that every Labor government-whether back in those days or even between 1972 and 1975- has come under severe criticism from our opponents to the effect that we are not capable of governing the country. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other reports with which we are dealing tonight is the Pipeline Authority annual report. The Authority will be a perpetual monument to our late colleague, Mr Rex Connor, who with his vision and foresight was able to pilot that legislation but he had difficulties with it. If it had not been for a Joint Sitting of both Houses of Parliament after the 1974 double dissolution we might not have had that pipeline authority operating today and the people in Sydney might not have been availing themselves of natural gas from the Moomba fields. </PARA>
<PARA> These things should be put on the record and should be repeatedly talked about to remind people that Labor was capable in office during the war years and was capable from 1972 to 1975. It will be capable again of bringing in legislation which will be of great benefit not only to the people who support our party but, in the main, to the people who oppose it. One of the other great things which was brought about by the Labor Government was Trans-Australia Airlines. We now find that the Government is in the process of trying to hand it over to private enterprise. Where will we be then? The Government will hand it over to Murdoch. He eventually will get his hands on it because he is a very strong supporter of the Government. Through various and devious means if this Government keeps its promise to turn TAA into a public company it will throw the baby out the window with the bath water and offer a great reward to its wealthy mates for services rendered. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that my colleague, Senator Mulvihill, who has had a deep involvement in the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority and who had great pride some months ago in taking part in a ceremony which paid tribute to people of many nations who worked on that project, will have a few words to say on this matter tonight. We in the Labor Party are proud not only of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority but also of the Snowy Mountains Council, whose report is tabled here for discussion tonight. We are proud at the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation which is another offshoot of the vision of a Labor government, but of course it is an old venture with a new name brought about by this Government. Because we are not carrying out any major government construction works in Australia today, we have lost the expertise of the people in the corporation. They have to go overseas to carry out work. We should be using them here and the Government should make more money available to carry out the necessary major works of which these people are capable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to deal with two reports tonight. The first one is the River Murray Commission annual report for 1980. Many South Australians on both sides of the chamber have expressed their concern on numerous occasions regarding the quality of water in the River Murray and the future quality and supply of water in the River Murray. Senator McLaren, who is a South Australian, has had quite a deal to say about this matter. He and I do not see eye to eye with regard to the way in which we perhaps can overcome some of the problems. Nevertheless I think it is significant in this place that South Australians, generally, irrespective of their parties, have continually expressed concern, not just during this session but over a period of years, with regard to the River Murray system. Dealing with waste discharges, under the heading 'Australian Newsprint Mills-Albury', the report refers to the need for some quality control. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a number of items regarding the treatment facilities of the Mill--</PARA>
<PARA>That is at Albury-</PARA>
<PARA>which are still subject to discussion and await resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>They are very good words and perhaps give us a lot of encouragement, coming from a responsible body. But the matter which concerns me is that the River Murray Commission is made up of representatives of three States and the Commonwealth. The Commission virtually has no control whatsoever with regard to water quality. It has control with regard to quantity-there is a quota system for the three States of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia-but no real control over water quality. The constitution of the River Murray Commission spells out very clearly that whilst the Commission can make recom- mendations-recommendations, I might add, are not directions-it must do so by a unanimous decision. So we have a situation which perhaps could be described on some occasions as farcical. In real terms, one of those representatives of the Commission would have to sit in judgment upon himself and the State. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the concern I expressed with regard to the proposed newsprint mill at Albury. I have expressed this opinion before in this place. The River Murray Commission has no control whatsoever over any of the feed systems of the River Murray. Let me make that clear. It has no control over any of the tributaries or feed systems whatsoever but, if there is agreement, it can make recommendations or suggestions. Discussions are being held at the present time to give this toothless tiger, if I may describe it in that way, some teeth in regard to water quality control. Let me make it clear that the Commission has done an excellent job in the areas in which it has power to do things, but as far as water quality is concerned it is virtually a toothless tiger because its powers are restricted. I hope that serious consideration will be given to extending the powers of the Commission so that a majority decision will rule and directions can be given in reality. South Australia, and Victoria for that matter, particularly in the irrigation regions, and Senator McLaren is very conscious of the problem because he also is very interested in the River Murray--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am referring to the irrigation areas. In South Australia and over the border into Victoria many people are involved in irrigation in the huge horticultural industry. The future of those people will be in jeopardy if the quality of the River Murray water is not looked after. The situation in respect of salinity is a grave one, and a good deal of work is being done in that area. I commend the governments concerned, including the Federal Government, and the River Murray Commission for what is happening. If I may refer to the salinity mitigation works at Barr Creek in Victoria, the work on salt disposal has meant that instead of the salt flowing into the River Murray it is being fed back into dry pools. From Barr Creek alone some 42,700 tonnes of salt has been kept out of the River Murray. From Lake Hawthorn some 17,600 tonnes of salt has been turned back. It is evident that a good deal of work is being done in this area by the River Murray Commission, with the agreement of the States. I come back to the point on which I started my speech. Until such time as somebody has authority to control the quality of the water in the River Murray we will have problems, and as time goes on the problems will become greater.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the Darling River area, which was discussed in this place the other night. There is genuine concern in South Australia about the proposal to increase the area of irrigation in New South Wales. Having said that, I hasten to state that it is the right of New South Wales to increase its irrigation if it wishes, but it is also our right to express our genuine concern, which we hope will be noted by the other States, and particularly the State of New South Wales. Because of the dry seasons, this year the River Murray is not flowing in real terms. In fact, it has been stated that the sand bar at the entrance to the sea is closing up the River Murray at the present time. If there is excessive drainage from the River Murray, a situation could arise in which there will be a slowing down of the river flow. When the river flow slows down we finish up with salt slugs in the river, which has disastrous effects in the lower reaches, and I refer to such large irrigation areas as Mildura, Renmark, Barmera, and Waikerie in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the State Ministers and the Federal Government through its representatives will show genuine concern and treat the River Murray system not so much as a system that runs through the three States of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia but as a national system. This river system supplies national industries with their life blood, that is, water. It is no use supplying poor quality water because that would only destroy what I call a national industry. </PARA>
<PARA> While I have the opportunity to speak briefly about this area, as a South Australian I do not want to appear to be parochial but I do want to express concern about the quantity of water that will flow in the longer term down the River Murray. It is correct that at the present time South Australia is able to obtain its water quota, but it may not be known to many people that the city of Adelaide and the northern areas of South Australia are dependent to a great extent on the waters of the River Murray, and I refer not only to water quality but also to the quantity of water available. We have been fortunate, and we hope that will continue, but my concern is that as South Australia continues to expand, unless technology comes to the fore with some other method to supply fresh water, be it through desalination or in some other way, South Australia will become more and more dependent on the waters of the River Murray to supply its urban and industrial needs. Hence there is a genuine concern for both the quality and quantity, but in particular the quality, of the water from the River Murray. </PARA>
<PARA> Having spoken very briefly on this matter, and one could expand much more the argument on the need for water quality control in the River Murray, I turn now to the annual report for 1979-80 of the Department of National Development and Energy. In particular I wish to speak on the great expansion that is taking place today in oil exploration in Australia. This Government can take much of the credit for what is being done, but I must concede that it cannot take all of the credit. The Whitlam Government introduced and supported not so much import parity pricing but a system whereby incentives would be given for oil exploration in Australia, and I admit that. However, this Government has stuck to its guns all the way through in introducing, defending, supporting and continuing import parity pricing for crude oil, which has had a big bearing upon the level of oil exploration that is taking place today. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HV7">Senator YOUNG</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been interjections in the chamber tonight from Opposition Senators criticising the Government's policy on import parity. Import parity pricing, which was introduced in 1978, is one of the best things this Government has done in energy conservation. The need for energy conservation is not peculiar to Australia. It is international concern, a growing concern, and a concern that will continue to grow. Australia is playing its part in the conservation of energy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we had not done something about fuel conservation in Australia, we could have found ourselves in a very invidious position in the mid-1980s. In the mid-1970s many people estimated that whilst at that stage Australia was 70 per cent self-sufficient in oil, by the mid-1980s our indigenous supplies would be less than 40 per cent of requirements. Such a situation would adversely affect our balance of payments and also perhaps place us in the rather risky position of being dependant upon overseas supplies. As we have seen in the last couple of years, at times they can be very insecure. One only has to remember the bubbly situation in the Middle East to appreciate fully the insecurity of supplies of crude oil. Australia has avoided this rundown in its reserves because of the increased exploration that has taken place. It has been estimated in some quarters that if at present we were buying all of our crude oil from overseas our annual payment would be in the vicinity of $4,500m, which of course would have an adverse effect upon our balance of payments and our balance of trade. Over and above that the Government would also be losing something like $3,096m in revenue which it has from the oil levy at present. </PARA>
<PARA> One only has to stop and think of what is happening in regard to our economy today. We have withstood the international pressures of great increases in interest rates. I agree that interest rates have risen in Australia, but there is a marked difference between interest rates in this country and interest rates in the major trading and manufacturing countries overseas. There has been a vast difference in inflation and in regard to deficits. Australia is reducing its deficit whilst many countries overseas have increased deficits. So we come back to the contribution that import parity has made to the stability of the economy of this country. I repeat: If we were running down reserves at present and becoming more dependent on overseas supplies we would have an adverse balance of payments and, of course, without import parity we would have had some $3,000m less revenue. One can see the benefits. Import parity pricing imposes what I call a progressive tax. It has made petrol dearer-we all appreciate this fact-but the person who can afford and who wishes to drive a big car, a luxury car, is using more litres per kilometre-we have to speak in metrics-and therefore is making a greater contribution because of import parity pricing than the person driving a smaller car. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the comparative prices in Australia and overseas. I will cite recent figures relating to the period between October 1980 and January of this year. For example, in Italy the price of petrol is 73c a litre; Japan, 68c a litre; Norway, 65c a litre; France, 64c a litre; Greece, 63c a litre; Austria 56c a litre; West Germany, 50c a litre and the United Kingdom, 60c a litre. On the average, Australians have been paying about 33c a litre. Yes, we have been paying more for petrol with import parity pricing but let us be honest, for too long our petrol has been too cheap. I can only say that it was a completely wasted resource. </PARA>
<PARA> The reasons why the Government introduced import parity pricing are contained under the heading of 'Energy Policy' in the annual report of the Department of National Development and Energy. The first reason is to ensure conservation of liquid fuels. We can see that this is what has happened since petrol went up in price. Petroleum sales dropped by almost one per cent in 1980 compared with a 2 per cent increase in 1979. There has been 3 per cent difference in consumption in that area. The policy of fuel substitution has had its effect; it has conserved crude oil. In 1980 there was a rather substantial reduction in sales of heating oil. Sales were down by some 47 per cent; sales of lighting kerosene were down by 23 per cent; sales of industrial diesel decreased by 18 per cent and sales of fuel oil were down by 17 per cent. In 1980 the production of natural gas increased by 14 per cent and the sales of liquefied petroleum gas were also up by 9 per cent. These commodities previously were hardly ever used but today their use is on the increase. I have not been able to obtain the 1981 figures for consumption but I am certain that when we get further down the line, later in 1981, we will find the same indicators going in the same direction as in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> In industry generally we find, for example, in Sydney in 1979 that industrial conversion from furnace oil to gas saved some 2 million barrels of oil. That is about one per cent of Australia's total liquid production. One can clearly see that in the field of conservation and substitution the Government policy is definitely working. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the area of exploration. I think this is perhaps one of the most interesting areas of all. In 1972 the total number of wells drilled in Australia was some 101. There was a gradual decline until 1975 when the number of wells drilled totalled 23. Because of the exodus of drilling rigs from Australia and the lack of capacity and ability to do any drilling it took quite some years for the situation to recover. From 101 wells drilled in 1972 the figure declined to 23 wells in 1975, 21 wells in 1976 and 21 wells in 1977. By that time confidence was returning to the oil exploration industry. Also with the Government backing the policy of import parity which encouraged companies to explore for oil-a very costly exercise-there was an upturn in oil exploration. In 1978, the year of introduction of import parity pricing, 52 wells were drilled. In 1979, 59 wells were drilled and in 1980 some 86 wells were drilled. </PARA>
<PARA> This year the situation is even better. I will cite some figures from the APEA bulletin, the Australian Petroleum Exploration Assocation publication, which provides figures direct from industry, not from government. This year it is stated that over $400m will be spent on what is called wildcat exploration where companies, not knowing whether oil is present, drill structures in the hope of striking oil or gas. Over $1,000m will be spent on the development of oil fields that have already been proven. Here is the return of confidence to the industry which is a result of the backing of policies in this country. The expenditure of $1,400m will fund the drilling of 137 exploration wells in Australia. That is very different from 21 wells. In 1981 up to 130 exploration wildcat wells will be drilled and some 86 developmental wells will be drilled in Australia. This gives a total of some 220 wells. The figure given of 20 off-shore wells may be slightly lower because of the problem at present of getting exploration rigs. Having said that, there is confidence in the industry and the only limitation upon exploration of off-shore areas at present, as I said, is the limitation in the availability of rigs. </PARA>
<PARA> Oil exploration is very expensive. It is estimated that in Bass Strait it costs something like $10m to drill a well. At the Exmouth plateau the cost of drilling varies between $15m and $25m for one hole-win, lose or draw. When one talks about that sort of cost and distance away from the market place or refinery it can clearly be seen that there needs to be a sufficient guaranteed price for oil to make worth while the risks and to show companies they can make a profit. If this is not the case companies will not look for oil in remote areas. The North Sea was a shining example, in its initial stages, of what companies will do when the incentive is there to look. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to a statement made in the Press a couple of days ago in which it was stated by a senior Canadian oil man that there will be much more Canadian investment and expertise coming into this country because of the adverse policies and disincentives of the Canadian Government at present. This is not the sort of thing we want to see happen in this country. There is a need to find more oil in Australia. Every incentive and every encouragement is being given to companies to explore. I am delighted to see that the response of the oil industry is such that it is prepared to pour in something like $1,400m in the current year purely in the area of oil exploration and development for a commodity that is so scarce throughout the world. If it can be found beneath our waters or on our mainland it will give us security, the sort of security we will need in today's energy-hungry world in which people are prepared to enter high-risk ventures. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that import parity has done-I do not have time to deal with it tonight because many other people wish to speak-is also in the area of substitute fuels. I refer to coal liquefaction. At the present time many overseas experts and technocrats are coming to Australia to assist in the research and, we hope, development of coal liquefaction which can take advantage of the huge coal reserves that we have in this country. This will be done only because of the fact that crude oil will continue to increase in price. The increase in price will mean that the stage will be reached where it will be economical to convert coal to liquids. If we did not have that increase in price then these gentlemen would not be here and the research would not go on. The same consideration also applies to our huge reserves of shale oil in Australia. I think the Government can be very pleased with the response that it has had to its policy which has been criticised. So many people in the country today are becoming more conscious of the fact that the right decisions were made. I am certain that in a few years time they will commend the Government for the stand it took and the courage, the wisdom and foresight it showed in its policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to devote most of my relatively short comments in supplementation of what Senator McLaren referred to, namely, the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority annual report. Firstly I am prompted to make a few cautious observations on the remarks of Senator Young. I notice that his theme was the encouragement of oil exploration. He referred to the influx of exploration in Australia. I think he has to face up to the fact that one of the reasons the big oil corporations have turned to Australia is because there are so many areas of turbulence in the world where, in theory, they would have liked to explore. It could be Indonesia or different areas in the Middle East. When a new government comes to power the companies are expatriated. There is a certain amount of fear. I think we have to look at this situation in a more realistic form. They know on what side their bread is buttered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Maybe Mr Trudeau has a conflict with various provincial governments in Canada. I do not think it matters whether it is the Ottawa or the Canberra government which wants to have the major say. Long before the Allende regime in Chile a Christian Democratic Party member named Frei was President. He is still around. I suppose he was a centrist. He was fairly progressive in some aspects of economic policy. In his book he gave some illuminating ideas about the Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey. Of course it had a big stake in Chile and Mr Frei found out that there had been no adjustment in royalties for 15 years. He told the oil companies that they could do better and they did. As Senator Cavanagh would appreciate, President Frei said: 'Look, I am not a leftist; I am a Christian Democrat'. The company said: 'It is our policy never to consider raising royalties unless the government pressures us'. I throw in that point because, as good as some of these oil companies appear to be, they try to get away with things. I read all their annual reports. I lay it on the line. I have no shares in any oil company. </PARA>
<PARA> I deal now with the conservation aspect. BP Australia Ltd brought Harry Butler to Barrow Island and now the habitat for wallabies has considerably improved. I think some other oil companies might emulate BP's policy and put back something in the field of conservation. Louisana in the United States has a very elaborate system in regard to conservation. I have my own views on this matter and I will not argue too much tonight about the role of State governments as against the role of the Federal Government on off-shore oil drilling. Recently I told one major oil group at a function that I hoped it would in some way emulate BP and do something for conservation. I make the same criticism of woodchip operators and people in our fishing industries as I do of oil exploration. The Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment has recommended a levy on woodchip exports. I would like to see a specific levy on oil exploration so that we reach the target of about $150,000 per annum which Dr Harry Frith wants for a beefed-up massive research into wildlife to combat certain ailments, whether it be an eye complaint with possums or something of that nature. This involves only a small cost to industry. Whether it be oil exploration or the woodchip industry generally. I believe the Federal Government and, in some instances, the State governments have to hint to the companies about a levy and let them come to the party. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the remarks made by Senator McLaren. It is true that six or seven Saturdays ago I was very fortunate to participate in a function when at long last we unveiled a plaque in honour of 123 men who lost their lives in industrial accidents on that major project, the Snowy Mountains scheme. It was a very effective function. Unfortunately a very illustrious Premier, Sir William McKell, could not be present, but people of the calibre of a retired justice, Stan Taylor, Mr Charlie Oliver, a dominant figure in the Australian Workers Union, and a host of other people were present. Mr Oliver made a major contribution to the ceremony. I believe, now the plaque has been unveiled and homage has been paid to those who made that supreme sacrifice in the industrial field, the authority should see that adequate publicity is given to the long-delayed tribute to people from many lands. The tribute could be linked with the Department of Foreign Affairs. People could see in the Press through publicity, via our embassies, that we have paid some small tribute to these people who came from probably 30 different nations. </PARA>
<PARA> At the termination of the official proceedings Radio Yugoslavia was present and a number of Slovenes who spearheaded the agitation for this plaque were interviewed. They conveyed to Yugoslavia that the Australian Government, aided by the trade union movement and ethnic communities generally, had finally brought this recognition to fruition. I believe the matter should not end there. I think the authorities-the cost may be debited to the Department of Foreign Affairs-should see that this plaque and its tribute are projected overseas. I spoke to relatives of people who came here from the United States, Ireland, Yugoslavia which I mentioned earlier, and Italy. I think this tribute should be projected further afield. </PARA>
<PARA> The message that Senator McLaren conveyed was that there is nothing unclean or repugnant about centralised government from Canberra. The idealogical terminology 'democratic centralism' could have been used but I prefer to think the term 'defence powers' was hinted at. There is no question about it. After World War II there was a clamour for everyone to do his own thing. People have individual rights. If a nation is to be great, there must be some determination, some drive from Canberra. When the late President Kennedy was inaugurated he said that it was not a question of what America would do for people but what people would do for the United States. The same situation applies in relation to this project. It may be conceded that most of the States had enlightened Premiers, but if we did not have the necessary thrust from Canberra and hints that we may have had to use defence powers, we may not have got the project under way. There is no question about that. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that we are talking about mineral exploration. It is true that we cannot ignore its vital role at the moment. The most precious jewel in Australia has always been adequate water. I refer to that famous stanza 'I Love a Sunburnt Country'. The process of evaporation has always been a hidden enemy. That is why adequate water storage is of paramount importance. I have said again and again that the Federal Government constantly has to be in the vanguard with these sorts of projects. I think of the magnitude of the achievement in the Snowy Mountains. The dilution of central government in favour of State rights is bad for Australia. We cannot afford the luxury of it. </PARA>
<PARA> I was in the Northern Territory recently. Members of the Northern Territory administration were implying that the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service rangers are foreigners. These suggestions always amaze me. If one applies that criterion, the bulk of people in high places in the Northern Territory are foreigners themselves. As the Senate would know, one of my prime targets is the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Paul Everingham. Let us look at Paul Everingham's history. He was educated at a college in Brisbane. He is a Queenslander. I do not hold it against any senator for being from Queensland-far from it. At the same time, I think we ought to face up to the fact that we are not Queenslanders, Victorians or New South Welshmen; we are Australians. The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service rangers tell us how people ostracise them because they put the value of Australia ahead of some of the greedy mining companies for which Paul Everingham would sell his soul. There is no other way to put it. Paul Everingham is one of those people who genuflects in front of mining companies every week. I have before me a lovely letter from him. In fiendish delight he told me that he had personally dictated it. I do not mind. I have dictated letters to him which are just as vicious. </PARA>
<PARA> I make this point quite seriously. When I travel with Senate committees to this new frontier of the Northern Territory it jars me to see how Paul Everingham and his Ministers, his offsiders-I will not use the word 'lackeys'-look at us southerners and treat us with suspicion. I think that when we put our patriotism on the line, anybody who has served in this national Parliament can look any of his State counterparts in the eye and assure him that he is not a Benedict Arnold. I can see Senator Grimes nodding his head. I have grave doubts about some of the people who constitute the Northern Territory Parliament. Judging from some of the queer statements they make, they are almost on a par with one or two of the backwoodsmen in the Queensland Parliament who used to wage a vendetta against our colleage, Senator Georges. I regret-I do not want to discuss this in his absence-that the Senate's own venerable President has fallen over backwards at times to protect our detractors by preventing us from speaking in the same vein in the Senate. I think that the patience of most of us wears thin when we read the comments of some of the parliamentarians in Darwin. Of course I am talking about Paul Everingham and his crew, but the attitude of one or two Federal National Country Party parliamentarians from north Queensland is not much better. The way in which they go on is a disgrace to the parliamentary system. I think I have that target--</PARA>

The embarkation by the Federal Government on more of these national projects would not be in any way murky or unsavoury. There should be more of them. I repeat that the Snowy Mountains Authority brought together the best of a reasonable Australian nationalism. We did not aspire to anyone else's territory. With the bonanza that may occur in relation to off-shore oil drilling-with all respect to Senator Young-Canberra has to keep its eye on the wheeler-dealers.

I support Senator Mulvihill on that matter, but I do not think that continually referring to these companies as 'greedy mining companies', would encourage them. I suggest that the use of that description is psychologically wrong and that it would be more appropriate to couch phrases in a way that would encourage the mining companies to achieve the results that Senator Mulvihill and I would like them to achieve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to deal with the papers relating to the Ranger uranium project. Having been in that part of Australia on four separate occasions, I think I am in a position to recognise the problems as well as the progress that is being made in developing uranium in the Northern Territory. The Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment, of which I am chairman, determined to examine the area before mining commenced at Ranger and after mining was completed at Nabarlek. Recently we returned to examine the situation after the processing of ore had commenced at Nabarlek and when the processing plant was being constructed at Ranger. Even before that, some committee members visited the Australian Atomic Energy Commission at Lucas Heights to obtain from people who are experienced in those areas of scientific knowledge information on the environmental aspects of the region. I was pleased to learn that the Atomic Energy Commission had done basic studies on that area for about eight years and to a degree had established baselines upon which it could judge the impact of future mining in the area. I was pleased to note that the mining companies concerned are very conscious of the need to respect the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Nabarlek area there is a small, very rich, ore body, and the processing period will last for only about eight years. In spite of that, the companies are very conscious of the need to monitor the environmental impact on the waters surrounding the area. In concert, and under the supervision of the Supervising Scientist I believe they are making a credible attempt to monitor their activities. The Ranger proposition, of course, is far greater in extent because its ore body is far larger. In fact, the latest resource estimates for Nabarlek are 7,000 tonnes of ore, with a planned initial production capacity of 830 tonnes per annum. The latest resource estimates for Ranger are 77,200 tonnes of uranium with a planned initial production capacity of 2,300 tonnes. So the two projects are vastly different. In regard to Ranger, I was interested to learn that in the 1980 annual report of Peko-Wallsend Ltd it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> On 8 September 1980, an Agreement was entered into by E.R.A., Peko and EZ with a number of German and Japanese organisations, principally being power utilities, for those organisations to participate as shareholders in E.R.A. In addition, those overseas organisations, or interests related to them entered into sales contracts with E.R.A. to purchase 30,648 tonnes of uranium concentrates over the period 1982 to 1996. Adding to this the 6,320 tonnes of concentrates already sold by Peko and EZ and the 1,011 tonnes of concentrate previously borrowed by Peko and EZ from the Government stockpile and due to be returned to it, approximately 84 per cent of the initial designed capacity of the Ranger project has now been sold or otherwise committed. </PARA>
<PARA>I was also interested to learn that the initial planned stages of this project will last for about 15 years but that the whole project is contemplated as being a 30-year development program. In regard to Ranger, a laboratory costing $1.3m has been completed at Jabiru. This laboratory is currently manned by a staff of nine scientists and laboratory assistants, who are continually monitoring the environmental aspects of the mining area, including water quality tests and the effect of mining on birds and feral animals. This staff is headed by a scientist who spent a number of years with the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. The number of staff will be increased ultimately to, I think, about 14 people, and it is costing the company about $1m a year to service and run the operation. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was at Jabiru I was impressed by what the scientist in charge told me. He said that he believes that, to his knowledge, the environmental laboratory is the best in Australia and probably one of the best in the southern hemisphere. That indicates that the companies concerned have quite a regard for the need to manage their operations properly and to ensure that whatever they do is not to the detriment of the environment of the area. While I was there I was interested also in a proposition being contemplated to build a laboratory, at an estimated cost of over $5m, which can be used jointly by the Commonwealth Government and the Government of the Northern Territory. The laboratory is planned to be constructed in the Ranger area. I think this proposal is very important because it will bring together in one building the scientific expertise of both the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory. Of course, the cost of construction will be shared between the Commonwealth Government and the Northern Territory Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this is a very important matter that must be given priority by the Government in the forthcoming Budget, and I am sure that all members of my Committee would agree with that concept. I notice that Senator Mulvihill is nodding, and I am sure that Senator Melzer would appreciate the value of bringing together this scientific expertise to ensure that we maximise our surveillance, under the office of the Supervising Scientist, of the operations being carried out in that very significant developmental area of Australia. I imagine that within a fairly short time the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment will have more to say about that matter. Senator Mulvihill made a very important point which must be borne in mind. In any development which goes on in this country, whether it be oil exploration, oil development, or gas development, there must be some element to look after the conservation of our wildlife and our natural environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point on which I will touch briefly is the matter of nuclear fuel. In spite of what is said these days by many people in the community, there is no question in my mind that nuclear fuel, nuclear power, is less damaging to the environment in general terms than any other fuel. I say that because in December I visited the Hinkley Point B nuclear power station in Devon in the United Kingdom, and I was most impressed by the conducted tour I had. The engineers certainly have a very great regard for the environment surrounding that power station. In fact, they conduct regular tests on animals within a radius of about 10, 15 or 20 kilometres of that power station. They do regular checks on the milk of the cows in the area, the vegetation, and so on to ensure that there is no elevation in the level of natural radiation that persists in the surrounding countryside. I was quite happy that they were monitoring their operations with infinite care. The following day I spent talking with officials of the Department of the Environment in the United Kingdom. They are extremely relaxed about storage technology for radioactive waste. At present about 20,000 tonnes of radioactive waste are stored in what they regard to be perfectly satisfactory and secure conditions. </PARA>

<PARA> I mention one significant aspect. That source of energy will be available very soon. United Kingdom nuclear technology is at a stage where the waste will be able to be utilised as fuel with absolutely minimal residual environmental effects. It will provide the same amount of energy that 48 million tonnes of coal would generate. Such coal generation would have absolutely disastrous consequences on the environment because of the proliferation of CO2 and SO2 and is a far greater problem than the generation of nuclear power. The 20,000 tonnes of radioactive waste would also generate the same amount of power that would be generated from the use of 27 million tonnes of oil which would last the United Kingdom for 750 years. </PARA>

One aspect of the United Kingdom's conservation policy worries me in particular and also the Department of the Environment. People are encouraged to insulate their homes. Many homes in Yorkshire, Scotland and other parts of the United Kingdom are built of granite. Horror of horrors! Granite happens to be radioactive. At present, uninsulated, a granite house will experience an air exchange about five times in an hour.

I am concerned-Senator Melzer should also be concerned-about what happens when the granite radioactive houses are insulated. When these houses are insulated the air exchange will be reduced to once or twice per hour. I am worried about that. I am worried about Parliament House in Adelaide, which is radioactive. It is built of granite. I am worried because the radioactivity of Parliament House in Adelaide is far greater than the radiation that was emitted from the Australian Mineral Development Laboratories at Thebarton.

Canadians are extremely concerned at the burning of fossil fuels in America. The prevailing winds takes the sulphur dioxides and the carbon dioxides over the border. The acid rain which falls on the lakes of Canada creates tremendous environmental problems. Fish, wildlife and trees are dying in the vicinity of the industries.

<PARA> The last matter I would like to deal with in the spirit of friendliness and co-operation that exists in this chamber relates to the River Murray Commission and the River Murray. This matter has been the subject of incredible interest. (Quorum formed). I thank Senator McLaren for attracting an audience for me. I was about to speak on water and water resources, a subject which I believe is quite important nationally. I was about to mention the annual report of the River Murray Commission and the fact that in recent times that report has attracted a lot of attention, as well it should. It reports on matters of vital significance not only to Australia as a nation but also to South Australia in particular. Over a great number of years, probably 10 years-significantly, since the presentation of the report of the Davidson Committee, as Senator Mulvihill often calls the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution-we have heard a lot about and we have dealt with, I suppose in a tiresome way, water pollution. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequent reports have been presented, drawing the attention of the Federal Government and the State governments to the need to establish a national water authority to deal with the problem of water pollution in a constructive, proper and co-ordinated way. Our Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment, in its report dealing with the continuing scrutiny of water pollution in the River Murray system, supported the contention that that ought to happen. We suggested that the River Murray Commission ought to be given the teeth required to enable it to supervise water quality. I am glad to say that in recent times the necessity for that appears to have been recognised by the Federal Government and the State governments concerned. I think the Minister for National Development and Energy, Senator Carrick, said the other day that he hoped that that aspect of the activities of the River Murray Commission would be dealt with this session. I hope that that happens because many of us, on both sides of the House, believe that that is a critically important aspect of the management of the River Murray system. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Committee went further: We stated that the River Murray Commission ought to have the teeth and authority to deal with flood plain management, recreational activities along the river banks, industrial development and so on. I know that that is a difficult task because we have the Commonwealth-State problem; but I cannot see anything wrong with the River Murray Commission being given the authority to determine the parameters for the types of activities that ought to be carried out along that important river. </PARA>

But that really worries me. I have some figures dealing with the sodium levels in the River Murray. I have also some information on the effect of elevated sodium levels in public drinking water as a contributor to elevated blood pressure levels in members of the community. I will read an abstract from a paper I have which was written by Robert Tuthill, Ph.D., and Edward Calabrese, Ph.D., of the Division of Public Health, School of Health Sciences, at the University of Massachusetts. The paper states:</PARA>
<PARA> Further statistical analyses of previously reported preliminary data upheld results showing elevated levels of sodium in drinking water may exert an adverse health effect on normal, healthy persons. High school sophomores residing in a community with elevated levels of sodium in the drinking water(107 mg/l) exhibited a marked upward shift in blood pressure distribution patterns in systolic and diastolic pressure, when compared with students in an approximately matched community (8 mg/l). Females exhibited a blood pressure distribution pattern characteristic of persons 10 yr older, while for the males the upshift was similar to that of a group approximately 2 yr older. </PARA>
<PARA>That was compiled in late 1979. Subsequently, doubt was cast on those claims in a survey conducted by the University of Western Australia. That seems to me to indicate that more research on that health matter is required in Australia. I also have figures that demonstrate the following for South Australia: At Morgan the average sodium content of a litre of water is 90 milligrams, with a maximum of 159 milligrams; at Mannum the average is 88 milligrams, with a maximum of 165 milligrams; and at Murray Bridge the average is 80 miligrams, with a maximum of 187 milligrams. That might explain why occasionally Senator McLaren becomes very excited about matters raised in this place. I suggest that drinking water with a sodium content of 187 milligrams a litre would give Senator McLaren cause for serious concern. In interstate terms, the Jack Club syndrome prevails. I will demonstrate that. People in New South Wales do not worry very much about the salinity problem because the sodium content of their water is 13 milligrams a litre. In Melbourne it is about 5 milligrams a litre. So the Jack Club membership in Melbourne and Sydney is pretty strong. It appears that to them it does not matter very much what happens downstream, although I know that some honourable senators would not subscribe to that view. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said before and other senators have said here tonight that water is our most important and vital national resource. We take it for granted. We waste it. We recklessly pour it on gardens. I remember that when I was a boy my father always told me to turn off the taps. Why did he do that in those days? He did it simply because he could not afford to pay for water. My father taught, as I hope a lot of people in Australia today are doing, the value of water. My father taught me also the value of turning off lights, which is of paramount importance today. In those days we turned off the taps and the lights because my dad could not afford to pay the bills. We had to keep the costs down. We had to conserve for a different reason from our reasons today. But today the need is greater, in my opinion. Today it is not just a matter of my father or anyone else's father dealing with the problem in terms of economics; it is now a matter of national significance that people should turn off the taps and the lights to ensure the further development of this nation. With those words, I suggest that the Government ought to give the matter of water far greater priority than it has done in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment on the papers covering the amendment to the agreement between the Fraser Government and the uranium miners all over the world and the paper that puts forward the apologia for reducing the safeguards under which the Fraser Government will sell our uranium. For many years in Australia the population has been against the exporting of Australian uranium. A gallup poll taken as recently as the beginning of this month showed that more than four in 10 Australians believed that the Federal Government was wrong to encourage the export of uranium. The number who feel that the Federal Government is wrong in exporting uranium has increased every year since 1975, and I see no reason why that number will not go on increasing until we have the vast majority of people in Australia strongly telling whatever government happens to be in power that they feel that, until the world can handle uranium, the export of that substance is wrong. People believe it is wrong because they know that the technology is not advanced to a point where nuclear power can be handled safely. If we need any great example of that, Three Mile Island is perhaps the most well known. It is not the only reactor that has caused and will go on causing problems but it is certainly the one that people know the best.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to find people such as Senator Jessop who, in most areas, can be a quite sane, reasonable human being but when it comes to nuclear power he cannot see any reason or logic. He maintains that nuclear power is the power that will do the least damage to the environment. If that is so, I wonder why most countries that have moved into nuclear power in any way at all are now moving away from nuclear power as fast as they can. For instance, was there ever another power station in the position that Three Mile Island is in at the moment? Has there ever been another power station that has endangered the lives of the people around the area and will go on endangering the lives of the people around the area until science can find a way of defusing it? At the moment, Three Mile Island is not defused because science cannot find a way to defuse the dangers. </PARA>
<PARA> If coal-powered plants are as dangerous as Government senators such as Senator Jessop maintain they are, why do those senators such as Senator Jessop not do something about it? Why are they not campaigning as strongly against coal-powered stations as those of us who believe that uranium and nuclear power are dangerous are campaigning against nuclear-powered stations? There can be only two answers: Firstly, they do not believe that coal-powered stations are dangerous or, secondly, they do not care. Frankly, I do not care for either of those answers. People are afraid of uranium because it is used to produce nuclear weapons and nothing that Government senators can say will defuse that argument. They have to accept that that is so. People are concerned because of the increasingly irresponsible attitude in the world to the production and use of nuclear weapons. None of that can happen unless we take our uranium out of the ground. There are an increasing number of countries which either have nuclear weapons and the material and the technology to produce those weapons, or wish to acquire the weapons, the material and the technology. All the fears that people around the world have about those areas are very well founded. </PARA>
<PARA> In every country where the production of nuclear power has been attempted there have been accidents. There have been accidents that caused death immediately or there have been accidents that caused creeping death by cancer over 30 years. Some consequences of the accidents are not even known yet because, as we have so often said, the cancers that are caused by radiation do not make themselves very obvious until it is almost too late. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not supposition. If Senator Thomas were really concerned he would read the papers, he would read the books, he would read the information that comes out of the United States that quite openly links cancer with nuclear power, with the production of plutonium. Senator Thomas should not shake his head. It is true. If he does not like the scientific facts, if he does not want to read them and if he wants to live in cloud cuckoo land, he can go on that way. But, I suggest, there are many parts of the United States he would not live in because of the prevalence of cancers in those areas. In countries such as the USA, Canada, Japan, France, Britain, West Germany, Italy, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Spain, there have been break downs and there have been accidents. There have been accidents that have caused long periods of close down of those nuclear power stations and there have been consequences to the health of people in those areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One fact that is little known, I suggest, is that a nuclear power plant was established in the Antarctic in he 1960s. The Americans took a nuclear power plant there because they said, and Senator Jessop and so many other Government senators would agree with them, that it was a safe, good way to produce power-safe, clean and with a renewable source of energy. But it did not last very long because the power plant broke down. It had all the usual problems that nuclear power plants all over the world had had and even the Americans were a little afraid of what the consequences might be of leakage from the plant. So, late in the 1960s they packed it up, dug out the contaminated material-we all hope-and took it out of the Antarctic. One's imagination boggles at what the effect may very well have been on the fragile ecosytem in the Antarctic if that power plant had been allowed to remain there. What the effect of a melt down in the Antarctic would be is horrific to imagine. The interesting part is that there is a treaty that prohibits the use of nuclear power in the Antarctic, yet a nuclear power plant was established and working there. So much for treaties. So much for pieces of paper. </PARA>
<PARA> In all those countries I have listed, the people have demanded a closedown of nuclear power plants. They have demanded by public vote in very many areas that those power plants be closed down. They have demanded it to the extent that governments have had to listen. They have demanded it in the face of facts showing that millions of dollars of their money had gone into those power plants. Nonetheless, they have said: 'Close them down. You have not shown us that you can handle the technology and you do produce the material from which nuclear weapons are made'. Are all these people all over the world wrong and only the uranium industry right? I doubt it. But it is not just the ordinary person, the man in the street who is worried and concerned. There are concerns other than that people's health and lives may be at stake. More and more energy utilities are today shying away from nuclear energy. They are moving away from nuclear energy because of the continuing closedown of the plants, because of the faults, because they cannot build good nuclear power stations yet, because of the uncertainty of supply of electricity, because the power plants close down so often and with so little warning. They are also moving away from it because of the increasing cost. The cost is rising because of the increasing demands by populations for more stringent safety precautions when nuclear power stations are built. Those increasing costs cause greatly increased building costs that now run into billions when one talks about building a nuclear power plant. There is also, of course, the enormous cost of closing down a nuclear power plant. As the Americans have found to their horror, the cost of cleaning up plants such as Three Mile Island when they go bad is running into the millions. The quote at the moment for cleaning up Three Mile Island is $300m-plus. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time the Americans admit that they do not yet know how to clean up Three Mile Island, how long it will take, or what the consequenses will be.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OL7">Senator MELZER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator has been reading novels; he should start reading facts. The long delay in the clean up of the damaged reactor at Three Mile Island is now leading people in the industry to believe that it will be at least 1988 before the installation is back anywhere near to normality; and that is 10 years after its installation. A newspaper report stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in its final report on the environmental problems of the site in Pennsylvania, said radioactive solid wastes and more than 6.7 million litres of contaminated water had to be removed from the plant. </PARA>
<PARA> The report said that the task could take as long as eight years. </PARA>
<PARA> A major accident at the plant on March 28, 1979 caused the uncontrollable release of radiation and the evacuation of more than 100,000 residents living nearby. </PARA>
<PARA> The clean-up operation has been suspended until the NRC and other government organisations prepare environmental impact studies. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, if 6.7 million litres of contaminated water is to be taken away from the plant, it has to be put somewhere; and nobody in America wants it in their backyard. The newspaper report continued:</PARA>
<PARA> NRC commissioners said today they are waiting for Metropolitan Edison, the owner of the facility, to present a detailed plan for cleaning up the plant. </PARA>
<PARA> The commission said it did not regard Three Mile Island as a safe waste-disposal site. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Removing the damaged fuel and radioactive waste to suitable storage sites is the only reliable means of eliminating the risk of widespread contamination . . . '</PARA>
<PARA> So the company will not be allowed to leave the material on the site and will have to find somewhere to take it. That will cost billions of dollars and will take at least another 10 years. The cost will be borne not by the utility company, the company that was proposing to make money out of the electricity it produced, but by the taxpayers of America. That is another reason why people all over the world are moving away from nuclear power. They say that in so many ways it is just too costly. Other consequences of areas such as Three Mile Island are becoming obvious. Of course, Senator Thomas would like to believe that this is all fiction, but it is very apparent that it is not. Another newspaper report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The infant mortality rate within a 16 km radius of the Three Mile Island nuclear power station has risen sharply. </PARA>
<PARA> In the six months after the accident on March 28 last year, 31 infants under the age of 12 months died compared to 14 deaths in the corresponding period in 1978 and 20 in 1977. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures were released today by Doctor Gordon MacLeod, who was fired as Secretary of Health in Pennsylvania by Governor Richard Thornburgh because of 'differences in institutional style'. </PARA>
<PARA>It would not, of course, have had anything to do with the research he did! To continue:</PARA>
<PARA> Initially, a Health Department spokesman denied such figures existed. </PARA>
<PARA> The spokesman said the mortality rate was twice the State average. </PARA>
<PARA> He was not prepared to associate the increased mortality rate among infants with radioactive emissions from the facility last year. </PARA>
<PARA> But he said accident-related stress in pregnant women might have caused the infant death rate to increase. </PARA>
<PARA>It might not have caused it, too. It is interesting that all these problems besetting the nuclear power industry are causing the power utilities to move away from nuclear power. Yet another newspaper report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Eleven nuclear plants in the United States are now nearing completion. But they will not go into operation this year or next without 'drastic remedial steps' by the Federal Government, according to the Atomic Industrial Forum, the nuclear industry's trade group. </PARA>
<PARA> The Forum blames the dilemma on the delays between completion of a plant and the award of an operating licence by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. </PARA>

<PARA> Because it is not producing power to pay off construction and interest expenses, the typical idle plant costs $US1 million a day, the Forum says. </PARA>
<PARA> That would add up to $US2.4 billion per plant over the expected 80 months of delays on the new plants. All that expense has to be passed on to the utility's customers. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it any wonder that people are shying away from nuclear power? The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Charles Komanoff, a New York energy and economic consultant, . . . asserts that for the plants now being completed, coal enjoys a 'modest' total cost advantage of perhaps 5 to 10 per cent that he conservatively sees widening to 25 per cent by the late 1980s. The main reason for this, he said, is that tougher standards for nuclear power will almost necessarily result as regulators attempt to maintain a given aggregate level of nuclear operating risk while the total number of nuclear plants in service rises. </PARA>
<PARA> In Mr Komanoff's view any utility such as Duke Power with nuclear units less than about one-third completed, should consider building coal plants instead, even if nothing could be salvaged . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In the end, industry officials say, the extent of nuclear rejuvenation depends not only on curbing inflation and finding a way to dispose of spent fuel but also on other factors of acceptance in the community. The disposal of spent fuel, of waste, is also a cause of great distress to the nuclear power industry, because there is as yet no answer to it. For years now the nuclear industry in America has been demanding of its Government that it find a way to dispose of the waste. It has said: 'We cannot go on and we will not go on. We refuse to go on taking the responsibility unless you provide a way to dispose of the waste'. It said that to the last President of the United States and undoubtedly it will say it to this President. Of course, it says it to the Government partly because in many ways the Government, through its military use of plutonium and thus its production of nuclear waste, has been at fault and has done nothing about providing waste disposal. It was reported recently that about 100 million cubic feet-three million cubic metres-of potentially harmful military nuclear waste have been virtually ignored in our national debate on nuclear power. A Press report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> This poorly stored and carefully shrouded mountain of radioactive materials represents the hidden burden of the arms race. </PARA>
<PARA> The same report went on to point out that radioactive rodent droppings had been found in the basement of an uncontaminated control and service building at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, the site of the worst commercial nuclear accident in the United States. Of course, that came not from military waste but from nuclear power plant waste. It went on to say very smartly that there is no possibility of radiation exposure from a rodent bite; but it did not say how those rates became radioactive, nor did it explain why people could not become radioactive from the same source. It has been said often by the proponents of the nuclear power industry that there is no problem in the storing of waste, it can be buried in salt domes. That too has been tried in many places, including the United States. It was interesting to discover recently that in the United States salt domes are being used to store not only nuclear waste but also hydrocarbons. I have here a report concerning a lady called Mary Harmon in Texas, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the domes are more worry than wonder. She and 2,754 others live over the largest hydrocarbon-storage dump in the United States. Last fall, when it began leaking gas, hundreds of townspeople had to be evacuated. Most have still not returned to their homes, and several have retaliated with law suits against eleven firms that store petrochemicals in the ground. Says Harmon: 'I wish that someone else had a salt dome and we had our town back'. </PARA>
<PARA>That was for hydrocarbons. But one wonders what the result would have been if radio active waste had been stored in the same salt dome. We know, of course, that America has already dumped waste in the Pacific. In a recent publication of Chain Reaction it was reported that:</PARA>
<PARA> After several years of incessant prodding the USA Environmental Protection Agency was forced to release the results of 1977 surveys of the major USA nuclear dumpsites, including one that occupies 12,500 square kilometres near the Farallon Islands off San Francisco. As scientific adviser to Quentin Kopp, Superviser of San Francisco, I analyzed the EPA data and found:</PARA>
<PARA> plutonium levels 2,000 times above background in ocean bottom sediment</PARA>
<PARA> deteriorating containers, with the worst contamination yet to come</PARA>
<PARA> extensive animal life in the dumpsite</PARA>
<PARA> released radioactivity stuck to the ocean bottom in the dumpsite, rather than dispersed by diffusion</PARA>
<PARA> radioactivity 5,000 times background in animal life, including edible fish. </PARA>
<PARA> In sworn testimony before Congressional Hearings last October the EPA could deny none of these disclosures. </PARA>
<PARA> The USA seadump programme was ended in 1970 not to protect the environment but to save money. It simply became cheaper to dispose of nuclear wastes on land. But now that land sites are filling up, the nuclear industry is again turning to the sea to bury its wastes. There are no fewer than six active programmes in the USA involving ongoing or resumed nuclear dumping at sea-</PARA>
<PARA>So it goes on. Dumping in that sea means that that material can wash on to any shore and certainly can wash on to Australia's shore. America has dumped nuclear waste in the sea. We know that West Germany has had problems with storing waste. On 1 March this year 80,000 demonstrators defied a court ruling against demonstrating and went out against the building of a nuclear waste dump in part of West Germany. It took 30,000 police and 10,000 special riot police to control the demonstration. Are we saying that these people are all just maniacs and are all just emtional? Eighty thousand people do not go out demonstrating against something unless the have great grounds for concern. We should have equal grounds for concern. We know that Japan wants to dump her nuclear waste in the Pacific. It is a problem which she has found very difficult to overcome. We know that Britain has dumped 10 times the amount that the United States of America has dumped in the sea. </PARA>
<PARA> So already if we do not do anything else, if we do not produce one other ounce of uranium, of enriched uranium or of plutonium, we have a problem which the world will find very difficult to solve. If Australia contributes to the proliferation of nuclear weapons, to the proliferation of nuclear waste and to the proliferation of power stations which can cause radiation and fall-out which endanger the lives of people, it has to accept responsibility because Australia makes the material available if it exports uranium. Once uranium is exported we have no control over where the waste goes. It is all very well for the Government to maintain that its safeguards agreement will prevent our uranium being used for weapons, but before we get to that point it cannot even control the waste which comes from using uranium to produce plutonium for weapons and power from nuclear power stations. </PARA>
<PARA> We are considering in these reports the conditions in which we will allow the reprocessing of Australian uranium. The Government maintains that the safeguards agreements will prevent our uranium being used for weapons. There are now more than 300,000 nuclear weapons in the world and the number is increasing all the time. The world spends $400,000m a year on nuclear arms. And this Government expects a piece of paper to keep our uranium out of the pile from which those weapons are produced! Does the Government believe this or does it want us to believe it and so allow the Japanese, the Canadians, the British, the French, the Swedes and the Germans to come here to mine our uranium, providing no great assistance to the Australian people, with great concessions from Australian taxpayers. This would contribute to nuclear proliferation in the world? It does not make sense. Why should a French company mining here care two hoots about a piece of paper which states that Australia's uranium must not finish up in nuclear weapons? What will we do about it if it does? How can we check that that little pound of uranium from Australia has not finished up in the pile from which plutonium is produced and which goes into nuclear weapons? What do we do about the nuclear weapons testing which the French carry out in the Pacific? Nothing. What can we possibly do to prevent our uranium finishing up in nuclear weapons?</PARA>
<PARA> A United Nations report estimates that 150,000 people have been killed or will die from nuclear tests which have already taken place. The report states that only 10 per cent of those people come from the southern hemisphere, but with the French persisting in nuclear testing in the Pacific how long will it be before that percentage increases? I suggest that Australia might get her uranium back sooner than she thinks, and in a quite uncomfortable way. We all know that the material from which nuclear bombs can be made has been stolen and has been diverted. It used to be a comfort to the Government to say that very sophisticated equipment and plant were needed before a nuclear weapon could be made. We all know now that that is not so and that terribly sophisticated equipment and high grade enriched plutonium are not needed to produce nuclear weapons and that one can produce a rather crude bomb without that sophisticated material and equipment. But a rather crude bomb kills, maims and kills by radiation in much the same way as a more sophisticated bomb does. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the fallout, as my friend says, is worse. We cannot put up great big brick walls around ourselves-nor can other countries do it-to stop that fallout drifting across a country's frontier. We were told, as part of the apologia by the Fraser Government on allowing uranium mining, that the mining of uranium would bring great prosperity to Australia. At one stage, Mr Anthony waxed eloquent and said that 300 jobs would flow from the uranium province in the Northern Territory. Where is the prosperity which was supposed to come? Where are the sales? We have to beg countries to take the ore which we mine. Ministers rush all over the world begging countries to sign contracts for the purchase of our uranium. We have to water down our safeguards agreements to get those countries to put their signatures on the bottom of these safeguards agreements which are necessary before they can sign the contracts. The price for uranium has fallen to $25 a pound and it is likely to fall to $20 a pound. In fact the other day the Wall Street Journal stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Declining nuclear power projections, large uranium inventories in utility backyards and serious overexpansion in uranium mining have together conspired to bring the world market price of uranium fuel to its lowest level in 5 years. </PARA>
<PARA>According to the Californian-based uranium brokerage firm, Nuexico, prices for the heavy metal have dropped by nearly 30 per cent in the last year. In 1977 uranium prices stood at a high of $53 a pound in 1980 dollars. Today's price, again in 1980 dollars, is $35 a pound, the lowest price since 1975. The Wall Street Journal states that the market could not be worse. The miners therefore are getting desperate for a return. If one has invested over $400m in a project and the price is falling one is worried. It takes a lot of sales at $25 or $20 a pound to bring in a profit on that sort of investment when the industry is dying. We were told that there would be 300,000 jobs. When I went to Nabarlek and Ranger with Senator Jessop two weeks ago we found that only four men were needed to run the Nabarlek processing plant-not hundreds, not thousands, but only four men could run the entire processing plant. So where will the 300,000 jobs come from? Ranger is not yet finished, but its plant will not be all that much bigger than the Nabarlek plant. How many more than four men will be needed to run the Ranger plant-eight? For the next 30 years we could have eight men running the Ranger processing plant. Thousands of jobs, Mr Anthony said! Of course Ranger will have miners. Sometimes I think Government members would like to think we are back in the days when miners went off every morning with their hat, lamp and pick, but we do not mine that way any more. So there will not be thousands of jobs there. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting how two people can go to the same place and yet see things so differently. I went to the Ranger area with Senator Jessop. Certainly the Atomic Energy Commission has done studies on base lines for water control, for the control of fauna and flora in the area, but the overwhelming point, if one cares about the environment at all, is that no base lines have been established. We still cannot tell anybody what insects were in the area, what plants were in the area, what animals were in the area, where the water in the area goes or what the quality of the water was before we started to mine uranium. Of course the mining companies are concerned to respect the environment. Why should not they be? Because they have now found difficulties which they have always refused to believe existed they are now more anxious to do research into this area. For instance, when people told the mining companies that the area flooded and had enormous quantities of water over it the companies said of course they could cope with all that and it could not be so impossible. When we went there two metres of water were lying over the site where the mine in Jabiluka is supposed to be built. Even the uranium miners are worried about how on earth they are going to control a mine when in an ordinary year-there was nothing extraordinary about the level of water this year-two metres of water is lying over the surface of the area. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jessop said that the mining companies are monitoring water flows up there, including the movement of water in the area. Of course they are, but they are doing it because they are forced to do it; because the people of Australia made this Government at least acknowledge that the mining companies had some responsibility in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, you have been listening to the Atomic Energy Commission for too long. There were no levels of uranium in the water before mining started in the area, certainly not in all the rivers there. Senator Jessop spoke in glowing terms about the tonnes of uranium for which the uranium mining companies have overseas contracts. He forgot to say that in respect of many of those contracts Australia has not yet got signatures on safeguards agreements from the countries to which the uranium miners hope to sell the uranium. For instance, we have not yet got a signature from Japan on a nuclear safeguards agreement; so we cannot very well have signatures on the contract. Senator Jessop spoke glowingly about the $1.3m laboratory that Ranger built in the area. He should have pointed out at the same time that the Supervising Scientist works up there in a series of portables and that this Government has done precious little about giving him the sort of laboratory he needs if he is to do his work properly. There are still no signs that the money will be made available for the construction of a proper laboratory with proper equipment to give dedicated scientists the chance to catch up on the enormous amount of work that needs to be done. The spending at Ranger might show that the companies are concerned, but all I can say in respect of the Government laboratory there is that the spending shows how little regard the Government has for the work that should be done in the area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to know just how much these uranium mines are costing the ordinary people. It is hard to find out because in so many areas subsidies appear to be hidden from the view of people, even members of Senate committees. For instance, when we were there two weeks ago we discovered that electricity for a house being built at Jabiru, the township, will be $1,600 a year. That is not the real cost of electricity in the area. That cost is based on north Queensland rates which are subsidised. The Commonwealth will pay the difference between that $1,600 a year and the real cost of electricity in this area. Again the taxpayers will subsidise the uranium miners. </PARA>
<PARA> Uranium mining is endangering our environment. We are not getting any sort of advantage from uranium mining. No jobs are flowing from the mining of uranium. There is no increase in the standard of living of the Australian people. They are not getting any share of the prosperity that is flowing out of the uranium mining at the moment. We are, as I said, endangering our environment. We are endangering the lives of the Aboriginal people who live in the area. We are endangering the lives of the workers in the uranium industry and in the long run by supplying the materials we endanger the lives of the people in the countries to which we export uranium because the technology for producing electricity from uranium is demonstrably imperfect. We endanger people all over the world because we provide the raw material from which nuclear weapons can be made.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak briefly on this report of the Joint Committee on Public Works. Over the years that I have been a member of the Public Works Committee I have found the Committee in essence to be what in my opinion governments really should be about. The Committee is a watchdog. It is a committee that asks Departments to prove that the project for which they are seeking approval is necessary; that the project is accepted by the community; that the project is of a cost that is in keeping with the necessity for the project and that the money of the people of Australia that is to be spent on the project will be spent in a proper way. The Committee makes departments commit themselves to a project and show that it has a real worth in the community and is really needed. As I said, I think that is what governments really should be about. By now the Public Works Committee has a vast knowledge of the needs of the community because all its hearings are public and it encourages the public to come to the hearings, comment, complain, listen and find out what is being done with its money. In some ways I think that is the essence of democracy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must say that over the years I have found that some government departments are quite arrogant about the projects they put before the Committee and arrogant about their role in government. Some departments tend to treat committees such as the Public Works Committee with arrogance and scorn, believing that they really understand what the community needs. The Public Works Committee, being made up of a vast range of people from the Parliament, who come from all walks of life and who have done all sorts of jobs in the community, are probably more representative of the community than people in any government department could be. Parliamentarians bring the knowledge that they have gained over the years to such hearings and test government departments, making them accountable for what they put up and for the way in which they spend the people's money. Over the years I have found some of these departments quite arrogant in the way they front up. Fortunately, they very soon find out that members of parliament have a real concern for their constituents and for the way in which public moneys are spent. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps matters often come to the Committee too late. It has been of great concern to members of the Committee over the years that when departments put forward a proposition to the Committee often it is a fait accompli because the planning stage has gone so far with so much money spent that really the members of the Committee cannot, in all conscience, say: 'We do not consider it a good project. We do not think it is worth while. We do not think you have designed it properly. Go back to the drawing board or scrap the idea altogether.' It has seemed to many of us on the Public Works Committee over the years that if propositions were put up as an idea, perhaps with some rough sketches giving a rough idea of the project as the architect and the Department saw it, it would be much more sensible and realistic for the Committee to view it at that stage. At that stage the Committee could look at the project and decide without any pressure whether the scheme was worth while. If the scheme were not then there would be very little lost but if it were found to be worth while then it could be sent back to the Department and developed properly along lines strongly suggested by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter that came before the Committee that concerned members deeply for a range of reasons was the proposed Casey military university. That project came before us after many thousands of dollars had been spent on developing the idea. Despite the pressure on us to acknowledge that the project had gone a long way down the track, in that instance the Committee refused to accept that the university was necessary at all. Finally, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) overrode us and said that the university would be built. If our recommendation had been accepted and the construction of the University had not been proceeded with we would still have wasted thousands and thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money in getting the project to the stage at which it came to the Public Works Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Public Works Committee goes on to take a stronger role when it comes to approving government projects. I hope that the time will come when all government projects, right across the board, no matter how much they cost, will come before the Committee for scrutiny. It does not always matter how much a project costs but it does matter whether it is a proper way in which to spend the people's money. Sometimes a project costing $5m can be put forward in a most economical way and can cover a need that is very apparent in the community. In other cases a department might waste $200,000 on a project which is absolutely absurd and quite unnecessary. In acknowledging the role that the Public Works Committee has played up to this point I hope that the Committee's work can be expanded because I think that it will only be to the good of this Parliament and the people of Australia. </PARA>

In addition, as most honourable senators would know, I have answered numerous questions at hearings of Estimates Committee A over recent years. To the best of my knowledge an assurance to the effect that the Parliament would be consulted prior to the making of decisions on accommodation has not been given by me. I did however give Senator McLaren an assurance on 29 August 1980 during a hearing of Estimates Committee A that 'no major determinations on locations will be made before the Parliament reassembles'. This was a reference to reassembling after the 1980 election. That assurance has of course been honoured.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The rising cost of public hospitals is a matter of serious concern to us in this place. These rising costs are reflected in higher medical care costs to all Australian families. Of course, this Parliament is concerned to the extent at least of funds it appropriates that go to the hospital system. How is that money spent? Are spending priorities right and to what extent should that concern us here? I want to narrow the subject down and speak particularly of conditions obtaining to the largest geriatric hospital in New South Wales and one of the largest in Australia. I refer to the Allandale Hospital in Cessnock, which has almost 500 inmates and which is controlled by the Health Commission of New South Wales. During a visit to Allandale Hospital on 11 February last I was appalled to find myself in scenes which might have been taken straight from the pages of Charles Dickens, a place in which helpless old people, formerly hard working and presumably respectable and decent citizens of this country now live in daily conditions of unnecessary hardship, discomfort and indignity. I did not raise the matter publicly at that time, although in fact the Australian Democrats were campaigning for a State by-election, because I hoped that I might obtain improvements by communicating with the New South Wales Minister for Health, the Honourable Kevin Stewart. I wrote to him on 13 February as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As you will know, Allandale was built originally as a psychiatric hospital and has been adapted to its present purpose. During the visit I made on 11 February, certain difficulties seemed very apparent. The average age of the occupants is 82; very many of them are incontinent and a high proportion of them have dementia. The challenge to nursing staff in day-to-day dealings is very considerable. Because of this a case could perhaps be made for the best possible conditions to assist them. In many areas the hospital has a heavy odour problem, which is unfortunate from the point of view of staff and the elderly patients, to whom I believe the community owes as much comfort and dignity as is reasonably possible for their final years. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not at all convinced that this is the case at present, but it would appear that some modest alterations could change the situation a great deal. </PARA>
<PARA> Specific points would include the following:</PARA>
<PARA> A. Provision of exhaust fans in wards, and especially bathrooms. </PARA>
<PARA> B. Replacement of the present vinyl tile floors, which have been laid throughout the hospital, with impervious vinyl sheeting. This measure alone would alleviate what is now an almost impossible hygiene problem. </PARA>
<PARA> C. Provision of chairs with coverings impervious to body fluids and designed to provide the best comfort and support for that group of patients who obviously and urgently need this. I gather that these patients who might be in bed through much of the day cannot be so located because of the low staffing of the hospital. </PARA>
<PARA> D. Some redesign of bathroom and water closets so that nurses are more able to assist patients. More space is needed. </PARA>
<PARA> E. Provision of better bathroom facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Partly due to its design faults the hospital would also appear even to have an acute staffing problem. I understand a staff ceiling has been applied as policy and I am only too well aware of the financial problems that have caused this. </PARA>
<PARA> However with respect I suggest that Allandale might be a special case, due to the difficulty of design and the very considerable degree of attention nursing staff must give to the patients. </PARA>
<PARA> As the average age of the patient increases these problems must also increase. </PARA>
<PARA> May I say at this stage that it was plain to me that the staff at the hospital are doing a magnificent job, which is well deserving of community commendation. </PARA>
<PARA>I received no reply to that letter, so on 13 March I wrote again to the Minister as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> May I please have a reply to my letter of 13 February 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>It is now 2 April and I have had no response from the Minister. As a senator for New South Wales I have a direct and personal responsibility to my constituents, and these include the patients at Allandale hospital. I am raising this matter here tonight in the hope that an enlightened and indignant public opinion in New South Wales might see, if they know the facts, that something is done. As I said, I admire and respect the work being done by the nursing staff at Allandale, fine selfless work under the worst of conditions. The matter is made even worse because relatively small expenditure could transform this place. Continuous impervious flooring, air conditioning, even exhaust fans in the wards and especially in the bathrooms, would make a tremendous difference. This expenditure has been denied by a State Government which saw fit during that same series of by-elections to give funds to provide an ethnic club in nearby Maitland with air conditioning. Cessnock is regarded as a safe Labor seat, which is bad news for everybody who lives there. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer again to the question of the flooring at Allandale because it is vital. The vinyl tiles have thousands of crevices and cracks between them, as such things normally do when they are laid. In spite of the best efforts, they make it impossible to keep the hospital clean, in conditions where people, incontinent through age and no fault of their own, are living. This results in the terrible odour and insanitary conditions which pervade large areas of the hospital and which I have experienced personally and which both patients and staff are expected to endure continuously. A young person who accompanied me on that inspection said: 'If ever I have seen anything that would turn me off being old it is what I saw at Allandale'. </PARA>
<PARA> Further indignity and discomfort results for nurses and patients from small bathroom cubicles in which it is almost impossible for nurses to help patients clean themselves. In these bathrooms hot, humid and stinking conditions-I could use no less a word-persist because of the lack of proper ventilation that a few exhaust fans, which could be provided at small cost, would alleviate. Most pitiful of all is the plight of very old, senile patients, most of them old ladies, who are daily taken out of bed in the morning and propped up for the day in chairs in which they sit lolling like rag dolls. They are not allowed to go back to bed when they feel tired because there are not enough nurses to carry out this work. It is a fact, I understand, that the Health Minister, Mr Stewart, imposed staff ceilings on Allandale. It is a sad sight to see these old people propped in chairs which give them no degree of comfort or support. Furthermore, the chairs are not impervious to body fluids and because of this are constantly soaked in them. Here again, small amounts of expenditure would mean that these old people, who surely should have some expectations of the community, could have comfort and dignity in their last days. </PARA>
<PARA> I speak of these matters with distaste and I am sure that honourable senators must hear them with distaste. Yet it is vitally important that I raise them. It goes against my conscience that people of decent and honourable antecedents should have to tolerate these conditions. If anything else goes against my conscience it is merely that I have held my hand in this matter for as long as I have. Old and senile people do not have appreciable voting power. Is this the cynical basis for the degree of neglect and pinchpenny methods that one sees in the Allandale hospital? While at Cessnock I visited the prison there. It is fair to say that in many respects prisoners serving sentences for violent crimes are treated better than the old people in neighbouring Allandale. What more cruel and unjust irony could there be than that?</PARA>
<PARA> There is growing evidence that this whole area of hospitals for old people needs careful re-examination and planning and a degree of en- lightened concern on the part of governments. Such hospitals ought to be planned properly and built for their purpose. They should have the best possible facilities for caring for the senile and incontinent since this is an arduous, difficult nursing job at any time. Well-planned geriatric hospitals should have at least three clear categories of care-one for the senile, another for hostel-type accommodation for more self-sufficient patients, and another for adequate domiciliary extension services for those who wish to remain as long as possible in their homes. I hope that these things will come with time. Meanwhile, I suggest to men and women of good will in New South Wales and elsewhere that there is a responsibility to see that the deficiences of places such as Allandale are cleaned up. That at least would be a necessary beginning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter which I believe to be of great concern to members of the Senate. It concerns reports in the media this evening of an organism known colloquially as legionnaires disease circulating in parts of Parliament House. One understands, and one is basing one's remarks only on media reports, that following the severe and recurrent illnesses to which, as we all know, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has been subject in the past year or so, certain tests have taken place in the region of his suite and in particular in the air conditioning and surrounds, to try to establish whether any disease organism is present which may be an explanatory factor in those illnesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is the understanding of many of us that a disease organism known colloquially as legionnaires disease has been isolated in the area of the air conditioning in the Prime Minister's suite. If that is the case, certain questions immediately arise. When it is stated, as it has been, that the disease organism has been isolated there, does it merely mean identified there, or isolated and held there? What tests have taken place in the air conditioning throughout the building? What tests have taken place in areas of the building other than the air conditioning? More importantly, I believe, why is it that parliamentarians and those who work here were not informed that this series of tests took place or of the results of those tests until apparently they were leaked to the media? Not only are some 200 parliamentarians who disperse at the end of each week to various parts of Australia in some sort of danger, if not to themselves then perhaps by spreading this disease when they return to their home bases, but also those members of staff who are constantly working within this building, and there are many hundreds of them, seem to be in even graver danger. It seems to me, and no doubt to other honourable senators, unpardonable that parliamentarians and those who work within this building have not been kept informed of this series of tests or of any results from such tests. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps no assurance can be given by you, Mr President, that it is safe for those who work in this building to return to it next week, but at least I ask that you make contact with our offices on Monday, or perhaps even tomorrow, to inform us of any facts which are at your disposal and which I believe ought to have been put at your disposal and that of the parliament much earlier than this, to allay the fears. If those fears cannot be allayed, perhaps you could tell us what steps ought to be taken so that those of us who return from interstate and those who work within the building are not subjected to some risk of a severe and, at times, fatal disease. I think that I would not be going too far to suggest that there has been some dereliction of duty on the part of those who have been involved in this series of tests in not informing the Parliament of what was going on. I hope, Mr President, that you will pursue that matter also. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) There is no ''Departmental policy on non-involvement in communities without secure land tenure.'' Where Aboriginal communities are living on land which is held as leasehold by another person, any buildings or other fixed improvements provided with Commonwealth Government grants would become the property of the leaseholder and not of the community. This was one of the major considerations leading to the recommendations of the Gibb Committee in 1971 that suitable land on pastoral properties should be subleased, or excised and leased, to Aboriginal communities. Where leases of community areas have not been provided, applications for assistance can still be considered by the Department and there is no obstacle to the provision of grants for such things as vehicles and radios, where this is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> The Gordon Downs community has recently decided not to return to the Gordon Downs pastoral lease, but to settle on land at Yaruman (Ringer's Soak) which has been temporarily reserved for the purpose. Details of a grant to help the group to resettle at the site are being worked out.</PARA>
<PARA>The Warringari group is camped on the Go Go pastoral lease, although members have links with the Fossil Downs station. One area on Go Go station has already been excised and a housing program for the Bayula community there is in progress. The lessees of Go Go are unwilling to consider a second excision from the lease for the Warringari group. The lessees of Fossil Downs are prepared to negotiate but there have been problems in finding a site on Fossil Downs satisfactory to the group and not subject to flooding.</PARA>
<PARA> Similarly at Christmas Creek station one area has been excised and a housing program is underway there, but some of the people living on the station have left that area and moved to another site some 19 kilometres away. I am informed that an application by this group, the Kroonull community, to the Aboriginal Development Commission for help in obtaining land is being considered by the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Aboriginal Affairs is continuing to review the needs of all Aboriginal groups living on pastoral properties in the Northern Territory and in Western Australia and to advise and help communities which are seeking to negotiate the provision of land by way of sub-leases or excisions.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The provision of schools is primarily a responsibility of the relevant State or Northern Territory Government. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs provides advice and assistance to any community seeking the provision of a local school and has provided funds for independent Aboriginal community schools in Western Australia at Noonkanbah, Strelley, Lake Gnangara and Coolgardie.</PARA>
<PARA>(4) The Aboriginal group living at Gordon Downs left the station early in January and, as indicated above, has decided to resettle at Yaruman rather than returning to the station.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Western Australian Minister for Lands has been reported as saying that the embargo imposed last year on the transfer of leasehold land to Aboriginal groups has been lifted. The Minister has confirmed this in a message to the Aboriginal Development Commission stating that the Western Australian Government is prepared to consider the transfer of pastoral leases to Aboriginal communities subject to the merits and particular circumstances of each case.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) My Department made a grant of $5,000 to the Rittaranga Community Association, the Aboriginal group resident on Urapunga Station, to allow it to make a contribution towards the costs of providing a power supply on a cost-sharing basis for the three consumers on the station-i.e. station management, education staff and the Rittaranga community. The amount was paid on 4 May 1979, although the transfer of responsibility for essential services to the Northern Territory Government from my Department was effected on 1 July 1978. This action was taken pending clarification with the Northern Territory Government of the responsibility for essential services for Aboriginals on pastoral properties.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. I am informed that problems have arisen in the implementation of the original cost-sharing agreement. The Northern Territory Department of Community Development, which has assumed responsibility for essential services, is now dealing with the matter and examining the overall power supply requirements for the station.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator Durack</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Mawson's Hut is situated at Commonwealth Bay which is 120 km from the nearest manned research station, France's Dumont D'urville in the Terre Adelie Sector, and 1400 km from Casey, the nearest Australian station.</PARA>
<PARA> In January/February 1978 a party from the Antarctic Division visited Commonwealth Bay to inspect Mawson's Hut, to assess the feasibility of returning it to Australia and to do some restoration work. The party found that the condition of the hut reflected the severe weather conditions it has had to withstand. They reported that the outer timbers had been reduced to half their original thickness and had shrunk leaving gaps between the boards. The inner and main timbers were generally in good condition, however some repairs and replacement would be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> The party recommended that because of the condition of the hut and the variable weather conditions no attempt should be made to return it to Australia and that it should be restored on site.</PARA>
<PARA> The arguments leading to a decision to leave the hut in situ are:</PARA>
<PARA> The high probability that the hut will be destroyed in the process of dismantling. The foundations and floor are encased in solid ice and due to limited access time it is not possible to free the hut of this ice in the course of a single season;</PARA>
<PARA> Even if the foundations and floor were abandoned it would not be possible to dismantle the remainder in a single season, bearing in mind the need to exercise extreme care to minimise damage, the time required to number and pack removed timbers and the time required to ensure the residual portion would not fill with snow and ice or be blown away in the ensuing twelve months. (As a point of interest, winds of up to 200 knots have been experienced at Commonwealth Bay);</PARA>
<PARA> The hut has been declared an Antarctic historic monument and it is the general practice of Antarctic Treaty nations, of which Australia is one, to leave their nominated historical monuments in situ;</PARA>
<PARA> The voyages of Sir Douglas Mawson were the basis of Australia's claims in the Antarctic and the Commonwealth Bay hut forms an integral part of those explorations; and</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate considered the dismantling and removal of an historic building to another site in order to save it as a 'procedure of last resort . . . an admission of failure to preserve an authentic environment' (Paragraph 4.113 of the Committee's report).</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 4 December 1980 (Hansard, page 337) Senator Tate asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the practice of some employers of opening the mail addressed to employees at their place of work. This is of particular concern to union officials written to in that capacity, and general concern to employees whose correspondents may know of their place of work but not their private address. Will the Minister consider making a statement or requesting Australia Post to advertise the fact that such opening of mail is almost certainly illegal and definitely improper?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Complaints of this nature have been raised with Australia Post on a number of occasions in the past.</PARA>
<PARA> It is appreciated that the opening by employers of mail addressed to employees at their place of work can cause concern to employees, particularly those who receive mail in their capacity as union officials. However, Commonwealth legislative provisions concerning opening of mail relate only to interference with articles in the course of postal transmission. There are no Commonwealth laws relating to opening of mail after postal delivery has been effected.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as Australia Post is concerned, the different methods of effecting delivery of mail are set down in the Postal By-laws and include delivery through private bag or private box. There is no requirement for a postal article to be handed personally to the addressee. Indeed such a requirement would be quite unworkable in the context of providing a national postal service.</PARA>

<PARA> The fees for medical benefits purposes listed in the current Medical Benefits Schedule have their origin in a list of common fees submitted as being fair and reasonable to the Government by the Australian Medical Association in 1970. The list of fees was adopted as the basis of the new medical benefits arrangements introduced on 1 July 1970.</PARA>
<PARA> The State surveys which led to the setting of common fees indicated that the fees charged in certain States often varied from those charged in other States. Since then, the levels of Schedule fees for medical benefit purposes have been adjusted following an independent enquiry by the Medical Fees Tribunal in 1973 and a number of subsequent independent enquiries. To an extent these differences in fees among the States have been maintained.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers that any move from different State fee levels towards uniform fee levels has to be based on substantial arguments, largely related to parity of practice costs and not incomes. Further, the Government considers that moves towards uniform fees should not increase the overall costs of medical benefits to the community and hence uniform fees would not be acceptable if they were on the basis of lifting the lower fees for some States to the level of the highest fees in another State. This policy has been followed by the Government in fees enquiries and has been ratified in the determination of those enquiries.</PARA>
<PARA> To date, information about medical practice costs and incomes provided by the medical profession has not been sufficiently detailed or representative to demonstrate that there should be further moves to uniform fee levels among the States. I might add that the Government's requirements have been made clearly known to the Australian Medical Association over a number of years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Housing and Construction has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Central Investigation and Research Laboratory Report titled 'Exposure Tests on Some Anti-corrosive Coatings for the Protection of Steel' has never been published. It is an internal Department of Housing and Construction Report which is updated every six months.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Draft Bills are confidential until they have been approved by the Government and presented to the Parliament. Accordingly, detailed drafts of the proposed Plant Variety Rights legislation have not been circulated to the seed trade industry or to any other groups or persons. In fact the drafting process has not as yet been completed.</PARA>
<PARA> In mid 1979 an early working paper in the format of a Bill was made available for discussion, and change, at a meeting in Canberra of representatives of Commonwealth and State governments and the three industry organisations which initially proposed a Plant Variety Rights Scheme for Australia. As a result of this meeting and subsequent discussions at meetings of the Australian Agricultural Council, a substantial number of amendments have been made to the scheme as originally proposed in the working paper. These changes are reflected in the proposed legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> An information paper on plant variety rights in Australia was prepared by my Department and copies are available for distribution to anyone, including members of the seed trade industry.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The information paper referred to in (1) is available for distribution to environmental and community interest groups. A substantial number has already been distributed in response to requests received from such groups.</PARA>
<PARA> Further, it is the Government's intention to introduce the Bill during the current sitting of Parliament and to allow it to remain on the table without debate until the Budget Sitting later in the year. During this period it will be a public document and available for examination by interested persons or organisations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 February 1981 (Hansard, pages 13 and 14) Senator Melzer asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Health, a question without notice concerning the withdrawal from sale of tampons associated with cases of toxic shock syndrome. The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Extensive laboratory tests conducted under the auspices of the National Health and Medical Research Council by leading Australian research institutions on all brands of tampons sold in Australia have now been completed. The tests have investigated the chemical composition of tampons and the possibility of contamination with Staphylococcus aureus, the pathogenic organism which has been shown to be associated with toxic shock syndrome. Special attention has been paid to Carefree Super, the brand associated with the first two diagnosed Australian cases; examples of this product of both Australian and New Zealand origin were examined.</PARA>
<PARA> No unusual features were found in the chemical components and only one variety of tampon, Tampax Super Plus, was found to contain the chemical additive carboxy-methyl-cellulose. However, this material does not now appear to play a significant role in the causation of the disease.</PARA>
<PARA> It is of particular significance that comprehensive bacteriological testing has failed to confirm the presence of Staphylococcus aureus in any unused product sold in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> During the course of test procedures consultation has been maintained with health authorities in the United States, New Zealand and other countries. The results we have obtained here have been in close agreement with the findings in these countries. There is, therefore, no valid scientific reason for continuation of the voluntary withdrawal from sale of Carefree Super brand tampons of New Zealand origin which was imposed following the diagnosis of the first two Australian cases. Neither is there any evidence to support the more general withdrawal from sale of other tampon brands. The two subsequent cases have been associated with tampons other than Carefree Super.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department is completing discussions with manufacturers and importers of tampons and arrangements are being made for comprehensive ongoing surveillance of tampon quality and hygiene. Matters under discussion included inspection of manufacturing facilities, codes of good manufacturing practice, standards for tampons, revision of package inserts and the placing of warning and ingredient labels on outer packages.</PARA>
<PARA> On 5 March 1981 I issued a news release on the results of investigations into causes of this disease.</PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman of the National Health and Medical Research Council has also issued a press statement stressing the necessity for a high standard of personal hygiene in the use of tampons, and recommending appropriate precautions to reduce the risk of tampon associated toxic shock.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the industrial surveillance I have outlined, Australian scientific research and consultation and co-operation with health authorities at an international level will continue.</PARA>
