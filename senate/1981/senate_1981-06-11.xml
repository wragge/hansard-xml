<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate, in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned at proposed future hydro-electric developments in South West Tasmania. As this area is on the Register of the National Estate it is therefore of national concern and your petitioners humbly call upon the Senate to conduct a Senate Inquiry into South West Tasmania. A Federal Inquiry has been recommended by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly call upon the Federal Parliament not to allocate funds or allow funds to be raised for development of roads or dams in the South West of Tasmania but rather to provide such funds as would enable the preservation of this area. This is a national issue and therefore Tasmanians should not be made to bear any financial burden resulting from its preservation.</PARA>

This applies not only to sun cancer but also to other problems to which the honourable senator's question might properly refer. Whether certain products-nourishing, moisturising or revitalising creams-should attract different rates of financial impost is a question which would involve a matter of policy.

Has the Treasurer received representations from business sources expressing concern at the effects the increasing infrastructure borrowings have on the funds available for business and housing in particular?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I understand that the Treasurer has received representations from business sources expressing concern about the size of the developmental and other projects that are at planning stages. The Government has called a Premiers Conference for 19 June and these matters, amongst others, will be discussed with the States at that time and at the Loan Council meeting. The Commonwealth takes the view that the call on resources and financial markets by the public sector should be restrained to make way for productive growth in the private sector consistent with reducing the rate of inflation. Of course, in the economic context these are matters that properly must be discussed with the Premiers. If any further information arises from Senator Archer's question I will see that he is advised accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate to the enormous disruption to Australian community life that has been caused by the Fraser Government's new federalism policy, which seems to amount to the Federal Government shedding responsibilities on to the States, an attitude further manifested in the razor gang's decisions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McIntosh's question raised two issues. One related to the new federalism policy of the Government and the other to the construction of the new Parliament House. Let me deal with the latter first. There may be differing views as to the need for the construction of the new Parliament House, but a decision has been taken, and is being proceeded with I understand--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator. There is bipartisan support here but I do not know whether it is quite so enthusiastic outside this place. But the fact is that a decision has been taken. We have started down the track and will continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That decision does not seem to have very much to do with the other aspect of the question, namely, new federalism. That policy, of course, has been designed to renew and has been successful in renewing the spirit of true federalism in this country after the years of Labor government in particular. Perhaps over many years, even prior to that, centralist policies had been developing in this country. The new federalism policy is not just about money. It is about giving life, as I said, to the Federation, about giving power and responsibility to and consulting with the States. Over the last few years financial assistance grants-which the States are free to spend as they like-have significantly increased. This has given the States much greater freedom in decision making. But apart from that, and perhaps even more importantly than that there have been the consultative aspects of new federalism which, despite what may be said by Premiers in relation to some financial matters from time to time, are very greatly appreciated by them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs: Why is it that the Federal Government is displaying an inconsistent attitude by urging New Zealand not to host a tour by the South African rugby union team and yet no protests have been made when other countries such as Britain, France and Ireland have sent similar teams to South Africa and when in fact South Africans participate in many other sporting events in Australia and overseas? Does the Government not feel that its protests are being made inconsistently and selectively and that in fact the matter is one for the two countries involved to settle?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Government accepts unequivocally its obligations under the Gleneagles declaration on apartheid in sport to work to isolate South Africa from international sporting competition as long as the South African Government pursues its policy of apartheid. In addition to refusing South Africa's sporting teams or individuals representing South Africa entry into Australia, the Government has decided that no government grants will be made available to Australian sporting organisations to facilitate sporting contacts with South Africa. The Government opposed the tour of the British Lions rugby team to South Africa in 1980 and the current tour of South Africa by the Irish rugby team as vigorously as it opposes the forthcoming Springbok tour of New Zealand. There can be no question of inconsistency in our approach to such tours.</PARA></TALK.START>

Information is not available to me for May 1975, but in August 1980 there were 650,900 young people employed. This compares with 615,700 in August 1975.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Health. I refer to the misleading advertising practised by several cigarette companies which market many of their products under brand names containing the words 'mild' and 'extra mild'. Does the Minister agree that this description leads people to believe that they are smoking low tar cigarettes, whereas research has shown that most such brands have a much higher tar content? When does the Government propose to fulfil its undertaking of 19 March 1980 to require the labelling of Australian cigarettes with their correct tar and nicotine content? In particular, when will the Government restrict the use of the word 'mild' so that it is applied only to genuinely low tar brands?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot be certain but I suspect that the statement of 19 March 1980 was a response to a Senate standing committee report. In any event, the Government at about that time responded to a Senate standing committee report and undertook to go down the road in the way indicated by Senator Chipp. The problem seems to be to ensure that the public knows what is meant by the description 'mild' in relation to the tar content of cigarettes. The honourable senator will be aware that for some years now the Government has been examining the tar and nicotine content of different kinds of cigarettes. There have been periodic publications setting out the tar and nicotine content of the different brands of cigarettes available in Australia. I am as concerned as all honourable senators would be by the rising smoking rates, particularly among young Australians. I would want to ensure, as I think all honourable senators would want to ensure, that whatever decisions people make are made on the basis of accurate information. On the basis of that being the goal towards which the honourable senator is aiming, I will make his concerns known to my colleague the Minister for Health.

Certainly, the recommendations do present very great problems for the Commonwealth and the States. When I say 'the States', I mean all the States because of the natural conflict that results from the recommendations. At this stage let me emphasise that these are only recommendations. The Grants Commission can only make recommendations. It has done a very full and impressive job but I think it was always assumed that an exercise such as this major review of relativities would present difficulties.</PARA></TALK.START>

He expressed particular concern for tuition of attendants at sports arenas and swimming pools and those involved in the control of sports. The Minister will be aware of the multitude of television advertisements, mainly to sell cool drinks, which depict young people engaged in practices which could be described as potentially dangerous, particularly if attempted by inexperienced young people without supervision.

I cannot answer for Senator Grimes, but as one of the people who have worked in a spinal injuries unit I would assert that many of the people I saw there would not have been there had the most minimal precautions been taken. For example, people had dived head first into shallow water in the belief they were diving into deep water.

This scheme, in common with virtually every scheme that is funded by this Government, other than matters that come under the National Welfare Fund, depends upon an appropriation by this Parliament, as indeed was indicated by the honourable senator in his question. That means that this scheme, like all other schemes, is subject to budgetary considerations. As would be well known to honourable senators opposite who for a period participated in the national government-of course Senator Douglas McClelland was one of them-it is one thing to assess a desirable need and another then to find the money which enables one to aggregate all the desirable needs and to meet them. The program referred to is one for which there is a Commonwealth commitment, one for which the Commonwealth has provided funds. Of necessity, it is subject to the requirement that it be considered in a Budget context and that funds be made available for it in accordance with such funds as are generally available to meet the many desirable social and economic objectives of the Commonwealth Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The suggestion made by the honourable senator as to a method of meeting that policy commitment is one which I think goes outside the ways previously followed by Federal governments in administering transport concessions of this sort. It is a fact that there are administrative difficulties in this matter and I understand those difficulties arise from the fact that the Australian National Railways Commission uses as its agents various State railway organisations. As a result it is not directly within the ability of the ANR to provide the concession in accordance with the Government's policy. Therefore, it may be that we will be forced back to the suggestion made by Senator Cavanagh in his question. It would be the preference of the Government to administer the scheme in the same way as other transport concessions are administered. As I indicated earlier in the week, the matter is one which has been the subject of correspondence between me and the Minister for Transport, and I undertook to follow up the matter further with him. At this stage that has not been done personally by me but I think it has been followed up by my office. I will endeavour to get a firmer reply for the honourable senator as soon as possible.

Each year the Government has tried to make sure that the maximum possible support is given to medical research. The fact is that Australian medical research is of a very high calibre by world standards, that the achievements of medical research in Australia are very considerable and that the funding that is available, apart from going to individuals, goes to several world famous institutes, not least of which is the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The interest of Senator Kilgariff in the communications needs and problems of the Northern Territory is well known, and his concern for the people of the Northern Territory is acknowledged. I think most honourable senators will be aware of the very considerable communications difficulties which people face in some of the remote areas of Australia. They would include the difficulties faced by some of the people for whom I have direct ministerial responsibility. The fact that the Commissioners of the Australian Broadcasting Commission have seen fit to grant a new status to the Northern Territory, as Senator Kilgariff indicates in his question, is something which honourable senators would welcome. The honourable senator also draws to our attention the particular requirement for increasing the communications capacities in remote communities. That is one matter that we would want to see followed up.</PARA></TALK.START>

I can certainly say to the honourable senator that the Government does recognise the problems which he sets out in his question. It recognises the need to address these problems carefully. I remind the honourable senator that questions of communications in remote areas of the Northern Territory have been under active study for some time. They are a concern of the Government and we would want to see the maximum possible improvement in communications for the people of the Northern Territory.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Acting Leader of the Government, refers in part to earlier questioning concerning the Grants Commission report and his promise that conferences will be held to try to ameliorate the devastating impact of that report on Tasmania's future. It was reported in today's Press that the reduction in funds of some $64m will require some 2,000 jobs to be scrapped in the Public Service of that State. Is it a fact that Tasmania was the granary of the Australian colonies? Is it a fact that Melbourne was founded from Tasmania? In other words, is it a fact that the early history of Australia shows that, following European settlement, Tasmania nurtured this nation in its early infancy? As a Tasmanian senator, I ask: If the present-day Australian nation spurns Tasmania, leaving it to wither away and die like some ancient relative, what reason can the Minister offer for Tasmania to stay within the Federation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If anybody had any doubts about this chamber being a States House, those doubts would certainly have been put to rest as a result of the questions asked this morning about the Commonwealth Grants Commission report. I am glad that Senator Tate, an Opposition senator representing Tasmania, has joined his colleague Senator Watson, a Government senator from Tasmania, in standing up for the interests of their State. I am aware of the many virtues of Tasmania. I am grateful to have been given some other information, such as that contained in the first part of the honourable senator's question, which was a statement about the early history of Tasmania in relation to the foundation of Victoria. I think I had some understanding of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said earlier, naturally, there are very grave problems for some States-indeed for all States-as a result of these recommendations. I do not really believe that the States will be going to the lengths that are suggested by Senator Tate. Tasmania has benefited in many areas, not only under the financial assistance grants but also under many other grants. I have in mind legal aid. The per capita contribution to Tasmania for legal aid is well ahead of the average grant to other States for that purpose. Tasmania does derive very great benefits from its membership of the Federation, and indeed the other States in the Federation derive great benefits from Tasmania's membership.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Archer asked me a question in connection with the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme. I can provide some supplementary information. The Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme provides funds to consignors of eligible goods by sea. A fundamental change to the scheme-indeed, a new type of scheme-would be needed to extend it in some way to the carriage of goods by air whenever sea transport is unavailable. Similarly, a major change would be required to have a form of Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme applicable to sea and air consignments. It is not visualised that air transport would be a complete alternative to sea transport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of extending the scheme to cover air freight has been considered on a number of occasions. Each time it has been looked at it has been agreed that such an extension would probably result in a reduction in the availability of shipping services with an overall increase in transport costs which would disadvantage all Tasmanians in the longer term. As honourable senators will appreciate, not all commodities-for example, zinc, paper, et cetera-are able to be transported economically by air. Some of these commodities are vital to Tasmania and are dependent on viable shipping services. The provision of assistance on air freighted goods would, in fact, discriminate against these commodities. It is for this reason that the Equalisation Scheme applies only to goods transported interstate from Tasmania by sea and specifically excludes those goods transported by air.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today Senator Elstob asked me a question about medical research funding in Australia. I can add to the answer I gave him the following information: For 1980-81, $18.7m has been allocated to the National Health and Medical Research Council for support of medical research. That represents, in fact, a 33.5 per cent increase over the funding for the previous year. In real terms, if one allows for inflation, that represents an increase of one-sixth in funding. This significant increase in funding is consistent with the thrust of the honourable senator's question and is consistent with the Government's intention to increase gradually the level of funding for medical research to international standards as economic conditions allow. The number of project grants will increase from 543 to 592 and the number of program grants-that is, institutional grants-will increase from three to eight. The only other point on that matter is to observe that the NHMRC funding is actually a calendar year funding. The Budget, of course, provides for financial year figures and the actual NHMRC budget for the calendar year 1981 will be about $22.7m.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was asked a question by Senator Kilgariff on 10 June concerning malaria in Australia. I have some extra information to the answer I gave. Notifications of malaria from all over mainland Australia, not just from the north, indicate that the number of cases of malaria continues to increase. As I said in my answer yesterday, this refers to malaria which is imported into Australia. There is, therefore, a risk of malaria being re-established in the areas of Australia north of the 19th parallel where climatic conditions would permit a resurgence. The increase is due partly to the fact that there is a resurgence of malaria in many of the malarious areas of the world. This is partly reflected in an increase in the incidence of malaria in travellers returning to Australia after visiting some of the malarious areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator asked about action being taken to prevent re-establishment of malaria in this country. The action being taken includes: Firstly, the Commonwealth in conjunction with State and Territory health authorities has an efficient vigilance system in northern Australia. This was demonstrated in 1977 when a threatened outbreak at Cape York was prevented and, again, when three cases occurred on Moa Island last year. Secondly, all microscopically diagnosed cases are notified to a central register and a close watch is kept on the infective potential of all cases. Thirdly, preventive and radical treatments are administered to travellers who have been in malarious areas at certain ports of entry into Australia such as Darwin, Gove, Groote Eylandt, Bamaga and Thursday Island. Fourthly, mosquito control measures are well developed in the Northern Territory and insecticide spraying of houses is done twice a year in the highly vulnerable Torres Strait Islands by the Queensland Government. Fifthly, plans are well advanced for the establishment of a malaria field station in Torres Strait. Sixthly, advice on prophylactic measures for travellers to malarious areas is updated regularly. There are currently available publications which set out these matters and which I can make available to the honourable senator.</PARA>

<PARA>RUSSIAN WOODPECKER INTERFERENCE TO OTHER SERVICES</PARA>
<PARA> Member countries of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) including Russia agree to abide by ITU and Radio Regulations. There is an ITU mechanism for protest if harmful interference is caused to radio systems of any member country which is operating within the legal framework of the ITU Radio Regulations. There has to date been no positive evidence of serious harmful interference to any Australian Service from the Russian Woodpecker Over-the-Horizon (OHR) Radar.</PARA>
<PARA> The Woodpecker is a military system alleged to be transmitting from a location near Kiev in the USSR. It is believed to operate on the ''back scatter'' principle with high power radio frequency pulses being emitted at a rate of about ten per second.</PARA>
<PARA> This system requires sensitive receiving equipment which is linked with sophisticated processing and computer facilities to build up a continuously updated image of objects in a given target area, which may be located some thousands of kilometres distant.</PARA>
<PARA> Because of the continually changing ionosphere, on which OHR depends, it is necessary to also constantly change the operating frequency of such transmissions to permit radar signals to continue to track a given target area.</PARA>
<PARA> Services which can be affected are the Amateur Service and the Citizens Band Radio Service (CBRS). As the Amateur Service shares a number of bands with other services and has allocations of frequencies to choose from at any given time, there should be scope for avoiding the usually transient interference effects from such radar transmission by Amateur operators temporarily shifting to another frequency at the time such interference is present.</PARA>
<PARA> Interference to amateurs is particularly evident in the 14 MHz band where it is often harmful in the sense that a change to a less useful frequency is necessary. Interference to the CBRS is believed to have been minimal in Australia as there has been little complaint until now.</PARA>
<PARA> There are no simple technical measures to combat the interference. The signals in Australia depend on Russian power output; and ionospheric conditions above the earth, which vary with solar conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Communications has written to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications in the USSR to ask them to investigate the matter, and are currently awaiting a reply.</PARA>

<PARA> (ii) ensures that those in genuine need receive special assistance to cover their hospital and medical bills;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) results in other people contributing towards the cost of the health services they receive-either totally out of their own pockets or through health insurance;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) ensures that health insurance is available to all people at a reasonable cost and directs the relevant government subsidies towards those who are willing to help themselves;</PARA>
<PARA> (v) recognises the importance of the community rating principle for a viable health insurance industry;</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) fully acknowledges the important role of the private sector of the health care delivery system, particularly private hospitals; and</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) seeks to ensure that users and providers of health care services become more aware of the costs they generate. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill now before the Senate will also:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Ensure immediate eligibility to receive basic insurance benefits for people taking out such cover with a registered health fund between 1 September and 31 October 1981 irrespective of any pre-existing illness conditions;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) ensure that those people who lose their entitlement to a pensioner health benefit or health care card and then choose to insure with a registered health fund can immediately become eligible for benefits at the basic coverage level;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) provide for the Commonwealth to pay all nursing home benefits and, so, take over responsibility for those nursing home benefits currently paid by health funds for insured persons;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) strengthen the powers of medical and optometrical services committees of inquiry to increase their effectiveness in combating the provision of excessive services by medical practitioners and optometrists;</PARA>
<PARA> (v) provide further protection to people in a nursing home against being unnecessarily charged for 'extras' that would normally be regarded as part of nursing home care and, therefore, included in the approved fee;</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) expand the operation of the isolated patients' travel and accommodation assistance scheme;</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) give effect to certain recommendations made by the pathology services working party which have been accepted by the Government;</PARA>
<PARA> (viii) overcome a problem in the existing legislation which relates to the bulk billing of certain pathology services; and</PARA>
<PARA> (xi) extend the Commonwealth's supervision of the production and supply of certain therapeutic goods. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the Senate will recall that in the statement by the Minister for Health on 29 April in another place on the Government's new health policy he outlined new funding arrangements it is proposed to introduce for State health services. They are designed to ensure that the waste, inefficiencies and unnecessary duplication of costly equipment in State public hospital systems highlighted by the Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals are overcome. Such waste and inefficiency cannot be allowed to continue. It results in a needless burden on all taxpayers and the Government would be neglecting its duties if it failed to take appropriate action. The Jamison inquiry found that a major reason for such waste and inefficiency was the problem of divided responsibility between the Commonwealth and State governments. The inquiry recommended that this should be corrected by requiring the states to take up their full constitutional responsibilities for the provision of health services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's new health care funding arrangements will give the States greater freedom in the spending of Commonwealth funds previously provided for specific health purposes. The States will now be totally responsible for determining their own priorities in this area and appropriately allocating resources. The new health funding arrangements will do this. The relevant enabling legislation-the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Bill-has already been considered by the Senate. However, an appropriate amendment to the Health Insurance Act is necessary because South Australia and Tasmania have agreements with the Commonwealth that operate until 30 June 1985 under which the Commonwealth cost-shares the agreed net operating expenses of their public hospitals. This is achieved in the Bill now before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that some States may seek to undermine the new health service funding arrangements by transferring traditional State functions in the nursing home area to the Commonwealth. It is recognised, for example, that some States could seek to re-classify public hospitals as State Government nursing homes. This would result in the Commonwealth paying nursing home benefits for such people. To protect the Commonwealth against such action the Bill will ensure that State Government nursing homes are not to be approved in future for the purpose of paying nursing home benefits without consideration of the need for such homes in the same way that other nursing home proposals are considered. Similarly, States could seek to classify institutions now receiving their financial support as Commonwealth deficit-financed nursing homes. Such action would, again, be unacceptable to the Commonwealth. The Bill now before the Senate prevents such an action. However, a ministerial discretion is provided in appropriate circumstances where the Minister considers a transfer of a State financial responsibility is not involved. </PARA>
<PARA> A basic element of the Government's health policy is that the Commonwealth should provide special assistance to cover the hospital and medical bills of those in genuine need namely: Persons holding pensioner health benefit cards; migrants and refugees during their first six months in Australia; people in receipt of unemployment and special benefits with private incomes below the pensioner health benefit limits; and people whose incomes fall below certain specified limits, plus their dependants. The Commonwealth will ensure that these people will continue to have free access to public hospitals by placing an appropriate condition on the States and Northern Territory. For States other than South Australia and Tasmania this is by a condition in the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Bill 1981. For South Australia and Tasmania the agreed arrangements will provide for such a condition to apply. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, in the face of recent media speculation as to the position of pensioners under the Government's new health policy, I would like to again reassure all those people who hold pensioner health benefit cards and their dependants that there will be no change in their position after 1 September next. The Bill now before the Senate therefore retains the existing arrangements for eligible pensioners and their dependants. These people will continue to be entitled to free private medical services where their doctor bulk bills them. And, as at present, where such a person's doctor chooses not to bulk bill, they will be entitled to a Commonwealth medical benefit of 85 per cent of the schedule fee, with a maximum payment-known as 'the gap payment'-of $5 per service where the doctor charges the schedule fee or less. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will introduce similar arrangements for those other groups outlined above who are considered to be in special need. They will be eligible for free public hospital accommodation and treatment and free bulk-billed medical services. They, in the majority of cases, will receive a health care card before such treatment becomes necessary. A Commonwealth medical benefit of 85 per cent will apply to bulk billed private medical services they receive. This compares with the present level of 75 per cent for those persons classified by their doctors as disadvantaged. It is expected that the majority of people covered will be bulk billed and, therefore, will not have to meet any 'gap' payment. Doctors are, of course, free to choose not to bulk-bill. Provision is therefore made in the Bill for holders of a health care card to be paid a Commonwealth medical benefit of 85 per cent through registered health insurance organisations in such circumstances-in the same way eligible pensioners are-with a maximum 'gap payment' of $5 for each service, so long as the doctor charges no more than the schedule fee. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that under the Government's new health policy, those people considered to be in a special need are being clearly defined for the first time. The Government has decided to take this action-and no longer leave this in the hands of individual doctors-because of a dual concern, namely: That bulk billed medical services provided under the existing disadvantaged arrangements are growing at a rate which would indicate that those services have been made available to persons who could not normally be regarded as disadvantaged; and people in genuine need are not always able to gain the protection of those arrangements. The Bill enables a person to apply for a health care card on the grounds that he or she fell within the low income category at the time a medical or hospital service was provided. The application may be lodged up to 13 weeks after the service was provided. In special circumstances a longer period will be acceptable. This means that it is not essential that people in special need have a health care card before they receive a service. Of course these new arrangements for those in special need will not apply prior to 1 September 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government estimates that nearly two million eligible pensioners and their dependants will be protected in this way and that up to one million people will be eligible for special assistance under the new health care card arrangements. Mr President, I would point out to the Senate that it will not be necessary for these people to take out medical or hospital insurance. However, if they want doctor of choice in a public hospital or wish to use a private hospital, they would-as is now the case-need to take out hospital insurance. I would also point out that the Government recognises that should any person lose his or her entitlement to a pensioner health benefit or health care card, they can obtain immediate cover by basic insurance with a registered health fund. The Bill will achieve this by requiring funds to waive the two months waiting period before people taking out insurance are entitled to receive both hospital and medical benefits at the basic level in such cases. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Government's new health policy those persons-and their dependants-not protected by the special assistance arrangements outlined above will be required to meet their hospital and medical bills. They may choose to do so by personal payment or through insurance. There are, therefore, considerable advantages in taking out insurance, or maintaining one's cover, after 1 September. Additional advantages will be as follows: Commonwealth medical benefits will be available only to those with at least basic medical cover with a registered health fund; secondly, the Commonwealth medical benefit payable will be at a flat rate of 30 per cent and will apply to all items included in the medical benefits schedule; additionally, the total benefit payable to a person with basic medical insurance will be equal to 85 per cent of the schedule fee with a maximum 'gap' payment of $10 where the doctor charges the schedule fee or less-this compares with the present level of 75 per cent and a maximum gap of $10; and, fourthly, a tax rebate of 32c in the dollar will apply for the cost of basic medical and/or hospital insurance with a registered health fund. </PARA>
<PARA> These new arrangements will apply from 1 September 1981. As the Treasurer (Mr Howard) stated in his second reading speech when introducing the Income Tax (Assessment and Rates) Amendment Bill 1981, this rebate will be at a rate of 32c in the dollar and will apply to amounts paid on or after 1 July 1981 for basic hospital and/or medical insurance cover from that date with a registered health fund. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators will be aware, persons taking out health insurance are normally required to wait two months before they are entitled to receive benefits at the basic level. The Government has decided that this waiting period should be waived between 1 September and 31 October next. The Government has also decided to put beyond any doubt that a fund should not apply a pre-existing ailment exclusion provision to people taking out insurance at the basic level during this period. As a result, no fund can refuse to accept any person applying for insurance cover at the basic level, no matter how seriously ill they might be when they apply and no matter how long they may have suffered from the illness. This anti-discriminatory measure also applies, of course, to women who are pregnant. </PARA>
<PARA> I would stress, Mr President, that the introduction of these legislative provisions should not be seen as a criticism of registered health funds as a whole. The Government believes that, generally speaking, the funds act to ensure that their members receive proper protection against the high cost of health care. However it must be recognised that some funds-very few in number-may not always act in this way and so the Commonwealth must have the means of ensuring that no insured persons are adversely affected by actions of a fund that are contrary to government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to further its aim of ensuring that insurance is available at a reasonable cost-and, at the same time, to provide greater protection for the aged and the chronically ill in relation to the cost of nursing home care-the Government has decided to take over full responsibility for the payment of nursing home benefits. The amendments to the National Health Act provided for in Part III of the Bill-together with complementary amendments to the Nursing Homes Assistance Act-will give effect to this decision. They will operate from 1 September 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1 October 1977 registered hospital benefits organisations have been required to pay, as part of basic hospital insurance, all nursing home benefits for their members. These benefits payable by the funds are equivalent in level to the benefits the Commonwealth pays for all patients in nursing homes who are not insured. The Government has decided that this arrangement is unsatisfactory for two principal reasons, namely: Nursing home patients are, in the strict sense, uninsurable through voluntary insurance in which guaranteed benefits without discrimination or exclusions are made mandatory; and the arrangement represents an inequitable liability for the bulk of people with hospital insurance. The Government believes that this decision will ensure a more equitable distribution of the cost of Commonwealth assistance to those in need of nursing home care. The Government also believes that this measure will further assist in containing the cost of health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will also be providing additional protection for people receiving nursing home care by new provisions to more clearly prevent nursing homes imposing a levy or compulsory additional charge on patients. Regrettably some nursing homes attempt to circumvent the present fee control arrangements by such measures. The Bill before the Senate will prevent this practice. I would add, Mr President, that the great bulk of nursing homes do not attempt to pursue such practices and these new provisions should in no way be taken as a reflection on the industry as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill now before the Senate also gives effect to the Government's decision to prohibit registered health benefit funds from operating optional benefit tables. These tables undermine the community rating principle under which the cost of health insurance is borne equally by contributors with such cover. The effect of this principle is to reduce the cost of health insurance to the more needy sections of the community-such as the aged, the chronically ill and families with children. The Bill will therefore strengthen the community rating principle. It will also simplify the present health insurance arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth fully acknowledges the important role of the private sector of the health care delivery system. The Government has received a number of submissions expressing concern at the financial problems facing private hospitals. It recognises that in the medium to longer term its overall health policy will assist in correcting this situation. However, immediate action is necessary to assist private hospitals in meeting the increased cost of servicing surgical beds. Surgical facilities in private hospitals should continue to be available to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> To achieve this goal a higher rate of subsidy-of $28 per day-is to be introduced for private hospital patients whose admission to hospital or subsequent treatment is primarily related to a surgical procedure. The new subsidy will operate from the date the Bill receives royal assent. The existing bed day subsidy of $16 per day will be retained for non-surgical patients in private hospitals. It is proposed that the medical services in private hospitals that will attract the higher subsidy will be prescribed in regulations. The Bill also provides that the Minister for Health will have a discretionary power to review individual cases, and by a regulation, to admit additional schedule items to the approved list. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill now before the Senate contains a number of provisions related to the Isolated Patients' Travel and Accommodation Scheme, the Therapeutic Goods Act and several machinery matters. The IPTAAS Scheme is to be expanded in line with the Government's decision last year to include cleft lip and cleft palate patients under 22 years of age requiring orthodontic and associated treatment and other patients requiring specialist oral surgery. The extension of the scheme is to apply retrospectively from 1 January 1981 to coincide with the date of the inclusion of orthodontic treatment for cleft lip patients in the medical benefits schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill now before the Senate would amend the Therapeutic Goods Act. The amendments seek to keep Australia abreast with other developed countries and further exemplifies the Government's belief that it should have the capability of ensuring that the therapeutic goods available in Australia are safe, pure, potent and of good quality. The Bill would amend the definition of therapeutic use to ensure that health care products and medical devices including contraceptive devices, pacemakers and artificial heart valves clearly come within the scope of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would also update the references to British publications which are the source of standards for goods for therapeutic use. Unless this is done, the standards upon which Australia has relied for so long would no longer have effect. The Bill would authorise the Minister for Health to set standards by references to other published sources. Under the present legislation the means for obtaining essential information about the way biological products are made is not available. The Bill would provide a mechanism to allow the Commonwealth, when necessary, to seek information about the manufacture and testing of biological products. It will also provide a mechanism to regulate their release onto the market. As the need for a complete list of the medicines used in Australia has long been felt, the Bill would establish the national register of therapeutic goods and provide the power to acquire information regarding the composition of goods included in the register. </PARA>
<PARA> To safeguard the rights of manufactures, the Bill will include appeal machinery. It will provide for appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against decisions of the Director-General that affect the commercial operations of a manufacturer. In addition, before the Director-General can seek information about medicinal preparations from a manufacturer for inclusion in the proposed register, those preparations must be declared by the regulations to be goods to which the register applies. The type of information must also be prescribed by the regulations. In this way the Parliament will have the opportunity to oversight the information which has been recorded. Similar arrangements will apply in relation to the expansion of the scope of the Therapeutic Goods Act. Before new health care products can be brought within its scope they must be prescribed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains a number of clauses related to the rendering of pathology services. It would correct an anomaly in relation to the assignment of benefits for pathology services. The Health Insurance Act now stipulates that in cases of bulk billing, a patient must assign his benefit at the time or after the service is provided. However, in the case of the majority of pathology services, the service is carried out sometime after a specimen is collected from the patient and the pathologist has no face-to-face contact with the patient. The amendment will enable benefits to be assigned in advance of the actual rendering of the pathology service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill includes a number of changes to the approved pathology practitioner provisions that were recommended by the pathology services working party. This working party was established by the Government in 1976 principally to review pathology arrangements, and schedule fees and benefits for pathology services. Its members included representatives from the Australian Medical Association, the Royal College of Pathologists of Australia, the Society of Pathologists in private practice, the Health Commission of New South Wales and Commonwealth departments. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the present arrangements medical practitioners requiring pathology tests to be performed must make their request in writing. The Bill now before the Senate will enable the Minister to approve requests in other forms so as to allow modern methods of data transmission to be used. In addition, the amendments would also enable the Minister to approve the use of alternative methods of modern storage media such as on microfilm and microfiche. The effect of the new provisions is to require the Minister for Health to keep the AMA informed in writing of any changes referred to the Medical Benefits Advisory Committee which involved variations to undertakings entered into by pathologists and for the Minister to be aware of the AMA comments before making such changes. The clause also provides for the AMA to be consulted ahead of the implementation of any recommendations by the Medical Benefits Advisory Committee which could lead to variations to undertakings. The Bill sets out those practices which were regarded by the pathology services working party as being inconsistent with the generally accepted standards of professional conduct. The effect of this will be to reduce the incidence of the provision of unnecessary practices. In order to clarify for approved pathology practitioners those practices prohibited by the Bill it will be necessary for them to enter into new undertakings with the Minister for Health. The Bill provides for the transition from the present undertaking to the new undertaking to be carried out in an orderly fashion . </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains a number of provisions which deal with the powers of medical and optometrical services committees of inquiry. Medical services committees of inquiry have been set up, under the provisions of the Health Insurance Act, in each State. One optometrical services committee of inquiry for the whole of Australia has also been set up under the Act, to serve a similar function in relation to optometrists. These committees form a peer review system which has been designed to combat the provision of excessive services by medical practitioners and optometrists. The provision of excessive services is a practice whereby medical services are provided to patients although such services are not reasonably necessary for the adequate medical care of the patients concerned. Doctors or optometrists who provide these services may claim Commonwealth medical benefits for them, through the bulk billing facility provided. This means that by providing these unnecessary services these doctors or optometrists are augmenting their income at the taxpayer's expense. </PARA>
<PARA> The medical profession is well respected within the community and the Government will work with the profession in maintaining these high standards of ethical conduct. As a corollary to this members of the profession who abuse or defraud financial arrangements put in place by the Government can expect no sympathy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill now before the Senate contains four proposals for increasing the effectiveness of the peer review system. These proposals have the agreement of the Australian Medical Association. The first proposal will enable the Minister for Health to appoint temporary members to casual vacancies. This will keep the committees fully operational during the time it takes to follow the statutory procedures for filling these vacancies on a permanent basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The second and third proposals, which are taken together in the proposed new section 96 of the principal Act, will require practitioners to attend hearings and to produce their clinical notes. Attendance at hearings will give a practitioner the opportunity, if he or she so wishes-and this will be without compulsion-to explain to members of a committee why he or she felt it necessary to provide the services in question. The presentation of clinical notes will give committee members a factual basis for making professional and objective judgments as to whether the services in question were necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill will allow MSCIs to recommend to the Minister that practitioners be counselled. Sometimes a committee, while being satisfied that excessive services have been provided, is also satisfied that they were provided in good faith by the practitioner concerned. At present the Act does not provide an appropriate course of action which the committees may recommend to the Minister in these instances. This proposal is intended to fill this gap. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators may rest assured that any information provided to committees under the provisions of this Bill will be treated in the strictest confidence. All persons involved in a committee hearing are bound by the secrecy provisions of section 130 of the Health Insurance Act 1973, the hearings are private and details of individual patients remain confidential. </PARA>
<PARA> Other machinery or clarifying amendments that will be of interest to honourable senators are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would extend the provisions in the National Health Act which presently permit the Minister to exempt an organisation from paying medical benefits for certain services to cover also benefits for hospitalisation in respect of these same services. The provision clearly defines the limits or exemptions and protects the rights of contributors who seek to transfer to another organisation because of the exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will put beyond doubt that under section 43A of the National Health Act the Director-General may request the balance sheets and related statements of nursing homes, as well as other relevant accounts such as profit and loss statements. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill now before the Senate will give effect to the health policy changes the Minister for Health announced on 29 April 1981. The overriding aim of the Government's new health policy is to ensure that all Australians have access to high quality health care at a cost the individual and the community can afford. The Government believes that the most equitable and responsible means of achieving that goal is through a combination of special assistance schemes for those in genuine need and the fostering of private health insurance for other people. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators should not lose sight of the fact that major government subsidies, financed through the general taxation system, are provided to ensure that health insurance is available to the average family man at a reasonable cost. However, the Government rejects the concept of a tax financed universal health insurance scheme. The Government believes that such an approach to health financing does not contain sufficient inbuilt checks and balances designed to prevent overuse and abuses of the health care delivery system-and, therefore, that such a system would inevitably lead to an increase in the overall cost of providing health services to the detriment of all taxpayers. Proper health care is vital to all Australians. But the Government's health policy must be both equitable and responsible. The Bill now before the Senate will achieve these dual goals. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the text of the statement to the report on industrial research and development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Science and technology provide the technical base for Australia's industrial advancement. The importance of this base has been underlined in reports from several inquiries over the past two or three years. The report on industrial research and development-IR&amp;D-in Australia from the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment has, since its publication in May 1979, made a substantial contribution to public discussion of science and technology issues and to the Government's consideration of policies in this area. The Committee identified a need for a statement of a national policy for science and technology and the report incorporates many suggestions and recommendations for elements to be included in national policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, many policy elements are already well established. These include the Government's commitment to encourage industrial research and development in the private sector and to support co-operation between Government research facilities and industry as evidenced by substantial increases in funding of IR&amp;D, the Government's continuing commitment to the work of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and support for private sector research associations. Government policies have been framed in recognition of the importance of science and technology in achieving rising standards of living for all Australians by expanding the current capabilities of industry. This Government firmly believes that research and development is an important element in providing the technological base for industry. The development of new technologies both at home and abroad and their absorption into Australian industry will continue to raise the competitiveness of industry and to increase productivity through more efficient use of resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Committee's report highlights the importance of establishing close links between scientific research and industrial research and development and notes that the two should be linked through public policy. The full integration of science and technology policy within that portfolio facilitates interaction between the two essentially different processes of pure science and technological development and will help in the formulation and application of policies to make each process more supportive of the other. The issues discussed in the Senate Committee's report have also been covered in a variety of contexts in reports from other bodies. These include the Independent Inquiry into CSIRO, Australian Science and Technology Council-ASTEC-the Committee of Inquiry in Technological Change in Australia and the Study Group on Structural Adjustment. As the recommendations relating to science and technology in each case have generally been in close accord, the Government's response to the other reports has also served to satisfy most of the recommendations of the Senate Committee. The issues so covered include support for industrial research and development. the operations of CSIRO, contracting out of Government R&amp;D, R&amp;D offsets, patents, encouragement to the formation of research associations, et cetera. Other issues concerning relationships between tertiary education institutions and industry are matters on which the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) and the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) will seek advice from the Tertiary Education Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The application of new developments in science and technology is a most important method of increasing productivity and competitiveness of Australian industry. Therefore the development of policies that will encourage the performance of industrial R&amp;D, lead to the effective application of existing technology and create an environment favourable to industrial innovation is being treated as a matter of national importance. The Senate Standing Committee report on industrial research and development has been of considerable value to the Government in assisting the formulation of Australian science and technology policies. With the concurrence of the Senate I incorporate in Hansard the Government's responses to the recommendations of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>REPORT FROM THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND THE ENVIRONMENT ON INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT</PARA>
<PARA>Government Response to Recommendations</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 1. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister give urgent attention to the expression of a clear national policy for science and technology against which planning decisions in support of IR&amp;D can be made. The policy should attempt to identify and support those scientific endeavours in which Australia could best pursue and achieve excellence, and which at the same time are likely to make significant contributions to national advancement. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC), after operating as an interim body from 1976, was formally established in 1979 to advise the Government on science and technology policies, has made a significant contribution to the development of policies in Australia. ASTEC has provided advice and recommendations on areas of science and technology which it considers to be of high national priority. The Government has provided substantially increased funds for those areas, which include marine science and technology, energy and industrial research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> Formulation, administration and coordination of science and technology policy has been enhanced by the establishment of the Department of Science and Technology. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 2</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister direct ASTEC to consider the feasibility of establishing a long-term national plan for the development and application of science and technology in relation to the furtherance of the national well being. This consideration should include a mechanism for involving the community in such planning. The example of the programme of the Royal Norwegian Council for Scientific Research may serve as a point of departure. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> ASTEC is currently engaged in studies to assist the determination of priorities in science and technology; they involve the cooperation and collaboration of scientists, technologists, industrialists and other relevant sections of the community. These studies will contribute to the development of long-range scientific and technological priorities. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 3</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister seek to orient policies for industry away from defensive strategies of protection, towards increased support for determined and adequately followed-through programmes of innovation, within national policies aimed at economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> In the White Paper on Manufacturing Industry the Government has stated a positive policy towards industry development. As part of that policy approach the Government has undertaken to pay special attention to development policies covering fields such as research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> Policy measures are in place, aimed at encouraging industry to make more effective use of existing technology and creating an environment favourable for industrial innovation. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular the Government's positive approach is reflected in its recent decision to upgrade the IR&amp;D Incentives Program and extend it for a further five years. The main focus of support for IR&amp;D will continue to be the project grants component of the IR&amp;D Incentives Act. The commencement grant element will continue, more detailed guidelines for project grants and public interest project will be issued and the Australian IR&amp;D Incentives Board strengthened. The grant limits for both project and commencement grants are to be increased.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has agreed that the proportion of its R&amp;D contracted out to industry should be increased. It will be increasing its support for new and existing research associations. It has substantially increased support provided under the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Program. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 4</PARA>
<PARA> The Government, depending upon the advice of ASTEC concerning the feasibility of a national plan for the development and application of science and technology, set up appropriate structures to construct, review, monitor and revise such a plan. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> This matter will be considered further in the light of further reports by ASTEC relating to recommendation 2. </PARA>
<PARA> Policy matters are monitored and reviewed in the present structure which incorporates departments and other bodies established by the Government to advise on various policy matters, including policies for science and technology. These include: the CSIRO Advisory Council; the Industrial Property Advisory Committee; Industry Advisory Councils; Commonwealth/State Ministerial Councils; and the National Energy Advisory Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 5</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister request ASTEC to examine, within the framework of national policies for science and technology, the desirability of setting up centres of excellence. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> In the 1980 Election Speech the Prime Minister announced support for research centres of excellence and has committed funds totalling $16 million for the period 1981-84 for this purpose. The Minister for Education recently announced a committee to recommend how these funds should be allocated. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 6</PARA>
<PARA> The Government give urgent consideration to the use and importance of technology assessment as a tool to assist in the formulation of national policies for science and technology and their relation to social development. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accepted the CITCA recommendation that a Standing Committee of ASTEC be established to review on a continuing basis the processes and trends in technological change in Australia and elsewhere; and to evaluate and report on the direct and indirect effects of technological change at the national level. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 7</PARA>
<PARA> The Government establish policies designed to remove disincentives from, and give positive encouragement to, the systematic commercial adoption of research results. The aim of these policies is to achieve an increase in the proportion of Gross Expenditure on Research and Development (GERD) expended on experimental development. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The encouragement of experimental development was one of the issues covered by ASTEC in its report 'Industrial Research and Development: Proposals for Additional Incentives'. Following consideration of that report and the report by CITCA, the Government has taken a number of initiatives to encourage experimental development; it has continued to substantially increase the support provided through the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Scheme and established a fund for energy research, development and demonstration projects. The Government will also increase the amount of its R&amp;D requirements which is contracted to industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 8</PARA>
<PARA> The Government considerably increase the level of funding for the Australian Industrial Research and Development Incentives Scheme. The level should be such as to at least maintain the effective value of funding of Commencement and Project Grants as in 1970, although the Committee considers that a much higher level than this is warranted of say, $50 million for Commencement and Project Grants and $50 million for 'Public Interest' projects. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Total funding for industrial research and development programs has been increased from $14M in 1977/78 to $54M in 1980/81 and will be reviewed annually in the budget context. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 9</PARA>
<PARA> The Government allocate an annual appropriation of about $50 million to ''Public Interest'' projects in addition to amounts allocated to Commencement and Project Grants. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Provision of funds for public interest projects under the IR&amp;D Incentives Act is determined in the Budget context. The Government has recently adopted guidelines for the selection of public interest projects and these will be announced before the amended Act comes into force on 1 July 1981. The nature and number of eligible projects is taken into account each year when determining the allocation of funds. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 10</PARA>
<PARA> The Government make Commencement Grants free of tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 11</PARA>
<PARA> The Government provide IR&amp;D incentives grants free of tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not support these recommendations. Exemption of these grants from taxation would result in anomalies as other forms of subsidy would remain liable for taxation. The Government has taken the view that if additional incentives for IR&amp;D are provided, they should be by way of increased expenditure on the IR&amp;D scheme, rather than by taxation concessions.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 12</PARA>
<PARA> The Government retain existing taxation allowances permitting depreciation of R&amp;D plant and equipment over 3 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will bear this recommendation in mind in any future consideration of changes to existing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Existing taxation allowances permit depreciation over a three year period on capital expenditure incurred for buildings and plant used for scientific research. In addition other expenditures of a capital nature, and payments to an approved research organisation for scientific research are allowable deductions for taxation purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 13</PARA>
<PARA> The Government ensure that all Departments involved in R&amp;D, CSIRO and Defence in particular, orient their policies towards maximising the amount of R&amp;D contracted to Australian Industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Following consideration of the ASTEC report ''Industrial Research and Development: Proposals for Additional Incentives'' the Government has accepted a recommendation to increase the proportion of its R&amp;D requirements contracted to industry. As a result Government departments and agencies are to examine their ongoing and planned activities with a view to preparing programs proposing R&amp;D contracts with industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the Government's decision relating to the Review of Commonwealth Functions direct Commonwealth involvement in defence science R&amp;D is to be reduced and universities and the private sector encouraged to perform more defence R&amp;D. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 14</PARA>
<PARA> The Government ensure that personnel, facilities, and information services of research establishments be provided as appropriate in support of consulting services to industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Government supports the principle that services provided to industry should be made available on a commercial consultancy basis and at commercial rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has recently taken a number of major initiatives in this field. To facilitate the matching of CSIRO resources to industrial needs a Bureau of Scientific Services has been formed comprising the existing Central Information, Library and Editorial Services, a new Science Communication Unit and an enlarged Commercial Group. </PARA>
<PARA> The Technology Transfer Council (TTC), directed by the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Metal Trades Industry Association and the Department of Science and Technology, has been set up to undertake a three year trial program in the Metals Industry to help firms in the application of technology and the resolution of technological problems. The Council draws heavily on the resources and expertise of research establishments in meeting the needs of industry. Following the Review of Commonwealth Functions the Government has decided to substantially reduce its activities in relation to technology transfer. Funding of the TTC is to be retained until 1982 and continuing Commonwealth involvement evaluated. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 15</PARA>
<PARA> The Government encourage its various instrumentalities to examine the possibilities of contracting research to tertiary education institutions, particularly where such institutions possess facilities or expertise not readily available elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accepted a recommendation by ASTEC that universities and colleges of advanced education be encouraged to engage in sub-contracting to industrial firms which have R&amp;D contracts with Government instrumentalities. Tertiary institutions will be encouraged to participate in the Government's R&amp;D contracting out program only where this is not at the expense of the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Public interest projects under the IR&amp;D Incentives Act can involve contracting out to tertiary institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 16</PARA>
<PARA> The Government look for ways in which certain entrenched attitudes towards what constitutes appropriate government intervention in industry may be revised, given the constraints imposed by political realities. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Attention is drawn to the statement by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in response to the Crawford Report (Hansard HR 23 August 1979). </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 17</PARA>
<PARA> The Government commission a comprehensive survey of Australia's management attitudes to R&amp;D, with the object of formulating strategies for strengthening positive attitudes toward innovation. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the Government's desire to reduce the ''paper burden'' on the private sector as stated in response to the Review of Commonwealth Functions, a comprehensive survey as recommended by the Senate Committee will not be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has undertaken to review the effectiveness of the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act prior to its expiry in 1986. Information relating to management attitudes will be taken into account in this review. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 18</PARA>
<PARA> The Government ensure that wherever possible, calls for tenders for government procurement specify performance requirements rather than, or as well as, design criteria. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Wherever possible, calls for tenders for government procurement will specify performance criteria. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 19</PARA>
<PARA> The Government closely examine the capabilities of such institutions as the Commonwealth Development Bank with a view to broadening them with respect to investment in developmental projects. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> This recommendation will be considered when the report of the Inquiry into the Australian Financial System is at hand. </PARA>
<PARA> The Interim Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System noted that in 1978 the Commonwealth Development Bank (CDB) was given broader scope to finance the development of all kinds of business undertakings, with an emphasis on smaller business enterprises. Since acquiring this broader charter, the share of new loan approvals going to the small (non-rural) business sector has increased substantially. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 20</PARA>
<PARA> The Government give full support to initiatives of the Department of Science and the Environment in awarding industrial fellowships. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Science and Technology will bring this matter forward for further consideration in the Budget context. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 21</PARA>
<PARA> The Government ensure that arrangements are made in each instrumentality which provides library-based information to consider the views of users. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The two major Commonwealth technical library-based information services are provided by the National Library and CSIRO. Both monitor national needs for scientific and technical library-based information services. CSIRO and the National Library of Australia have announced a new framework of co-operation in the science and technology area. This is aimed at facilitating more efficient dissemination of scientific and technological information to Australian users. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Library is evaluating a shift in emphasis from collection building and direct reference assistance to providing national services to support the activities of other libraries. CSIRO library and information services are following the Birch Report recommendation for further integration and rationalization in relation to a national network. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 22</PARA>
<PARA> The Government encourage attendance by Australians at international conferences on scientific and technological subjects. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Within budgetary constraints the Government already supports government and non-government scientists and technologists travelling overseas for a variety of purposes, including attendance at international conferences. Support is given through, for example, multilateral and bilateral exchange schemes and fellowship schemes. The learned Academies receive Commonwealth grants which among other things enable their members to attend meetings of their international affiliates. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 23</PARA>
<PARA> The Government, as a matter of urgency, collate the information already obtained through committees of inquiry into scientific and technological information services, bring it up-to-date, and present to Parliament a national information policy together with a scheme for the coordination and development of library-based information services. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth/State Ministers having responsibility for cultural affairs are considering the establishment of an Australian Libraries and Information Council to advise Commonwealth and State Ministers on means of securing coordination and cooperation in library and information services. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 24</PARA>
<PARA> The Government maintain all its international scientific and technological liaison posts. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Following the Review of Commonwealth Functions the Government has decided to substantially reduce staffing in the London and Washington posts and to revise overseas representation. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 25</PARA>
<PARA> The Government carry out a review of Australia's overseas scientific liaison arrangements to see whether there may not be advantages in strengthening those offices, or creating new ones, where the flow of technical information is particularly high (i.e. in North America, Europe and Japan). </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> See response to recommendation 24. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 26</PARA>
<PARA> The Government accept the OECD proposal to study the IR&amp;D activities of foreign owned companies in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The OECD has recently completed its report on the Impact of Multinational Enterprises on National Scientific and Technological Capabilities. The value of this report as a forerunner to further work is somewhat limited however, because of the difficulty in getting agreement between member countries on the validity of many of its findings. Further information of a related nature is being obtained by the Department of Science and Technology and the Bureau of Industry Economics, who are undertaking a joint study of trading in technology. This study is exploring the factors which influence the IR&amp;D and technology licencing policies of Australian companies. </PARA>
<PARA> These reports will be examined by the Department and proposals will be brought forward for any further action that is thought appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 27</PARA>
<PARA> The Government commission studies to learn more about current practices governing the importation of technological information and to determine whether their application is in Australia's best interest. </PARA>

<PARA>Recommendation 28</PARA>
<PARA> The Government commission studies of the significance of the flow of technology from Australia to other countries, looking in particular at its consequences for investment, research and employment. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Science and Technology and Bureau of Industry Economics have undertaken studies in several related areas. Further work has been dependent on priorities and the allocation of resources each year in the Budget. The Senate Committee's recommendation has been drawn to the attention of the Bureau. </PARA>
<PARA> See also response to recommendation 26. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 29</PARA>
<PARA> The Government provide increased support for research including academic studies of matters relating to science policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Government encourages government agencies involved in research into science policy issues to make their work widely available and welcomes additional academic studies on science policy matters. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 30</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Productivity undertake an examination of both the national and international relevance of present patent laws and agreements to Australia IR&amp;D and the importation of technology. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Industrial Property Advisory Committee is currently undertaking a comprehensive review of the patent system which will include consideration of the effectiveness of the patent system in encouraging the adoption of new technology by Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 31</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Productivity strengthen the means whereby assistance is given, possibly through collaboration with DSTO, to projects originating in industry for military equipment having export potential. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industry and Commerce will consult with the Ministers for Defence, Science and Technology, Trade and Resources, and Foreign Affairs on means to ensure that existing forms of assistance are being fully exploited to encourage and facilitate Australian industry projects for developing new military equipment for overseas markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Existing forms of assistance includes policies requiring Offsets to Overseas Procurement and Australian Industry Participation in Defence contracts. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 32</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Productivity require the Australian Industrial Research and Development Incentives Board to review its criteria for recognition under 6 (1) (b) and 7 (1) of the IR&amp;D Incentives Act 1976, in particular re-examining the case for recognition of the Industrial Design Institute of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The AIR&amp;D Incentives Board has examined the question of recognition of the Industrial Design Institute of Australia in terms of the professional qualifications of its members and their suitability in terms of the AIR&amp;D Incentives Act. Since the Institute accepts, as members, persons having no formal training, the Board has declined to provide a blanket approval for the Institute. However the Board is endeavouring to determine the suitability of individual courses and has recently decided to accept graduates from the Sydney School of Arts as 'approved employees' under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The criteria applied by the Board for recognition of professional institutes, approved research organisations under Section 6; and for recognition of Approved Employee status under Section 7 of the IR&amp;D Act have been chosen to ensure that the highest standards of R&amp;D are encouraged in Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 33</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Productivity introduce an amendment to the Industrial Research andDevelopment Incentives Act 1976 to relax the requirement for a company to employ at least one full-time 'approved employee' in favour of a provision whereby IR&amp;D may be contracted to an approved research organisation if required. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 34</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Productivity ensure in relation to Commencement Grants, that the rate of grant be set at 50% of eligible expenditure with a ceiling of at least $25 000 per company, the ceiling to be subject to revision only to take account of inflation or the need to increase motivation towards establishing an R&amp;D capability. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendations 33 and 34 were implemented as part of the new arrangements for the research and development grants introduced in the context of the 1978/79 budget. Furthermore the limit in relation to commencement grants was raised from $25 000 to $40 000 following consideration of the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 35</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Productivity review the published criteria for approval of grants with the object of making them as specific and as detailed as possible. In due course the criteria should reflect the priorities of a national plan for the development of industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's recent review of the IR&amp;D Incentives Act included an examination of the criteria for project grant assistance. The guidelines developed in that review are to be implemented from 1 July 1981 and are consistent with the Government's industry policy objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 36</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Productivity examine the possibility of preparing blanket forms of agreement. If it is not possible for the Australian Industrial Research and Development Incentives Board to issue blanket forms of agreement then, as an alternative, attention should be drawn in the Explanatory Notes to any mandatory standard clauses. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> A standard form of agreement for project grants is in use by the Australian Industrial Research and Development Incentives Board. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 37</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Productivity alter the application of the IR&amp;D Incentives Act such that if a grant application is successful then grants are made retrospective to the commencement of the project, provided adequate records have been maintained by the applicant. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Project grants are payable retrospectively to the date of application by the company. Entitlement to a project grant depends on an agreement being entered into between the company and the AIR&amp;D Incentives Board. R&amp;D projects should be discussed with the Board to ensure that the necessary criteria are met before the project is commenced by the company. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 38</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Productivity ensure that the provisions of Section 22 of the IR&amp;D Incentives Act be scrupulously observed. In particular, commercial information provided in support of a grant application should remain confidential to the Board and not be discussed with other departments or outside organisations without the express permission of the applicant company.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Research and Development Incentives Board maintains strict confidentiality on information provided by applicant companies. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 39</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Productivity establish procedures and criteria for review and re-evaluation of project grant agreements, to take account of project cost changes and the value of the project end product to the community. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The AIR&amp;D Incentives Board undertakes periodic reviews of projects and considers cost and other changes. See also Response to Recommendation 35. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 40</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Productivity require the Australian Industrial Research and Development Incentives Board to review its procedures, to ensure that more efficient manufacturing processes are not ignored, when considering projects under the heading of 'improved processes for or in connection with the production or use of material products'. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> New arrangements which follow the review of the IR&amp;D Incentives Act will direct the Board to rank project grant applications according to their potential contribution to the Government's industry policy objectives. A technical standing committee will be established to advise the Board on specialised technical and commercial aspects of the selection and progress of IR&amp;D supported by grant assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 41</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Productivity in collaboration with the Minister for Home Affairs, examine the situation with respect to searches of overseas patents, with a view to establishing a system to improve access to INPADOC information.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Improvements have been made by the Patent, Trade Marks and Designs Office, the National Library and others to provide Australian industry with easier and cheaper access to patent information on both overseas and local patents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Patent Office is continuing to develop systems in patent, trade marks and designs administration and patent examination searching. This includes an online inquiry facility; which it is planned, should eventually be available in regional sub-offices and will be suitable for direct access from industry and patent attorney offices. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 42</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Productivity continue to give full support to proposals for research into machine tool technology and management, with a view to assisting establishment of a 'Centre of Excellence' in this subject. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Following the Review of Commonwealth Functions the Government has decided to evaluate continuing Commonwealth support of the machine tool technology work at Swinburne Institute of Technology through support for the Technology Transfer Council (TTC). Commonwealth funding support for the TTC will continue until 1982. The TTC provides a field extension service to the metals manufacturing industry, making use of expertise available in universities and institutes of technology as well as the CSIRO Division of Manufacturing Technology. </PARA>
<PARA> The CSIRO Divisions of Material Science and Applied Physics will continue to make valuable contributions to research and development in this field. </PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Science and the Environment review the methods, manpower and facilities of Project SCORE to ensure that results are published frequently and as early as possible after completing a survey. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Responsibility for conducting the Project SCORE surveys was transferred from the Department of Science and the Environment to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) in December 1978. Following the Review of Commonwealth Functions, Project SCORE surveys will have their frequency reduced from every two years to every three years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Science and Technology retains overall responsibility for Project SCORE, particularly for policy interpretation and comparative analysis of the survey data with other information pertaining to Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> It is intended that the Australian Science and Technology Statement including Commonwealth Government expenditures on research and development will be published on an annual basis. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 44</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Science and the Environment initiate studies to determine the extent to which measurements relating to the output or value of R&amp;D, and scientific information collection and diffusion, can be made and incorporated in Project SCORE, to enhance the value of the material already provided. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The first steps towards inclusion of R&amp;D output indicators in Project SCORE have been taken and further examination of output indicators and the resources required for their generation is in hand. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 45</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Science and the Environment through CSIRO, examine mechanisms such as liaison with further research associations whereby closer contact can be made with industry, including small businesses, to gain increasing awareness of trends and problems, and to facilitate timely relevant assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> In the statement by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the Government's response to the CITCA Report it was noted that support for new and existing research associations will be increased (Hansard (HR) 18 September 1980). New research associations will be assisted by initial Government grants of $40,000 plus matching grants on a $1 for $1 basis up to $200,000 per annum for up to 5 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Increased support for new and existing research associations will enable CSIRO to increase its contacts with industry, including small businesses. Following Government acceptance of a recommendation of the Independent Committee of Inquiry into CSIRO, the Executive of CSIRO established a Planning and Evaluation Advisory Unit in February 1979. The Unit's objectives include forecasting industry trends and problems, and research opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the amended Science and Industry Research Act (1978) the Organization's Advisory Council was reconstituted with enhanced functions including the provision of advice to the Executive in relation to industrial and economic matters. This role is strengthened by the revised (also under the amended Act) membership and functions of State Committees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Organisation is also active in promoting mechanisms aimed at increasing contact with particular sectors of industry, for example, Metal Trades Industry Association-CSIRO Committees, CSIRODIAL, Australian Scientific Industry Association SIROMATH P/L. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 46</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Science and the Environment investigate the merit of, and possible arrangements for, grants to tertiary education institutions made specifically for industrially oriented research, particularly as this relates to community services and problems. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The IR&amp;D Incentives Act provides for companies to employ universities and colleges, which are approved research organisations under the Act, on specific IR&amp;D projects. </PARA>
<PARA> See also response to recommendation 15. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 47</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Science and the Environment request CSIRO to explore the possibilities of an increase in joint project activities with universities. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> A Joint Committee of CSIRO and the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee is exploring the feasibility and implications of increased joint project activities. A comprehensive survey of the contacts occurring between CSIRO Divisions and Australian universities is being undertaken with the aim of promoting increased collaboration. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 48</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Science and the Environment request CSIRO to give attention to considering all tertiary education institutions in any proposals aimed at encouraging secondment or interchange of staff. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> CSIRO has been actively exploring mechanisms for establishing closer relations with all tertiary education institutions. The matters raised by the Senate Committee are being taken into account in discussions with those institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 49</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Science and the Environment request CSIRO to give consideration to creating opportunities for undergraduate training in connection with the 'industrial situation' experience required for certain science and engineering courses. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> See response to recommendation 48. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 50</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Science and the Environment examine the proposal, that in addition to establishing a joint CSIRO and Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee covering universities (as recommended by the independent inquiry into CSIRO) the CSIRO seek a mechanism for promoting collaboration with other sectors of tertiary education, in particular institutes of technology, through the Australian Conference of Principals of Colleges of Advanced Education. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> See response to recommendation 48. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 51</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Science and the Environment request CSIRO to consider the need for mechanisms such as consultative committees to identify areas of potential beneficial collaboration with tertiary education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> See response to recommendation 48. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 52</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Science and the Environment request the CSIRO Executive to review the Organization's recruitment and secondment policies in the light of its statutory commitments, taking into account its recently introduced revised structure. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> CSIRO's acknowledged success as a research organisation with an enviable national and international reputation is to a large degree due to its policy, followed since its establishment, of selecting the best people available for its research positions. This policy has been reaffirmed by successive Executives of CSIRO and is one which the organisation believes is crucial to its continuing success. The Organisation recognizes the value of both host and home agency of exchanges and secondments of staff and will continue to encourage such arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 53</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence ensure an outward looking approach to DSTO planning which takes into consideration the need to build up domestic industry as well as Australia's defence needs in the light of the anticipated world situation. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Defence Science and Technology Organisation's (DSTO) main role is to provide scientific support to the Defence Organisation. Only a small part of its resources are devoted to fostering the development of equipment which might lead to later production. Notwithstanding this, the Department of Defence has been able to take a number of measures to enhance industry capability. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 54</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence re-orient Departmental policies for R&amp;D contracts and equipment procurement, towards recognising a progressive build up of R&amp;D capability in Australian industry as an important element in national defence.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> As part of the Government's policy of increasing the amount of R &amp; D contracted to industry, greater emphasis will be given to R &amp; D offsets. There is a limit to what Defence alone can do but it has made significant progress. For example the $26 million development of the Barra Sonobouy in Australian Industry is nearing successful completion. (See also response to recommendations 13 and 53). </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 55</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence ensure that means exist for considering potential overseas users, particularly ASEAN nations, when drawing up new equipment requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> It is Government policy to include consideration of possible overseas interest and requirements when planning local equipment development and to accommodate these to the extent practicable within the primary objective of satisfying Australian Defence requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 56</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence ensure that overseas defence equipment purchase be established as a second preference to domestic procurement, requiring strong justification and only resorted to after full exploration of possible domestic suppliers. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> This recommendation is established Government policy but for many major Defence equipments it is not practicable to buy Australian. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 57</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence ensure that industry participation in military project R&amp;D is invited as early as possible, preferably at the pre-specification preparation stage. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Report itself refers to Defence projects where industry has been funded to develop equipment at the pre-specification stage. This reflects a deliberate policy of early involvement of industry in Defence projects wherever practicable. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 58</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence arrange for membership of the Defence (Industrial) Committee to be increased to include wider representation of industrial R&amp;D interests. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Industry representation on the Panel of the Defence Industry Committee (DIC) examining ways in which more Defence R &amp; D work could be contracted to industry was expanded during the course of its investigations during 1979-80.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The National Committee on Discrimination in Employment and Occupation has reported again for the year 1979-80. I draw attention to the fact that a large number of complaints are made by people in the Australian work force about discrimination in their employment. This report records 665 such complaints. The significant thing about the complaints is that the majority of them have to do with discrimination on the ground of sex. In fact, 54 per cent of the complaints recorded are on that ground. Of course, this finding will come as no surprise to those honourable senators who are aware of the difficulties faced by women in employment in Australia, despite the fact that some States now, notably New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, have at the State level anti-discrimination legislation designed to prevent discrimination on the ground of sex. </PARA>
<PARA> The operation of the National Committee on Discrimination in Employment and Occupation is useful as it makes available to the Parliament these figures about discrimination on the basis of sex and other matters. However, I would like to make the point that this Committee and the State committees-which the national Committee represents-have no powers to resolve complaints. All that the committees can do is investigate a complaint and then seek to persuade those employers who are discriminating to cease that discrimination. In some cases they have been successful. However, in many cases they have not been successful in persuading employers to cease discrimination. Details of the unresolved cases are in the report for honourable senators to read. Where an employer continues discrimination in face of an attempt by the Committee to have that discrimination ceased the Committee has only one option; that is, to report to the Minister who, under privilege, can then table this report in Parliament. To my knowledge this has never happened. This mechanism for exposing discriminatory employers has not been used in the Parliament. Therefore, I would say that the mechanism is quite useless. </PARA>
<PARA> It leads me to the main comment I wish to make in respect of this report. It is clear that there is a great deal of discrimination on the grounds of sex as well as on other grounds in the Australian work force. It is clear that the legislation operating in some States, while providing some redress in certain cases, certainly does not provide complete redress for employees experiencing discrimination. Of course, the outstanding inadequacy in this whole area is that there is no federal anti-discrimination legislation which prevents employers from discriminating on the basis of sex. Hence the large number of complaints, particularly in the federal sphere, which are recorded in the report. The work of the Committee has been successful in drawing our attention to widespread discrimination in the public and private sectors on the grounds of sex. The machinery that the committees have available to them to pursue and to resolve these complaints is inadequate in many cases and it is ultimately inadequate in that there is no legislative basis. </PARA>
<PARA> During the next session of Parliament I will be seeking to take action with regard to federal anti-discrimination legislation. I will be speaking in much more detail at that time. I simply draw to the attention of honourable senators the inadequacy of the machinery we currently have for preventing discrimination in the federal sphere or for resolving complaints where they exist. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to speak very briefly to the report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, not in any depth I hasten to add as this report is a very lengthy and complex document which would have required much more than 20 hours to assess adequately even if we had not been occupied with other business in the meantime. However, since the matter was raised by way of question from Senator McIntosh to Senator Durack today I want to make a couple of comments about Senator Durack's answer. It is correct, as Senator Durack stated, that there have been substantial increases in real terms in general purpose payments or tax sharing payments to the States, whichever term one prefers. However, he did not mention that very large increases occurred in 1974-75 and that substantial increases in real terms since then have been pursuant to the 1975 Act. Effectively, they have been pursuant to the 1975 Act which provided for a betterment factor of 3 per cent after the States had already been compensated for population increases and increases in wage levels which, of course, are somewhat normally in excess of the consumer price index. In fact in recent years it has been that 3 per cent benefit factor which has put the flaw in Commonwealth payments to the States and which has ensured that in real terms, after adjustment for population changes as well as changes in wage levels, payments to the States under this section have continued to increase. </PARA>
<PARA> The position following the passage of the new legislation-I think it was last week-of course is quite different. The only guarantee which the States now have is that funds will not fall in money terms-not a guarantee that there will be no decline in funds in real terms, but that funds will not fall in money terms. In other words, that is a guarantee that the rate of real decline cannot be greater than the inflation rate or increases in the consumer price index. As far as guarantees are concerned-there could be ultimate results different from the guaranteed minimum-up until now the States have been guaranteed that after other appropriate adjustments have been made they will receive in real terms an increase of 3 per cent each year. The only guarantee they now have is that there will be no decline in real terms greater than the rate of inflation. It should be added that these payments present only one component of total Commonwealth payments to the States and therefore cannot really be viewed in isolation. It should also be noted that the Commission's report which has been tabled determines the relativities between the States and not the absolute amount which will be paid to the States which is set by independent decision of the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> All the recommendations in the report are about the carve-up of any given quantity between the States and the fact that in real terms the States will be squeezed for the first time in the next financial year and are likely to be squeezed thereafter. This will probably be the first decline in real terms that they have had in almost a decade. The controversy which inevitably exists between the States about what is and what is not a fair relativity will be intensified by the fact that in real terms the total payments will decline next year and are likely to continue to decline. The customary acrimony will be intensified by that overall squeeze which the Commonwealth is imposing on all the States. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one other comment: Some of the recommendations, on a superficial examination at least, are surprising, one of which is the disparity between the recommendations for the States of Western Australia and Queensland. I do not wish to comment upon the justice or otherwise of that because I really have not examined it in sufficient depth. But it is stated that a major consideration upon which the Commonwealth Grants Commission has based its assessment is the taxing effort made by a State. That may have some relevance to a comment made by the Western Australian Premier last week. An agreement between Alcoa of Australia (WA) Ltd and its employees to reduce working hours prompted from the Premier a threat to increase Alcoa's royalty payments. That begs the question that if Alcoa can afford higher royalty payments after granting reduced working hours it obviously could afford even higher royalty payments prior to granting reduced working hours. Implicit in the Premier's threat was an admission of previous negligence by him and his Government, that is, that Alcoa had the capacity to pay significantly higher royalty payments but the Western Australian Government, through its own negligence, declined to apply the taxing effort to which the Grants Commission refers and may have suffered accordingly in the recommendations made by the Commission. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The report of the Dix Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is very substantial. The Committee sat for almost 18 months and visited many parts of Australia in trying to assess community reponse to the Australian Broadcasting Commission and to prepare this report. The detailed nature of the inquiry can be shown by the fact that 11 volumes make up the report. One can only be impressed by the wide range of inputs to the Committee from consultants drawn from such wide areas as market research, financial management and engineering. The Committee even received a paper by Professor Inglis based on a study of ABC records and the history of the ABC. I think anything I say about the report at this stage should be qualified in view of the fact that it is a very substantial report. The size of the report makes it difficult to make a full and accurate assessment at this stage. It would, I suppose, be a classic case of fools rushing in if one attempted at this stage to pass judgment on any of the recommendations of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> This is, refreshingly, quite an eloquent document compared with many of the reports which come before this Parliament. The description of the history and current activities of the ABC is quite readable and that is a refreshing change from many reports which we receive here. When I say 'quite readable' I should say 'eloquent'. That is something for which the Committee is to be commended. The report seems to attack some of the main problems of the Australian Broadcasting Commission-management, finances and equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> In assessing the current situation of the ABC, the Committee identifies four factors in answer to the question: 'Has the Australian Broadcasting Commission's performance declined?' The Committee singles our four most important areas which point to decline. The first area is broadcasting to non-metropolitan audiences. It is suggested that the ABC provides inadequate services to country and outback people. The second area is broadcasting for the whole of the Australian community. In this case it is said the ABC has failed to reflect the realities of Australian society, particularly the needs of Aboriginals and non-Anglo Saxon Australians. Thirdly, the Committee comments on cultural bias in that the ABC over-emphasises some overseas programs, particularly British programs, on television at the expense of Australian produced programs. The fourth area is the failure of the ABC to decentralise effectively its resources in the States and regions and thus to reflect the interests, characteristics and concerns of the whole country. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think many commentators on the ABC would have serious difficulty in recognising that there are four major areas of defect with the ABC as it is presently structured. I particularly emphasise the question of cultural bias. Some three or four years ago the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, in its report on the self-regulation of broadcasting in Australia, made the comment that there was a need for Australian television particularly to have an Australian look. The ABC has got away with not having an Australian look by having a British look. The comments of the Broadcasting Tribunal were more directed to commercial broadcasting which, of course, has an American or mid-Pacific look. The ABC, on the other hand, has a British or mid-Sahara-or whatever the appropriate place is somewhere between Australia and Britain-look. That aspect of cultural bias is an important factor to which the Dix Committee draws attention. </PARA>
<PARA> The report attacks the main problems of management, finances and equipment. The Committee faced up to the difficult problems in seeking ways to overcome the shortcomings of senior management in the ABC. It has opted for a new structure. One might worry whether the new super-management body, the national broadcasting organisation, is the ideal solution and could simply superimpose a new bureaucracy on the old and much criticised one. Those sorts of worries and doubts no doubt still exist. But it seems to me that the new management structure seems much more capable of flexibility and accountability to the Commission's employees, the Government and the people of Australia, than the present management structure. </PARA>
<PARA> Any hopes for a progressive and innovative ABC will rest squarely on the talents of those chosen to fill the top positions in the national broadcasting organisation. It should not be assumed by this Parliament, one would hope, that the senior executive positions such as that of director-general would be filled only by those occupying positions in the ABC at the moment. Such positions should be widely advertised and should be capable of attracting the best possible talent, even in spite of the fact that the Committee properly recommends that the position of director-general should not be a lifetime position but should be a position which is readvertised and refilled every seven years. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to make some other points about the Committee's report. The Committee is very concerned with questions of financing a national broadcasting service, accountability of a national broadcasting service and of course the quality and content of a national broadcasting service. It says, for example, in dealing with the question of sponsorship, that it is desirable in their view, as a method of helping the ABC to finance its activities, that there should be corporate sponsorship of a number of ABC programs. Guidelines, of course, must be set for that sort of activity, as the Committee proposes before corporate sponsorship is introduced and there are very obvious dangers in corporate sponsorship of ABC programs unless those safeguards are very strict and very tightly observed. There are real dangers about corporate sponsorship of any program in the public affairs area, for example. There would be real dangers if there were sponsorship in the public affairs area and, indeed, some of the other areas of entertainment with which the ABC deals. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has recommended the merger of the news and public affairs departments of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. While the word 'merger' is perhaps unkind to the Committee in the sense that it recommends, as I think it puts it, a rationalisation of activities, I think there is need to sound a note of caution that any rationalisation or merger should not be at the expense of forthrightness and imagination in the presentation of public affairs coverage. The Australian Broadcasting Commission news is widely respected by the Australian people but, if anything, it is a little bland, and this blandness should not in any sense be imposed on a vigorous and critical public affairs program of any kind. I think that is something about which there should be some caution. </PARA>
<PARA> The next reservation which I suppose I have is that the Committee has suggested that Australian Associated Press should be the basic source of news for the Australian Broadcasting Commission which at present has its own news gathering service. That is a recommendation which I guess comes from a need to be very careful in terms of expenditure. I remind the Senate that at the current time all television news coming into Australia, with the exception of the news on Channel 9, is supplied by Visnews Ltd, an international news-gathering organisation. All overseas television material is supplied from that one source. We do not want in this country a situation whereby all media-print, radio and television-are relying on the one source for domestic news. I draw the attention of the Senate to paragraph 13 of the summary of the report where the Committee makes this point based on survey findings:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the ABC's value to the community is dominated by its importance as a provider of news and information. People who want to know about the world and want authoritative interpretation of major events turn to the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA>In a sense, on a preliminary perusal of what the Dix Committee has said, that comment about the authoritative nature of ABC news services lies slightly unhappily, in my view, with the suggestion that AAP should be the basic source of news. That is something which I think needs further examination and care in any implementation there may be of the decisions of the Dix Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point that the hiving off of orchestras could well be a very good thing for both the orchestras and the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I notice that Senator Davidson, the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts, is nodding his head. That Committee gave considerable attention to this question two or three years ago when I was a member of the Committee and Senator Davidson was its Chairman. We are glad that the Dix Committee has taken up the spirit at least of what we were trying to say in our report on that occasion. At present the orchestras are relatively minor parts of the ABC's activities. They probably suffer only marginally because of that, but the only concern must be for appropriate future funding for both the orchestras and the Australian Broadcasting Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of industrial relations, which the Committee says has plagued the ABC to some extent, the Commitee has given careful consideration to staff management problems. It has recommended the establishment of grievance appeals procedures and the encouragement of mobility within the Commission should help improve this situation of the staff morale and industrial relations. The Committee also recommended that the ABC basically be removed from the jurisdiction of the Public Service Board, other than in respect of top management. That is something which has been sought by the ABC for a long time and for very good industrial reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the recommendations regarding services provided by the ABC, it is sufficient to say that the Committee referred to the importance of a second radio network to serve country areas in Australia and recommended that this should have high priority. The Committee was, I thought, unnecessarily cool on the question of a second television channel for the ABC in not recommending it as a high priority at this stage. I concede that in terms of the financial requirements of the ABC it must come further down the line in the priorities of rationalising buildings and providing new equipment to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, bringing it into the second half of the twentieth century in terms of the technology and equipment which it has available to it. Those are matters of paramount priority. The question of a second television channel for the ABC should not be ignored. A second radio network is of a high priority and is something which we on this side of the chamber have been arguing for for a long period. More attention should be given to the needs of regional audiences. Any attempt to improve the ABC's services to country people must be welcomed. The report also canvassed issues such as broadcasting for women, children and teenagers, public broadcasting, ethnic broadcasting, triennial funding, Australian content and so on. It is too soon to say anything definite about the recommendations of the Committee on these matters.</PARA>
<PARA> This report should be commended to all members of this Parliament for very careful reading. As the Dix Committee itself says, the ABC has been a great national broadcasting organisation but presently it is somewhat run down. This document provides a great opportunity to restore the ABC to the paramount position, as I said earlier, of a great national broadcasting service-an innovative organisation, as it has been in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Townley says, it is also an opportunity to get rid of the Special Broadcasting Service. That is something which the Dix Committee approached with less caution than I would have. We have had a lot of discussion on broadcasting matters in this Parliament in the last few weeks. The Broadcasting and Television Act was amended in the Senate the other night for the benefit of a few friends of this Government and against the interests of the Australian public. That was the first major legislative effort of the new Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair). I said on that occasion that that legislative effort was a disaster for this country and will continue to be a disaster for this country. Honourable senators opposite will hear about it for months and years to come. It has turned upside down the whole system of accountability and responsibility for the commercial broadcasting sector which Liberal and Labor governments have supported for many years and the ownership and control provisions of commercial broadcasting which have always existed. That will have most unfortunate results for the commercial sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having failed there, the Minister for Communications has a great opportunity with the Dix report to redeem himself and to go down in history as a great Minister for Communications rather than with a footnote for what he did to the commercial sector of broadcasting at the instigation of great and powerful friends of the Liberal Party. This is a unique opportunity for Mr Sinclair. I hope that he and all Government senators will approach this eloquent, thoughtful, sane and sensible report in a very constructive and positive way. The ABC, on the basis of this report, can be properly restored to its rightful position as the pre-eminent and most imaginative broadcasting service in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Australian Democrats welcome the report of the Dix Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. It is certainly a much needed breath of fresh air through the corridors of power in the ABC. We agree with Senator Button that it is an enormous document which will take a long time to study in all its detail. I believe it is certainly not too soon to express the hope that the ABC will now look hard at itself and allow a situation in which effective decision-making, control and money will be channelled as directly as possible to the areas actually making programs and that there will be a healthy spirit of competition between production groups based on actual results. I believe that only in this way will the Australian people get full value for their dollars invested in the ABC. Staff cuts in the ABC in recent years have tended to exacerbate grotesquely a situation in which the ABC has had far too many chiefs and far too few indians. The Dix report has noted chronic problems of morale and efficiency that have stemmed from that situation. I suggest that its words ought to be taken with the greatest of seriousness and that corrective action should be taken as soon as possible. The British Rediffusion system of competitive program-making for sale to other outlets could be looked at with profit in this area. Prestige, a proper financial reward and a reasonable independence of action ought first and foremost to be the privileges of those who can make successful television and radio programs. That has not been the case in the past and is not the case at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To judge from the feedback I have been receiving of widespread unhappiness amongst ABC staff at the operating levels, such people ought also to have proper technical facilities for their work. Financial priorities should now be directed towards providing those facilities at a fairly basic level. I think any honourable senator who has had much contact with the ABC in recent months will have noted the broken down and antique tape recorders which frequently do not work. I was appalled to see that some of the equipment now in use was exactly the same as that used when I was a working broadcaster in the ABC 20 years ago. It is intolerable to expect professional people spending public money to go on using that broken down equipment. There has also been a tendency for people of ability to be used in two or three different directions so that a person getting a news story also has to do something for Newsvoice and perhaps something else as well. It is not possible for people to carry out their functions properly if that sort of tremendous demand on people at the operating level is continued. </PARA>
<PARA> In that respect Senator Button thought there should be reservations about a closer co-ordination of news and public affairs areas in the ABC which, of course, is recommended in the Dix report. It would be a tragic step at this stage of the ABC's development if there were a merging of news and public affairs because there would simply be further reductions in staff and the same people would be expected to serve all those programs, to the detriment of all concerned. I believe quite firmly that the ABC should have its own news staff. It is an independent news service-perhaps at times not as good as it may be-but it has the potential, as it has had in the past, to do outstanding work and it is an essential part of the balance of media in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The ABC's attitude to sport has received some attention in the report. Of course, it is a fact that the ABC, even in the sport area, is curiously blinkered by its predilection for the over-exposure of a sport of minority interest-that is, cricket-which has developed, I cannot quite see how, a completely unjustified position as a holy cow in this country. Many people find watching hours of cricket acutely boring. I think it is time the ABC became aware that there are many other sports. </PARA>

But please let them not be indulged to the detriment of those people interested in more active sports. Seriously, there is a need for greater balance in the ABC's sporting coverage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We welcome the recommendation that the ABC should not carry advertising and commend it most forcibly to the Government. One reason for that is the tedious way in which television and radio advertisements, especialy television advertisements, are repeated in this country. I say to those who advertise by a boring repetition of their messages that, if they hope their messages will have greater impact because of that process, as far as I am concerned the process is totally counterproductive. That kind of advertising on the ABC would be bad, but even more serious is the fact that the ABC would then be at risk of commercial sponsors influencing programs. I think it would be tragic if that situation were to happen in this country. I agree with Senator Button that that area should be regarded as particularly sensitive where news and public affairs are concerned. I do not believe they should have any sponsorship whatsoever, even the sort of corporate backing that has been suggested. I think corporate backing is a good thing for such things as opera and drama in respect of which there is obviously no question of the people concerned having an influence on the content, which is already determined. </PARA>

I would like to look at what the Dix report said about WASP-white Anglo-Saxon Protestant-culture. The ABC has notoriously shown itself to be limited to those old ideas of Australian culture and as not recognising that ours is a truly multicultural society. I do not think that it meets this need by coyly presenting from time to time national dancing and things of that sort. We must go much more deeply into the question of how we can use the ABC to present Australia as the multicultural society that it now is. As an ex-program man in the ABC, I would say that there is only one answer-that people of racial origins other than English should be allowed to have their head as program producers. The ABC should bring in Italians, Yugoslavs and people of other nationalities and see what they can come up with in the way of programs that will present those aspects of Australian society. I suggest that that is the way in which we can make progress in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Finally, the Australian Democrats appeal to the Government to allow this process of reform and smartening up of the ABC to proceed along the lines proposed, as far as we have yet been able to see them. I have not yet had an opportunity to read the report fully and at this stage would by no means like to endorse everything that is in it, but its general trend-as we have examined it in the last 24 hours-in presenting guidelines is in the right direction. We would ask that the Government please proceed in this matter with a total absence of that political tinkering which, though no doubt tempting to it, will not be of any assistance whatever in this case. Any tampering with the independence of the ABC, or even any attempt or apparent attempt to tamper with it, diminishes a government and those members of it who suggest that that be done. I seek leave to continue my remarks. </PARA>

<PARA> It is worth noting that Senator Walters had no criticism of the information given in the program, which she found to be 'usually accurate'. </PARA>
<PARA>That description is a little too broad in view of what I actually said. I emphasised to the Commission that the general information was very biased. The report quotes me as saying that the program lacked professionalism, evidenced by bias, contained prejudicial statements against males and failed to balance these with equally critical statements about females; had a marked tendency to generalise from the particular, and created an overall tone of depression and complaint and conveyed the idea that this is the norm in society. That was the message that I was giving. To say that I had no criticism of the information given in the program could not be regarded as entirely accurate. What I said was that in the couple of programs that I had heard regarding women's health, the actual description of women's health was usually accurate. I believe that the program has a preoccupation with women's health and sexual matters. In fact, women never seem to have any other illness than that pertaining particularly to women's problems.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I indicate that the Opposition supports indicative planning as an important arm in the whole process of properly managing the Australian economy. The report by the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry is not only an important document in respect of that industry but also challenges the basic philosophical position of this Government which relies completely upon market forces to determine the whole process of our economy. In fact, this report is an indictment of that policy as it relates to housing needs and the housing industry in our country. </PARA>
<PARA> The report shows, of course, that the housing industry, as presently acting under the constraints imposed by the Fraser Government, is capable of building about 144,000 dwellings a year over the coming triennium and estimates that industry capacity at the national level will remain fairly flat. The report suggests that we would require, on the basis of current projections 174,000 homes to be built in the period 1984-1991, 166,000 homes to be built in the period 1991-96 and 158,400 homes to be built in the period 1996 to 2001 just to keep abreast of the natural increase in population and the increase arising from the Government's migration policies. It is untenable that the housing industry should be placed in the position where market forces are its only regulator when we take into account the established resource development policy of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> As the report indicates, Australia's resources boom will be good news for the housing industry but bad news for home buyers. If we are concerned about home buyers we have to recognise that there is a considerable problem in home buying today not only in relation to the cost of borrowing funds because of high interest rates but also because there is an acute shortage of housing. By not building sufficient homes to meet current needs that shortage will be even more pronounced than it is today. </PARA>
<PARA> Such is the case that has been made by the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry that the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) has warned of the expected rise in rentals. He is reported as saying that this would cause 'severe personal hardship' for low income earners, a trend that is already emerging. Of course, this is exactly what the Opposition has been saying. This is exactly and precisely what the Australian Labor Party spokesman on housing and urban affairs, Mr Uren, has been saying continuously in the House of Representatives and in other places. Indeed, spokesmen for the housing industry have been drawing the attention of the Australian people and the Government to what is happening in the building industry in this country. More and more people are being forced into a position in which they are just not able to become part of the home ownership sector of our country because of the limitation on funds and the high rates of interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The report bears this out. It points to the fact that in the development of resource-type industries in various regions in Australia the cost of buying or renting a house will rise significantly in the next five years. Of course, that means even greater hardship being imposed upon greater numbers of people. One would have thought, therefore, that this Government would have adopted a much stricter position and policy on resource development and would have been attempting to have that development take place in a planned way so that the provision of the infrastructure, which is the responsibility of State and local governments, and private and public housing, in fact, would run parallel with the development. That would, therefore, not put citizens, workers and those involved in the resource industry in an invidious and disadantaged position. An article, referring to the report, states:</PARA>
<PARA> The resource boom would be likely to affect housing demand, costs, the availability and cost of housing finance, and finance for developers. </PARA>
<PARA>One other aspect we have to consider-the report deals with this in some detail-is the rising cost of land in our major cities. What the report does not refer to, of course, is that the rate of the increase in the cost of land and housing is rising at about, in average figures, twice the rate of inflation. So there is no point in talking about the inflation rate being kept at about double figures when, in fact, the rate of inflation in respect of land and housing is double the inflation rate. That is the single biggest cost item for a family unit. Greater numbers of people are finding it impossible to come within the ambit of being able to provide for their own housing needs and that is therefore driving more and more people into the area of public housing. Yet this Government, as Mr Uren has pointed out, has in fact reduced the amount of funds available to the States for public housing to such an alarming degree that the waiting lists of the housing authorities in the various States are getting longer and the lack of housing is becoming a national scandal. </PARA>
<PARA> The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> In most parts of Australia new land coming onto the market in the next five years was likely to be much more expensive than it had been in the past five. </PARA>
<PARA>That is understandable, having regard to the inadequate and improper policies being pursued by the Fraser Administration. It reduced to a minimum, and finally abolished, the very important initiatives that were taken by the Whitlam Government, particularly by the former Department of Urban and Regional Development and its Minister, Mr Uren. We established land commissions in the States, the purpose of which was to buy land in large tracts in order to stop private speculation which was a feature of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s until the Whitlam Government came to office. They enabled the State governments to be part of the process of reducing land costs and maintaining them at a level commensurate with the capacity of the Australian working people to purchase land. </PARA>
<PARA> That was a very important innovative step to be taken by a national government because it meant that for the first time in Australia's history the Commonwealth, in co-operation with the States, had established the processes and procedures by which the States would be able to become active competitors in the area of providing funds and subsequently serviced land so that the public sector could compete against the rapid exploitation of land values which arose because of the activities of large scale development corporations which were very considerably exploiting the land hungry markets in the capital cities. That was particularly evident in Sydney and Melbourne. The report is correct when it says that the existing housing stock is adequate to accommodate population growth. That applies not only in the resources areas but also in our major cities. </PARA>
<PARA> This report comes out each year and gives some sort of an indication to the government of the day about what policies it ought to pursue if it is concerned about the housing needs of our population. But, as the Fraser Government does with so many other reports, it will receive the report, comment on it and then will fail to act on or take into account the important advice that is encompassed in it. That will mean that the Australian people who are interested in home ownership, who are interested in the continual increase in the cost of rented accommodation and who want to have access to accommodation will be denied yet again an opportunity to become properly and adequately accommodated in respect of their housing needs. </PARA>
<PARA> One could say a great deal more because this is a very important report. It ought to be considered by Government back benchers. It is important because it emphasises and endorses the basic position taken by the Australian Labor Party in respect of its housing policies. Of course, we have no confidence that this Government will do more than receive the report, make a few pious statements and then file it away. We hope that at a subsequent time we will have an opportunity to debate this matter further. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>Some ministerial statements that are presented in this place from time to time are obtuse, stubborn, pigheaded, the product of closed-circuit thinking by narrow minds. Some show appalling ignorance. Some show just plain dishonesty in the way in which they state their findings or their recommendations. This statement by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) on the subject of insurance brokers, rejecting as it does the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission on the desirability of national legislation in this area, distinguishes itself by possessing clear elements of every one of the characteristics I have mentioned. Above all, it represents a triumph of ideology over common sense. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened is that the Government has rejected out of hand the 1980 report of the Australian Law Reform Commission which recommended the introduction of national legislation, in the national interest, the community interest and the interests of consumers who have been so savagely disadvantaged by the misbehaviour and collapse of so many broking houses in recent years, to regulate insurance agents and brokers. The kinds of recommendations brought forward by the Law Reform Commission which have now been rejected would have resulted in legislation which, among other things, would do the following: Provide for a statutory system of registration of insurance brokers to be supervised by the Insurance Commission and the Life Insurance Commissioner respectively; place an obligation on registered brokers to keep all premium moneys and moneys received from insurers in a separate trust account, the investment of which would be closely controlled; and provide for heavy penalties for misleading conduct by brokers and agents and for greater protection in a variety of ways for consumers by making insurers statutorily liable for the actions of their agents and responsible for the premiums received by brokers. </PARA>
<PARA> I have referred elsewhere at some length to the Law Reform Commission report and its recommendations on the kind of legislation which is needed in this respect, in particular on 28 May when introducing as a private member's Bill the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Bill 1981. As a result I do not propose now to repeat everything that could be said on this topic, particularly also since the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) stated the Opposition's position very effectively in the House of Representatives yesterday. Nonetheless, a number of points must be made to demonstrate what a shoddy short-sighted exercise this is. What we have here is a rejection of all the Commission's recommendations to establish a national system of regulation with only one passing exception, and that is in respect of extended credit by insurers to brokers which it is proposed should be the subject of further consideration by the Commonwealth with a view to some possible minor amendments to the existing Commonwealth legislation to control some of the excesses that have been prevailing in that area. Apart from that one exception, what we have is a complete straightforward rejection of the Law Reform Commission's recommendations-a rejection which is premised on a number of very unhappy assumptions and misleading statements about what this exercise is all about. Let me mention just a few of those. </PARA>
<PARA> The first question on which the Treasurer premises his statement is the question of the need for this kind of legislation. Mr Howard says in his statement that he and the Government are simply not satisfied that there is a need, that a case has been made out by the Law Reform Commission. He says that only $7.25m-I emphasise the word 'only'-was known to the Law Reform Commission to have been lost in the 10 years preceding the presentation of its report in 1980. What a misleading-to put it at its mildest-statement that is. One way of responding to that is simply to say that certainly that amount of money was thought to be enough by the Law Reform Commission itself both in absolute terms and comparative terms to persuade it that regulation was necessary and to do so on the basis of a very long extensive consultative process to which I will come back in a moment. Perhaps even more importantly and pertinently, since the Law Reform Commission completed its report there has been a spectacular escalation in the problems in the insurance broking industry, so much so that in the last two years there has been a whole series of collapses of broking houses which have resulted in another $7m worth of losses being experienced. The Law Reform Commission itemised 27 insurance broker insolvencies in New South Wales and Victoria alone between 1969 and 1979 with estimated losses, as the Treasurer acknowledged, of $7,250,000. The Commission was, however, unable to obtain detailed information in relation to 17 other cases of alleged insolvency during that period, so the figure for estimated losses is probably an underestimate. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, within the last two years, 1980 and 1981, the additional losses have been put at around $7m, producing a total of $14m plus. That is probably an underestimate of losses over the 12-year period from 1969 to 1981. The Government and certainly some honourable senators opposite perhaps need some examples to remind them of the magnitude of the problem in this area. Perhaps they will remember how in January 1979 Cyril Stanley Pty Ltd collapsed with debts of $1.9m and an estimated deficiency of $619,000. In May 1979 the Hamilton Group of Companies became insolvent with an estimated $400,000 owed to unsecured creditors. In 1980 six Western Australian broking companies collapsed, as Senator Martyr will no doubt recall, with outstanding debts totalling well over $3m. Those companies were Douglas Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd, John D. Seale &amp; Co Pty Ltd, Ibis Holdings Pty Ltd, Morley Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd, Dyson Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd and Town and Country Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd. Over the last 18 months the total number of broking collapses in Western Australia has risen to at least twelve. As recently as March this year Beneficial Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd of Perth went into receivership with an estimated premium shortfall of $1m. </PARA>
<PARA> In New South Wales 14 insurance brokers have stopped trading in the last 18 months. Of those perhaps the most notorious is the One Stop Insurance Shop broking group. The New South Wales part of this operation went into liquidation in March this year with debts of $1m. The same amount was owed when the One Stop Insurance Shop Pty Ltd in Victoria went into provisional liquidation. The Queensland affairs of that company are also in the hands of the liquidator. Some 34,000 policy holders around the country were put at risk by the collapse of the One Stop operation and the Australian Premium Financing Co. Pty Ltd which had financed those operations. In March this year two further Victorian brokers folded up. Anthony H. Bown Insurance Pty Ltd went into liquidation with debts of over $320,000. Perhaps the worst case of all to finish up with is Kinloch (Insurances) Pty Ltd which was placed in the hands of the liquidator in March this year with estimated debts of $3m after a premium turnover estimated at about $6m annually. </PARA>
<PARA> That recitation, although perhaps tedious to some members of this chamber, demonstrates beyond any possibility of doubt that there is a phenomenal problem at work at large in the community which is simply not acknowledged in the terms of Treasurer Howard's statement. To refer, as he did, solely to the situation which prevailed in the ten years prior to 1979 can be described only as an exercise in deliberately misleading the Parliament and the community as to the magnitude of the insurance broking problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point that needs to be made about this matter is the dismissal of the credibility of the Law Reform Commission involved in Treasurer Howard's statement. This occurred in the second guessing of it in the first place by seeking views from everyone around the place who might conceivably be likely to be affected by it and the failure to come to grips in any serious systematic way with the arguments that run throughout its detailed report which totals 142 pages. The Government also failed to take into account the qualifications of the Commissioners, chaired in this instance by Professor David Kelly from Adelaide. The panel of people who worked on this project consisted of Professor Castles, Mr Debelle, Mr Jack Ewens-the former Parliamentary Counsel-and two highly regarded and respected silks; Brian Shaw from Victoria and Murray Wilcox from the Sydney bar. The Commissioners were backed up by a team of 40 consultants, all of whose names are listed publicly in the report, who individually and collectively have the highest reputation and credibility in this country and indeed in the insurance industry and with everyone who is concerned with the regulation of that industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of the compilation of the Law Reform Commission's report the Commission considered 235 written submissions. It also listened to approximately 79 oral submissions made at a series of hearings that were held in late 1978 in Sydney, Perth, Adelaide, Hobart, Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane and Darwin. In each case those hearings were accompanied by the holding of seminars organised in association with the Australian Insurance Institute. So a phenomenally detailed and complex process of consultation has been carried out by the Law Reform Commission. It is not just a matter of three or four wise men sitting down in a back room somewhere and generating, off the top of their heads, some proposals which may or may not bear some resemblance to the needs of the real world. On the contrary, as with every report that the Law Reform Commission produces, it is a systematic exposition of the problem, an identification of the various options that are available for its solution and a highly articulate and sensitive argument for the conclusions that are finally brought down. </PARA>
<PARA> For this report to be simply rejected out of hand in the way that it has been by the Treasurer and the Government reflects no credit whatsoever on anyone who has been concerned with it. In the statement made by the Treasurer-again there is an element which can only be described as dishonesty in the way in which it was brought down-he sought to convey an impression, throughout the whole statement, that there is major disagreement within the industry, both as to whether there should be legislation at all and as to what kind of legislation there ought to be if any legislation is to operate in this area. But the reality is, as the Treasurer and the Government must know, that the broad thrust of the Law Reform Commission's recommendations has been accepted by everyone in the industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a whitewash job in any way, shape or form. The broad thrust of its recommendations has been understood and appreciated. Of course there are nuances and differences of opinion by the respective interest groups that all have their own axes to grind and barrels to push. That is so with every complex social, economic or business regulation problem that anyone ever has to deal with. But the point is that all these things were put into the pot and understood by the Law Reform Commission and the proposals that were generated by it have subsequently had an enormous measure of acceptance within the industry; by insurers, by the more reputable individual brokers, by the brokers organisations, councils and associations and-I will come to this in a moment-by the State governments which have been in the first line with demands by the community and by people who have suffered as a result of these collapses for something legislatively to be done about them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is not the same passion for deregulation and self-regulation as the Government seems to assume exists in every corner, every nook and cranny, of the private sector. That kind of reaction within the insurance industry just does not exist. Mr Nick Renton, the Executive Director of the Life Insurance Federation of Australia-LIFA-commented in the immediate aftermath of the razor gang report which report recommended a significant winding back in the operations of the Life Insurance Commission and the Insurance Commissioner. Everyone associated with the industry knows that so far as self-regulation is concerned the industry has been there, done that and it has not worked. There just have to be more systematic controls in this whole area. We cannot apply ideological prescriptions to these sorts of problems. We cannot make the assumption that regulation is bad, deregulation is good. We cannot do that across the board. We must look at each individual industry situation and judge what kind of regulation is necessary and, will be effective in cases of particularly clearly demonstrated need. </PARA>
<PARA> This leads me finally to the question of the attitude of the States to this problem of insurance regulation. This again is an area in which this statement by the Treasurer is so misleading and so full of half truths in the statements it does not make about the reactions of the States to this whole problem as to amount to what can only be described as an exercise in dishonesty. There is a situation in the States that, in the aftermath of the Law Reform Commission's report being tabled last year, there was a meeting in November 1980 of the consumer affairs Ministers of all States. They made an urgent call to the Federal Government to implement on a national legislative basis the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission. That is not where the matter has stopped. </PARA>
<PARA> The States have been complaining continually for years about the inability of the Government to move in this respect. Those complaints have been escalating in number very rapidly. They have spread right across the political spectrum. It has not been a matter of Labor State governments complaining about Federal Liberal governments. On the contrary, it has been an across the board matter. In Western Australia, there has been a situation where the impatience about government inaction at the Federal level has become so acute that it has recently introduced its own legislation, the General Insurance Brokers and Agents Bill 1981. The New South Wales Government gave notice as recently as 21 May that it was preparing legislation which it would introduce unless the Federal Government took decisive action. In March, Syd Einfeld, the New South Wales Minister for Consumer Affairs, said that he completely supported the principles inherent in the report of the Law Reform Commission. The Commissioner for Consumer Affairs in that State, Mr Gallagher, repeated in mid-May that the Federal Government's failure to take action would inevitably compel the New South Wales Government to move in this direction. In Victoria, again in mid-May, just a few weeks ago, the Victorian Minister for Consumer Affairs, Mr Ramsay, added his voice from the second most populous State in the nation to the call for national legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> So this is what is being rejected in the interests of some spurious, free enterprise, Friedmanite, razor gang ideology combined with some passion for reverting back to the States functions which could be exercised by them. What will happen? We will not have a situation of self-regulation in the industry because the industry knows that it cannot cope with that and everyone else knows that that will not be good enough. We will need to have legislative controls. Those legislative controls, as has been foreshadowed by all the relevant State governments concerned, will have to come from the States. So we will have State legislation. When we have State legislation in this area, as in so many other areas-we have seen it in the past-we have immediately the spectre of non-uniformity, the problem of different standards and different rules about registration applying nationally from State to State to control what is essentially and overwhelmingly a national industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The uniformity problem is something that time does not permit me to go on about in the length that it needs perhaps to be gone on about to emphasise our concern about it. It is always a headache for federal systems of government to create uniformity in regulatory law. We have had that argument over and over again in the context of companies and securities law. We are edging our way gradually forward to solutions. This Senate's Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs dealt, at some length, with the whole problem of uniform law reform in its 1979 report on reforming the law. I refer honourable senators to chapter 4 of that report if they want some further responses to it. </PARA>
<PARA> If the States are to go ahead, as they obviously will, to legislate in their own area that will create an enormous number of headaches for the future. In this respect Mr Howard, in his statement, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government stands ready to assist wherever it may be able in achieving uniformity between the States in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>What a horse laugh that sort of statement is when we consider the track record of this Commonwealth Government in its own enactment of national legislation and in its exercises in co-operative federalism. We cannot expect the sort of movement that we need here. The reality is that there has to be a single national legislation. There is no argument about the constitutional powers and the constitutional responsibility of the Commonwealth to legislate nationally in this way to the extent that section 51 (xiv) of the Constitution gives the Commonwealth Parliament explicit power to make law in respect of insurance other than State insurance. This power covers all private insurance except insurance offered by State instrumentalities within the boundary of the home State. There can be no doubt about the nature and extent of the Commonwealth's responsibility in this area. Equally, there can be no doubt about the abdication of that responsibility in this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Bill which I introduced into this chamber as a private member's Bill on 28 May will establish a single national statutory system of broker registration and financial and other controls to protect the public, being based, as it is, squarely on the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission. That Bill will, I can promise the Government now, be debated in the Budget session. It does have the support of the Australian Democrats. It is a Bill and this is an issue about which the Government and this Parliament will hear a good deal more. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Chairman of the Standing Committee on Science and the Environment I would like to make some comments on the Government's response to the Committee's report on industrial research and development in Australia because the Committee was very anxious that the Government should pick up a number of our recommendations. It is pleasing to note that the Government's response, and also the response to reports from bodies such as the Australian Science and Technology Council and the Myers Committee, have served to satisfy most of the recommendations of our Committee. It should be noted that the Committee's inquiry from May 1977 to June 1979 formed part of a widespread growing consciousness that all was not well in Australia in the relationship between academics, industry and government, and that policies were needed aimed at achieving a better balance between research, development, management and the market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In recommendations 1 and 2, the Committee recommended that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) give urgent attention to the expression of a clear national policy for science and technology and direct ASTEC to consider the feasibility of establishing a long term national plan for the development and application of science and technology for the national good. The Committee is particularly pleased to note that the Government, through ASTEC and the Department of Science and Technology, is moving towards the development of these objectives. However, much more needs to be done and with the increasing rate of technological change in Australia it needs to be done very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has rejected recommendations 10 and 11, suggesting that commencement grants and industrial research and development incentive grants be free of tax. However, the Government has stated that if additional incentives are required they should be by way of increased expenditure on the Industrial Research and Development Scheme rather than by taxation incentives. The Committee's recommendation that a comprehensive survey be undertaken of management attitudes to research and development has been rejected on the grounds that it would add to the 'paper burden' on the private sector. Whilst agreeing in general terms with this objective I hope that the promised review of the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act will examine this matter extremely thoroughly. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the decision to reduce the scientific liaison posts in London and Washington, on behalf of the Committee I have already written to the Prime Minister requesting the reversal of this decision. It seems to me to be a retrograde step at a time when Australia is facing problems associated with technological and scientific change that important posts such as London and Washington should not be serviced by a scientific representative from Australia who would be able to keep in touch and communicate with the people involved in technological change in those important developed countries. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another issue on which I must comment. The Committee's report was tabled in the Senate on 6 June 1979, just over two years ago. Chairmen of other Senate committees have previously referred to delays in responding to Committee reports. I just want to emphasise my concern that the Ministers have not responded to reports as quickly as they should have. Commendably, the Prime Minister instructed his Ministers to respond to parliamentary committee reports within six months. It should be the aim of all Ministers to achieve that objective. Sometimes-and I think it is reasonable that chairmen of committees recognise this-it is not always possible for Ministers to respond to recommendations within six months. However, I think it is fair to suggest that the Ministers concerned should be in a position to inform the committee chairmen of the reasons why they cannot respond within the time that has been set down by the Prime Minister. I hope that the Prime Minister and the Ministers will ensure that what I have said will be taken note of in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-In tabling this report, I wish briefly to draw to the Senate's attention a number of positive features of the Committee's operations since its last report in September 1980. I have already made statements to the Senate earlier this year on ministerial undertakings relating to the Australian Capital Territory Nature Conservation Ordinance and the Traffic (Amendment) Ordinance, and have outlined the Committee's views on the Health Commission (Amendment) Ordinance. I now wish to mention other actions by Ministers, following consultations with the Committee, which might otherwise escape general attention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has announced that the Government proposes to introduce amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act to accord with various recommendations made by the Committee. Three Ministers have agreed to present certain delegated legislation to the Committee in draft form. Two Ministers, the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) and the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson), have been admirably prompt in ensuring that undertakings made to the Committee have been given legislative effect while other Ministers have agreed to insert review provisions in instruments which have attracted the Committee's attention. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, one area continues to be of concern to the Committee. Four examples of financial retrospectivity provisions of more than two years' duration are identified in the report. The Committee considered recommending disallowance, but this would have caused hardship to individuals affected by the provisions. The Committee has concluded that only by public censure of undue delays in production of delegated legislation is the incidence likely to diminish, and therefore it will continue to report to the Senate on any further examples of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, on behalf of all the members of the Committee, I wish to endorse publicly the tribute paid in the report to the Deputy Chairman, Senator Cavanagh, who will retire from the Senate on 30 June 1981. The Committee will miss his wisdom, common sense and experience, but extends to him its good wishes for a happy and well-earned retirement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I thank Senator Lewis, Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, for expressing appreciation for my services on the Committee. It may well be that that appreciation has been over-emphasised. Perhaps it has been more a reflection of the view of the author of the speech than a direct result of anything I did on the Committee. I have enjoyed my work on the Committee. It was only when I read the report that I realised I had been on the Committee for so long. This Committee has become important to me over the years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Legal opinion we receive on the effect of ordinances is frightening. As was stated at the Conference of Delegated Legislation Committees which was held last year, regulations and ordinances are not subordinate legislation but laws of the land which are as effective as any law passed by the Parliament. One man, a Minister, may make a law affecting the whole population or part of the population of Australia and this law can be enforced without being considered by the Parliament. Law-abiding citizens could become criminals overnight because of the actions of a Minister or a department. That is the frightening thing about ordinances and regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> We witnessed what happened when the Australian Capital Territory Traffic Ordinance was amended recently. Sixty-three women who engaged in an otherwise lawful assembly and demonstration were arrested as a result of action taken by the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) two days before. He amended the Traffic Ordinance prohibiting what the women intended to do. The new Ordinance may or may not have been justified, but as yet Parliament has not had an opportunity to consider whether it was justified. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Attorney-General's Department is proposing alterations to the Acts Interpretation Act to get over some of the problems, there is no way of getting over the problem of power being put into the hands of one man. Whilst normally the system operates all right, from time to time the quality of Ministers changes. We may have an occasion when perhaps a tyrannical Minister takes action that has a detrimental effect. We must consider making provision for a continuing committee to look at ordinances before they become effective. If such a committee thought people could suffer harm from a proposed ordinance, implementation of the ordinance could be delayed until Parliament had time to discuss it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lewis also mentioned financial retrospectivity provisions. Although there may be justification for a payment, a Minister should not commit Parliament or the Treasury to a payment for something that happened two years previously. The Parliament should have considered the matter at the time, and dealt with it by either ordinance or Act of Parliament. In the situation we are considering an ordinance may approve a payment with which neither the Committee nor the Parliament agrees. That ordinance may be rejected by the Parliament but the payment may have been made between the time of the making of the ordinance and its rejection by the Parliament. Therefore, a payment with which the Parliament might not agree would be legally paid by the Treasury. These are things that need consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to take up the time of the Senate unduly. However, I express again my appreciation for the words spoken about me. I have done only what every other member of the Committee has done. At all times I have done my best. No man can do any more, and no one should do any less. That is the policy that I have carried out. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>This report is entitled 'A Review of the Report on the Impact of Television on the Development and Learning Behaviour of Children'. No doubt the Senate will recall the report on the subject which I tabled in the Senate on 23 November 1978. At the time of tabling that report I gave the following undertaking on behalf of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts:</PARA>
<PARA> Because of the great amount of interest in this inquiry and the likely continued public interest, I inform the Senate that we will be looking at the subject of children's television again in about eighteen months. </PARA>
<PARA>A number of factors, which included an assignment from the Senate on the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill, the necessity to complete an earlier inquiry on education in the work force and, of course, the intervention of the general election, have considerably extended that 18-month period. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee resumed this review in March of this year. The Committee communicated with a number of witnesses, authorities, representives and organisations and invited them to make submissions that would be of assistance in this review. Additionally, a number of public hearings were arranged. The Committee interviewed 22 witnesses over four days. Included in the group of witnesses was the Minister for Education in New South Wales, the Honourable Paul Landa, MLC; and the Minister for the Arts and Minister of Educational Services in Victoria, the Honourable Norman Lacy, MP. The Committee was appreciative of the interest shown by these two State Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> The review observed, firstly, that there has been significant progress in getting better children's programs to air on both commercial and Australian Broadcasting Commission television stations. In the case of commercial television stations these improvements are due largely to the efforts of the Children's Program Committee of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal with co-operation from commercial television management. However, we find that much still needs to be done, particularly in the area of children's drama. To this end we have supported the establishment of an Australian Children's Television Foundation which will act as a means of stimulating production of high quality children's programs and encourage the purchase of these programs by television stations. It is envisaged that the Foundation will be jointly funded by the State and Commonwealth governments. Victoria and New South Wales have already committed funds to the project and other States have indicated their support. We have strongly recommended Commonwealth participation and financial support for this worthy project. However, our review emphasises that if the Australian Children's Television Foundation is to succeed it will need Commonwealth support not only from a financial viewpoint but also in terms of maintaining an effective regulating authority to ensure that good programs for children go to air. In the latter context the review expresses its opposition to any reduction in the powers of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to regulate positively, particularly in the area of children's television. </PARA>
<PARA> The review also expresses disappointment at the progress made in research into the effects of television on children. In our review we have urged greater attention to this important area of social science. The report also expresses disappointment that the Government has decided not to proceed with the establishment of the Broadcasting Information Office, which we believe would have played a key role in media research. We also are concerned about the demise of the Broadcasting Information Office for other reasons. Without such an organisation to collect and disseminate information on all aspects of broadcasting we are unlikely to have informed public debate on broadcasting in this country. Therefore, we ask the Government to reconsider the decision in relation to the Broadcasting Information Office. </PARA>
<PARA> An important part of our review relates to advertising. The National Health and Medical Research Council, acting on one of the key recommendations of our original report, has found that much of the food advertising directed to children promotes unbalanced dietary habits which can give rise to long term national health risks. We have recommended in our review that the effects of such advertising be offset by the active involvement of the National Health and Medical Research Council in advertising which promotes more balanced dietary habits. </PARA>
<PARA> I have briefly mentioned some of the more important aspects of our review. There are other important aspects, and in relation to these I will let the review speak for itself. We emphasise that this document is but a review and its principal purpose is to alert the Senate and the community to the need for ongoing vigilance and awareness in relation to the effects television is having on our society and, in particular, on our children. Furthermore, I emphasise that this review needs to be read in conjunction with the original report of November 1978. I again mention that throughout the review we have expressed our concern about any proposed amendment legislation that would weaken in any way the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's powers to regulate effectively, particularly in the area of children's television. </PARA>
<PARA> This Committee has now completed all the work which was referred to it. The overriding and continuing reference relating to all aspects of broadcasting still remains, and I have no doubt that the new Committee will retain this broad heading to initiate further inquiries into this area of public interest. So it is that I table this, my last report. Our program is complete and there are no outstanding references. The new Committee will start its operations with a clean sheet and will commence a brand new program. I place on record my sincere thanks to all members of the Education and Arts Committee who have served since 1975. Their work and contribution as well as their personal co-operation is greatly appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I refer by way of tribute to Mr John Lipscombe, the Secretary of our Committee, who is shortly to retire. Along with Mr Kathage and Miss Moyes, Mr Lipscombe has rendered sterling service to the Committee. John Lipscombe has been attached to our Committee since 1975, having first entered the Department of the Senate in 1972. The reports we have put down owe much to John Lipscombe's special skill in analysing the evidence, his special ability in understanding the witnesses, and his capacity to relate to the responses of senators on the Committee. He is to retire from service shortly, and the Senate will lose the services of an efficient and perceptive officer. John Lipscombe has been a good friend to the Committee and to me. He and his wife have been very interested in us and very kind to us. We thank him and we place on record this tribute to him and wish him well in the future. </PARA>

On a personal note, I extend my best wishes to the new Committee and renew my thanks to the Senate for the privilege of serving it in this way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most of what I am about to say will be covered in the valedictories tomorrow when we are speaking of the work of Senator Davidson. However, I think it would be unfortunate if we allowed this final report of Senator Davidson's to go without some tribute from us to his leadership of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts. I can speak only of the time since 1975. Senator Davidson has indicated that he spent some nine years as Chairman of the Committee. Certainly we on this side of the chamber would like to indicate our appreciation not only of the leadership he has given to the Committee people but also of the way he has been able to meet with people outside the Senate chamber in our public hearings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is obvious to all of us who work on committees and find them a very valuable part of the work we do in the Senate that if we have a good front man, if I may use that phrase, to handle the public inquiries, it makes a lot of difference to the sort of information that comes across. Gordon, by his natural charm and his knowledge of the people who have come before us-I say that carefully because he has a wide range of contacts in the industries we have looked at in the five or six years I have been involved-has been able to maintain a good atmosphere in our public hearings. This has meant, of course, that we have had good contributions from the people who have come before us. Let me say again that it is not only that aspect but also the leadership he has given the Committee which is important. We have appreciated his bipartisan approach. By his care, his understanding, and his own personality he has been able to smooth over some of the wrinkles that must come out when six people sit around a table. He has been able to reach a consensus view on some pretty contentious issues, and we have appreciated him for it. We will miss him. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me also join him in paying a particular tribute to Mr John Lipscombe, who is leaving the Committee. He has been with the Committee ever since I have been a member of it, and I think it is fair to say that everyone here would appreciate that it is the secretariat that does the really hard work. It is the members of the secretariat who set the evidence before us by getting the submissions and arranging the public hearings. It is they who finally collate the information and present it in the form of a draft for us to look at. Certainly, Mr Lipscombe and his people have been outstanding in that regard. I pay a personal tribute, because he is leaving, to the friendly way in which he has carried out his duties and the very efficient manner in which he has worked with us all and tried to meet our individual idiosyncracies. I make those comments, making the point that further things will be said tomorrow about Senator Davidson. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment, in tabling its report 'Australian Marine Science', draws together evidence from many sectors of the community and presents the Senate with a blueprint for developing and co-ordinating marine science in this country. The Senate will recall that the Committee's progress report on Australian Marine Science, tabled on 22 May 1980, identified certain areas which the Committee believed warranted immediate attention, particularly research vessels and marine science information. The terms of reference of the Committee's inquiry gave particular emphasis to the development of a marine science program for Australia and the co-ordination of research efforts between the various agencies involved in marine science. Witnesses to the inquiry posed several models for co-ordinating marine science. From this evidence the Committee has considered the requirements of marine scientists and their suggested solutions. The Committee also paid regard to the recommendations of the Interim Council of the Australian Institute of Marine Science. The Interim Council proposed roles and functions for an Australian Marine Science Council to co-ordinate the research effort. The Committee was told repeatedly of how the present organisational structure of marine science serves only to fragment the research effort rather than consolidate it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee drew up a blueprint for the structure, functions and membership of an Australian marine science council. This council would operate as the national adviser on marine science matters especially in policy development, co-ordinate marine science research efforts, liaise with similar bodies overseas, and finance marine science research projects. The Committee recommends that the Australian Marine Science Council co-ordinate research efforts through regional and marine sciences committees and an advisory committee. The council, through its Executive and Secretariat, would be responsible for operating an information services unit and a ship operations unit. The Committee also recommends that the Australian Institute of Marine Science and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's divisions of fisheries research and oceanography become research institutes to be managed by the Council. The Commitee believes that marine science could best be served by CSIRO vacating this explicit field of research while the divisions of fisheries research and oceanography could more efficiently consolidate their work in a research institute. The regional and marine science committees would be responsible for co-ordinating research activities within each region and field of marine science respectively. They would assist in reducing unnecessary duplication of research while at the same time encouraging co-operation and liaison between researchers. Mr President, in the interests of time, I seek leave to incorporate the rest of this statement in Hansard. I have already spoken to Senator Robertson about this arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The advisory committee would advise the Council on program planning and evaluation, education and training, and the conferring of fellowships, scholarships and project and program grants. The information services unit and a ship operations unit would be established under the proposed umbrella organisation, the Australian Marine Science Council. The information services unit would service the information needs of the organisation and researchers and agencies concerned with marine science. The ship operations unit would be responsible for the operational management of marine science research vessels and co-ordinating information concerning available ship time on Australian and overseas vessels in Australian waters. This unit would also administer a fund to enable scientists to take up ship time opportunities at very short notice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also examines the development of a marine science program for Australia, and, in doing so, recommends that a marine science policy be developed. This policy should incorporate aspects such as the types of research to be financed and mechanisms for the selection, financing and effectiveness of research as well as the exploitation of research results. The Committee identifies areas of research priority which should be incorporated in a future marine science program. The Committee also further examines research vessels and facilities, manpower requirements and financing for marine science. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2G7">Senator JESSOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Finally, I urge the Government to give earnest consideration to the recommendations in the report, which represent the unanimous views of the Committee. Before resuming my seat, I think it would be appropriate for me to recognise the efforts of the Committee's staff in the compilation of this report. Mr Peter Roberts found on taking over as the Committee's Secretary that a lot of valuable work had already been done by Mr Dawe, the Committee's former Secretary. I want to pay Mr Dawe a compliment. I am glad to see that he is present in the public gallery. I think all members of the Committee would want me to compliment him for the work that he has done for us. This work then became largely the responsibility of Sue Thomson, who is our senior research officer. I would also like to pay her a compliment, as well as our stenographers, June Andrews, Linda Rutter and Robyn Graham, who all worked very well to enable this report to be presented today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This seems to be the season for making speeches of farewell to certain honourable senators. I do not think I could let this opportunity pass without paying a very sincere tribute to the work Senator Melzer has done on our Committee. Nobody could wish for a better, more enthusiastic and conscientious member of a committee. I believe that her position on the Committee will be most difficult to fill. I am sure that all of my colleagues join with me in wishing her every success in the future. I hope that she enjoys her retirement and finds some very useful work in which she can pursue her very wide community interests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Jessop outlined partly in the speech which he gave-no doubt this will be outlined further in the rest of his speech which has been incorporated in Hansard-the basic recommendations in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment. I want to make one or two very brief observations about the report. Firstly, let me say that the report generally accepts full responsibility for the 200-nautical-mile Australian fishing zone as a Commonwealth responsibility. The report makes a number of recommendations as to how that responsibility ought to be fulfilled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If I might just make a very brief political point, the contrast between the sensible approach adopted in this report as to constructive policy initiatives and areas of government involvement which should be pursued with the report of the so-called razor gang is stark and, if I might say so, hair raising. I hope it is something that Senator Jessop for one will cogitate about during the coming recess. The report of the razor gang involves the Commonwealth Government in washing its hands right, left and centre of functions of government, for reasons which are in part legitimate and in part ideological. This report suggests certain functions of government which should be pursued constructively in the interests of this society. To that extent it is to be very much commended. It is a forward-looking document which expresses in many ways the sort of involvement which the Opposition has been advocating for some two years in relation to the marine resources in the seas adjacent to this very big continent. I might say that the Australian Labor Party has been advocating this policy for two years. We have had in that advocacy diligent support from Senator Melzer. I would just like to support entirely Senator Jessop's comments about Senator Melzer and about her activities on the Committee. She has been a great help to the process of government in that not only has she contributed to the work of the Committee but also she has contributed very much to the thinking of the Australian Labor Party on these issues, and that is a function and a fact of life which I think should be commended by everybody. It is something that should not go unnoted. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make one other comment on the importance of the initiatives recommended in the report. I want to make a point that we have made many times before. That point is simply this: Governments in Australia would be negligent if they did not look to all the potential areas of resource development which are available to this country. I suppose that in a sense potential areas of marine resources development are still being explored but they must be looked at in terms of the potential wealth and employment opportunities which can be generated in areas of this kind. This very important point emerges from the report. I just make the point that the Government, under the education guidelines which have been brought down for this year, is financing centres of excellence at universities in Australia. That was something that the Government took up in the last days of the election campaign in 1980 in response to the Opposition's policy on that matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. The Government even stole some of the words. I can point to the responsible Minister's statement. That is a good thing, as the honourable senator would recognise. As he would say in some of his more pompous moments, that is the function of an Opposition. I hope that he still recognises that fact. We recommend that the TEC, when considering the question of centres of excellence, look very closely at this report in relation to the issues which are involved. The TEC is being asked to consider the establishment of a national school of fisheries. Perhaps it will widen its consideration somewhat to embrace some of the matters dealt with in this report. All of the things that this report says recommend and point very strongly to the need for a national policy in this area. That is something which is very constructive and most important. For those reasons I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I endorse to the hilt all that has been said by the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Science and the Environment, and I think that has been substantially endorsed by Senator Button. Firstly, I should like to say that Senator Melzer had the capacity, in any interrogation of witnesses, to go for the jugular vein when the dialogue was slowing down and to get answers. One of the difficulties with committee meetings is that they can be endless, and nobody wants too many long baseline rallies. I refer to item 37 of the report. I believe that the clamour that we made for adequate updated mammal research is timely. Not long ago we had a great example of bipartisan policy in relation to the whaling legislation. The forces of good triumphed. There were some malcontents, but I do not want to get too political. The legislation went through, and I know that the Minister for Science and Technology, Mr Thomson, was concerned that it would be unduly delayed. I do not want to go further with that statement. I can see Senator Martin looking at me.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will let that go over my head. I had enough to say yesterday; I do not want to start again. I stand by that statement. Item 37 dealt largely with the evidence of Dr Ling, the curator of the museum in South Australia and a leading authority on seals. He was backed up by Dr Guller, reader in zoology at the University of Tasmania. I believe that the tocsin has been sounded for the Government to move quickly on mammal research. Recently we have had increasing incidences of the beaching of whales, and those who read Time and Newsweek would know that several successful operations have been carried out by the United States Coastguard and it has been able to get some of these whales back into the seas. I raised the question on the Estimates committee which dealt with the Department of Home Affairs and Environment, but I received only a vague response. I believe that there are scientists in Australia who can be co-opted into the field. We also know that with the world food demand and the competition for krill all sorts of situations can arise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me revert to seals. Senator Puplick and myself have had some apprehension about this matter. Perhaps we can be a bit easy in our minds when we compare our position in regard to seals with the position in Canada. There is no case for slaughter of seals here. In conclusion, I say that I hope that the Government will respond to the Committee's efforts. When we see photographs of seals on Moriarty's Reef we will know that they are protected by the humane bipartisan policy of this Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In commending the report of the Standing Committee on Science and the Environment to the Senate, I should like to respond to some of the kind remarks that have been made by my leader, by colleagues, and by the Chairman of the Committee. I say, in response, that I have not served under a fairer chairman than Don Jessop. He manages to control members without bullying them. He manages to control witnesses without ever bullying them-not very noticeably, anyway-and without any overuse of authority. He is a veritable example of an iron fist in a velvet glove. The Chairman and Committee members have all shown a deep interest in and a deep commitment to the matters which have come before us. That is a great help for a committee to get to the truth and to write a report which puts that truth further forward. The leadership that Don Jessop has shown in that regard has always been, I think, something of which the Committee can be proud. I think my colleagues represent a broad cross section of Australian people and Australian ideas. It is from that broad grouping that we have been able to bring forward reports that I think make these matters of interest to ordinary people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One matter that has been raised over and over in this chamber since I became a senator has been that committees can work very hard, wheedle out and demand evidence in all sorts of quarters and write a report that gets to the nub of the problem, but then the report sits in a pigeon hole and governments cannot be brought to the point of implementing the recommendations brought down by the Committee. I believe that Senate committees will get teeth only when people outside realise how much good and truth there is in reports and how close they get to the actual problems that exist. When people outside realise that the reports do affect and can affect their lives they will start to demand that these committees have some teeth. Only when reports are written in language that people understand and only when people can see the reports as affecting their own lives will they take more interest in the reports that are written by committees in this place. I am very proud of the reports that the Science and Environment Committee has put down because I believe that they reflect real problems and that they are written in the sort of language that real people can understand. I thank the Senate for the opportunity of having served on this Committee. I am very proud to have been on it. I will watch from not too far away the work that it does in the future. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>This report was tabled in the House of Representatives yesterday. Unfortunately, because of arrangements relating to reports, it could not be tabled at the same time in the Senate. Because of the fact that it was tabled yesterday and the constraints on the time of the Senate this afternoon, I shall comment only briefly on the recommendations of the report. I trust that in the next session of the Senate there will be opportunities to debate the report, by which time undoubtedly quite a few things will have happened in Indo-China which would necessitate some updating certainly in the detail of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> The report follows the decision by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence in November 1979 to inquire into 'the changing power structure in Indo-China since 1975 and its effects on Australia and the region'. Sub-committee A undertook the reference and in the course of the inquiry submissions were received and evidence heard from a wide variety of individuals and representatives of organisations. These included nationals and diplomatic representatives of the Indo-Chinese countries, Australian academics with expert knowledge of the region, representatives of Commonwealth departments and United Nations representatives. Five members of Sub-committee A individually visited the region between 1979 and 1981. This has provided the Committee with valuable first hand information, especially regarding the refugee situation and conditions in Kampuchea. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the Committee's recommendations in the report tabled today is that the Government should encourage further and continuous study of this volatile region which is likely to become more important to Australia's future. In this way, the Australian public can become aware of the many political, military, social and economic factors contributing to the present instability of the region, and public interest in events in the region will be stimulated. </PARA>
<PARA> The very large Indo-Chinese refugee problem which has arisen in recent years has had direct consequences for Australia, since over 50,000 Indo-Chinese refugees have been accepted for resettlement here since 1975. The humanitarian aspects of the Indo-Chinese refugee situation, and Australia's role in assisting the refugees, is currently being examined by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and has not been studied in depth by this Committee. The existence of a very large body of refugees is also a major cause of instability in the region, particularly in the Thai-Kampuchean border area. The Committee therefore recommends that, working through United Nations organisations, the Government should press for the establishment of some form of administrative machinery on the border so that those Kampuchean refugees seeking resettlement in a third country can be separated quickly from the short term refugees who intend returning to their country. </PARA>
<PARA> The report notes that there have been few regimes this century so reviled as the Democratic Kampuchean Government, which is better known as the Pol Pot regime. The Committee recommends that the general abhorrence felt in Australia towards that regime should be kept in mind when considering Australia's attitude towards the Indo-Chinese region and that Australia should discourage diplomatic support for the Democratic Kampuchean regime. The Committee does not, however, support the recognition of the People's Republic of Kampuchea, which is known as the Heng Samrin regime, while Vietnamese military forces are present in Kampuchea. Recent reports of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations have stressed that Kampuchea's economy is still so fragile that famine conditions could easily return if drought or floods occur, or as a result of political or military upheavals, or if there is an abrupt end to international aid. In the interests of encouraging stability in the region, every effort needs to be made by the international community to prevent the recurrence of famine in Kampuchea. The Committee, therefore, recommends that Australian humanitarian aid to Kampuchea should continue. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most notable developments in Indo-China since 1975 is the emergence of Vietnam as a strong military power. As the report tabled today indicates, Vietnam is apparently determined to maintain its present domination of Indo-China even at the cost of conflict with China. Under the so-called Twenty-five Year Treaties of Friendship and Co-operation signed with Laos in July 1979 and Kampuchea in February 1979, Vietnam has legitimised its military presence in those countries under the guise of defence co-operation. Currently there are 40,000 to 50,000 Vietnamese troops in Laos and some 200,000 in Kampuchea. Consequently, Laos and Kampuchea must now be regarded as client states of their powerful neighbour. The Committee is concerned at this situation and recommends that Australia should support policies which would result in the independence of Vietnam, Laos and Kampuchea, based on democratically elected governments. The Committee also recommends that economic aid should not be given by Australia to Vietnam until it withdraws its military forces from Laos and Kampuchea. </PARA>
<PARA> Vietnam's domination of Indo-China entails her continuing dependence on the Soviet Union for large-scale military and economic aid. The Soviet Union has been able to utilise its relationship with Vietnam to obtain access to port facilities and thus increase its own presence in the region. The physical presence of Soviet advisers in Vietnam and the Soviet naval presence, particularly in such major ports as Da Nang, appears to have expanded considerably since February 1979. Vietnam has apparently become an important staging-cum-naval observation post or depot for Soviet naval operations in the South China Sea. To China this no doubt appears part of what is seen as a Soviet plot to encircle her on all possible borders. </PARA>
<PARA> A reduction in the tensions in the Indo-Chinese region will not be achieved easily. The Committee believes, therefore, that Australia must face the prospect of continued instability in the region, coupled with the very real prospect of renewed armed conflict there. The Committee recommends that Australia should make strenuous efforts to promote regional solutions to Indo-Chinese problems and, in the interest of peace and stability in the region, attempt to decrease the involvement of the super-powers. The Committee further recommends that the Government should utilise its relationship with the Association of South East Asian Nations to encourage all forms of dialogue between ASEAN countries and Indo-China which may help to decrease tension in the region and promote a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Kampuchea. Australia should also continue to lend its support to international efforts aimed at decreasing regional tension. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EJ4">Senator SIBRAA</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Eight of the nine Australian Labor Party members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, along with Senator Sim who was one of the Government members of the Committee, signed a dissenting report on recommendation No. 3. Recommendation No. 3 of the report indicated that economic aid should not be given by Australia to Vietnam until it withdraws its military forces from Laos and Kampuchea. Our dissenting report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We believe a more appropriate recommendation on the question of future Australian economic assistance to Vietnam would read as follows: 'The Government should resume its commitment to the two aid projects to Vietnam suspended in January 1979. Such assistance reflects continuing obligations resulting from Australian involvement in the war in Vietnam. This action may encourage Vietnam to lessen dependence on the Soviet Union and encourage Vietnamese resistance to the Soviet demands for access to Vietnamese facilities for Soviet military purposes. The Australian Government should also use alliance channels to press the US Government to adopt a similar policy'. </PARA>
<PARA>We continued later in our minority report to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The cessation of Australia's small aid program to Vietnam following the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea is understandable, but in the context of our longer term interests, is counterproductive. For Australia to continue to maintain this position deprives us of attaining an identifiable position in the process of reaching a solution to the Indo-Chinese problem. </PARA>
<PARA>We realise that the issue of the withdrawal of forces was something that had to be dealt with. We stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We should not delude ourselves that Vietnam is likely to withdraw its forces from Kampuchea until it is assured that a government friendly to its interests is firmly established in Kampuchea. The prospects for a resolution of the Indo Chinese problem in the short term are not bright. However, in the longer term an accommodation is possible and we should direct our efforts to this eventuality. In the nature of the process there will of necessity be compromises in the positions taken by all interested parties. A more flexible Australian position will assist in this process. </PARA>
<PARA>In the minority report we also dealt with the problem of refugees. We said in part:</PARA>
<PARA> As well as our national security interest in seeing Vietnamese dependence on the Soviet Union reduced we need to be concerned with developments which may lead to substantial increases in the numbers of Indo Chinese refugees. We need to be concerned about such developments on humanitarian grounds. We also need to be aware of the social, political and economic damage a large influx of refugees will do to friendly States in the ASEAN group. We must further acknowledge that a massive increase in the number of refugees is likely to pose political and economic difficulties in Australia. So far obligations to accept Indo Chinese refugees in Australia have been undertaken without raising substantial domestic difficulties. This situation may not necessarily continue in the face of surges in the numbers to be accommodated. </PARA>
<PARA>It is fair to say that the success of the refugee program, or the manner in which Australia has accepted a number of refugees from Vietnam, is due to the fact that there has been a bipartisan approach to the problem. I believe it is also fair to say that the Labor Party sees economic aid being very closely tied up with these problems. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The refugee question is complex. The large exodus of refugees from Vietnam prior to July 1979 was a product of racial and political tensions. However, it is clear that economic problems also weigh with Vietnamese in determining whether or not to permit large numbers to leave. Economic stability in Vietnam is also likely to be a factor in determining whether or not individual Vietnamese wish to leave. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, at the conclusion of our minority report we said:</PARA>
<PARA> Aid is a diplomatic entree, one of the few which Australia can utilise. To deny itself an opportunity to use aid for realistic objectives is foolish. Recommendation 3 as it stands does this. The alternative put forward would permit Australia to pursue its national interest more appropriately. </PARA>
<PARA>It did concern us that we had to write a minority report on such a sensitive subject. It is worthy of note that Senator Sim who was, up to yesterday, the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, also agreed with us and signed the minority report. I think it is worth noting also that when Senator Sim was Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence-for a period, I think, in excess of 10 years-we never presented a minority report. We were all able to sit together as a committee to work out whatever differences we had, to approach problems realistically and, finally, to reach agreement. I know that it is easier to reach agreement on a Senate committee with six members than it is to reach agreement with 21 members from both Houses on a joint committee. However, it did concern us that in this sensitive report we were not able to reach agreement on this one issue even though we reached agreement on all of the others. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence since 1975 and a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence since 1975. I have served with Senator Sim who was Chairman of the Senate Committee and I have also served with him as a member of the Joint Committee. I know how strongly he feels about overseas aid not only to Indo-China and South East Asia but also to Africa. I take this opportunity today in talking to this report to congratulate him on the distinguished work that he has done on both those committees. I am sure that Senator Primmer and Senator McIntosh, my colleagues on the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, join with me in wishing Senator Sim well for the future. I know that he is not going to lose his involvement in foreign affairs and defence. We are looking forward to the time when he will be able to come before our Senate Committee as a witness and give evidence on the areas and the subjects on which he has been so very well briefed in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> I should not conclude my remarks without thanking the staff of the sub-committee on Indo-China for the work they have done in preparing this report. Finally, I join with Senator Martin in saying that the issues involved in this report are too important for it to be pigeon-holed. I also hope, along with Senator Martin, that the report will come up for debate in the Senate at a very early stage in the Budget session. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I agree with my colleague, Senator Sibraa, in all he has had to say. As one of the signatories of the dissenting report, I would like to say that there was no way I could agree with recommendation 3. It was that economic aid should not be given by Australia to Vietnam until such time as it withdraws its forces from Kampuchea. I think it was an unrealistic attitude. Therefore, I could not agree with it and I was a signatory to the dissenting report. If one read the body of the report, one would begin to wonder why the Committee made recommendation 3. In the body of the report, the position was made pretty clear. It is stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On several occasions in 1975, North Vietnam reaffirmed its desire to normalise relations with the United States. However, no progress was made on this issue, nor on the question of the United States' payment of war 'reparations'.2 The United States Government further expressed its displeasure at the communist conquest of the south, by announcing that it would veto the separate applications made by North and South Vietnam in July for membership of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA> In the period 1976-77, following Vietnam's re-unification, the Vietnamese Government launched a diplomatic offensive on a wide front, which echoed what then became the principal theme of its foreign policy: to assert its independence from the socialist giants and improve its image as a genuinely non-aligned nation. In August 1976, at a meeting of the non-aligned bloc in Colombo, the leader of the Vietnamese delegation, Premier Pham Van Dong, said: 'On the international plane, it is necessary to establish, maintain and diversify our relations with all countries, primarily those with developing countries'. In line with Vietnam's need for foreign loans in order to finance its 1976-80 Five Year Plan, Premier Pham Van Dong also called for economic relations with developed capitalist countries. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to explain that Vietnam tried very hard to get assistance from America, Australia and developing nations in order to get on to a proper economic footing. It was forced further and further into the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, COMECON, bloc. I think we have to accept some of the responsibility for that situation. It would be rather petty to withhold the pittance of aid that we gave after our commitment to Vietnam. Making aid conditional was, I think, very wrong indeed. In the first place, I do not believe that aid should have conditions and strings to it in that manner. For those reasons I went along with the dissenting report and everything else contained in it. </PARA>

<PARA> It will be recalled that the Parliament has twice previously enacted legislation of a defensive character in regard to foreign anti-trust proceedings-the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Act (in November 1976) and the Act prohibiting the enforcement of judgments in Australia, to which I have just referred. That legislation was directly occasioned by proceedings in the United States relating to trade in uranium and, more particularly, the Westinghouse suit, but I wish to recall what I said of the Westinghouse suit in my Press statement of 5 October 1980. I then said that 'it represents an example, even if the most dramatic, of the particular difficulties experienced by foreign governments with private treble damages proceedings where United States extraterritorial jurisdiction was being asserted'. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Westinghouse suit has been settled. But the jurisdictional threat to our export and other trading policies from such private proceedings remains. The measure which I am now introducing is designed to further protect those policies. It is also designed to underline the seriousness with which the Commonwealth Government and the Parliament continues to view this problem. For here, I believe that I express, in a complete sense, a national voice. The two previous Acts were enacted by the Parliament with bipartisan support and, whatever differences in nuance may emerge, the Opposition has been at one with the Government in its concern. Australia is not alone in the difficulties which it has experienced in this area. Belgium, Canada and the Provinces of Quebec and Ontario in that country, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom have, at one time or another, felt the need to introduce prohibitory measures as a defence against the jurisdictional assertions of the United States in the field of antitrust enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia's Objections</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Let me state as clearly and as fully as I can Australia's objections to the way in which the United States enforces its anti-trust laws extra-territorially. Australia is a major trading nation and a major exporter of commodities. It is the largest or close to the largest exporter of meat, sugar, wheat, iron ore, alumina, mineral sands, lead, bauxite, zinc, coal and nickel in the world. Its export income from agricultural and mineral commodities of $A14.1 billion in 1979-80 represented 77 per cent of the total national export income of that year. Australia regulates its exports under certain laws; chiefly by the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations, but also by other laws incidental to its export control. By Part X of the Trade Practices Act it regulates outwards shipping-and I emphasise 'outward' shipping-from this country. By the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act the relevant Minister may, upon the recommendation of the Corporation, designate the carriers of meat exports from this country and impose certain conditions relating to its carriage. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me, in the light of that, turn to United States extra territorial anti-trust enforcement. The United States applies its anti-trust laws to the conduct of aliens abroad, if there is, as a result of that conduct, an adverse effect upon United States commerce. In applying that principle the United States regards it as jurisdictionally sufficient if the conduct has produced the required adverse effect upon the foreign commerce of the United States. That is a special feature of United States anti-trust law. As was stated in a report of the OECD Committee of Experts on Restrictive Business Practices in July 1977:</PARA>
<PARA> The special feature of the United States anti-trust laws is that they alone also apply to restrictions on competition which affect the foreign trade of the United States. (Paragraph 119). </PARA>
<PARA>And whatever minor gloss may be placed upon it, that remains true today. What that characteristic of United States law means is that jurisdiction will be asserted if there is the required adverse effect upon United States exports or United States imports. That alone is sufficient. To that extent-to the extent that United States anti-trust law extends into foreign commerce in this particular way-it is a trading law. It requires foreign traders to behave in a certain manner in the international market so as not to affect adversely American trade. </PARA>
<PARA> Trading laws are common enough. Nations, by their laws, regulate their exports and their imports. I have given certain examples in the case of Australia. But ordinarily what they regulate is their exports and their imports. We would not, for example, regard it as open for a country to impose criminal sanctions upon a foreign trader because he refused to sell to us, nor to require him to sell to our traders at a stipulated minimum price. The United States anti-trust laws, as applied extra-territorially, do proscribe the way in which foreign exporters shall do business where there is an adverse effect upon American trade. But the matter does not rest there. The conduct by foreign exporters is subject to American law even where they are carrying out the laws and policies of the exporting country. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, nations, in the ordinary course, regulate their exports and their imports. That is clearly a corollary of each nation's sovereignty. Is there then any special justification by which the United States could presume to regulate the conduct of foreign exporters and that, notwithstanding that their conduct is in accordance with the trading laws of their own country? What the United States anti-trust laws are directed against is anti-competitive behaviour. Many countries, including our own, have competition laws. Many legislate so as to take steps to prevent the control of anti-competitive behaviour within their domestic economies from being undermined by external conduct. But with that we are not here concerned. We are dealing with the international market. For it is the conduct of foreign traders and the effect of that conduct on American trade which grounds jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, let me look briefly at competition policy practice in the international market. Section 51 (2) (g) of the Australian Trade Practices Act provides, in substance, that arrangements relating exclusively to the export of goods are, subject to certain requirements, exempt from the operation of the Act. Australian law is not alone in containing such an exemption from its competition law. The competition laws of Canada, Germany, Japan and the United States itself provide in one form or another for export exemptions. The United States Webb Pomerene Act grants anti-trust immunity to export associations. The fact that such associations might fix prices and thereby injure the trade of another nation is no obstacle to their obtaining immunity. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I need not dwell upon the contradiction in the United States position of insisting by its anti-trust laws, that foreign exporters shall act competitively in the international market whilst allowing by specific legislative provision its own exporters to act anti-competitively in that market. Nor upon the collision of laws and policies which would result if each and every nation were to apply an 'adverse effect upon foreign commerce' test of legislative jurisdiction and if, at the same time, each such State were to give effect to an export exemption. Many countries have legislated to require competition within their economies, yet consider restrictive conduct by their exporters to be permissible and justified. And they do so because of the special character of the international market. The international market is not a free market, however much that may be wished. It is distorted by the actions of governments-importing as well as exporting countries. It is not unreasonable to take the laws and practices of the United States for examination both by reason of its prominence in world trade and, more simply, because it is, after all, the United States which has asserted jurisdiction to regulate foreign traders in the manner described. For example, section 201 of the United States Trade Agreements Act provides for relief to be given where goods are imported in such increased quantities as to be 'a substantial cause of serious injury or the threat thereof to a domestic industry . . . '. Successful foreign competition is the criterion upon which that section operates. Moreover, the relief which can be granted-including the negotiation of orderly marketing arrangements-is itself restrictive of competition in the international market. In addition, the United States has entered into what are described as voluntary restraint agreements. References to such agreements almost invariably place the word voluntary in quotation marks. And the reason for this is that they are not voluntary. They are agreements resulting from governments leaning on traders. And so over the years, in order to protect the United States domestic producers from foreign competition, such agreements have been concluded. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1964 the United States has applied provisions for the imposition of quotas on the importation of meat into that country. Those provisions, themselves restrictive of competition, have been relied upon to induce voluntary agreements to limit exports to the United States. I might also mention the legislative provision under which the United States uranium import embargo-which was frequently referred to for its significance in the Westinghouse proceedings-was imposed. The provision enabled an embargo to be imposed to the extent necessary to ensure the maintenance of a viable, domestic uranium industry. In other words, to protect United States domestic uranium producers from foreign competition. The United States is not alone in these policies. The point which I have been endeavouring to make is that the international market is not, as a matter of reality, a free market. And from that it follows inevitably that the United States cannot rely upon the practices in that market to justifiably overreach foreign trading laws and policies and proscribe the conduct of exporters carried out in accordance with them. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another quite separate point. It is evident that the difficulties encountered where jurisdiction is based upon an adverse effect on American trade could be substantially mitigated if the kind of effect required were precisely delimited and carefully applied. But this is not the case. There is no consensus in United States legal authority as to the kind of effect required. It has been variously described as a 'direct and intended' effect; a 'direct, substantial, and foreseeable' effect; a 'substantial and foreseeable' effect; a 'direct or substantial' effect; or that 'the better views seem to be that any effect that is not both insubstantial and indirect will support Federal jurisdiction'. And, more recently, in 1979, in the case of Dominicus Americana Bohio, Judge Carter said-and I quote-'indeed it is probably not necessary for the effect on foreign commerce to be both substantial and direct as long as it is not de minimus'. In other words, for the assumption of jurisdiction, although not, in fairness, for its exercise, that court was prepared to accept that any effect on United States commerce which was not trifling would be sufficient to ground jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> We live in a world in which the repercussions of economic conduct may be infinitely remote. And we criticise, on that ground, an effects test which is so wide, so vague, and so uncertain. The only clear case in which foreign government laws and policies are taken into account by United States courts in respect of private conduct carried in pursuance of them, is by the defence of foreign sovereign compulsion. That narrowly confined defence is quite inadequate. It requires that the foreign trader shall have been compelled by his government to carry out the impugned conduct. By its nature, it excludes the vast range of foreign laws and policies which approve or authorise trading conduct. In point of sovereignty, compulsion or otherwise is an arbitrary and irrelevant distinction. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite as importantly, the doctrine of foreign sovereign compulsion affords a defence only. The foreign law or policy does not, as we maintain it must, go to the question of jurisdiction. This is not a matter of mere theoretical criticism but of great practical importance given the nature of United States proceedings and the cost burden involved. I shall refer in due course to what has become known as the Timberlane principle which does relate to foreign laws and policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me sum up. As things stand, our export laws and policies and those laws and policies incidental to them are, in our view, quite unjustifiably threatened by the jurisdictional assertions of United States Courts in proceedings against Australian exporters when giving them effect. </PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth Government Policy</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken of the restrictive character of the international market. There is no question that restrictive business practices adversely affecting international trade constitute a major problem. The obstacles they present to trade have been greatly aggravated by the increasing internationalisation of the corporate structure. Australia's policy is, and has been, to participate actively in the removal of these obstacles to world trade. Australia's policy is clear. We believe that where United States' anti-trust enforcement and Australian trading laws clash, the solution lies in inter-governmental consultation. Our policy is to establish a mechanism by which those inter-governmental consultations can take place. On 3 November 1977, the then United States Associate Attorney-General, Mr Egan, made an important statement. He said, in an address to the International Bar Association, that:</PARA>
<PARA>''an unyielding and unresponsive anti-trust policy, heedless of considerations of comity could seriously disrupt United States foreign policy. It could weaken vital alliances. It could provoke retaliation.''</PARA>
<PARA>And, in the same address, Mr Egan added:</PARA>
<PARA>''the only appropriate response is one of seeking accommodation and compromise when United States anti-trust enforcement conflicts with foreign laws and important foreign policies.''. </PARA>
<PARA>And so this statement gave us, as we thought, the opportunity for the implementation of our policy. In September 1978, I led a delegation from Australia to discuss the matter in the United States. We recognised that if, in accordance with the statement by Mr Egan, the United States was to accommodate its anti-trust enforcement to the important policies of foreign governments, some means must be devised by which the United States would be apprised of our laws and policies where they might have significant anti-trust implications for the United States. It would also be necessary for there to be full consultation and, subject to the outcome of those consultations, the preservation of the authority and sovereignty of the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I can say that, at that meeting, the Australian initiative was welcomed. A text, in provisional and draft form, was presented by us to the United States and we looked forward to an early and favourable response. The United States submitted a revised negotiating draft agreement under cover of a letter dated 27 July 1979, from the then United States Assistant Attorney-General, Mr Shenefield. In that letter it was indicated that the United States saw little room for negotiating on two matters-private anti-trust proceedings and immunity of Australian enterprises from prosecution in respect of conduct during the process of consultation as contemplated by the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I will deal later with the further discussions that I had with the United States Attorney-General concerning the bilateral agreement and other developments. Our concern in those discussions related very much to the apparent exclusion of the issue of private anti-trust proceedings from the discussions as I have just mentioned. It is not, however, possible to understand the significance of those discussions, or indeed, the need for this present measure, without some general explanation of the law relating to private treble damages suits. </PARA>
<PARA>Private Treble Damages Suits</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The United States Department of Justice is authorised to bring criminal proceedings for a breach of United States anti-trust laws. In addition, however, a private plaintiff can bring suit to recover three times the amount of any damage which it has sustained as a result of that same breach. The purpose of this multiple damages remedy is penal. Private anti-trust suits, it has been said, serve to supply an ancillary force of private investigators to supplement the Department of Justice's law enforcement. Plaintiffs in such suits are referred to as private Attorneys-General. United States procedures enable judgments in criminal proceedings to constitute prima facie evidence for the purpose of these civil proceedings. Private action is encouraged by a provision permitting the plaintiff to recover costs. The defendant, even if successful, is not entitled to recover costs. And let me add, Mr President, that not enough has been said in discussions on this subject about the matter of costs. Legal costs in these proceedings can amount to millions-and I mean millions-of dollars. The costs alone can constitute a quite undeserved penalty for an innocent defendant. </PARA>
<PARA>Procedural Problems Associated with Multiple Damages Suits</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of problems associated with these penal actions which are in form private or civil. Nations have established by their laws a fabric of reciprocity in regard to civil proceedings which are compensatory in the strict sense. But this fabric of reciprocity was never designed to take account of criminal actions or multiple damages proceedings which are civil in form. One such problem concerns the recognition of judgments in those proceedings and, it will be recalled, that in April 1980 I presented a paper on multiple damages judgments at the Conference of Commonwealth Law Ministers at Barbados in the context of a proposed Commonwealth scheme for the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. That paper was well received by the Ministers attending the Conference, who represented 38 Commonwealth countries. That Conference expressed general support for the principle that enforcement of judgement arrangements should exclude multiple damages awards. Importantly, in the present context, the concept of recovery back was supported. Details of the Conference and a copy of the paper which I presented can be found in my Press statements of 1 May 1980 and 8 June 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other difficulties with private treble damages suits. Under procedures available in civil proceedings, a plaintiff may call for discovery and production of documents to the court from the other party. In most common law countries such a procedure exists and it enables each party to have access to all documents in the possession of the other which are directly relevant to the suit. Under United States procedures, however, the defendant may be required to produce not only documents that are directly relevant but also any documents that lead to admissible evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, in the case of private anti-trust suits, discovery may generate the production of massive quantities of documents. In the case of one defendant in the Westinghouse suit, half a million or so documents in Australia were subject to discovery. This matter of discovery of documents leads back to the ambit of legislative jurisdiction assumed under United States law. For it is a clear rule of international law-unquestioned by the United States-that enforcement jurisdiction, of which discovery of documents is an example, can only exist where legislative jurisdiction exists. Accordingly, where that latter jurisdiction is disputed-as is the case with the United States anti-trust laws-it must necessarily give rise to dispute as to the availability of discovery. </PARA>
<PARA>The Problem of Jurisdiction and Multiple Damages</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> But let me return to the central problem with these private treble damages suits-and to the reasons for our disappointment at the United States response to our negotiating initiative of September 1978 by removing the issue of these suits from the further negotiation of the bilateral agreement. The jurisdiction assumed by the court in these private anti-trust suits is precisely the same as that which applies in criminal proceedings. It follows that there is exactly the same possibility of United States national economic policy being given effect by its courts and superseding the trading laws of other countries as I have previously described. </PARA>
<PARA> We, of course, have neither objection nor concern with regard to the use of multiple damages to advance national economic policy within the United States. But where extra territorial jurisdiction in private proceedings allows for our own trading policies to be superseded, we are confronted with a quite different problem. It is obvious that a private plaintiff is not, as such, concerned with questions of sovereignty or jurisdiction. Likewise, a foreign defendant is inevitably concerned with its own interests in resisting the claim. Questions of national interest are of incidental importance to a private plaintiff and to a private defendant. Where there are problems of jurisdiction and the matter is left entirely in private hands there is no scope for resolving these conflicts by inter-governmental consultation. </PARA>
<PARA>Recognition of Foreign Government Interests in Private Treble Damages Suits</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's general concern with the problems of private treble damages suits, of which we had been aware from the outset and which I have dealt with generally, became immeasurably increased by certain events which took place about this time in the Westinghouse suit. Those events related to the failure to accord adequate recognition to foreign government policies and interests in certain proceedings then current in that suit. Those proceedings allowed us to observe the operation of a relatively recent decision of a United States court dealing with foreign government policies and interests. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, let me explain. In early 1977 the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit delivered judgment in the Timberlane case. In effect, it was held that before jurisdiction should be assumed or exercised in any suit where foreign government policies or interests were involved, there should be a 'weighing' of the respective governmental interests of the United States and the foreign country. Certain factors were enunciated in that and in a subsequent decision which were to be taken into account for that purpose. There then followed a development which appeared to Australia to be of considerable importance. The United States Government, through its most senior officials, endorsed that decision. Indeed, it has continued to endorse the Timberlane principle as the means by which sovereignty of other nations may be respected and comity given effect. Accordingly, when, in relation to proceedings then current in the Westinghouse matter, we approached the United States Administration to intervene, we did so with some confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Timberlane decision itself was premised upon the view-and I quote from the words of Judge Choy-that 'the effects test by itself is incomplete because it fails to consider other nations' interests'. That being the basis of the decision which the United States Government had so emphatically endorsed it seemed to follow that the Administration would have been anxious to have had Timberlane established as the law of the land as soon as possible. There were, however, more particular grounds for our confidence. It is to be remembered that the Westinghouse suit was preceded by a massive Grand Jury inquiry. Arising out of that inquiry the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, after a full study of the matter, filed one misdemeanour charge only, and that against a United States corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States Government had thus made its own assessment of the governmental interests in question and the result of that assessment was made clear by the then Assistant Attorney-General, Mr Shenefield. That assessment was as follows. In a letter to United States Senator Metzenbaum dated 31 March 1979, Mr Shenefield said that 'the evidence did not support the conclusion that the broad uranium cartel had any significant and foreseeable effect on United States commerce, as required by law'. In January 1980, Mr Shenefield stated to a Congressional committee 'first it is an undoubted fact . . . that the cartel had its genesis in a major anti-competitive action by our own government in walling off a major portion of the world's market to businessmen who had theretofore sold into our market'. He added that 'I think it is also fair to point out also that certainly the Governments of South Africa, Canada and Australia see uranium as being one of their major national resources and took steps following our own Government's anti-competitive acts to try and save an important national industry'. We would have thought that, having made its assessment of the governmental considerations involved, the Administration would then have wished to bring them formally before the court so as to assist it in giving effect to the Timberlane principle which the Administration has espoused. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the factors which the Timberlane principle requires to be taken into account is the 'possible effect upon foreign relations if the court exercises jurisdiction and grants relief'. In its Note to the Commonwealth Government dated 31 October 1979, the United States Department of State, in acknowledging that the suit sought large damages from Australian companies which were important participants in the Australian economy, went on to add 'it is also the case . . . that the United States has an interest in the stability and the prosperity of the Australian economy, given our strong political, strategic and economic ties'. Timberlane required a consideration of foreign relations. The Department of State acknowledged that foreign relations were involved. Intervention to explain the foreign relations aspects to the courts would have seemed imperative if that principle was to have any reality. All our requests for intervention have been rejected. It was said by the Department of State that the Commonwealth Government could present its views directly to the court-and I quote-'we are confident that its views will be given due weight'. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me then look at the reactions of the courts. In the District Court, Judge Marshall in proceedings before him commented-and I quote-that 'the judiciary has no expertise or perhaps even authority to evaluate the economic and social policies of foreign governments'. In the Court of Appeals the intervention of foreign governments was criticised so strongly that its comments led to a letter from the United States Government to that Court in whom its confidence had been so misplaced. For that letter we were grateful, as I have indicated in a previous press statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, let me sum up the whole position. A decision of a United States Circuit Court called for the weighing of governmental interests in anti-trust suits where the policies or interests of foreign governments were involved. In particular, the court was to consider the possible effect upon foreign relations. The United States Government specifically endorsed that decision as the means by which the sovereignty of other countries may be respected and comity given effect. Nevertheless, the United States Government has not to this stage intervened to assist the court in its consideration of those foreign governmental interests, notwithstanding that the Administration has reached views upon them and acknowledged that the foreign relations of both the United States and the other countries are implicated. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States Government refuses to intervene upon the ground that the courts can deal with the matter. United States courts, for their part, have said either that they have no expertise to weigh foreign governmental interests or that the Timberlane principle is not the law of this circuit, or have complained and relied upon the failure of the Department of State to intervene. (Decision of the Supreme Court of New Mexico in General Atomic Co. v. United Nuclear Corporation dated 29 August 1980.) And for good measure, the court, in a recent case, said that 'naturally the defendants must bear the burden of demonstrating that foreign policy considerations outweigh the need to enforce the antitrust laws where the foreign commerce of the United States is affected'. (Dominicus Americana Bohio v. Gulf &amp; Western (1979) 473 F. Supp. 680 at 688). The inconsistencies in the United States position on this matter are clearly apparent. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not recited our endeavours to secure United States Government intervention in order to suggest that that represents a solution to the problem of private treble damages suits. The issue is not so much intervention. It is the Timberlane principle itself. It is fundamentally unworkable for the very reason that Judge Marshall gave. The judiciary has no expertise to decide these questions; questions as to the significance of a trading law to another country; as to the need for stabilisation of prices; as to the need to deal with an unforeseen emergency in the export market. Timberlane is not a principle which we can in point of sovereignty accept. We are not prepared to acknowledge that a United States court can judge, on the basis of its view of our national interest, whether it will exercise jurisdiction. For the reasons already given, we claim that there is no warrant for United States anti-trust laws overreaching our own export laws and policies. In Australia's view these conflicts over jurisdiction and sovereignty, on the one hand, and over national interests on the other, can only be worked out by governments. But given United States law as to private treble damages suits, it is extremely difficult for a mechanism of inter-governmental consultations to be arranged. </PARA>
<PARA> I met with the then United States Attorney-General, Mr Civiletti, in April 1980. It will be understood, against the background which I have given, that my purpose was to press upon the United States Government the problem posed by the issue of private treble damages suits and the need for that issue to remain negotiable. I also broached with him the need for some legislative change in this area. For it is clear that if the private treble damages remedy were not extended into the field of foreign commerce, many of our problems would be removed. Mr Civiletti was sympathetic to our concerns but I cannot claim any particular success on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA>The Canberra Meeting with the United States Attorney-General</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I met with Mr Civiletti in Canberra on 13 August 1980. That meeting was successful. A Press statement was issued on that date relating to the meeting. I do not wish to repeat what was there stated but I refer to it as the meeting forms an important stage in the history of this matter. The important outcome of that meeting was that the United States understood and acknowledged Australia's concern that there should be prior consultations before anti-trust enforcement action affecting its interests was taken. It accepted the need for those consultations to take place in the event of any future anti-trust enforcement action. At the same time both governments recognised the problem of private treble damages suits. The United States Government agreed to prepare a draft text on that subject for our consideration. We have not, as yet, received that draft text. I do not say this by way of any criticism of the United States Government. There has been a new Administration. Perhaps, more fundamentally, there are inherent difficulties in drafting any satisfactory provisions adequately protective of foreign government interests given the present United States law relating to private treble damages. </PARA>
<PARA>General Activities Involving the Commonwealth Government</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> There has been certain activity in the United States Congress in the area of international anti-trust. It is true that some of this stems from concerns within the United States that its anti-trust laws constitute some impediment to United States exports. But there is another strand of thinking which recognises that in the long run accommodation to the interests of foreign governments and a full respect for their sovereignty will in truth enhance the efficacy of its anti-trust laws and the control of restrictive business practices generally. During the last session of the Congress before the elections, a Bill was introduced into the Senate, sponsored by Senator Mathias, which would have the effect of setting up a commission to study international aspects of United States anti-trust laws. In a letter of 16 November 1979 to Senator Mathias, the Commonwealth Government expressed its support for the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> A further Bill in similar terms has been introduced during the present session of Congress. On 6 May 1981, the Australian Embassy in Washington presented a Note to the United States Department of State expressing its support for the establishment of the proposed commission and asking that its views be passed to the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Commission, as proposed by the Bill, would comprise members of the United States Executive, the Congress and private enterprise. As proposed, it would be chaired by the Vice-President of the United States. It would examine, among other things, the effect of the application of United States anti-trust laws on United States relations with other countries and, further, the jurisdiction and scope of the application of those laws to foreign conduct and foreign parties. At the same time a task force of the American Bar Association has examined the international implications of United States anti-trust enforcement and has put forward recommendations, not yet endorsed, but which would involve prior consultation with foreign governments in certain circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> There has also been activity from a different angle at the multilateral level. Basic to the control of restrictive business practices is the collection of documents and information relating to them. At the present time a Working Party of the Committee on Restrictive Business Practices of the OECD is engaged in the important task of reporting on jurisdictional obstacles to the collection of information abroad necessary for the control of restrictive business practices. It has also been asked to look specifically into the consequences of the effects doctrine of jurisdiction in this regard. The Working Party is chaired by the Federal Republic of Germany and is attended by the United Kingdom and a large number of other European countries, Canada, Japan and the United States. A senior official from my Department has attended meetings of this Working Party held in March, June and November 1980 and in January and March 1981. We are not approaching the problem in any negative sense but I think that other countries will allow that we have assisted in identifying the jurisdictional problems behind the enactment of prohibitory legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Present Position</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Stated broadly, we are thus in this position. The United States understands, and I believe accepts, that governmental action on its part by way of anti-trust enforcement which impinges upon our laws and policies should be preceded by consultations. Our ultimate objective remains. That is, to establish a detailed mechanism by which inter-governmental consultations can take place in advance. But that is not possible if any agreement arising out of such consultations can be undermined by private anti-trust proceedings of the kind which I have described. We will continue our endeavours to overcome this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> An investigation by the Department of Justice into an alleged violation of its anti-trust laws in relation to shipping between Australia, New Zealand and the United States, is proceeding. There are various proceedings between the Conferences and the United States Department of Justice which we are keeping under careful review. Certain facts disclosed by the United States Department of Justice in the course of answering interrogatories in those proceedings have led Australia to deliver a Note to the United States Government seeking consultations on the matters arising out of the answers. We would expect the United States Government to respond positively to this request in the spirit of the arrangements reached at my discussions with the former United States Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a private treble damages suit which appears to be connected with the subject of the Pacific Shipping investigation. It would be premature to comment upon whether those proceedings involve Australia's sovereignty or bear upon its national interests. We are keeping those proceedings under careful review. At the same time, a private action has been instituted in the United States by the Conservation Council of Western Australia against Alcoa and Reynolds. A motion by the defendants to strike out that complaint is presently before the court and this week I released a copy of the amicus curiae brief filed by the Commonwealth Government in those proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>The Present Bill</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> It is, in the Government's view, imperative that Australia's legislation should give the utmost protection to our laws and policies and hence the need for the present Bill. The Government is introducing the present measure with a view to it being debated at a subsequent sitting of the Parliament. It will itself give close consideration in the interval to the form of the legislation and will, of course, pay close attention in the meantime to the current proceedings and developments in the United States. The effect of the Bill is to amend the Foreign Anti-trust Judgments (Restriction of Enforcement) Act so that where the order has been made under that Act prohibiting the enforcement of a foreign anti-trust judgment, an Australian defendant-described in the Bill as a prescribed person-may take proceedings to recover from the foreign plaintiff any amount which has been recovered under that foreign anti-trust judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> The United Kingdom enacted similar legislation in March 1980-the United Kingdom's Protection of Trading Interests Act. The purpose of that legislation was the same. The United Kingdom legislation provides for the recovery back of the punitive-non-compensatory-part of any multiple damages. We have not adopted this option. The Bill is consistent with the present provisions of the Foreign Anti-trust Judgments (Restriction of Enforcement) Act which provides for an order prohibiting the whole of the judgment in Australia. It is to be noted that, in any event, we consider that the principle involved is not directed to multiple damages suits as such but multiple damages suits combined with extra-territorial jurisdiction. It will also be observed that the Attorney-General may, on making such an order, specify that portion of the amount of the judgment may be recoverable in Australia and there is provision in the Bill precluding the recovery back in respect of amounts allowed by the order to be recovered in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the details of the Bill. Clause 3 of the Bill extends the operation of the Act to the external Territories. In addition, it provides a specific interpretation section of general application in the Act. The clause includes a definition of related company by reference to the definition of that item in the Australian Capital Territory Companies Ordinance 1962. That definition is consistent with the definition contained in the Companies Act 1981, which was passed earlier this sittings. Clause 4 repeals certain definitions of words and expressions contained in sub-section 3 (1) of the principal Act. It also inserts a new sub-section 3 (2A) which restricts the right of the Attorney-General to make an order under sub-sections 3 (2) (c) or (d) where the proceedings leading to the foreign judgment relates to conduct which took place in the jurisdiction where the foreign judgment was given. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 creates the right of recovery back where a foreign judgment, to which an order has been made by the Attorney-General under sub-sections 3 (2) (c) or (d) of the principal Act, has been enforced against an Australian defendant outside of Australia. Under new sub-section 4 (1), as provided in clause 5, where the order has been made under sub-section 3 (2) (c), the amount of recovery back allowable is the whole amount paid as a result of the enforcement outside of Australia. New sub-sections 4 (2) and (3) operate where an order has been made under sub-section 3 (2) (d) allowing the foreign plaintiff to enforce his foreign judgment to the extent specified in the order. Sub-section 4 (2) provides for recovery back in the situation where there has been no previous Australian or any overseas enforcement has not exceeded the reduced amount in which case the recovery back is limited to the amount by which the enforcement exceeds the reduced amount. Sub-section 4 (3) provides for the situation where the previous enforcement of the judgment had already exceeded that reduced amount, in which case the amount that can be recovered back under a later foreign enforcement is the amount in excess of the reduced amount. Sub-section 4 (4) describes the prescribed persons who are able to take advantage of the cause of action being created by sub-sections 4 (1), (2) and (3). These are Australian citizens, companies incorporated or deemed incorporated under a law of a State or Territory or governments or governmental authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to bodies corporate, sub-section 4 (5) allows bodies corporate related to the body corporate mentioned in sub-section 4 (4) to have the same right of recovery back as is available to the body corporate mentioned in sub-section 4 (4). Sub-section 4 (6) provides that where there is more than one prescribed person with the right to recovery back, any one of those prescribed persons may institute proceedings for recovery back. Sub-section 4 (7) provides that where a number of prescribed persons bring an action in respect of a cause of action arising under sub-sections 4 (1), (2) and (3) and the defendant to those proceedings has been adjudged liable to pay an amount to those prescribed persons, then the defendant will be under no further liability in relation to those proceedings. Sub-sections 4 (8), (9) and (10) confer jurisdiction on the Federal Court of Australia to hear and determine proceedings arising under sub-sections 4 (1), (2) and (3). Sub-section 4 (11) provides a limitation period for the institution of proceedings for the recovery back provided by the Bill. In relation to each overseas enforcement of the foreign judgment that limitation period is three years from the date of the overseas enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 6 provides a new section 5 (1) which allows for the enforcement of a judgment under that Bill in a foreign country which has a law corresponding to that contained in the Bill where a reciprocity agreement has been entered into between Australia and that other country. Sub-section 5 (2) provides that the enforcement of a judgment of a foreign country under a corresponding law to that contained in the Bill will only be allowed in Australia where the Attorney-General has, by order in writing, declared that judgment to be enforceable in Australia. Sub-section 5 (4) provides that an order under sub-section 5 (2) shall, as is the case with orders under the Act generally, be laid before each House of the Parliament. Sub-section 5 (5) provides that where an order has been laid down before each House of the Parliament and neither House has within 15 sitting days passed a resolution disapproving the order, a copy of the order shall be published in the Gazette and the order becomes effective from the date of publication. Sub-section 5 (6) provides that where an order under sub-section 5 (2) is in force, a judgment, or a certified copy, may be filed in the Federal Court after which it may be enforced as if it was a final judgment of the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I conclude by a quotation from an address on this subject given by a former United States Attorney-General, Mr Griffin Bell, on 8 August 1977. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Comity is a very small word that stands for a very large principle. Comity is a way of saying fair play-that each of two parties will yield to the one which has interests that are clearly paramount. It is a word signifying a concern for common decency in conduct towards others. Where conflicts arise between sovereigns, the sovereigns have an obligation to resolve the conflict with restraint, co-operation and good will. That is the essence of comity . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I believe-the Government believes-in every word of that. In that statement lies the solution of our differences. In the meantime, I introduce this measure. It is defensive; it is necessary. I regret the need for it. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will update and revise all existing Australian law relating to the counterfeiting of currency-both domestic and foreign-and Commonwealth and foreign Government bonds and other forms of securities. It will also create offences in relation to reproduction of Australian paper money and prescribed securities. This legislation, when in operation, will also enable Australia to accede to the International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency, which was opened for signature at Geneva on 20 April 1929. </PARA>
<PARA> The International Convention was made under the auspices of the Council of the League of Nations at Geneva in 1929. By a resolution of the United Nations General Assembly in November 1963 any member of that body may accede to the Convention. In all some 70 countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, France, West Germany and Switzerland, are now bound by the Convention. Australia has been unable to accede to the Convention because of hitherto inadequate legislation which has not enabled Australia to reciprocate the protection afforded to Australian currency by a large number of member countries of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Convention seeks to ensure the prevention and punishment of offences relating to the counterfeiting of currency wherever those offences may be committed. The Convention is aimed particularly at counterfeiting operations involving more than one country; suppression of operations of this nature could, in the absence of international agreement, be hindered by national boundaries. Under the Convention, each state party undertakes to provide appropriate protection against the counterfeiting of domestic and foreign currency. Before becoming a party to the Convention, each party must ensure that its legislation and its administrative organisation conform with the rules of the Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> There are significant inadequacies in present Commonwealth and State law dealing with counterfeiting of currencies, both Australian and foreign. It would not be appropriate to describe these inadequacies in detail but, by way of example, I refer to Part IV of the Crimes Act 1914 dealing with counterfeiting of coins. The prohibition on counterfeiting of current coin is limited to coins that have been coined in a mint in any part of the Queen's dominions or that are lawfully current in any part of the Queen's dominions. These provisions would obviously not fulfil the obligations arising under the Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> National legislation concerning the counterfeiting of government securities was urged in a resolution passed in 1969 in Mexico City at the 5th Conference of the International Criminal Police Organization-Interpol. The Government sees merit in this recommendation and accordingly counterfeiting of both foreign and domestic government bonds and other securities, while not covered by the Convention, are dealt with in the present Bill. Australian experience has disclosed weaknesses in the laws relating to the reproduction of coins of numismatic interest-for example-in relation to the reproduction of the Spanish coins known as 'Holey Dollars'-and we consider that the opportunity should be taken to deal with these problems in the legislation now introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, there can be few more important objects of legislation than protection of the currency of the nation. This is the primary purpose of the present Bill. Until now, law enforcement bodies dealing with currency frauds have had to apply piecemeal pieces of legislation, both Commonwealth and State; these have not given full satisfactory protection to Australian currency and often no protection at all to the currencies of other nations. Adequate protection will now be provided by one comprehensive piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the Bill will affect all sections of the community, the Government proposes that the Bill should lie before the Parliament until the Budget session to enable it to be adequately studied and interested parties to supply comments, if they so wish. It is also the Government's intention that the legislation will not be brought into force until the expiration of at least three months after passage. This will allow the community to become acquainted with its terms and persons in possession of articles contravening its provisions to surrender them to the authorities. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to set aside any doubt as to the Commonwealth's right to title and possession of the Mudginberri and Munmarlary pastoral leases in the Northern Territory. These properties were acquired by compulsory process under the Lands Acquisition Act 1955 on 23 June 1978. The chief provisions of the Bill are:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Clause 4 is designed to put beyond any legal doubt that the Mudginberri and Munmarlary leases are vested in the Commonwealth and that the Commonwealth is entitled to immediate possession of the lands. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Clause 10 preserves the right of the former lessees to claim compensation for interests in the land under the same terms as when land is acquired under the Lands Acquisition Act 1955. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Clause 14 is intended to ensure that this Act does not affect the rights of the former lessees to contest the validity of the original acquisition in 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Other clauses are of a machinery nature and are generally self-explanatory. </PARA>
<PARA>Leasehold interests in the Mudginberri and Munmarlary pastoral leases were, prior to 1978, vested in two companies. In 1977 the Government adopted the recommendation of the Fox Report on the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry that the lands be included in the proposed Kakadu National Park. At that time it was also recognised that the lands could become the subject of Aboriginal land claims. Honourable senators will be aware that a claim is, in fact, currently under consideration by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner, Mr Justice Toohey, in relation to lands in the Alligator Rivers, Stage II region which incorporates the Mudginberri and Munmarlary leases. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth offered in early 1978 to acquire the leases but it was not possible to reach agreement on the amount of compensation. The leases were compulsorily acquired on 23 June 1978, however the companies holding the leases have contested the validity of that acquisition and further attempts to reach a voluntary settlement have so far failed. So long as these two leases are held, or appear to be held, by the companies, the Government is inhibited in giving effect to policies which relate to future activities in the Alligator Rivers Region. </PARA>
<PARA> The former lessees have instituted proceedings in the Supreme Court in the Northern Territory to challenge the validity of the Commonwealth's acquisition of the leases. The Bill now before honourable senators would give the Commonwealth title and right to immediate occupation of the leases but at the same time ensure that the rights of the former lessees to continue to contest the validity of the original acquisition is in no way affected. The Bill also provides for any compensation to persons who had interests in the acquired lands to be paid on just terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will appreciate that the determination of validity of the original acquisition as well as negotiations on compensation could be very protracted issues. It is the view of the Government that these matters should not prejudice or delay the determination of the Aboriginal land claim in the Alligator Rivers Region which is required in order that Government policies relating to establishment of the Kakadu National Park and mineral development can be implemented. The Government has therefore decided that it is appropriate that legislation be passed to ensure the Commonwealth's right to title and immediate possession of the Mudginberri and Munmarlary pastoral leases. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Government's decision to provide bounty assistance to the production in Australia of certain yarns. The decision to adopt this form of assistance follows the Government's consideration of the recommendations by the Industries Assistance Commission contained in its report No. 240 of 30 April 1980 entitled 'Textiles, Clothing and Footwear'. </PARA>
<PARA> This bounty proposal is part of the Government's broader program designed to encourage the development of a more efficient industry structure for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. It will also provide substantial benefits for industries using bountiable yarns in manufacturing textiles or textile products. User industries will benefit from reduced costs of material inputs and greater flexibility of sourcing. To this end the proposal is in agreement with the broad objectives of the Industries Assistance Commission's recommendation. The Bill provides for the bounty to be payable to producers of most yarns at rates calculated as specified percentages of the value added to the yarns, on a factory cost basis, in their production. The yarns eligible for the bounty are specified in clause 2 of the Bill and the rates of bounty proposed for each type of yarn are specified in clause 6 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government in August last year established the bounty rate for several yarn types, including yarns spun on the cotton system, at 33 per cent. Following extensive discussions with industry sectors, and based on an assessment of up to date information, it has become apparent that assistance for cotton system spun yarns at this level would be likely to result in a degree of disruption that could not have been foreseen at the time the Government took its original decision, particularly in some regional locations. For this reason the Government has decided to set the bounty rate for these products at 43 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> From 1 January 1982 imported yarns similar to the bountiable yarns will be quota free and subject only to minimum rates of duty. Wool carpet yarns and yarns for handcrafting and sewing thread will not be eligible for the bounty. Sewing threads and hand craft yarns are to be assisted by import duties from 1 January 1982. The processes and expenditures eligible for bounty are specified in clauses 2 and 3 of the Bill. In general the 'additional value' provision excludes materials such as fibres and polymers, dyes, yarn additives and some packaging materials. It also excludes other costs such as general administration, selling and distribution. </PARA>
<PARA> The bounty scheme is to operate for a period of seven years from 1 January 1982, and it is estimated that bounty payments during that period will be $47m for 1981-82 and $71m per annum thereafter. Bounty eligibility will be restricted to yarns produced in premises registered under this Act and used in registered textile factories. Textile factories will be treated as registered for the purposes of the bounty scheme if used for the commercial manufacture of textile products and if registered as a factory under a State or internal Territory law. In the case of internal Territories which do not have laws suitable for these purposes, buildings used for the commercial manufacture of textile products and approved by the Comptroller-General of Customs will be recognised as registered factories. The Government expects that the assistance proposed by this Bill will encourage further improvements in the efficiency of this industry, reductions in cost, and responsiveness to changing consumer needs. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition proposes to move an amendment to the Bill in respect of clause 5. It concerns the composition of the Gaming and Liquor Authority. Honourable senators will have noticed that the new Authority is proposed to consist of five members including a chairman and a deputy chairman with no specific membership qualifications being prescribed. No doubt honourable senators, with the close attention they have given to this measure, will have noticed also that the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) in his second reading speech indicated that as a practical matter he would, because of the important community implications of the Authority's activities, include a member of the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly and a legal practitioner. It is the view of the Opposition that Mr Hodgman's promises in this respect would be a little more satisfactorily embalmed for posterity were they to have statutory force. It is our proposition that there ought to be not just one but two members of the Authority who are persons nominated by the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly. The amendment proposed by the Opposition to clause 5 is to ensure that result insofar as it proposes that sub-clause (1) of clause 5 be left out and in its place the words included in the amendment be inserted. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> '(1) The Authority shall consist of 3 members appointed by the Minister and 2 Members who are members of, and nominated by, the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly constituted by the House of Assembly Ordinance 1936 of the Australian Capital Territory as amended.'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not accept the amendment. The amendment is unacceptable for two reasons. Firstly, it reduces the size of the Authority from five members to three. The Government believes that an Authority comprised of three part time members would be unable to carry out satisfactorily the work load associated with the running of the Australian Capital Territory Totalisator Agency Board, liquor licensing and poker machine control. The new Authority will carry out a wide range of functions and will be required to act in a quasi-judicial role in relation to both liquor and poker machine matters. It will have a wide range of administrative functions as well and will be responsible for significant staffing and funding matters. Secondly the amendment is unacceptable on the ground that it would require that two of the members of the Authority be nominated by the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly; that is, out of those three members two would be from the House of Assembly. Senator Evans pointed out that in the second reading speech of the Minister for the Australian Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) the Minister said that out of five members to be appointed one would be from the House of Assembly and the other a legal practitioner. The appointment of one member from the Assembly is consistent with the present appointment made to the Australian Capital Territory Liquor Licensing Board and the Poker Machine Licensing Board. Only one member of those Boards is a member of the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly. Clearly, if the Government were to allow the Authority to be comprised of only three members, two of whom would come from the House of Assembly, it would lead to a situation in which the House of Assembly would in effect exercise executive function. Such functions are clearly beyond the purely advisory role which the House of Assembly presently enjoys. Of course, that is consistent with the argument in relation to the second reading amendment moved by Senator Evans last night. I am sure that honourable senators will recall the referendum held in the Australian Capital Territory in 1978 when residents decisively rejected a proposal that the House of Assembly be given either legislative or executive powers.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The response of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) seems to have been founded on a quite bizarre misapprehension as to what in fact is being proposed by the Opposition. It is no part of our intention to reduce the total membership of the Authority from five to three. If the Minister will perhaps look again at the text of the Opposition amendment he will see that we proposed that the Authority should consist of three members appointed by the Minister and two members who are nominated by and members of the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly. I appreciate that the Minister, in his previous incarnation, was an accountant and accordingly cannot entirely be relied upon to get his arithmetic completely straight, but I would have thought that it would not be beyond the wit or resources even of a front bench member of the present Fraser Administration to be able to add up three and two and reach the conclusion that the total is, in fact, five! There is no question of executive functions being superseded by Australian Capital Territory nominees swamping the membership of the Authority in question. Perhaps the Minister could, with this important measure, take another gulp at answering the Opposition's objection and indicate to us how his objections stand up if that particular premise on which his reply was founded is in fact altered.</PARA></TALK.START>

I must admit that, when I was given the responsibility to speak on electoral matters on behalf of my party, I did not at that stage consider that my jurisdiction extended beyond rather radical changes in the Commonwealth Electoral Act and electoral procedures in our country. But, having had some matters brought to my attention as a result of two deputations by constituents, there is a matter I wish to raise now because it shows that there are wider implications in respect of matters conducted by the Australian Electoral Office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Several weeks ago, some constituents interviewed me about what appeared to be a serious conspiracy against certain Australian Labor Party members in the leadership of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union. At first glance, these matters appeared to be related only to the matters they had raised with me. Subsequently, further information came into my possession. The issues involve an apparent attempt to set up the present officials of that union-the President and Secretary-and a manipulation of postal ballots in respect of that union which are conducted by the Australian Electoral Officer in New South Wales. I am concerned because these allegations suggest grave improprieties by certain law officers and grave irregularities by one or two persons in the post office. The allegations confirm that attempts are being made by unscrupulous persons to unduly influence ballot results in certain selected trade union elections. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned too at suggestions which show that there is a concerted move by some elements in New South Wales to provide money and resources to undermine the leadership in a wide variety of union ballots taking place this year. This interference affects the proper functioning of unions not only in my own State but also in the State of Victoria. I have sought political and legal advice about the documents which I will seek leave to incorporate in Hansard. I have had discussions with the officers concerned and, consequently, I believe there are compelling reasons for me to raise with the appropriate Minister the possibility of an inquiry into the seriousness of the matters placed before me by the constituents. These matters fall into several categories. They are, firstly, a conspiracy against officers of a union; secondly, interference in Commonwealth electoral ballots for union elections; thirdly, the availability of large sums of money to defeat sitting union officials; and, fourthly, interference in internal affairs of selected unions by unauthorised persons. I wish now to elaborate. I was handed a photostated leaflet headed 'Attention: Telecom Members'. I seek leave to have this document incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>ATTENTION: TELECOM MEMBERS</PARA>
<PARA> The documents you will find attached to this covering note are of grave concern to our Union. The two documents, one an affidavit from the Vice President of our Union, Frank King, and an 'advising' outlining a process of obstructing the Union officers, demonstrates clearly that there is a substantial plot to undermine the effectiveness of your Union. </PARA>
<PARA> The tragedy of this situation is that it comes at a time when the officers of the Union are determined to oppose in the strongest way possible the outrageous cuts initiated by the Fraser 'Razor Gang'. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not intend to summarise these two crucial documents. The facts stand for themselves. We urge you to read these documents and make up your own mind.</PARA>
<PARA> To us what is contained in these documents represents a most serious undermining of Union leaders that we have heard of in many years and a complete breach of ethical behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> A campaign of obstruction designed to reduce the effectiveness of leaders of the Union bears close resemblance to CIA activities in Chile and other countries. All fair minded unionists cannot tolerate them. </PARA>
<PARA> We call upon you to join with us in demanding that outside forces leave our Union alone, and that the few individuals who are obstructing our leaders immediately cease this anti Union behaviour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall just briefly refer to the documents handed to me which include an affidavit from the Vice-President of this union and an advising by two legal officers. The legal advisings show a process by which union officials can be undermined and how the union can be effectively undermined as well. The document reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The tragedy of this situation is that it comes at a time when the officers of the Union are determined to oppose in the strongest way possible the outrageous cuts initiated by the Fraser 'Razor Gang'. </PARA>
<PARA>This leaflet handed to me by the constituents has attached to it two legal advisings and the affidavit which is signed by the union official concerned, Mr Frank King of 34 Salsoe Street, Mayfield, New South Wales. In the affidavit, he states:</PARA>
<PARA> I, Frank King of 34 Salsoe Street, Mayfield in the State of New South Wales, Union Officer, being duly sworn make oath and say as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. In late 1979 I, together with Joe Kanan, Paul Watson, Barry Polson and John Wilson had an appointment to meet Mr Brian Wallace, Solicitor partner in McClellands solicitors. </PARA>
<PARA>I say at this point that, whilst that organisation has that name, in no way am I suggesting any impropriety on behalf of the former member of this place or, also, his subsequent partner, Mr Landa. The affidavit continues:</PARA>
<PARA> 2. This meeting arose out of charges that had been laid against Noel Battese and Merv Hawkins alleging misuse of Union funds. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. At that meeting I asked Mr Wallace, the Union Solicitor whether it was possible to use those charges that had been laid to have Mr Hawkins and Mr Battese removed from Office. </PARA>
<PARA>The affidavit went on. That statement sets out the means and the processes by which Mr Hawkins, the Secretary of the union, will be given such a work load that it will be impossible for him to carry out that work load and make decisions of the union and, as a consequence, charges would be laid against him for dereliction of duty. What is particularly disturbing is that Mr Wallace, the law officer concerned, is, in fact, the union's solicitor. It would appear on the basis of this affidavit and the subsequent advising that he did conspire with a section of the union to undermine and thus cause charges to be laid against the State Secretary of that union which means, of course, that there is a conflict of duty. Subsequently, Mr Hawkins, who is a member of my party's administrative committee in New South Wales, was charged along the lines I have referred to. </PARA>
<PARA> Coupled with this affidavit and its grave implications is a legal advising by Mr Garry Johnson, barrister, obtained by Mr Wallace and dated, I believe, either 17 January 1980 or 17 December 1980. As I have said, coupled with this affidavit and its grave implications is a legal advising setting out the charges in the form in which action was subsequently taken. It shows not only that Mr Johnson was briefed to frame Mr Hawkins in the document but also that he prepared the charges. Of course, both these gentlemen are legally involved in this matter. I understand that the matter has been brought to the attention of the Law Society of New South Wales. The fact that they, as official union solicitors, set out to advise a small opposition group in the union shows the extent to which actions can be taken to undermine the effectiveness of a particular union and also to cause grave difficulties for an elected official. I seek leave to have these documents incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>AFFIDAVIT</PARA>
<PARA> I, FRANK KING of 34 Salsoe Street, Mayfield, in the State of New South Wales, Union Officer, being duly sworn make oath and say as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. In late 1979 I, together with Joe Kanan, Paul Watson, Barry Polson and John Wilson had an appointment to meet Mr Brian Wallace, Solictor partner in McClellands solicitors. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. This meeting arose out of charges that had been laid against Noel Battese and Merv Hawkins alleging misuse of Union funds. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. At that meeting I asked Mr Wallace, the Union Solicitor whether it was possible to use those charges that had been laid to have Mr Hawkins and Mr Battese removed from Office. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Mr Wallace suggested that this would have to be done in other ways. This suggestion was then discussed generally by those present, in order to find a way to proceed against Mr Hawkins and Mr Battese. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. It was then agreed that Mr Hawkins should be requested to give written reports to the State Executive on the various contentious matters within the State Executive at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. The people at the meeting agreed that because of Mr Hawkins large workload as Branch Secretary, it would not be possible for him to handle a request to produce written reports and that the situation would therefore arise that he would be unable to comply with a lawful direction of the State Executive. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. Mr Wallace advised that this was the only way in which Mr Hawkins' position could be attacked. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. It was also agreed by those present that if Mr Hawkins could be given an impossible workload this might cause him to make mistakes or to inadvertently breach Union rules. Charges could then be laid so as to discredit or expel Mr Hawkins. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. Mr Wallace advised the meeting that this course of conduct would apparently be in accordance with the Union rules. The State Executive would be able to request the tabling of the reports required of Mr Hawkins. If Mr Hawkins was unable to produce such reports, as those present thought that he would be unable to do, then charges could be laid against him after the State Executive had noted that the reports were not available. This could then be used as a basis for charges in order to attempt to expel Mr Hawkins. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. Mr Wallace was present throughout these discussions and participated in them. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. The persons present at that meeting also agreed that the magazine 'Communicate' which was the magazine of the New South Wales Branch should be used to the electoral advantage of Messrs Watson, Kanan, Chalker, Staines, Sheppherd and King. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. Mr Wallace suggested that prominence be given to photographs of these people and that articles be written so as to gain the maximum publicity for these people for electoral advantage in the September 1981 elections for the State Branch of the Union. This was agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA> 13. If was further discussed and agreed at that meeting that Mr Hawkins and Mr Battese be given as little publicity as possible in the magazine. </PARA>
<PARA> 14. It was agreed that by increasing Mr Hawkins' workload to an impossible level and by mentioning his name and using his photograph as little as possible in the Union magazine this would create the impression that Mr Hawkins was unable to do his job properly and further that he would be unable to represent the membership of the Union effectively. He would then appear to be ineffective and incompetent. </PARA>

<PARA>. . . . J.P.  A Justice of the Peace</PARA>
<PARA>ADVICE</PARA>
<PARA>APTU Hawkins and financial state of NSW Branch</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> 1. I have read the minutes of the Federal Executive of the Union (14.10.80 last) and note especially items 170, 186 and 188. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. I am still of the opinion that the State Executive should take hold of the matter in the following manner:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Proceed to charge Mr Hawkins with neglect of duty and to deal with the charges according to the Rules. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. As for the Report of the Accountant into the running of the NSW Branch, they should be distributed to the NSW membership with an unofficial circular explaining and pointing out certain matters. I have attached a draft circular.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. As far as the laying of, and the hearing of charges against any person the procedure is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) A charge is laid by a member of the Union pursuant to Rule 56 (i) for one or a number of offences. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) The charge (a) should be made in writing to the Secretary. </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) The State Executive should then resolve to summon the member charged. </PARA>
<PARA> (iv) The summons (this is merely in non-legal terms) should be in writing, should state the time and place of the hearing, the name of the person laying the charge and the substance of the charge (i.e. what he has been charged with under 56 (i) and brief particulars.)</PARA>
<PARA> (v) The person charged should be given reasonable notice of the hearing i.e. 21 or 28 days. </PARA>
<PARA> (vi) If he requests further particulars then (within reason) he should be supplied with such. </PARA>
<PARA> (vii) The State Executive then has the power to hear and determine the matters: Rule 56 (iii). </PARA>
<PARA> (viii) At the time and place appointed the charges may be investigated. The person charged shall generally be given an opportunity to defend himself, call witnesses, tender written submissions. </PARA>
<PARA> (ix) At the hearing before the State Executive the procedure as outlined in Rule 56 (x) must be followed to the letter. </PARA>
<PARA> (x) The hearing may be adjourned to another time and place if not completed. The person charged must be notified of such adjournment: see Rule 56 (1v). </PARA>
<PARA> (ix) After the hearing of the matter the State Executive shall decide whether the person charged is guilty of the charges laid. If so, the State Executive then has the power to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) fine him: see 56 (v) (a)</PARA>
<PARA> (b) If he holds office, remove him from office if he has been guilty of misappropriation of funds of the union or substantial breach of the rules or gross misbehaviour or gross neglect of duty: see 56 (v) (6)</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Expel him from the Union: see 56 (v) (6)</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Suspend him from membership. </PARA>
<PARA> 5 As I read the Accountant's Report the following conclusions are reached:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Sub-standard keeping of Records (P2-item 101)</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Use of election funds to cover shortfalls in postage funds (Pw-item 105)</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Deficiencies in warrants to pay (P3-item 106)</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Inadequate records for loss of time and travelling expenses (PP4/6-item 202)</PARA>
<PARA> (v) Insurance quotation (P7-item 206)</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) N.S.W. Branch contributions to Head Office (PP7/8-items 207/208)</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) Furniture removal expenses (P8-item 210)</PARA>
<PARA> (viii) Travelling expenses to Queensland for Batesse (P11-item 213E)</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Ace Service Co. (P9-item 212)</PARA>
<PARA> (xx) Travelling expenses to Perth for Batesse contrary to Federal Executive Resolution (P11-213F)</PARA>
<PARA> (xi) Transaction concerning computer installation (P14-items 311/313)</PARA>
<PARA>Further matters concern requests at Executive meetings in 1980 for information relating to accounts which have not been supplied. </PARA>
<PARA> 6 It seems to me that Hawkins activity and duties comes within the following Rules:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Keep a correct account of all money's received and expended: Rule 59. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Not to appropriate the funds of the Union for any purpose except in accordance with Rules, Resolutions and minutes: Rule 59. </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Produce Bank passbook for inspection at State Executive meetings when requested: Rule 59. </PARA>
<PARA> (iv) He shall keep a separate account for money's owing to Head Office: Rule 59 and Rule 17. </PARA>
<PARA> (v) He shall have books ready to hand over to Branch when requested: Rule 59.</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) He shall act according to instructions of State Executive Rule 59. </PARA>
<PARA> (vii) He shall answer all correspondence and answer such questions etc: Rule 59. </PARA>
<PARA> (viii) Keep memo book and insert date of postage: Rule 59. </PARA>
<PARA> (ixx) Enter in account book detailed account of money's received and expended: Rule 59. </PARA>
<PARA> (xx) He shall be responsible for all funds and property of Branch: Rule 59. </PARA>
<PARA> (xxi) He shall act as directed by State Executive: Rule 59. </PARA>
<PARA> 7 I have not been briefed fully with the information concerning the above duties. However, it seems to me the procedure should be adopted:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) A member of the Union should lay charges against Hawkins. The charges should be in the form as per attached draft. The person laying the charges should probably be a member of the State Executive and as such he will not be able to participate in any way with events leading up to the hearing nor the voting itself. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) The matter should come before the State Executive and the procedure as outlined above should be adhered to strictly. </PARA>

<PARA> Letter to be sent to Hawkins as Secretary/Treasurer in the following terms</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> As a financial member of the Union holding ticket number I write to state that I am formally laying charges against you for failing to properly perform your duties as Branch Secretary /Treasurer of the New South Wales Branch of the Union. I forthwith charge you as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Failing to observe certain Rules of the Union in your capacity as Branch Secretary/Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Knowingly failing to comply with certain Resolutions of Federal Executive and State Executive. </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Obstructing and unreasonably failing to assist certain officers in the course of their duties. </PARA>
<PARA> (iv) After having been reasonably requested to assist failing to assist the State Executive of the N.S.W. Branch in the performance of their functions. </PARA>
<PARA> (v) Failing to report to the State Executive or member he believed in and has been guilty of a breach or breaches of the Rules. </PARA>
<PARA> (vi) Aiding and encouraging members and certain officers in offences under the Rules of the Union. </PARA>
<PARA>The rules I rely upon in support of the above alleged offences are both singularly and/or collectively Rules 10, 15, 21A, 22, 49 and 59. </PARA>
<PARA> Should these alleged offences be dealt with (in accordance with the Rules and procedure) by the State Executive, I will be ready to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also sent copies of this correspondence to the President of the New South Wales Branch of the Union and the Assistant Secretary. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours faithfully,</PARA>
<PARA>DRAFT CIRCULAR TO MEMBERS</PARA>
<PARA>Dear member;</PARA>
<PARA> This circular is sent to you as a member of the N.S.W. Branch of the APTU so that you are aware, as you are entitled to be, of the financial position of the N.S.W. Branch of your Union. </PARA>
<PARA> On 3 October 1980, a firm of Chartered Accountants on instructions from the Federal Executive of the Union prepared and submitted a Report on the financial operation of the NSW Branch. Specific mention was made of the period Oct (1978)-November (1979) before the last State Executive elections. </PARA>
<PARA> If the facts contained in this report are correct (and there is no reason to doubt the integrity of those investigating) it shows that the current leadership of the NSW Branch have a lot to answer. </PARA>
<PARA> To give just three (3) examples. The summary of the findings of the Chartered Accounts was ''that Generally the Standard of Record keeping maintained by the New South Wales branch is not at the level we consider adequate for an operation with an annual turnover approximately $1 million'' and ''we have observed many cases of expenditure incurred without documentary evidence being present in the files.'' Further ''we feel that the apparently casual way payments are made may not be unconnected with the growth in expenses. Because of the quality of the Branch's Records, we feel it is difficult to be certain that all money has been correctly and productively spent for the benefit of the membership as a whole.''</PARA>
<PARA> Concerning specific examples you should be aware that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) That a computer purchased in May 1977 for $62,409 as at Oct 1980 was not operational and providing no benefits at all to Union members. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Travelling expenses reimbursed to President Batesse when Federal Executive resolved no expenses to be reimbursed. </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Sub-standard keeping of important necessary accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Use of election funds to cover shortfalls in postage fund. </PARA>
<PARA> (v) Deficiencies in the expenditure records of the union. </PARA>
<PARA> (vi) Inadequate records for loss of time and travelling expenses. </PARA>
<PARA> (vii) Payments of fire insurance premiums some 40 per cent above average quotes. </PARA>
<PARA> (viii) Breaches of the Union Rules. </PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Payments to individuals and companies allegedly doing work for the Union who cannot be contacted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In these documents is a circular drawn up by Mr Johnson to be sent to all members of the union in order to denigrate the elected Secretary of the union. The tragic part of this incident is that the events predicted in the original documents did, in fact, take place and charges were laid against Mr Hawkins and Mr Battese. They were charged before their peers in the State branch and the charges were later dropped. They were not proceeded with at that level because another union ballot took place which, to some extent, altered the balance of power in that union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, similar charges were laid at the federal level. I am informed that charges against the State President, Mr Battese, and the State Secretary, Mr Hawkins, were dealt with at a meeting of the federal executive of the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union. I am happy to advise the Senate that this body, under the leadership of a colleague and friend of mine, Mr George Slater, did not, I believe, on the basis of the matters I have raised, proceed to deal with the defendants by way of suspension or expulsion. I am concerned that, on prima facie evidence, Mr Wallace and Mr Johnson did conspire with and give advice to a dissident element in the union to discredit and to expel two properly elected officials. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal with some of the other grave irregularities that seem to have occurred in this union's elections which are, after all, conducted by the Australian Electoral Office. I do so because I think we have to recognise that, in the changed world of today, we need to have some regard to how we can tighten up the procedures in respect of Commonwealth electoral ballots. I have been advised that in respect of an election conducted by the Australian Electoral Officer for positions in the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union, both Federally and in New South Wales, there occurred an example of how easy it is for unscrupulous persons to interfere seriously with a postal ballot. The ballot I am referring to was conducted during September 1979. In this instance it occurred at a medium sized post office outside the Sydney metropolitan area. It involved the illegal seizure of some 380 ballot papers by an official of the New South Wales branch of the union and a candidate who at this stage I would prefer to leave unnamed. When ballot papers are addressed to each financial member and are despatched by the Commonwealth Electoral Office they inevitably arrive at the appropriate suburban or country post offices for distribution to the members at their various addresses. What then happened in this case was that the official and the candidate took steps to get into the post office and take out the 380 envelopes containing ballot papers. They then proceeded to open them and, in the presence of others, filled them in to suit this person's candidacy. I am informed that through this gross interference they were able to alter the overall result of that union election. Consequently, these matters were raised at a meeting of that union and the resolution passed at that meeting states in part:</PARA>
<PARA> That this general meeting wishes to express its outrage at the recent physical assault carried out on NSW ALP member, Peter Baldwin. We also wish to express our disquiet regarding rumours circulating that criminal elements may have succeeded in infiltrating sections of the Labor Party in this State and that these criminal elements may have utilised funds gained from their illegal activities in order to attempt to gain influence in or control of this union. </PARA>
<PARA> We therefore request the state secretary to contact the Australian Labor Party to ask them to conduct an investigation into any campaign funds which have been donated to assist any member of this union during the last APTU state and federal elections, bearing in mind that . . . NSW Union organiser for the APTU stated that he had in fact received a large sum of money from a member of Parliament for this very purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> After examining this matter further I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it is possible-indeed probable-that persons are able to interfere seriously in such union elections. It is possible to do it here-it has been done-and it is possible to do it elsewhere. I remind the Senate that in the computer age it is now possible for a well-organised group to get a computer print-out of eligible voters in a union election broken down on a locality basis or even, in built-up areas, on a street-by-street basis. That group can then steal ballot papers from letter boxes, particularly in circumstances where husband and wives are at work, and so unduly affect the result of a union election. </PARA>
<PARA> One cannot say that these matters have very little relevance because in a particular case involving another union, in a judgment handed down in 1974 by Justices Joske, Nimmo and Sweeney which dealt with certain ballot papers and envelopes which were posted to a number of people in Sydney, Justice Joske said:</PARA>
<PARA> In these cases we are satisfied that the offences have been proved beyond reasonable doubt. In each case the defendant visited the home of a member of his union on the day ballot papers for an election of officers of his union could be expected to be received by those members and by various subterfuges he took possession of the mail containing the ballot papers forwarded to those members by the Commonwealth Electoral Office. The defendant was one of a team of candidates opposing the officers in the election. He thus obtained possession of the ballot papers without lawful authority or excuse. His conduct not only deprived the member of his vote but was a fraudulent interference in the election. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 171 of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act makes procedures available for the conduct of union ballots and specifically lays down that no person has the right to collect, personate another person or in any way get possession of a ballot paper other than his own. Of course there are other ways in which postal ballots conducted by the Commonwealth Electoral Office can be corrupted. Some ballot papers in my State are returned undelivered-that is, in 'return to sender' envelopes-to the Darlinghurst Post Office in Sydney. I ask: Is there watertight security as far as these 'return to sender' envelopes are concerned because they contain ballot papers? In this period of great mobility of the work force, as well as the difficulties that ordinary citizens have in rented premises, there is a larger than normal number of 'return to sender' envelopes in every union ballot conducted. Consequently, there needs to be a tightening up of the procedures involving these envelopes. There are also those letters returned to the dead letter offices in each of the capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA> Most disturbing of all is what some persons can do, and have done, in other union elections conducted by the Commonwealth Electoral Office. I believe there is a case for tightening up the conduct of union ballots by the Commonwealth Electoral Office. I assert that there are insufficient safeguards and electoral officers should be directed to ensure that no person other than the legitimate voter votes in union elections. This would involve greater supervision in the distribution of ballot papers to voters and a demand that a certificate be signed by each postmaster concerned stating that ballot papers were duly delivered to the voters and that responsible officers were stationed specifically at the return to sender office and the dead letter office in the respective States. In making these charges I do not want it to be suggested that I believe that employees of Australia Post, perhaps with one or two exceptions, have acted improperly or corruptly in these matters but I do believe a case can be made out that there was some interference in the elections to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA> I now wish to refer to more recent ballots and other corrupt practices that have been brought to my notice I refer to ballots conducted in Victoria by the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union, and the Australian Railways Union's current ballot for officers and to a pending ballot in the New South Wales branch of the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union. I would be the first to acknowledge the need for rank and file members to participate in union affairs. I recognise that apathy is not a good thing for the trade union movement. Members should at all times be encourged to take an active interest in union affairs and to stand for office if they are not satisfied with the conduct of their union. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I regret that there are several disabilities in regard to all of these matters particularly as they relate to standing for office in a union. The particular disadvantage which rank and file unionists have is the inability to raise sufficient funds to post to each voter information in support of their own candidacy. A disquieting feature is the apparent ease with which some candidates are able to get access to large sums of money to push their candidacies. This is of particular concern as large amounts of funds have been shown to be readily available for certain types of candidates in selected unions. I refer to the APTU and a resolution carried by that union at its July meeting. It was mentioned that a sum of $20,000 was available for a ballot. An amount of $20,000 was being made available to a rebel group which lacked any basic rank and file support to raise those sorts of funds. Similarly, in the recent AMSWU Victorian ballot involving the challenge to Mr Jim Roulston, a very well respected official of that union and Federal Vice-President of my party, and Mr Halfpenny, a sum of $10,000 was made available from certain quarters to the challengers in that ballot. I understand that another $10,000 was made available to challengers in the Australian Railways Union election in Victoria and it is claimed that this money is coming from certain circles in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the ballot taking place for the current union elections of the liquor trades union, I accept that there is a measure of discontent by the rank and file of this union because of recent award variations. This has led to some nominations against the sitting officials of that union. However, the relevant fact is that more than 40,000 members of this union are eligible to vote, so the rank and file is up for approximately $10,000 in printing and postage costs just to place themselves before each person who has a right to record a vote. That means that a large sum of money is essential and they need to have access to nominal rolls and printed material. It has been suggested to me that a post-out to every member of that union has occurred. The question must therefore be asked: Where does the $10,000 come from? Did the rank and file contribute to those funds? I have information in my possession which suggests that the substantial funds needed did not come from the rank and file movement. </PARA>
<PARA> I also refer the Senate to an election conducted several years ago by the south coast branch of the Federated Ironworkers Association. It was established that unauthorised persons had taken envelopes and ballot papers out of individual letter boxes belonging to the financial members of that organisation and that as a result an official complaint was referred to the Attorney-General but no prosecution or action followed. If people set themselves a task of taking letters out of letter boxes when persons are at work it is, of course, very difficult to establish later on that that process took place, even though it may be obvious that it did take place. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to these cases not in any way to further the difficulties of the unions, but rather to bring them to the attention of the Senate and simply to show the Senate and the public at large, including unionists, how easy it is for individuals to interfere with the democratic right of members properly to vote in the process of electing their officials. When we are talking of such large sums of money, we have to ask where the money is coming from. It has been suggested to me that it is coming from certain sources in New South Wales, that there is plenty of money available for certain types of campaigns and candidates. It has been suggested to me further that the money comes from a number of sources-firstly, from employers who are interested in the result of union ballots because of the militancy that might be pursued by the officials of the particular union involved. I say to persons who hold different points of view, even within the labour movement itself, that union officials come under threat of undue interference by outside forces. The money comes from persons associated with gambling syndicates in New South Wales. It is suggested that it comes from persons who had associations with the now failed Nugan Hand bank. There are, of course, those of us who believe that that organisation was a conduit for Central Intelligence Agency funds in our country. I am pleased to note the response made by Mr Newman to a question in the House of Representatives yesterday. In that response he pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA> Of recent months the Commonwealth directed that the task force--</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the task force established by the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales-</PARA>
<PARA>extend its activities to looking into drug trafficking associated with the Nugan Hand bank and people involved in drug trafficking who may have had associations with the Nugan Hand bank. The work of the task force will take a long time. I am advised that up to 1 May the task force can claim the following achievements . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to speak about the important gains that have been made in breaking up a number of drug syndicates in our country. It has also been suggested to me that certain funds could be made available from from the National Civic Council and from a certain tobacco company. Whilst we all support the democratic right of union members to nominate and become active in union affairs, and whilst we would all want unionists to become active in the internal affairs of their union, there is evidence that a person can get into a post office in a certain manner in order to get his or her hands on ballot papers. Such action, on the information which is available to me, had the effect of completely altering the result of the union election to which I referred earlier. As we know, no more than a few hundred votes were involved in the election that took place in the AMWSU in Victoria recently. If malpractices do occur in union elections they need to be identified and wiped out. We need to establish a much stricter control of the way in which these matters are dealt with by the Australian Electoral Office. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst it is true, as I have said, that when the Senate resumes it will be asked to look at the whole question of electoral matters generally, I must admit that we will also need to look at the way in which safeguards can be written into the Act in order to establish a democratic process whereby no person, other than the individual voters themselves, shall have the right to vote in union elections. As I said at the outset, the case of conspiracy which seems to be evident in the matters involving Mr Hawkins and Mr Battese are serious ones and ones which I hope will occupy the attention of the appropriate Minister. I hope that he will take certain steps to establish the veracity or otherwise of the charges that I have made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity on the first reading of the Income Tax Laws Amendment Bill of raising a matter which I have raised in this Parliament before. I will not take very much of the Senate's time to reinforce the argument I advanced on 24 February when I was speaking to the tabling of the Australian National Railways Commission annual report. In speaking to that report I was very critical of the Australian National Railways for the way in which it handles its passenger bookings. I said that I had run into some difficulties in getting accommodation on the train from Perth and that on my way back from Perth I had spoken to the people who run the train and was informed that because the railways were not taking steps to see that the train was full on every trip dead cars were running on the train and some of the staff had to be paid 60 per cent of their salaries to travel back as passengers. I went on to ask:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why on earth cannot these cars be full? People wanted to get seats on the Indian Pacific or on the Transcontinental but were told no seats were available. </PARA>
<PARA>I went on to say that the railway was not doing its job in promoting the wonderful service it offers. I further said:</PARA>
<PARA> I say the service it offers is second to none anywhere in the world. </PARA>
<PARA>I stick to that statement. During my remarks Senator Jessop interjected:</PARA>
<PARA> You wouldn't know what you are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA>Today I received a letter from a great friend of mine, Mr John Dunnery, who is the Australian Workers Union organiser at Port Pirie in South Australia, where most of the personnel who service these passenger trains live. I am proud to be a member of the AWU. I joined it well over 40 years ago and I am still a financial member. Mr Dunnery wrote to me on 9 June. The letter reads:</PARA>

<PARA>Dear Geoff, Attached please find copy of letter to the ANR from Bill Albough concerning bookings on the Indian Pacific, for your information. </PARA>

<PARA>The letter referred to is a very interesting letter. It backs up to the hilt the complaints I was making in this Parliament on 24 February. The address on the top of the letter is:</PARA>

<PARA>Port Augusta, SA. </PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> I write to acquaint you with an alarming state of affairs in respect to our booking for 21 persons on the Indian Pacific on Sunday 3 May. </PARA>
<PARA> Our original application was declined by your GSA Thomas Cook having been advised by yourselves that the train was 'full'. Our tour being constructed around the Indian Pacific-I was involved in the BBC T.V. series Great Railway Journeys of the World which included 'The Long Straight', the Indian Pacific-I obviously could not accept your answer so long in advance of the date of travel. </PARA>
<PARA> A participant of the English tour working in Rockhampton Queensland contacted the Brisbane office of the Western Australian Tourist Development Corporation, whose Mr Ray Stenhouse contacted various States asking for their help in obtaining seats on the train. I regret to tell you the reply was always 'full'. </PARA>
<PARA> Eventually an impassioned telex to Westrail obtained the seats-imagine our astonishment to discover this departure-</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the train on which they travelled-</PARA>
<PARA>has 113 passengers aboard, whilst 144 is the maximum complement. </PARA>
<PARA> Would you please investigate this matter thoroughly and advise me why we were so misled. Our BBC TV film has been seen on its initial launch by 60,000,000 viewers with further viewings scheduled, including your own State of South Australia. We may need to add a warning: It is impossible to book on this train because its operators mistakenly believe it is full. </PARA>
<PARA> Should you wish to contact me, my group is c/o QUORN 13--</PARA>
<PARA>I take it that is a telephone number at Quorn in South Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>until Friday 8 May, when we join the Indian Pacific again, at Port Augusta. Perhaps you might care to meet me to discuss the matter?</PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely, BILL ALBOUGH Tour Director TEA/BBC TV</PARA>
<PARA>That is a damning letter to have to read into the Hansard record of the Parliament. It backs up the criticism I made of Australian National Railways that it is not doing its best to fill the train. I have spoken to many people who go to tourist agencies and railway offices wanting to book seats on the train and cannot get them, as is borne out in that letter. Recently I asked why the Australian National Railways paid $409,000 to change its name from Australian National Railways to AN, or Australian National. The answer was that this was to promote the railways and give them a logo which people knew about. Yet tourists from the United Kingdom who write many months in advance to book seats on the train are told by the railway authorities that the train is full. The people who work the train repeatedly tell me-they tell John Dunnery, the Australian Workers Union organiser in Port Pirie-that the train is not full and that they are running dead cars. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not take the time of the Senate now, but I will pursue the matter further in the Budget session when we have the appropriations before us. If something is not done I will have a lot to say about it. I hope that the people responsible for handling bookings and allocating seats on the train hurriedly do something about it. I raised the matter on 24 February. The letter I have read was written on 4 May. A great deal of time elapsed between those dates but people still could not get seats on the train. The film which has been made about this great railway has already been shown to 60 million people, and the railway has been publicised at no cost to ANR. But if the BBC does not get a satisfactory answer by the time the film is shown in Australia it may need to add the following warning:</PARA>
<PARA> It is impossible to book on this train because its operators mistakenly believe it is full. </PARA>
<PARA>That will be very damaging to the railways. It is up to the railways to take immediate action and publicise the train, as people in the Soviet Union publicise the Trans-Siberian Railway and as people in Canada publicise the Canadian Pacific. I have been on both those trains, and I can say that the standard of service offered on them, although it is good, does not come up to the standard of the service offered on the Indian Pacific or the Trans-Continental. Yet the people who run our railways are not doing them justice because they are not getting word to all the tourist agencies and bureaus and fully advertising them to see that they have a full complement of passengers. If they do that they will be doing a service not only to this country by promoting tourism but also to the people in Port Pirie and in Parkeston in Western Australia who work on this train. I hope that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) who is in charge of the Senate at the moment, will draw my remarks to the attention of Mr Hunt, the Minister for Transport, so that some remedial action can be taken and we can fill the train every time it runs from the Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bills be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>INCOME TAX LAWS AMENDMENT BILL 1981 This Bill, in terms both of its size and the range of matters it covers, may well be described as an omnibus measure to amend the income tax law. Three of the measures will give effect to policies foreshadowed in the policy speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) for the last election. These are an immediate deduction for capital expenditure on the connection of a business property to mains electricity; a concessional deduction for the cost of insulating a taxpayer's first home; and an immediate deduction for capital expenditure on storage facilities for petroleum fuel. Also included are provisions to give effect to the decision, announced by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) late last year, that tourist buses may qualify for the investment allowance with effect from 1 January 1976. The Bill also contains further amendments to the gift provisions of the income tax law, including some that will give effect to the 1980-81 Budget decision to allow deductions for gifts to certain overseas aid organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> Last, but by no means least in importance, the Bill proposes amendments designed to provide a counter to various forms of tax avoidance. Trust stripping, expenditure recoupment schemes, and exploitation of trading stock transfer provisions and of the tax-exempt status of certain bodies are the avoidance areas covered. Extensive details of most of these changes have already been announced and, relying on that and on the detailed explanations contained in an explanatory memorandum that has been circulated to honourable senators, I propose in this introductory speech to limit myself to the key points. </PARA>
<PARA>Cost of Connection to Mains Electricity</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In this respect the Government is aiming to provide assistance to persons who, particularly in remote areas of Australia, face the often heavy cost of obtaining the facility of a mains electricity supply. Capital expenditure on connecting mains electricity, or upgrading an existing connection, to a property on which a business is carried on is to qualify for deduction in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. Qualifying expenditure will be the capital costs incurred by an owner of the property, or by a lessee or share farmer, in bringing the mains electricity to the point on the property where the supply authority meters consumption. The deduction will be available only where the connection or upgrading is, at least in part, to be used for business purposes in the production of assessable income. The concession will apply to connections or upgradings costs incurred on or after 1 October 1980, irrespective of when contracts were entered into. </PARA>
<PARA> In the form in which the Bill was introduced in the House of Representatives, the concession would have applied to connections or upgradings effected under contracts entered into on or after 1 October 1980. The Bill was amended by the Government in the House of Representatives to delete that qualification in the light of representations to the effect that the former arrangements would have disadvantaged people in rural areas who, after having contracted for supply, may have to wait a considerable period for the connection to be made. I add that the Government is aware that some may see scope in the concession for the inflation of costs so as to benefit the utilities that supply electricity. I give notice now that any action of this kind could very well place the continued availability of the deduction in serious jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA>Home Insulation Costs</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This concession will provide tax assistance to people who take steps that have an effect of reducing energy consumption. It is proposed that an income tax deduction will be allowed for amounts paid by a resident taxpayer for insulating a first home. Amounts paid by a taxpayer for thermal insulation materials and for the cost of their installation in a dwelling are to be an allowable deduction if the dwelling is the sole or principal residence of the taxpayer in Australia. It is a further condition of the deduction that the taxpayer or, in the case of married couples, the taxpayer or his or her spouse, has not previously owned another dwelling in Australia that he or she used as a home. The deduction will be available for insulating a dwelling purchased by the taxpayer on or after 1 October 1980, as well as a dwelling constructed by the taxpayer, where construction started on or after that date. Amounts expended by eligible taxpayers for the insulation of extensions to their dwellings will qualify for the new deduction under corresponding conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>Fuel Storage Facilities</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The third election policy initiative covered by the Bill relates to the capital cost of storage facilities for petroleum-based liquid or gaseous fuel.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will authorise a deduction, by way of a 100 per cent depreciation allowance, in the income year in which the facilities are first used or installed ready for use to produce assessable income. </PARA>
<PARA> The allowance will apply to plant in Australia used wholly and exclusively to store fuel held for use in a business as fuel or as trading stock for disposal. Ancillary plant used wholly and exclusively to convey fuel in and out of storage, or to measure the amount of fuel stored, will qualify. So too will the cost of installation of eligible plant. Storage facilities for crude oil and other fuels being held for further processing will not qualify for the allowance, nor will rail, road or shipping tankers, pipelines or containers for use in the transport of fuel. Expenditure will qualify for the allowance if it is incurred under a contract entered into on or after 1 October 1980 or, if the expenditure is on facilities constructed by the taxpayer, if construction commenced after that date. Facilities that a taxpayer acquired secondhand on or after 1 October 1980 will qualify if used by the taxpayer at a site other than where they were situated at that date. </PARA>
<PARA>Tourist Buses</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that, late last year, legislation was enacted to give effect to the Government's decision to remove the specific exclusion from the income tax investment allowance of plant for use in connection with amusement or recreation. At the time when that legislation, which applies from 1 October 1980, was introduced it was announced that the Government had further decided to permit tourist buses to qualify for the investment allowance as from 1 January 1976, the date of commencement of the allowance. Measures to achieve that result are in this Bill. By these measures, the exclusion that applied for the period between 1 January 1976 and 30 September 1980 of plant for use in connection with amusement or recreation will be treated as not having applied in relation to tourist buses. Buses brought within the scope of the investment allowance by this amendment will, of course, remain subject to the general requirements of the investment allowance provisions. For example, the general exclusion from the allowance of cars and other light vehicles will mean that buses designed to carry fewer than nine passengers will continue to be excluded, as will buses of any size that are hired out on a 'drive-yourself' basis. </PARA>
<PARA>Gifts</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Amendments under this head will extend the existing gift provisions of the income tax law which confer deductions for gifts of the value of $2 or more to specified funds, authorities or institutions in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> One extension will introduce a scheme to authorise deductions for gifts to certain public funds maintained for the relief of persons in developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> That proposal, which has been most warmly received, was announced in the 1980-81 Budget Speech. </PARA>
<PARA> It was supplemented by a ministerial statement on 18 September 1980 which listed 22 organisations that are to qualify for the concession, with effect from that date. The proposed arrangements will accommodate the decisions announced in that statement and, as well, will make provision for further additions to the list of eligible organisations and funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the legislative scheme proposed in the Bill, gifts made to a public fund established by an organisation approved for purposes of the scheme by the Minister for Foreign Affairs may qualify for deduction. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be necessary that the Treasurer be satisfied that a particular fund is for the relief of persons in a country that is certified by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to be a developing country. </PARA>
<PARA> A further requirement is that the Treasurer-by notice published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette-declare the fund to be an eligible fund for purposes of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Generally, gifts to an eligible fund will be deductible from the date of the Gazette declaring its eligibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Transitional arrangements will apply so that gifts made to a fund maintained by one of the 22 organisations nominated in the ministerial statement may qualify for deduction when made after 18 September 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments will mean that gifts to the International Disaster Emergencies Committee Africal Relief Appeal will qualify for deduction when made after 30 June 1980. Further amendments will ensure that deductions are available for gifts to the IDEC Kampuchean relief appeal made after 30 June 1980 when the present authorisation of deductions was to have terminated. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also authorise deductions for gifts to the Herbert Vere Evatt Memorial Foundation made after 16 January 1981, and for gifts made after 23 December 1980 to a public fund that is established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing religious instruction in government schools in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This latter amendment places on a general basis a right of deduction now contained in the law in respect of a limited range of bodies. </PARA>
<PARA>Tax Avoidance</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to remaining provisions of the Bill designed to deal with a variety of income tax avoidance practices. With one qualification that I shall specify later, the amendments have all been foreshadowed in announcements that the Treasurer made last year on 5 March, 24 June and 4 August, and on 30 January this year. With the introduction of this Bill, all proposals for action against specific schemes of tax avoidance foreshadowed in announcements by the Treasurer will have been given legislative form. I also expect that, before the Senate rises for the winter recess, new general anti-avoidance provisions will be brought before the Parliament for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 36A Schemes</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes the amendments foreshadowed in the Treasurer's statement of 30 January 1981. These are designed to provide a counter to tax avoidance schemes that set out to exploit the special provisions of section 36A of the income tax law that apply to changes in interests in trading stock, such as changes that occur on the formation of a partnership. This exploitation takes place under arrangements whereby a person who has, for example, some cattle about to be sold or a crop ready to be harvested, enters into a partnership with a company controlled by the promoter of the scheme. The cattle or the crop, as the case may be, is transferred to the partnership for an amount roughly equivalent to market value. However, a special right of election available under section 36A is used so that the property is treated for tax purposes as having been transferred at the substantially lower tax value at which it would have been brought to account if the transfer had not taken place. The net result is that the former owner realises an amount close to market value of the property, but is taxed only on the substantially lower value. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments proposed will make an election under the section ineffective where the person who disposes of an interest in relevant property receives consideration in respect of the disposal that is substantially more than the amount that might reasonably have been expected if the property had been valued at the low tax value applicable as a result of the election. The consequence of the ineffectiveness of an election in these circumstances will be that the person will be treated as having disposed of the property at its market value. Transfers made in ordinary family or commercial dealings are specifically excluded from the scope of the amendments. These amendments will apply generally to changes in ownership or interests occurring after 30 January 1981. However, consistent with action taken previously by the Government to debar the carry-forward of paper losses resulting from avoidance schemes, the Bill will ban the carry-forward from one year to another of such tax losses resulting from earlier section 36A schemes, with first effect for the income year 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA>Trust Stripping Schemes</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Changes that the Treasurer outlined on 5 March 1980 to deal with variants of the trust stripping arrangements against which remedial legislation was enacted early in 1979 are the next matter covered by the Bill. These arrangements, which sought to free from tax altogether the trading profits and other income of trusts, commonly entailed a specially introduced nominal beneficiary being made presently entitled to income of the trust that was to be stripped. By this means, the trustee was relieved of any tax liability in respect of the trust income. The arrangements were at the same time designed so that not only did the special beneficiary escape tax, but the family from which the income was diverted received the benefit of it in a tax-free capital form. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1979 amendments are contained in section 100A of the Income Tax Assessment Act and operate to treat income to which a beneficiary is nominally made presently entitled under reimbursement arrangements of this type as income of the trust estate to which no beneficiary is presently entitled. The trustee is thus liable to be taxed on the income at the maximum rate of personal income tax, which for 1980-81 is 60 per cent. The variants of the trust stripping arrangements with which this Bill deals exploit the exclusion from the 1979 amendments of income of a trust estate to which a beneficiary becomes presently entitled in the capacity of a trustee of another trust estate. That exclusion was intended to ensure that section 100A would apply only in relation to the last link in a chain of distributions through interposed trusts, thereby removing any possibility of double taxation on income as it passed through the chain. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments now proposed will continue the scheme of applying section 100A to the last nominal beneficiary only, but in a way that aims to prevent the exploitation that has been being experienced. For this purpose, the exclusion from section 100A of income to which a trustee-beneficiary becomes presently entitled is to be limited to so much of that income as is passed on by the trustee as income to which a beneficiary of that trust estate is in turn presently entitled. Further amendments will deny deductions for losses or outgoings incurred under arrangements to which the section applies. This will prevent the section being frustrated through such amounts being available for write-off against other income of the nominal beneficiaries. The amendments will apply generally to trust income paid to, or applied for the benefit of, a beneficiary after 5 March 1980 and to losses or outgoings incurred after that date. </PARA>
<PARA>Expenditure Recoupment Schemes</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Legislation against expenditure recoupment schemes already exists. It was foreshadowed on 24 September 1978 and now applies to a range of losses and outgoings. Broadly, the legislation applies to deny a deduction where the specifically designated loss or outgoing is incurred under an arrangement whereby the taxpayer or an associate obtains a benefit the amount or value of which, together with the tax advantage sought, effectively recoups the claimed loss or outgoing. In a statement on 4 August 1980 the Treasurer foreshadowed action to extend the provisions to deal with variants of the recoupment type schemes that had by then been encountered. These involve paper losses generated in producing or marketing films, in operating gold mines, in purchasing consumable supplies and in carrying out market research. The amendments in respect of these variants are to apply with respect to losses or outgoings incurred after 24 September 1978. The decision to do this follows the clear warning given on that day and repeated subsequently. </PARA>
<PARA> I add that more recent information coming from returns of income for 1979-80 indicates that, before the Treasurer's announcement on 4 August 1980, still further schemes of the expenditure recoupment type had been implemented. As in the case of the schemes referred to in that announcement, it would appear that promoters of the further schemes had chosen to ignore the Government's repeated warnings. In the light of the information now available, and of the clear Government commitment to put an end to expenditure recoupment schemes, the Bill proposes extensions of the existing legislation additional to those already announced by the Treasurer. These latest identified variants against which remedial action is now proposed involve paper losses generated in acquiring a licence under a copyright existing in computer software; by way of commission for collecting assessable income; by way of a fee in relation to the growing, care and supervision of trees; by way of an amount paid in relation to the enhancement of the value of shares held as trading stock; and by way of a fee in relation to the procuring of master sound recordings. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators would be interested to know that one of these schemes-that built on commissions for collecting assessable income-generated identified claims for deductions for 1979-80 of $111m. The additional amendments will also have effect from 24 September 1978. They, and the amendments specifically outlined in the Treasurer's statement of 4 August 1980, will ensure that the ban on the carry-forward from one year to another of paper losses created under tax avoidance schemes, and which at present applies to expenditure recoupment arrangements, will apply similarly in respect of all the latest variants. </PARA>
<PARA>Exempt Bodies</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In a statement on 24 June 1980, the Treasurer foreshadowed legislation on tax avoidance through attempts to exploit the tax-exempt status of various entities. As the Treasurer said at the time, two earlier warnings about the abuse of the privileged status of tax-exempt bodies had gone unheeded, and there was clear evidence that substantial revenue losses were accruing through the use of these bodies as vehicles for diverting taxable income from individuals and companies. The kinds of schemes being employed were outlined in the statement. I do not think it is necessary to describe them in detail again now. Broadly, however, the schemes involved the diversion of income from a person who would otherwise be liable to tax on it to a body that has no tax liability. The exempt body was required to pay to the person from whom the income was diverted, or to an associate of that person, a tax-free consideration equal to the greater part of the diverted income. As a fee for its participation it retained a small amount of the income for its own benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> As mentioned in the Treasurer's statement, the legislation will operate where, under a tax avoidance agreement entered into after 24 June 1980, an exempt body provides consideration for property giving rise to diverted income and the consideration is substantially more than the amount that, in the circumstances, would be paid by a taxable public company. The income derived by the exempt body in these circumstances, without deduction of losses or outgoings incurred under or in connection with the tax avoidance agreement, will be subject to tax at the maximum rate of personal tax. These measures will apply only to income derived by exempt bodies from participation in the particular tax avoidance schemes. Their ordinary income will continue to be exempt from tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the last, and bulkiest, clause of the Bill contains a number of formal amendments, incorporating changes in drafting style. These will result in the adoption, in references to other provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act, of a forward referencing style. Before concluding, I mention that legislation in pursuance of the Government's commitment to provide tax incentives for investment in Australian films is at an advanced stage and will be brought before the Parliament before the winter recess. I commend the present Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>INCOME TAX (DIVERTED INCOME) BILL 1981</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is closely related to measures contained in the Income Tax Laws Amendment Bill 1981, about which I have just spoken. By reason of those measures, income tax is to be charged on income diverted to an exempt body under a tax avoidance arrangement entered into after 24 June 1980. The overall design of the legislation is to counteract the exploitation, for tax avoidance purposes, of the privileged status of tax exempt bodies. This Bill will formally impose tax on the diverted income. The rate of tax of 60 per cent proposed by the Bill is the same as that payable by a trustee of a trust estate on accumulating trust income and is equal to the maximum rate of personal tax. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bills before the Senate are being debated together. The major Bill, the Income Tax Laws Amendment Bill 1981, covers several of the 61 electoral bribes announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his policy speech on 30 September last year. In many cases they were announced right off the top of his head and were either uncosted or dishonestly costed. Many of those bribes took the form of tax concessions. The Bill also covers a couple of minor matters not related to the Prime Minister's policy speech. In this Bill we have examples of both dishonestly costed and uncosted tax concession bribes offered by the Prime Minister in the pre-election period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Specifically, the Bill provides for the cost of connection to electricity mains in rural areas to be immediately and fully deductible from taxable income, for the cost of fuel storage facilities used by business likewise to be fully and immediately deductible from taxable income, and for the cost of insulation of a first home to be deductible from taxable income. Previously, the latter deduction was not available at all, and the costs of electricity connection and fuel storage were deductible at a very much lower rate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides that the investment allowance shall be granted to tourist buses. It seeks to close off some tax avoidance practices, particularly those related to the transfer of stock in such a way as to avoid the payment of tax on the appreciating value or on a growing crop. It also covers some donations to charity. It is ironic, but not unusual, that in the one Bill there is an attempt by the Government to close off loopholes in the Income Tax Assessment Act which have induced tax avoidance and simultaneously to insert a number of tax rorts into the Act which will, of course, in time add to the length and complexity of the Act and provide scope for future tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of universal objections to the use of tax provisions in the way that this Bill uses them. Firstly, tax concessions of this nature, that is, deductions from taxable income, are always regressive. The maximum benefits are gained by people on the highest incomes. The benefit to an individual taxpayer is directly related to the marginal rate of tax being paid. Therefore, inevitably, such concessions are regressive. If tax concessions are to be provided-in the Opposition's view at least insulation of a first home is a cost for which some form of tax concession can be justified-it ought to be provided by way of a flat rate rebate of tax payable which, although it may still have some small element of regressivity in it, is not overtly regressive in the way a taxation deduction provision is. That sort of flat rate rebate, probably at a rate of 32 cents in the dollar, which is the lowest marginal rate, would also have a less distortionary effect on investment decisions than would deductions from taxable income, which can be and usually are related to the highest tax rate of 60 cents in the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, and probably most objectionable of all, once a concession is written into the Act it escapes the annual review or even the notice of Parliament. It is an implicit expenditure of the Commonwealth Government, a hidden subsidy, which continues automatically year after year without anyone having his attention regularly drawn to it and without Parliament having the opportunity to scrutinise it year after year, as it would if the same amount of industry assistance were provided through the appropriations. Thirdly-this is ironic in view of the Government's professed commitment to small government taxation concessions will distort investment priorities and decisions made by individuals. They are one of the manifestations of big government. Implicit in the provision of a taxation deduction for any form of business investment is the belief that government are better able to judge the areas into which business investment should be directed than are individual entrepreneurs guided by pure market forces. </PARA>
<PARA> The penchant of the Prime Minister for providing enormous amounts of hidden assistance to business by way of taxation concessions certainly calls into question his credentials-indeed, those of many of his colleagues-as a disciple of the free enterprise system. I believe that in the case of the Prime Minister at least this would be a completely accurate assessment. The Prime Minister does not believe in market forces. He does not believe in free enterprise. But he uses the rhetoric of a market economy and free enterprise to rationalise an existing distribution of wealth and income which is highly favourable to himself and his class and is therefore wholly acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> The other, and final, objection to all taxation concessions is that they destroy the simplicity of the taxation Act. Probably nobody-certainly very few-really understands the Australian taxation Act. At present it comprises more than 1,000 pages of legalese. It is complex, inconsistent and fairly easily evaded. The ease with which it can be evaded is a function, to a very substantial degree, of its length and complexity as well as an aggregate of decisions by a compliant High Court. Its length and complexity, in turn, are a function of its having been misused for decades as a vehicle to carry electoral bribes offered by an assortment of irresponsible politicians, chief among whom is the present Prime Minister. The reprehensible practice of offering electoral bribes by way of taxation concessions has become cental to his political and economic policies. In the last three years this Government has added more than 300 pages to the Income Tax Assessment Act. This year, with less than half the year gone, it is already in the process of adding another 70 pages. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears that, in the strange mind of the Prime Minister, the hidden expenditure of a tax concession is qualitatively different and different in a numerical sense to overt expenditure by way of appropriation. In a political sense it is quite different, for reasons that I have just explained, as appropriations are regularly and necessarily reviewed by Parliament. Equal assistance-assistance of equal magnitude-once written into the taxation Act is there indefinitely and without parliamentary scrutiny. The enormous damage which the present Prime Minister has done to the taxation Act in terms of its comprehensibility and effectiveness is probably equalled only by the damage that Sir John McEwen did to Australian manufacturing industry in the 1960s. The general objection to taxation deductions applies even if the specific concessions and rorts being opened were considered and rational decisions. In this case they clearly were not. </PARA>
<PARA> I challenge any Government senator to justify it. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) certainly has not attempted to do it. I challenge the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner), in his reply, to justify on a rational basis the provision for immediate write-off of expenditure on fuel storage capacity for business, for reasons that I will detail in a minute. I challenge any Government supporter to provide a rational justification for that decision. These concessions came-like the ridiculous film tax rort which accompanied them in time, the full dimensions of which are not grasped even by many people opposed to it-uncosted and unconsidered off the top of the Prime Minister's head in a pre-election crisis atmosphere. In the case of the film tax rort, it has subsequently been revealed that the original inspiration came from a television studio cosmetician who was saddled with the task of humanising the Fraser face. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of these concessions are clearly embarrassing to the Treasurer. They have certainly infuriated the Secretary to the Treasury. No justification has been offered by the Treasurer or, to my knowledge, any other member of the Government for at least the concession concerning fuel storage, and that is no wonder because no rational justification can be offered. The promise originally given by the Prime Minister was related to expenditure on fuel storage by farmers for storage on farms. Initially, it was rationalised in that way and was subsequently extended as a more general concession to business. I stress that this was not presented as a measure to assist people in financing their normal operational fuel reserves. It was presented as something to assist in financing an emergency or strategic reserve. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, there is nothing wrong with having emergency or strategic fuel reserves, given the relatively high risk of disruptions to overseas supplies and even through unforseeable acts the disruption of local supplies. The Opposition does not criticise the measure on the grounds that there is no case for adding to the nation's strategic or emergency fuel storage. However, it just happens that the cheapest and most effective reserves for any given quantity of fuel as an emergency reserve are those held in larger storages at a number-100, perhaps 1,000-of strategic centres around Australia rather than scattered around hundreds of tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, of private businesses. The proposal which the Prime Minister has put up does precisely the opposite because the finance is provided by way of taxation concessions to small business, it is regressive, and the costs of all those things are not regularly examined. </PARA>
<PARA> The storage will be done mostly by small business and it will inevitably be in small tanks. It will be held almost entirely in 500-gallon or 1,000-gallon tanks. If, as a result of this measure being introduced, sufficient people were induced to provide a capacity to store sufficient additional fuel to provide a six months supply for agriculture, the cost of providing that quantity in 500-gallon tanks would be $235m. The cost of providing that quantity in one-million-gallon tanks would be $67m, that is, about one-quarter of the cost for one-million-gallon tanks as against 500-gallon tanks. To store it in five-million-gallon tanks it would cost $37m, less than one-sixth of the original cost. I ask the Minister to examine a table which sets out the tank requirement for storing that quantity of fuel-267 million gallons or 1,200 million litres. I will seek to incorporate that table in Hansard later. </PARA>
<PARA> The actual cost of this proposition is unknown at this stage. When the proposition was first put up by the Prime Minister it was costed at $10m. If the cost is in fact that small, its effect on the quantity of fuel held for emergency use will be negligible. If the effect of this concession is to provide extra fuel equal to six months' agricultural usage, as the table which I will incorporate suggests, and if it is stored in 500-gallon tanks and the average marginal tax rate of the people who are storing it is 45 per cent, the cost to government revenue will be in the vicinity of $110m, just 11 times the estimate given by the Prime Minister. That estimate, of course, like most of the costing estimates in the Prime Minister's policy speech was fraudulent. It would be cheaper, indeed, for the Government to give oil companies the tanks to store one million gallons of fuel than it would be to finance the storage of that fuel by way of this taxation concession simply because fuel stored in large containers is much more cost-effective than the storage of fuel in small containers. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not the only objection that we have to this ridiculous proposition. If an emergency arises in a particular locality and the only source of fuel is that which has been delivered to 100,000 small businesses scattered all over the country, it will be more difficult to retrieve the fuel and use it for emergency purposes than if the fuel were stored in 270 one million gallon tanks scattered around the countryside. Distribution for emergency services from those regional tanks would be much easier than recovery and distribution from tens or hundreds of thousands of small tanks. The other thing-I restrict my remarks to agricultural which was the ground on which the provision was originally rationalised-is that this is a very attractive proposition to a farmer paying the maximum marginal tax rate of 60 per cent who can easily find the capital required to provide the storage and to buy the fuel to put in it. If fuel prices continue to appreciate at the rate they have recently appreciated-that would seem unlikely-an investment in liquid fuel would be a very good investment since the appreciation in value has exceeded in the past the going rate of interest. But it is a fine proposition for the farmers who are in a liquid position and on a high marginal tax rate. Who will provide the emergency reserves for those farmers who are not in highly liquid positions and who can not get the capital either to purchase the tanks or the fuel to put in them? The stocks of a regional storage of the type which I propose would, of course, be held by someone else and that problem would not arise. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also, I might add, some technical objection to the storage of distillate, particularly in small tanks, over a long period. This is related, I understand, to the degree of oxidisation which takes place and the subsequent engine damage. This is a ridiculous proposition. I trust sincerely that not everybody in the Liberal Party lacks the capacity to see what a ridiculous and indefensible proposition this is. It is a tragedy that they are so cowed by party discipline that none of them would have the courage to come over to this side of the Senate to vote for the amendment to the second reading which I now move. </PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate notes with concern that-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The introduction of several additional tax concessions raises serious questions as to the suitability of tax legislation as a means of extending assistance to particular interest groups;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No reasons have been given to the Parliament for providing these concessions through the tax system rather than through the expenditure side of the Budget;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) These concessions, being in the form of deductions rather than rebates, are inequitable in that they provide most assistance to highest income earners and least assistance to low income earners;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No costings have been provided to the Parliament by the Treasurer on the concessions; and</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Government has not developed a national strategic crude oil storage policy and calls on it to establish such a policy with the objective of meeting the International Energy Agency's target for national crude oil storage of 90 days national consumption'. </PARA>
<PARA>The provisions other than the fuel storage tax provision in the Bill are certainly less objectionable and may even be defensible except that the Government has gone about financing them in the wrong way. There remains the overriding objection to the unnecessary complication and lengthening of the Income Tax Assessment Act. But if the Act were to be used as a vehicle it would be both more equitable and more efficient if whatever degree of assistance was provided through the Act was provided on a rebate basis instead of a tax deduction basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The associated Bill, the Income Tax (Diverted Income) Bill 1981, is not opposed by the Opposition. It is an attempt to block off avenues for tax avoidance which have been opened up by previous Government amendments and com- plexification of the Act. We note again the irony of the Government simultaneously attempting to close off loopholes opened up by its previous fiddling with the Act and continuing to fiddle with the Act and open up other and different loopholes for future tax avoidance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most of the points that have been made in the course of this debate by Senator Walsh relate to the amendment. Consequently, I think that he was speaking in support of that amendment. I will come to those individual points a little later. I firstly indicate that the Government does not accept and does not propose to adopt Senator Walsh's amendment. I turn now to some of the points which the honourable senator raised. Firstly, he accused the Government of producing an amendment and providing a concession to certain persons in the community on the basis that these were uncosted or, at least, dishonestly costed in terms of the Government's promises made in the policy speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) before the October election last year. I think the honourable senator referred to them also as bribes. The Government rejects that kind of criticism. It points out clearly that these statements on costing were made at the time of the election policy speech and were subject to discussion at that time. I am not aware whether or not Senator Walsh and the Australian Labor Party raised criticisms on the costings at that time. I feel that, perhaps, they did not do so. In fact, in subsequent times we have heard bleatings to this effect. But again, very little conclusive evidence has been brought to bear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the clearest indications of that is the first table which Senator Walsh had incorporated in Hansard which relates to fuel storage costs. It does not refer to all businesses; it refers only to farming business. Secondly, he seeks to assert in that table that automatically all those persons who are covered-presumably he is talking about farmers-would seek to take advantage of the deduction in one year. Obviously that is not a proposition which is real and quite clearly is not contemplated by this amendment. Clearly, people will choose their own times for taking advantage of the concessions in order to build up their supply of and their storage facilities for fuel. Furthermore, Senator Walsh seeks to make the point that these kinds of deductions should be made available by virtue of a rebate rather than a straight out deduction which he equates then with the normal kind of concessional rebates which are provided in the Income Taxation Assessment Act for such things as spouse rebates. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly that is at odds with the general principles of the income tax law under which business deductions of all kinds, including depreciation and some straight out deductions for various kinds of expenditure are allowable under the general law in one year. In fact they are deductions and are not presented in the law in the form of a rebate. Clearly the one area in which there might be some support for Senator Walsh's argument is the area of home insulation which of its very nature is a private domestic expense. Consequently, there may be some support for this argument in that area. Nevertheless, I think he would agree that the action that has been taken by the Government by virtue of this amending legislation is in conformity with the kinds of policies in relation to energy conservation which his party supports. Consequently, I believe that exception is well and truly justified. </PARA>
<PARA> Further to that point, Senator Walsh said that all deductions are by their very nature regressive. Naturally, if he follows the argument I have just been putting he will realise that whether the argument that he has proposed is relevant and in fact real depends on how one defines income. That is the key question in determining whether his argument should be accepted. I wonder whether, for instance, he would consider, in line, I think, with the general policy of his own party that the cost of travelling to and from work by individual employees should be allowable in the form of a rebate or in the form of a deduction. Perhaps he would consider the same argument should apply in respect of expenditure by tradesmen on tools of trade and the special clothing which those people wear when engaging in their profession. The honourable senator might care to consider those matters alongside the general argument which he has put. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the question of the simplicity of the legislation, it is quite clear that Senator Walsh seeks to mislead us a little in this area. Firstly, I think he will acknowledge that of the tremendous number of amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act that have been made in recent years-I think he mentioned a figure of some 300 pages having been added to the Act; I am not able to confirm that figure at this stage-most have been related to countering tax avoidance. I think the honourable senator will acknowledge that point. Further, the Opposition on most occasions--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walsh" NAMEID="TJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the reasons you have such a tax avoidance problem is that the Act is so complex.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator has not made out that argument at all; in fact I challenge him to do so. I think he will find that most of the tax avoidance which has arisen in this community and which has been countered by the Government in taking the kinds of actions that it has taken is not related to any deductions of the sort that he has mentioned. In fact, there may be one or two but they are very much in the minority as I think Senator Walsh, if he were to consider the question, would recognise. Certainly it is true too that the substantial number of amendments which have occurred in this period have been put through this Parliament with the support of the Opposition. Most tax avoidance questions have been strongly supported by the Opposition. In fact, I recall many occasions on which Bills of this kind have been criticised by the Opposition as not being strong enough in certain areas. I would be surprised if the Opposition had changed from that position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of simplicity, surely we ought not to throw stones at this set of legislation. Rather, we ought to look at the broader framework of the income tax law in this country. I do not think there are any further major points, other than the general ones which Senator Walsh has raised during the debate, which require answering. I believe all of the points that he made have been adequately covered. Consequently, I reiterate that the Government does not accept the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no objection to the Income Tax Laws Amendment Bill and the Income Tax (Diverted Income) Bill being taken as a whole in Committee. I want to address a few remarks to clause 8 of the Income Tax Laws Amendment Bill which deals with costs and the principal philosophy of taxation deductibility for business expenditure. The provision generally accepted in Australian tax law and in the tax laws of most other countries is that an investment in plant or equipment is more or less written off over the period encompassing the useful life of the asset. There is a qualitative difference between the payment of wages where the expenditure is immediately incurred by the business proprietor and the value of the labour dissipated or obtained immediately and investment in an item of plant which may continue to perform useful services for a number of years. That principle is well recognised and well established.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On occasions governments divert from that principle. This Government increasingly diverts from that principle and allows the full and complete write-off of items of capital equipment which continue to provide useful services to a business for a number of years. It is quite appropriate and logical that labour, fuel and some other expenses associated with earning income should be written-off immediately and fully. It is not appropriate either on logical grounds or on grounds of our whole taxation experience that investment in capital equipment should be written off on that same basis. In other words, items such as the ones which are before us are special concessions offered to business through the Income Tax Assessment Act. Given that they are special concessions, our argument-which either the Minister did not understand or does not want to understand-is that the benefits of those special concessions ought to be distributed on a less regressive basis than they necessarily are if they are provided by way of taxation deduction. If they are to be provided at all, they ought to be provided by way of tax rebate where the benefits obtained by every taxpayer are directly related to the absolute amount of the expenditure instead of-as is the case with taxation deductions-being the product of the absolute amount of the expenditure multiplied by the marginal tax rate which, of course, provides the greatest benefits inevitably to the people on the highest incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> The table which I incorporated regarding the costs dealt with in clause 8-incidentally, I incorporated only one table in case there is some confusion about that-states the assumptions behind the cost figures given. The assumption is that that is the cost of storing 267 million gallons of fuel which happens to be equal to six months' agricultural consumption. I am well aware-the Minister has stated also-that the provision applies to businesses other than farm businesses. To the degree that it is exploited by businesses other than farm businesses, it is emergency fuel storage. From an agricultural point of view, that same quantity must last something less than six months. But it was an agricultural emergency storage that the idea was first rationalised by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). </PARA>
<PARA> The assumptions underlying the Prime Minister's estimate of $10m as the cost of this provision are not stated. They were not stated on 30 September, they have not been stated by the Minister today and they were not stated in the House of Representatives two weeks ago. I assert that that was a dishonest costing. It is certainly a nebulous costing until the assumptions underpinning it are revealed. As the lack of honesty in the costing of various items in Mr Fraser's policy speech has been raised, I will cite three in relation to which, on the Government's own admission, there have been drastic revisions in cost. The most spectacular, of course, is the film industry tax rort, dishonestly and fraudulently costed in the policy speech at $2m. This was subsequently admitted by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) a month ago to be $20m and, on the basis of the figures released by the Treasurer last week, it is more likely to be $30m. That costing has gone from $2m to $20m on the Government's own admission and it is more likely to be $30m. </PARA>
<PARA> The extension of the liquefied petroleum gas subsidy is estimated to cost between $9m and $11m. A letter from the Treasurer which is in my possession acknowledges that the revised estimate-as he euphemistically calls it-is $13m. That is another costing in the Prime Minister's policy speech. The 20 per cent depreciation allowance for various items of farm equipment, which was estimated in the Prime Minister's policy speech to cost $7m, was subsequently admitted by the Treasurer in a letter to me to be $20m. So there are three examples of fraudulently dishonest costings in that policy speech. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Prime Minister's assumptions underlying the cost estimate of $10m were not stated, I suppose one cannot say categorically that they are wrong. The assumptions underlying that $10m cost estimate still have not been stated and I invite the Minister to do so. If a 45c in the dollar average marginal tax rate, which is probably a conservative estimate for this provision on fuel storage, and the cost of storing 267 million gallons of fuel, which happens to be equal to about six months' agricultural consumption-the Minister may relate it to something other than six months' agricultural consumption if he wishes-induces fuel storage of that magnitude in 500 gallon and 1,000 gallon tanks, the cost to the revenue at that 45 per cent marginal tax rate will be between $80m and $108m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall quickly answer the points raised by Senator Walsh. Certainly in connection with the estimates of the costing, while I think he is correct in claiming that the cost of the fuel storage facility stated in the election policy was of the order of $10m, I have an-up-to-date costing on that figure which indicates that it will be of the order of $12m. I believe the cost is not of the proportions mentioned by Senator Walsh during his argument on the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walsh's assumption, of course, goes back to a one year implementation of the proposition which I think cannot really be assumed on the basis of the argument he has put forward, especially on the basis of the table which he had incorporated in Hansard. In terms of the broader question which Senator Walsh raised, there is the matter of the immediate write-off and the total cost being claimed for one year as compared with the depreciation charged which might otherwise have been claimed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think everyone in this Parliament would acknowledge that one of the problems that Australia faces, and one of the most urgent and real problems, is the lack of storage capacity in the event of major dislocations of international oil supplies which may affect our capacity to keep our factories, farms and food production going which all relate very closely to the individual well-being of every Australian. That is an important matter, bearing in mind the highly mechanised state of Australian industry. Consequently, this proposal, which is aimed at ensuring that we encourage people to develop storage facilities of this kind to the highest possible degree, only enhances the total reservoir of fuel in this country which can be kept on hand ready for any emergency. If Senator Walsh cares to think back to the time of the election campaign when this proposal was put forward by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), he may recall that it was within a month or so of the Iraqi invasion of Iran, with all kinds of difficulties in assessing the long term and short term effects on Middle East oil supplies at that time. Certainly, that war continues, with escalations possible in other areas which may indeed lead us to a state in which our oil supplies may be dislocated. These factors are considerable ones and ones which the Government has in mind in the assessment and establishment of this policy. Clearly, the Government does not resile from it and believes such action is correct in the proper circumstances at the time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I again refer to the assumptions. In the table I had incorporated on the cost of this measure, I stated the assumptions. The assumptions having been stated and if they are accepted-they are assumptions and by definition are not claimed to be absolutely correct; they are stated assumptions, no more and no less-what follows then is a question of calculating. It is a matter of arithmetic. While the assumptions may be doubtful, from then on there is no doubt. It is just an arithmetical calculation. On those assumptions the cost to the revenue is between $80m and $108m to store that quantity of fuel in tanks of that size. The Minister has given an estimate of $12m as the cost to revenue, I presume in the current financial year. He has not stated the assumptions underlying that estimate. If he has them I would like to know how much additional storage has it been assumed will be induced by this measure. In tanks of what size is it anticipated that fuel will be stored? I invite him to state certainly those two assumptions. There may be some other relevant assumptions, but I cannot think of them at the moment. Certainly those two are relevant and I invite him to state what they are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In view of what he said, although it has been said before it is apparently necessary to repeat it, the Opposition is not opposed to emergency fuel storages. The second reading amendment which we moved in fact called upon the Government to increase the storage of crude oil in particular. The Opposition is in favour of greater emergency fuel storage but it is in favour of doing it in a cost-effective way in larger and more accessible storages. What the Government proposes to do is to store emergency fuel in a cost-ineffective way. The fact that it will be cost-in effective is guaranteed by the proposition in clause 9. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The figure which I cited earlier in the debate in fact has been prepared by the Australian Taxation Office staff with their normal care and ability.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it somewhat ludicrous that a government would seek to introduce legislation to bring about an increased storage of fuels in this country by this method. The Minister has proclaimed what he believes to be the results of that-there will be an increased storage of fuel. It will be scattered all over the place. I am inclined to agree with the sentiments of my colleague Senator Walsh in that it will be stored hither, thither and yon. There will perhaps be massive storages amongst the wealthy farming community, there will be minuscular extra storages amongst the great bulk of the farming community. One of the things that worry me is this: In the event of an emergency in some part of the continent and the fuel in some other part of the continent is wanted in an endeavour to overcome problems in the disaster area, how does the Government propose to get that fuel back?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having been a farmer for 40 years and knowing the mentality of farmers-based on the concept 'what I have, I hold'-and having paid for that fuel, will the Government ride shotgun on tankers with sheriffs or something and take the fuel? Will its inspectors check what fuel every farmer in a given district has and at the time of an emergency, when that fuel is required, will a sheriff, policeman or army officer demand that fuel? Unless it does something such as that the fuel to a large extent will not be available to the community that the Minister is talking about in the event of some emergency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not let the Minister get away with the way in which he gave that reply. I certainly have not accused the Australian Taxation Office of shonky costing on this issue. The shonky costings come from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) or from the Prime Minister's office, not from the Taxation Office. Having produced an estimate of $12m cost, presumably the cost to revenue in the current financial year, does the Minister have available to him now the assumptions underlying that estimate and specifically the quantity of additional storage which it has been assumed will be affected by this measure? In what size tanks will that fuel be held? Does he have that information? If he does have that information, what are the figures?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation that the Senate is now debating is the very controversial and indeed notorious legislation designed to give additional tax concessions to the Australian film industry. Honourable senators and members of the public will be aware that this legislation represents one of the worst examples of the incompetence and dishonesty of the Fraser Government. The saga of extravagant promises, broken promises, modified promises and the absolute chaos that has been created in the film industry by the Government's handling of this issue is something that all Australians who are interested in having an Australian film industry or who are involved in the Australian film industry will not forget for a very long time. The upshot is that we still have a totally unsatisfactory situation. We now have presented to us legislation which the Opposition, for reasons I will go into in some detail, finds itself unable to support, much as it wishes and desires to support a truly Australian film industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us examine what the legislation in its latest and perhaps final form actually does. The legislation provides a tax deduction for investors in Australian films equal to 150 per cent of the capital expenditure on the film. This deduction is now to be available only when the film has been completed and used to produce income. It provides a tax exemption on income from Australian films for an amount up to 50 per cent of the qualifying investment in the film. To qualify the film must be an eligible Australian film according to a definition which the Opposition believes is significantly and improperly broadened by this legislation. It must be a feature film, a documentary or a mini-series of a television drama and be produced for exhibition to the public in cinemas or by way of television broadcasting. An amendment moved by the Government to its own legislation in the House of Representatives on Friday allows that investment in films under contracts entered into between 1 October 1980, when the first series of extravagant promises were made, and 27 May 1981, will qualify for deduction in the year of expenditure rather than in the year the film is completed and used to produce income. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to remind the Senate that for the second time in two days-the first being the broadcasting and television amendment legislation-the Senate has been presented with a situation where the Government has made a detailed announcement of its intentions, then brought in a Bill which diverges drastically from its announced intentions and then proceeds to amend its own Bill in the House. So this is another example of the Government's incompetence and inability to develop and stick to a realistic policy. Of course, this legislation is a further example of legislation, one of the main beneficiaries of which is Mr Rupert Murdoch who, as well as his other activities in airlines, broadcasting and so on which have been so favoured by the Government during this legislative program, has recently entered into the film making business on a large scale and so, of course, will receive one of the largest benefits from the tax concession which this Bill introduces. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party, as I think everybody knows-certainly everybody in the film industry knows-has long been committed to a vigorous, thriving Australian film industry. In government we took a number of steps, not least of which was the setting up of the Australian Film Commission, to ensure that we did have a burgeoning Australian film industry. During our period of Opposition we have continued to support any measures which were genuinely in the interests of the local film industry and genuinely in the interests of those talented people who work in that industry. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we have to oppose the amendments before us. We oppose them for a number of reasons. Firstly, they undeniably create opportunities for tax avoidance which will damage the film industry and create unacceptable losses to public revenue. I do not think any Government senator can argue with those assertions. It would be charitable to say that the costing for this scheme must represent one of the greatest Government bungles of recent times, and many bungles have there been in recent times. The cynical view would be that the Government deliberately misrepresented the projected loss to revenue when the scheme was first announced during the election campaign. At that time-this was in October 1980-the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) estimated the loss to revenue would be $2m on an annual basis. This was revised by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) on 11 March 1981 when he informed the Parliament that the latest estimate indicated the annual loss to revenue would be in the region of $20m rather than $2m. On 29 April 1981 the Treasurer, in response to a question by my colleague Mr David Charles, did not deny David Charles's suggestion that the loss to revenue would be $30m annually. We are now informed in the Treasurer's second reading speech that the total budgeted cost for the 170 applications which have already been received for eligibility for this scheme is $130m. If the 170 films were all to go ahead the loss to revenue would be over $200m. </PARA>
<PARA> This projection is a staggering indictment of a government which bases its claim to credibility on a platform of economic responsibility. I think the truth is that in a desperate bid for votes in a disintegrating electoral situation during the election campaign the Prime Minister got more than a little carried away and made promises which he could not afford. I must point out that he made those promises with virtually no consultation with major bodies in the film industry such as the entertainment unions. He made them on the suggestion of one group only. Of course, he undertook no proper costing. As the Opposition warned at the time, the estimated $2m was a figure which was pulled out of the air and could not be substantiated by anybody who knew anything about the film industry or indeed anybody who knew anything about the operation of the Income Tax Assessment Act. At a time when public expenditure in almost every area of genuine need is being reduced, slashed and razored, we have this extravagant costing of a tax concession proposal which will result in a tenfold to one hundredfold increase in this form of assistance to the Australian film industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point to be made about the Fraser Government's apparent willingness to assist the industry in this way is that, of course, it fits in with the Government's ideological attack on publicly accountable public spending. If the Government is so willing to put the taxpayers' money into the film industry, what is wrong with doing it by way of increasing assistance to the Australian Film Commission which is, after all, the national body set up by the Labor Government and maintained by the Fraser Government to engage in investment in films, to assist the production of experimental films and other activities. That form of public assistance is, as I said, publicly accountable. It can be examined by senators at Senate Estimates committees. As a result, the public is in no doubt about how much money is going to the film industry by way of direct allocation to the Australian Film Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The other means, of course, is public expenditure by stealth. There is no accurate way of costing the concession. Even now, in its present form, there is no accurate way of costing it. There is no way in which the public can know from year to year what it will cost. There is no accountability for this form of tax concession. All that happens is that an undefined number of people get undefined reductions of their tax bill. But we as a Senate, we as a parliament, never get to examine what is lost to public revenue in that way. For although it is a burden to the taxpayer, it is a hidden burden, a disguised burden which allows the Fraser Government, with its particular ideology against the public sector, to claim that it is reducing public expenditures when of course it is creating vast and undefined new burdens for the public purse. I must stress that that is a particularly obnoxious feature of the scheme to which the Opposition is quite hostile. </PARA>
<PARA> What effect will the legislation in its present form have on the film industry? The Opposition, I must say, is well aware of the high risk nature of investment in the film industry. We are aware that of the total investments in Australian films between 1972 and 1979, amounting to $22.97m, only $8.7m or 38 per cent has been returned to investors. We are aware that investors have a one in two chance of losing 100 per cent of an investment in an Australian film. We are aware that only one in every five Australian films provides a clear profit to investors. In light of the high risk nature of the film industry, the Opposition does not oppose realistic taxation concessions. We have not opposed them in the past and we would not oppose them in the future if they were realistic. We oppose these particular taxation concessions because they are outrageous and irresponsible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer himself described them in the House of Representatives on Friday as 'unparalleled in our taxation laws'. Furthermore, we believe that the Government will not be able to maintain these tax concessions. Again, the Treasurer foreshadowed this when the Bill was debated in the House. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the operation of the Scheme will be carefully monitored over the next six to 12 months and, if the need is demonstrated, appropriate action will be taken. </PARA>
<PARA>I say to film investors: 'Be warned. There are more changes in the wind'. Some of the changes might involve retreating to a position which is less obnoxious to the Opposition than the original position was. But the whole point about attracting investors, as anybody in this place ought to know, is that the worst thing for investors is insecurity, instability. We believe that the film industry would have been much better served by a much more modest but stable form of tax concession which would have allowed investors and producers to plan over a long period and which would have allowed the industry to adapt to a realistic and stable level of growth. This stop-go, on-off approach is the worst possible thing if the Government's objective is truly to attract investment into the film industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, through its vacillation, has already caused great instability and damage to the film industry. It introduced an unsuccessful tax concession scheme for the film industry in 1978. When this scheme led to large scale tax avoidance, in August 1980 the Government took action, properly, to close tax avoidance schemes in the film industry. But by doing so and by doing so without introducing a stable scheme to take its place, it precipitated a collapse in the industry. This new scheme has been announced in one form, introduced in another, and then amended at the last possible moment. The film industry cannot prosper under the see-saw tax policies of this Government. What is required is realistic legislation to ensure a stable source of private investment and an ongoing and stable source of public investment in the film industry. But it is clear-as the Treasurer, in the same breath that he is introducing this latest lot of amendments, is already foreshadowing more changes-that the stability so desperately required by this particular high risk industry will just not be achieved under the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of this legislation on the film industry will be an initial over-production of films, subsequent poor distribution deals for Australian films, and a shortage of labour which will push up production costs. Evidence of all of these things is already available. In the long term, the legislation will result in the production of 'quickie' films, produced and distributed within the year in order to obtain taxation concessions in the year of expenditure. This legislation mitigates against the production of quality Australian films. It is actually a deterrent to the achieving of the objective the Prime Minister said at the outset that he was trying to achieve, which is quality Australian films. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation also broadens the definition of 'Australian film' to an unreasonable degree by including within it a film made pursuant to a co-production agreement with a foreign government or an agent of a foreign government. That is all detailed in the specifications of what an Australian film is. Previous requirements found in section 124ZAD are not to apply and a co-production with a foreign government is automatically to be an Australian film. There is no justification for allowing tax concessions, a cost to the taxpayer, to go partly or half to a foreign government or an agent of a foreign government. Unlike the Government, the Australian Labor Party does have a comprehensive policy designed to support the Australian film industry. The Labor Party, as I said, would seek to provide tax incentives at a level which would ensure a stable souce of private investment in films without creating a haven for tax avoidance. I wrote to the Treasurer on 4 May urging him to introduce incentives legislation with the following modifications. The first of these modifications was that any salaries paid to overseas actors, directors, writers, or other participants should be excluded from the production total liable to attract the new tax incentive. My reasons for making that proposition are self-evident. If we are to have expensive tax concessions, they ought to be there to help the Australian industry and to help the talent in the Australian industry. There is no justification for what is happening and what can continue to happen under the legislation in its present form, which is that foreign talent can be brought into an Australian production, a vastly inflated salary paid to that foreign talent, and that vastly inflated salary added to the production cost which will, of course, attract the tax concession. That is simply throwing the Australian taxpayers' money overseas and is an irresponsible action which, of course, again mitigates against Australian producers looking around Australia first to find the talent they need for the production. So that provision should be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> I also pointed out that brokerage fees, which shot up to over 20 per cent of production costs recently under the influence of the new incentives, should be excluded. It is perfectly proper for brokers to get the money for a production together, and for a producer to pay a fee to that broker. But why should a brokerage fee of 20 per cent of the total production costs be included and attract a tax concession at the Australian taxpayers' expense. There is no justification for that at all, and no properly preventive measure of such a rort in the present legislation. I pointed out to Mr Howard that the tax write-off of 150 per cent should be modified and reduced to a figure which would attract genuine investment in film rather than the tax evaders. It seems to me and to the Opposition that while ever we have this extravagant figure of 150 per cent that can be written off tax bills we will attract the tax evaders, whatever steps the Commissioner of Taxation takes to try to prevent this happening. </PARA>
<PARA> These are modifications which the Labor Party would require before it could consider supporting this legislation. The Treasurer chose to ignore our constructive suggestions and has modified the legislation in a way which deals with none of these problems of abuse and which deals with none of the problems of taxpayers' money going to subsidise overseas talent. Therefore the legislation is still unacceptable to the Labor Party. However, while recognising that tax incentives may be necessary in the short term, the Labor Party would, in the long term, attempt to get a better deal for Australian films, and thus Australian producers and investors, by regulating or by restructuring the distribution-exhibition system in Australia, thus obviating the need for extravagant tax concessions. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for regulation of the distribution-exhibition system will become more apparent when the current 30 Australian films in production come onto the market and there are not sufficient exhibition outlets to screen them. This is the whole point. Producing a film is only half, and perhaps the least important half, of why we want to see government support for the Australian film industry. Surely the films are being made to be seen by the Australian public. Surely what it is all about is to provide the Australian public with Australian films that are good and that they want to see. Yet, if we allow the current distribution-exhibition arrangements to continue, many of the films which will be made and which will attract tax concessions will not be seen by the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate well knows that the original Australian film industry of the late 1920s and early 1930s collapsed primarily because of the takeover of Australian cinemas and film distribution by foreign interests. As a result, between 1940 and the early 1970s only a handful of feature films was made in Australia. Government action since the early 1970s has been aimed at reversing the situation and establishing a viable Australian film industry. All programs for the development of the Australian film industry so far, by State and Federal governments, have been production oriented. The problems of exhibition-distribution have been pushed into the background. The problems of foreign controlled film exhibition and distribution were put to the Royal Commission into Motion Picture Production in 1929 and the Senate Select Committee on the Encouragement of Australian Productions for Television in 1962 and were dealt with in the 1973 Tariff Board report on motion picture films and television programs. Tariff Board recommendation No. 5 included:</PARA>
<PARA> That legislative provision be made to adjust and regulate the ownership and control of cinemas. </PARA>
<PARA>The report concluded that, to give Australian films a fair chance in the market, the present concentration of control within the industry should be reduced. The report states that this is only possible if the dominance of exhibition outlets by the Village, Greater Union and Hoyts groups is broken. To achieve this the report recommended limitations on shareholdings on exhibition outlets along the lines set out for television in the Broadcasting and Television Act. The report also recommended that in future no producer or distributor should control exhibition outlets. This is the major problem of the film industry and it is a problem that the Government has failed to grasp. The Australian Labor Party recognises that by providing production assistance alone governments will not solve the problems of the Australian film industry. We recognise that there are overseas precedents, such as in the United States of America, for the restriction of links between distributors and exhibition interests and for the breaking up of monopolistic exhibition chains. We also recognise that there are legal options for taking Federal action along these lines in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Labor Party does not oppose tax incentives to the film industry in principle but they should be at a reasonable level. They should benefit only the local industry and not overseas investors. They should be designed in such a way as to minimise abuse and, of course, they should be closely monitored and in a form whereby the public has some idea of what the scheme is costing. In none of these respects does the legislation before us measure up. It fails in all respects. We are unable to support it. I would like to say that as a long term means of assisting the industry the Labor Party does not believe tax concessions are the most appropriate form. We are prepared in the short term to maintain tax concessions at a reasonable level-perhaps tax concessions at a reasonable level in the long term-but they are not the most appropriate means of assistance to the industry. They are by no means a comprehensive means of assistance to the film industry. There ought to be-and the Labor Party is committed to providing-ongoing public investment in the Australian film industry by the Australian Film Commission. Of course, the States film corporations are carrying out a very important role in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA> Most significantly, we would seek to develop alternative assistance to the Australian film industry through the restructuring of the system of distribution and exhibition. Again, in this vital area the Government has failed to act. The legislation which is before us is just another excuse for the lack of any Government policy to ensure the long term survival of the Australian film industry. The Australian Labor Party is determined that the Australian film industry will survive. We reject the amendments proposed by this legislation because they endanger the survival of a quality industry. At the earliest possible opportunity we will seek to take action along the lines that I have outlined to put the Australian film industry on a firm and stable base where it can grow, develop and build on the record of success which it has had in the last decade of which I believe all Australians and, may I say, in particular the Australian Labor Party, are very proud. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me a great deal of pleasure to rise in support of this piece of legislation-the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill. The feature film is probably the only original art form to come into existence in the twentieth century. The nature and type of films produced by any national cinema say a great deal about the nation which produces them and about the culture for which they are produced. Had time permitted, I would have liked to have said something in detail about the history and development of our Australian film industry. However, I do not intend to do so this afternoon. I know that many of these points will be covered in a speech to be given later in this debate by my colleague Senator Hamer. I say simply that the film has been an integral part of Australian culture for a long time. From Soldiers of the Cross through to Gallipoli, Australians have been producing quality films which in their own distinct way have been world leaders and have said a great deal about Australia, about the skill and integrity of Australian film makers and about the values that are important to Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Certainly, it is true that in recent years the film industry has had its notable ups and downs, particularly in terms of the number of films being produced. From about 1975 to 1979, on an average some 20 feature films each year were produced with varying degrees of artistic and commercial success. For those who are particularly interested, they will be able to find in David Stratton's book entitled The Last New Wave: Australian Film Revival a complete analysis of those films and of their commercial and artistic successes. It is certainly true that in 1980 this had declined so that only about eight feature films were produced. At the moment it looks as if in this current year we will see something in the vicinity of 25 films being produced. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ryan has already drawn attention to the number of film backers who have sought certificates in order to qualify for this tax concession. In her second reading speech, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle mentioned a figure of some 200 films to a value of $145m. An assumption is drawn from this that, simply because certificates are issued, because the value of the films for which certificates are issued is $145m, this is a realistic estimate of what the cost to revenue might be. The physical constraints imposed on the Australian film industry in terms of personnel, producers, directors, cameras, crews, processing, location and all of the other factors which are significant will lead to a situation quite contrary to what Senator Ryan predicts. She claimed that there was already over-production of films. Rather for the reasons that I have mentioned there will be a quite clear limitation on the number of films capable of being produced. It is certainly not possible to say how many films that will be. I concede that. It is certainly not possible to say how many there will be, but it certainly is possible to say that there will be nowhere near the 200 which have so far sought some preliminary certification. </PARA>
<PARA> This concession is unparalleled in its generosity. It is not true to say that the Australian film industry is the only industry for which all sorts of special exceptions have been made. Under section 51 (1) and under Division 10, the Income Tax Assessment Act already provides for concessions to the film industry. Section 160ACA provides concessions in terms of capital subscribed for off-shore petroleum exploration ventures. Section 78 (1) B deals with afforestation. Section 23 (O) deals with gold mining. Division 10 deals with mining operations in general. Division 16 deals with income averaging provisions. Each of them has been introduced in the Income Tax Assessment Act as a measure of Government support for a particular industry or for a particular set of income arrangements or to encourage certain activities which the Government wishes as a matter of policy to promote and foster. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept that a grave responsibility now lies not only on the Government but also on the industry itself to be conscious of the fact that there will be people who will seek to exploit this in the worst possible sense. It also ought to be indicated that some of them have been around for a long time. Perhaps the most crooked and most wretched of these particular schemes is one run by United American and Australasian Film Productions Pty Ltd and a notorious character by the name of Mr Picton Warlow who, using the existing provisions of section 51 (1), writes to potential investors and says, in effect, that he can turn an investment of $10,000 into a deduction of between $37,500 and $45,000 under the existing scheme. He is not the only one knocking around in the market. I have real worries about a group that calls itself Ozfilm Pty Ltd and has an associated group which calls itself Nolava Consultants. They are currently putting out prospectuses but they do not really want too many people to know exactly what they are offering. In fact, in the opening page of the document Ozfilm puts out, it says:</PARA>
<PARA> No part of this outline--</PARA>
<PARA>That is the scheme to raise money for the production of a film tentatively entitled Going Platinum-</PARA>
<PARA>is to be reproduced or transmitted to or discussed with any member of the public or any potential investors at any time unless personally known to the General Partner and such person has received a numbered copy of this confidential outline. Any reproduction transmission or discussion is a breach of confidence and may constitute a violation of the Companies Act or The Security Industry Act. </PARA>
<PARA>A similar organisation called Quantum Films is seeking money for a film called Relatives. It says in its document:</PARA>
<PARA> Neither this document nor its content is to be reproduced or transmitted to or discussed with any member of the public at any time or any potential investor unless such investor is personally known to the offeror or its agents. Such prohibited reproduction transmission or discussion may constitute a violation of the Companies Act or of the Securities Industry Act and is a breach of confidence. </PARA>
<PARA>Groups like Film Co., Tasman Developments Australia Pty Ltd, and Cassandra, about which one can find out very little in the market-place, are similarly getting themselves involved in this operation. They are concerned only about financial lurks not about our great film industry. It will be in the interests of the industry, more than anybody else, to police these concessions and to ensure that they are not put at risk by the unscrupulous operators who would be attracted to any scheme, no matter how generous or ungenerous it happened to be and no matter who it genuinely sought to help. Liberal and National Country Party governments have had a long record of support for the Australian film industry. Prime Minister John Gorton was a great supporter and introduced much of the early legislation in support of the industry. In the current arrangements being made for other parts of the film industry, it will be noted that this Government has committed a large sum of money to the rehousing and reconstruction of the Australian Film and Television School. That is a wonderful investment in the industry and in the young men and women who are its future. I am not one who takes the view that the Opposition front bench spokesman, Senator Walsh, has put so far as this industry is concerned. When speaking about continued support of this policy by the Government, Senator Walsh criticised the Government and said:</PARA>
<PARA> Since the Government has broken promises to just about every other section of the community, why should it honour irresponsible undertakings to a noisy, greedy, egocentric bunch of tax dodgers and their parasitic advocates is beyond comprehension . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I think that there are hundreds of very genuine people in the Australian film industry, a lot of people who have done a great deal for Australia within the Australian film industry. To describe them as 'noisy, greedy, egocentric tax dodgers and parasitic advocates' brings great discredit on the Opposition. It sits very ill with the statements that Senator Ryan made earlier about the extent to which the Labor Party allegedly seeks to support and encourage the Australian film industry. It is clear that groups like the Australian Film and Television Producers Association will have to play a pivotal role in ensuring that this legislation is policed and is made effective. Its representatives have been down here having discussions with Senator Ryan, the Treasurer (Mr Howard), me and others. In particular, representations were made by Ray Beattie, its President, James Mitchell, its Executive Director, and Tom Hayden, one of its councillors, who are themselves reputable and significant figures in the film industry. I know they are awake to their responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA> It is certainly true that changes were made between the statement of 18 December 1980 and the legislation as it currently stands. There was a situation in which in changing those rules some disadvantage would have occurred for those who had genuinely invested their money prior to 27 May on the basis of an understanding of what the statement of 18 December in fact meant. Amendments to the Act were made in the House of Representatives to ensure that these persons were not disadvantaged. I have a letter from Mr Skrzynski, the General Manager of the Australian Film Commission, addressed to the Treasurer and a telex response from the Treasurer to Mr Skrzynski which goes further and in fact outlines some of the interpretations which I think are important in regard to those persons who had invested or agreed formally to invest their money prior to 27 May. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard both the letter and the telex. </PARA>

<PARA>My dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA>Amendment to Income Tax Act re Film Investment to 'Restore Benefits of December Statement'</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>We are concerned that the above amendment cover persons who have entered into financial commitments as a result of the Ministerial Statement of 18 December.</PARA>
<PARA> Two classes of person are involved, producers and investors. We identify the categories as follows. </PARA>
<PARA>1. Investors who cash subscribed prior to 27 May 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>2. Investors who contracted unconditionally prior to 27 May 1981 to subscribe prior to 30 June 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Investors who contracted or indicated intention prior to 27 May 1981 to subscribe conditional on legislation being same as Statement. </PARA>
<PARA>4. Producers who committed prior to 27 May 1981 to productions on basis of some investors cash subscribed, balance intending subject to legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>5. Producers who used own resources to finance production pending legislation on assurance from responsible financial intermediaries that investment money would then be available. </PARA>
<PARA> We understand that investors in category 1 are covered. </PARA>
<PARA> We seek your assurance that investors in categories 2 and 3 are also covered.</PARA>
<PARA> We draw your attention to categories 4 and 5 and urge that producers who are now significantly advanced in production and who face economic loss be protected. This can be effected by approving their identified projects and budgets as qualifying for the amendment and allowing investors who subscribe by 30 June 1981 to qualify as though they had subscribed prior to 27 May 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of a survey conducted this morning, we have identified the following amounts involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Categories 2 and 3-$6m. </PARA>
<PARA> Categories 4 and 5-$7m. </PARA>
<PARA> We are sending under separate cover the list of productions involved. There maybe other productions, however we believe we have covered the majority of projects which are significantly advanced. </PARA>
<PARA> As advised previously, urgent clarification is needed as to whether the categories above are covered by the proposed amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Your sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA>J. SKRZYNSKI General Manager.</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Skrzynski</PARA>
<PARA> In response to your telex of yesterday I confirm that the Government has agreed to amend the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1981 with respect to expenditure on film investments under contracts entered into on or after 1 October 1980 and before 28 May 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> Subject to the general eligibility requirements for the income tax concessions being otherwise satisfied, this will have the following consequences for the four categories of situations described in your telex. </PARA>
<PARA>Category 1 Investors who paid cash into eligible film projects on or before 27 May 1981 will qualify for deductions in the 1980-81 income year (assuming regular accounting periods for income tax purposes). </PARA>
<PARA>Category 2 Investors who entered into unconditional contracts on or before 27 May 1981 to invest in a film will attract deductions in the 1980-81 income year for eligible expenditures incurred under those contracts by 30 June 1981. Any expenditure incurred after 30 June 1981 under such contracts will attract deductions in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. </PARA>
<PARA>Category 3 The existence of an escape clause in a contract that would have permitted the investor to withdraw in the event of the legislation not being in accord with the ministerial statement of 18 December 1980 will not prevent that contract from being recognised as valid for these purposes. The tax treatment of persons in category 3 will correspond with that for category 2 if the contract is honoured. </PARA>
<PARA>Category 4 Whether a pre-28 May 1981 contract to invest in a film had been made is a question of fact to be determined in each particular case. Persons who had not made a contractual commitment on or before 27 May 1981 will not qualify for deductions in respect of any investment until the film has been produced and used to produce assessable income from exhibition. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of your telex it is not readily apparent that investors subsequent to 27 May 1981 would have been party to any prior commitment on the basis of assurances received by producers from investment intermediaries. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I wish to respond quickly to three things that arise from what Senator Ryan said earlier. The first is that I think Senator Ryan presented a most misleading presentation of the Treasurer's commitment for a review of this legislation. She in fact implied quite clearly and deliberately that if the expenditure was getting out of hand, within six to 12 months the Government would review it with a view to reducing the concessions being made available. If one examines the second reading speech of the Minister for Finance, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, one will find that she said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr President, I note that representations have been made to the Government that the effect of the modifications to December Statement will be to direct investment away from quality productions which may take some time to reach the market place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has examined these comments carefully but does not consider that, with the exception of pre-28 May contracts, they should lead to any departure from the approach taken in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister stated further:</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the operation of the scheme will be carefully monitored over the next six to 12 months and, if the need is demonstrated, appropriate action will be taken. </PARA>
<PARA>That does not mean appropriate action to withdraw the concessions. Far from it if, in fact, the claims made that these recent changes to the concession as originally announced will lead to the production of lower quality films are actually seen to occur. Given the fact that the thrust of the Bill is to encourage quality productions, that is what will be reviewed. It is not that the concession will be reviewed in order to wind it back but that the operation will be reviewed to ensure that there is no deleterious impact on quality films in Australia. I think it is also untrue for Senator Ryan simply to present the move to what has been called 'quickie' films without any discussion of the argument which says that through the operation of the provisional tax system this in fact will not necessarily occur. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a statement which set this out. The statement was made by a colleague of mine from the other place, Mr Michael Baume. It deals with the question of the use of provisional tax by film investors. I seek leave to have it incorporated because it explains this situation and I will not have to go into detail in the course of this speech. </PARA>

<PARA>PRESS STATEMENT</PARA>
<PARA>5 June 1981</PARA>
<PARA>Financiers had 'blackmailed' film producers into objecting to the Government's new taxation assistance to the film industry, the Member for Macarthur, Michael Baume, said in Parliament today. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Baume, who was speaking on the Second Reading of the Income Tax Assessment Bill, said, 'Many potential investors in the film industry have threatened to withdraw funding to existing and proposed film projects now that details of the legislation are known. </PARA>
<PARA> ''As a result, film producers have been imposing ridiculous pressure on the Government to remove the safeguards against tax 'fiddles' that have been introduced since the initial statement on taxation assistance was made last year. </PARA>
<PARA> ''The reality is that these generous concessions (which the Labor Party described as 'outrageously generous') will result in a flood of money becoming available for the Australian film industry. </PARA>
<PARA> ''So the fears of film producers that they will be bankrupted by the withdrawal of funds by these 'blackmailing' investors are unfounded. </PARA>
<PARA> ''On the contrary, the relatively small number of remarkably capable Australian film producers will in future be in a position to pick and choose their financial backers out of the enormous volume of potential investors who will be attracted by the Government's generous concessions. </PARA>
<PARA> ''These highly capable and world-renowned Australian film makers will not be under any real pressure to revert to producing 'quickies' as a result of the Government's tax incentives as claimed by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> ''In the first place, their integrity is too high for that, and in any event the tax concession adequately provides for those films where the major expenditure can be spread over as long as 21 months while still providing the same tax benefit, in terms of timing, as would be received by investing in a 'quickie' movie within 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> ''This is because of the effect of provisional tax which is not applied until 9 months after the close of the previous financial year, and which is paid at the same time as tax liability for that previous year falls due. </PARA>
<PARA> ''I know of no film ever produced in Australia where the major expenditure has been spread over a longer period than 21 months, so that there is no serious cash-flow disadvantage to investors in longer movies of this nature as against 'quickies', particularly as borrowing and other costs incurred by investors can be deducted from current year income. </PARA>
<PARA> ''Those film-makers protesting at the present sensible safeguards in these tax concessions are not serving the best interests of the film industry. Instead they are helping those 'investors' whose only interest is in trying to keep open as many tax dodge loopholes as possible'', Mr Baume said. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The third point I wish to raise is that, in effect, Senator Ryan said: 'This will lead to a rip-off because there will be grossly inflated brokerage fees built into the cost of production and we will have to provide deductions for all of these glorified inflated brokerage fees'. That is simply not true. If one looks at the explanatory memorandum under the heading of 'The deduction' at page 2 one will find that it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In circumstances where money is expended by way of contribution to the production of a film, the expenditure will qualify for deduction only to the extent that the moneys so contributed are applied directly in the production of the film. </PARA>
<PARA>I stress that word 'only'. This in fact is a guarantee in the legislation that the over-inflated brokerage fees which rightly have caused concern in the industry will not be permitted to be part of the concessions and will not lead to the distortion that was alleged previously. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary I say these things: First, I am extremely unhappy about the role which the Australian Film Commission has played in this whole sad saga of these recent changes to film industry tax legislation. I hope that the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wilson) will get round to putting a radical broom through the Australian Film Commission and to putting into effect some of these Peat, Marwick and Mitchell recommendations about the Australian Film Commission. I certainly hope he will get round to doing something about the role of the General Manager of the Australian Film Commission which, within the history of the development of this film legislation, will be seen in retrospect to have been a disgrace and to have been contrary to the best interests of the Australian film industry. I do not believe that the AFC is the appropriate vehicle for the channelling of all government moneys into the production of films. It is certainly a good socialist solution to the question of how to encourage the film industry. It is not a solution that commends itself to anybody who does not believe in government control extending further and further, especially in artistic and cultural endeavours. When one looks at some of the investment decisions of the Australian Film Commission, its members would certainly be the last persons whose judgment in this matter I would trust. When one looks at the commercial success of films such as Mad Max, one is constantly reminded of the success of commercial films that have never been able to get-or have not sought-a cent out of the Australian Film Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> There are certainly at least three major issues which still have to be grappled with in terms of the overall position of the film industry. The first is the question of the importation of release prints rather than requiring that more and more of the release prints be produced in Australia by Australian processing laboratories. The second is the problem of the distribution of films in Australia. In fact it was an error made in the taxation legislation in 1936 which in effect penalised Australian distributors in favour of foreign distributors and put them out of the market. We need to rectify the situation which has grown historically since then. Our films cannot continue to be hostage to the whims of foreign controlled distributors. The third is the need for a more intelligent approach to the support and encouragement of Australian film archives. Anybody who has noted the enthusiastic reaction of people when the Sydney Film Festival was able to open with a showing of the film The Term of His Natural Life, made I think in 1927 and substantially reconstructed and made available for today's viewing audience by Ray Edmondson and his devoted colleagues in the Film Archives section of the National Film Library, can see the importance of archives to the Australian film industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who look at John Hindes's recent book Other People's Pictures will come to understand the pervasive and important position of film as part of any national culture. I believe this Bill attempts to bring about a situation which not only encourages in a direct sense the genuine people in the Australian film industry but also keeps out the unethical operators. I believe this is yet another indication of my Liberal Government's determination to support one of the most interesting, dynamic and significant parts of the creative life of Australia. I have great pleasure in supporting the Bill. </PARA>

Senator Puplick told us how good Australian films are, and I certainly would not dispute that. However, he did not tell us much about the specifics of the Bill. That is not surprising. He claimed that there were precedents for these sorts of concessions, which is just not true. In the taxation Act there is no provision, and never has been, for capital expenditure to be written off against taxable income at the rate of 150 per cent, let alone immediately; nor has there been a simultaneous provision for any part of the return on that investment to be free from income tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My colleague and leader Senator Button has often referred to the bad legislation of the Fraser Government and the mad legislation of the Fraser Government. With this Bill the Government has managed to put the two together-this legislation is both mad and bad. David Barnett, the Press secretary of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), following the Premiers Conference early last month, attempted to stand over the Australian Broadcasting Commission with threats of dismissal to ABC staff in an attempt to censor the news. That showed the very ugly face of the Fraser Government, as distinct from the phoney face of the Fraser Government concocted in the Senate by such people as Senator Baume who mouth pious platitudes about the independence of the ABC. The reality behind that phoney face and those pious platitudes is David Barnett and other members of the Prime Minister's Press staff standing over people in the ABC, storming the ABC office in Parliament House and attempting to censor the news and to suppress the dissemination of accurate information, the attempts, in some cases, being backed up by threats of dismissal. This measure shows not that ugly face of the Fraser Government but the farcical and very unfunny face of the Fraser Government. Its original inspiration, we now know, came from a television make-up girl. That was compounded, of course, by the Prime Minister's penchant for tax dodging schemes of all types. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister certainly has a high propensity to write into the taxation Act provisions which facilitate the avoidance of income tax by a variety of people; and the legislative record testifies to that. Since the commitment was first given at the end of September we have had the film industry taxation concessions scheme marks I, II and III. All of them are stupid and all of them are obnoxious. It first surfaced in the Prime Minister's policy speech and accompanying policy document, which stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tax concessions to encourage investment in the production of Australian films ($2m). </PARA>
<PARA>That was the estimated cost. That estimate is and always has been inaccurate. It is and was a fraudulent estimate. It could have been correct only if the total investment which qualified for deduction had been equal to $3.3m. Of course, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has since admitted that the estimated loss to revenue now is $20m and on the figures he recently gave it is more likely to be $30m. In acknowledging that the $2m was in error by a factor of 10, the blame was transferred backwards on to the Film Industry Association-it was an industry estimate-which I must say incorporates the novel proposition of the acceptance of program costing by the beneficiaries of the programs. If the Fraser Government were to extend that principle to the area of education, we would have self-assessment instead of examinations and people would award themselves degrees and higher academic titles. If the Prime Minister is to accept industry costings of programs when he promises to inflict them on the taxpayers, one wonders why half the staff of the Taxation Office is being retained. </PARA>
<PARA> That original brief and non-specific commitment-non-specific except in terms of the fraudulent estimated cost-was supplemented by a Press statement on 15 October which stated that '150 per cent of the investment would be eligible for the write-off in the first year of expenditure' and 50 per cent of the net earnings of the film would be tax free. There has been some confusion subsequently about the meaning of 'net earnings'. If there is an investment of $1m in a film and that $1m is all written off at the rate of 150 per cent, the term 'net earnings' as defined in the legislation means that every dollar of income from that film between $1 and $500,000 will be exempt from taxation. On 18 December we got a definitive statement from the Treasurer and from the then Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, Mr Ellicott, who was aptly described recently by my colleague Dr Klugman in the other House as an innumerate lawyer. The statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Deductions will be available in the year of income in which the capital is actually expended by the investor for example, under the common type of investment arrangements, at the time that the money is paid into the relevant production account . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise: '. . . at the time that the money is paid into the relevant production account'. A subsequent clause in the statement adds that unless the film is ultimately completed the deduction will be disallowed. The important point to note is that, according to that statement, at the time the money is paid into a production account-before a film has been produced-it will be eligible for deduction from that year's taxable income at the rate of 150 per cent. That proposition would have been incredibly expensive to public revenue, and still is. It was also, because of that production account provision, an open-ended invitation to tax dodgers to defer taxation without ever making a film. All they had to do was pay the money into a production account. They got their tax deduction of 150 per cent for that year and in the next year could argue with the Deputy Commissioner about whether or not they had made a film. </PARA>
<PARA> If such a provision had been put in the Act-subsequently it was dropped-the only way of avoiding the deferral on a year by year basis of virtually unlimited tax liabilities would have been to vest in somebody an arbitrary power to decide whose production account was legitimate and whose was not. That would have been possible, but it would have been very bad law. I am sure that even a majority of the members of the Liberal Party would agree that such arbitrary power to decide what is a legitimate production account, one which qualifies, and what is not should not be vested, if at all avoidable, in any individual. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also possible, because of options to vary provisional tax, that the tax benefits could actually be obtained before the money was paid into a production account. Provisional taxpayers have until the end of March-it is not unusual, on a de facto basis, for one to have the option of a somewhat later date-to vary the provisional tax which has been assessed by the Australian Taxation Office in respect of the current financial year's income. Thus, a provisional taxpayer intending to pay into a production account some time in June-I have no doubt that this has been done-would have varied, on the personal option basis, the provisional tax liability normally due for payment on 31 March. In other words, he would gain a taxation benefit-assessed taxation would be deferred or avoided-before he had actually paid the money into the production account, let alone made a film. An oversight in respect to that occurred in even the Australian Financial Review editorial on the subject. Although quite rightly the editorial was highly critical of the whole proposition, for that reason it understated the case against this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> I have absolutely no doubt that if not the loudest squeals, then certainly the heaviest push, which forced the Government backdown last week on the production account provision would have been provoked by the tax dodge which would have produced a concession before money was even paid out or a film made. Tax dodgers would have been participating in the scheme effectively from the end of March of this year, through varying their provisional tax, and if that had been subsequently disallowed they would have had some awkward explanations to make to the Deputy Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course the Treasury people, who are infinitely more numerate than is the Prime Minister and possibly even than television make-up girls, realised very quickly the potential for deferral on a year by year basis of virtually unlimited amounts of tax liability if that production account clause remained. Therefore, a fortnight ago when the legislation finally was introduced after a protracted struggle, that provision was dropped. That was film tax rort Mark II. The eligibility under Mark II for the 150 per cent write-off was not to be available until the film was concluded, whereas under the 18 December definitive statement, it would have been available as soon as the money was paid into a production account. That alteration closed off the opportunity for deferral of tax liabilities by the pure tax dodgers who, I emphasise, need never have even made a film. All they had to do to qualify was to pay into a production account. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it opened up two other problems. First, it provided an obvious incentive for making 'quickies', because the film had to be completed before the tax provision would become available. The point that Senator Puplick made about provisional taxpayers and the option to vary-although unfortunately I did not see his table-might have some effect on that but would not entirely cancel it out. There is still, with or without considering the implications of provisional tax and the option to vary, a definite incentive to make 'quickies' which, incidentally, would be fine for owners of television stations who also happened to own a film company. That is true of one well-known media magnate, perhaps two, but certainly of the well-known Rupert Murdoch. Perhaps we can see his influence behind this legislation as well. </PARA>
<PARA> For the Government the second problem of that change was that it upset the articulate lobby, although I emphasise that all the benefits which were available under the original proposition, Mark I, to people who actually made films, as distinct from those who exploited a stupid suggested law to defer tax liability without making films, were still available under proposition Mark II-and indeed are available under Mark III-except that the year in which they could claim the benefit may have been affected. </PARA>
<PARA> I have referred to the oversight in the editorial of the Australian Financial Review. The Melbourne Age, which is another one of this country's leading newspapers, in rightly condemning this proposition, also understated the case against it by saying, in an editorial of last Saturday:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . income from their investment (should the film make a profit) will be tax free until the income exceeds 50 per cent of the outlay. Few films actually show a profit. </PARA>
<PARA>I touched on this matter earlier. The implication-although it could have been expressed more clearly-is that the film income which is tax free is that which is derived after 100 per cent of the capital investment has been recovered by income. That is not the way it is. The income which is tax free is not that which represents between 100 per cent and 150 per cent of the original investment. In fact, it is the income which is between one per cent and 50 per cent of the original investment. The fact that two of the nation's best newspapers, whilst opposing the proposition, did not grasp fully the dimensions of the rort, is highly significant. The Government incompetence and irresponsibility was beyond belief. That was Mark II and that stood until last week. It was threatened last Sunday week-on 31 May-when the Prime Minister attended a dinner for, I understand, the National Institute of Dramatic Art. The lobbyists there caught him on a bit of a binge and, in what the Australian Financial Review euphemistically described as an oddly-worded speech, the Prime Minister promised to review the change made in Mark II, which was to insist that the film actually be completed before the tax benefits became available. That produced Mark III, which was the same as Mark II except that money which had already been committed to a production account between 18 December and 27 May qualified for the 150 per cent write-off in this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the short term cost to revenue of that backdown could be as high as $10m. The cost of the whole proposal-implicity admitted in the total investment figure which the Treasurer gave the other day-is $30m, against the $2m fraudulent original Government estimate which is now being blamed on the industry. Apart from being incredibly expensive in their final form both Mark II and Mark III provide, if not an incentive to make bad films, certainly an incentive to complete films quickly so that the tax benefits can be obtained. With or without provisional tax, there is no getting away from that fact. There is an incentive to complete films as quickly as possible. People who are going to make quality films of the type for which the Australian film industry, rightly, has an enviable reputation will find it difficult if not impossible to make those quality films within one financial year. They will be in the position of being unable to attract the limited supply of film making resources, as Senator Puplick has already mentioned. They will not be able to bid those resources away from the manufacturers of the 'quickies' who are interested in a quick return, at the expense of the public revenue, rather than in making quality films. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that both Mark II and Mark III would be and will be deterrents to the production of quality films. It is axiomatic that a production subsidy would be a more cost effective way of assisting quality film production than any of the propositions put forward. It would be more cost effective because the benefits of that flow directly into the industry. The benefits of Mark I, Mark II or Mark III of this proposal flow substantially, if not entirely, not to the film industry but to the tax avoiders. Channelling any given quantity of public assistance into the Australian Film Corporation would probably be an even more effective way. Perhaps that has something to do with Senator Puplick's hostility to the Film Corporation. Money channelled to the Film Corporation cannot be syphoned off by tax dodgers. The record of the Government and the Prime Minister, in particular, on this issue is the type of record that would be expected from an innumerate president of a banana republic. As I said earlier, the full dimensions and the full horror of this proposition have not been grasped even by those editorial writers in the nation's leading newspapers who justifiably condemned the situation. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which shows the position from the viewpoint of both the public revenue and the individual investor. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The table read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Investment of $1m by Investor Paying Marginal Tax Rate 60 per cent and Assuming Film Producing Income of $0.5m</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Investment = 1.0; tax deduction = 1.5; tax saving = 0.9</PARA>
<PARA> Film income = 0.5; tax-free; investor income = 0.5</PARA>
<PARA> Initial outlay = $1m; net return = $1.4m</PARA>
<PARA> Tax revenue forgone, $1.2m (i.e. 0.9 immediate reduction in tax payable, plus tax forgone on $0.5m film revenue = $0.3m)</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The table shows that an individual investor, providing he is paying the maximum marginal tax rate of 60 per cent, who invests money in a film-I know now that the film has to be completed, so they will make a 'quickie'-will attain an immediate return in the form of a remission of tax liability equal to 90 per cent of the investment. In other words, if this investor puts $100,000 into a film he will reduce his tax assessment by $90,000. If the film returns income equal to 10 per cent of the cost of making the film the investor recovers the other 10 per cent. In other words, the break-even position for the investor is a film that produces 10 per cent of its own cost. All revenue between 10 per cent and 50 per cent of cost in the form of revenue is tax free profit to the investor. For an investment of $100,000 in a film which generates income equal to only 50 per cent of its cost-in other words, a dismal commercial failure-an investor will receive total benefits of $140,000, $120,000 of which is at the cost of the public revenue. Income, if any, above 50 per cent of the production cost will be taxed in the normal way. For that taxpayer, the public revenue would effectively get 60 per cent of it and the investor would get 40 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is the situation from the point of view of the investor. What is the situation from the public revenue point of view? The minimal cost to the public revenue will be 90 per cent of the cost of making the film. The maximum cost to the public revenue, which is maximised at an income to the film equal to 50 per cent of its production cost, is an additional 30 per cent of the production cost because that is the taxation forgone on what otherwise would have been taxable income. In other words, the cost to the public revenue of making these films under this proposition will fall somewhere between 90 per cent and 120 per cent of the cost of making the film. It should not be too hard to deduce from that that it would be cheaper for the Government to make the films itself; to fund the films wholly and to give them away to whoever wanted them. The Senate is being asked to support legislation which will be more expensive to the public revenue than the proposition that the Government should entirely foot the bill for the production of films and then give them away. </PARA>
<PARA> I will have one last word on the investor who, for example, has $100,000 to invest, who puts the money into a film and who pays the maximum marginal tax rate. Let us assume the investor makes a film every year, that it shows a 50 per cent return-income equal to 50 per cent of its cost-that he puts the funds back each year for five years. Would any honourable senator like to hazard a guess as to what the investor finishes up with at the end of five years for his $100,000 initial investment? The answer is $538,000. That is 40 per cent interest compounded for five years. Fortunately, I think there will be some physical constraints which will prevent too many people actually achieving that sort of unearned capital gain at the expense of the public revenue. But I suspect that people in control of film making companies and television broadcasters will devise some way of going pretty close to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now refer specifically to Division 10BA of the Bill and the exclusions qualifications. Among the exclusions are a film forming part of a drama program series that is, or is intended to be, of a continuing nature and a training film. I am not criticising the people who drafted the legislation. Given a mad government which is committed to passing bad and stupid legislation the blame for any defects certainly should not be attributed to the people who had no option but to draft the provision the best way they could. The question of intention arises; the provision refers to series intended to be of a continuing nature. Again, there is that problem of arbitrary power being given to somebody. Not only is arbitrary power being given to somebody but also it is subject to appeal to the courts. Those provisions relating to intention have been one of the long-standing errors in the whole taxation Act. When one writes sections such as that into the taxation Act whereby one has to determine the intention of somebody, when quite clearly it is impossible on any objective basis to determine what the intention was, it is arbitrary power and bad law and it opens up potential for tax avoidance, particularly for those people who are both film makers and television producers. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an appalling piece of legislation. It is an insult to the intelligence of every member of this Parliament to ask that they support it. I have absolutely no doubt that if the few numerate members of the Liberal Party had a clear choice they would certainly vote against this legislation. Most of them, perhaps all of them, and certainly all of the Opposition would provide assistance to the film industry. We have a great respect for the quality of films that has been turned out, but this is not a scheme to provide provision for the film industry on a cost-effective basis. It has built into it now, both in its Mark II and Mark III forms, provisions which will probably sound the death knell of the quality Australian feature film industry because the people who want to make quality films will not be able to compete in the market place for the limited film resources against those who are primarily interested in tax dodging and, therefore, in turning out quickies. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hamer will follow me in this debate. I will be surprised if he does not make some pertinent observations about this Bill. In particular I would like him to comment on the points I have raised and to justify his support for the Bill-if he is going to vote for the Bill; I assume he is-in view of the enormous cost to revenue, the enormous potential gains at public expense to investors through exploiting the provisions for tax avoidance, the deterrent effect to the making of quality films and the fact that it will be cheaper for the Government to make the films on its own account and give them away than to assist the film industry in this way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian film industry has had a long and turbulent history. Film production started early in Australia, the first film-which included footage of the Melbourne Cup-being screened in 1896, only one year after the world's first public film screening in Paris. In 1906 the Tait Brothers' film The True Story of the Kelly Gang was one of the first feature length films made anywhere in the world. The early years of the Australian film industry were dominated by the figure of Raymond Longford whose life mirrored the fortunes of the Australian film industry. He made 31 films between 1911 and 1934, including Australia's first screen classic, The Sentimental Bloke, made in 1919. After 1934 he was prevented from making any further films, not only because of problems with financial backing but also because of the very great difficulty of gaining public release for any Australian feature film at that time. This gifted film maker ended his working life as a night watchman on the Sydney wharves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By the 1930s the once flourishing Australian film industry was in ruins. It had been hit by the flood of American imports, by the arrival of the talkies and by the domination of the cinema outlets by large foreign-controlled chains which were not interested in exhibiting Australian made films. The consequences were catastrophic. In 1930 only three feature films were made compared with 16 in 1926 and 18 in 1916. The first 25 post-World War II years were also barren for the Australian film industry. Feature film production was almost non-existent. The British film industry made a few films here in the 1940s and the 1950s and the occasional American unit came to Australia. But these were not Australian films. They were American or British versions of Australian stories made for foreign audiences, with foreign actors making peculiar attempts to be Australians. Admittedly, a few Australian feature films were made during this period, mostly by Chips Rafferty but, frankly, they were not very good films. In any case, they could not be properly distributed through the foreign-controlled outlets. The Commonwealth Film Unit did turn out competently made documentaries but they could not match the far more imaginative productions of the Canadians, for instance. </PARA>
<PARA> All in all, until little more than 10 years ago, the Australian film industry was a mess and it would have been a brave person who would have predicted that it would get out of it. Yet now, in 1981, the mood has completely changed. Our film industry is internationally acclaimed. Look at the roll-call of success: Sunday Too Far Away, Picnic at Hanging Rock and Caddie in 1975; The Devil's Playground and Storm Boy in 1976; The Getting of Wisdom, The Picture Show Man and The Last Wave in 1977; The Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith, News Front and Mouth to Mouth in 1978; Cathy's Child, My Brilliant Career and Mad Max in 1979; and Manganinnie and Breaker Morant in 1980. Of course, not all the films made have been successful. More than 125 feature films have been completed since the film revival started and only a small proportion has been financially or artistically successful-by no means always the same thing, by the way. </PARA>
<PARA> By 1980 only 16 per cent of the feature films the Australian Film Commission had invested in had made a profit, that is, less than one in six was profitable: 49 per cent-nearly half-had brought in no money whatsoever to the producers. In other words, they had not covered their print and distribution costs. The other 35 per cent had covered their costs and brought back something to the producers but not enough to cover production costs. Yet this is a common pattern of film making everywhere. It is a high risk industry with many failures. What has been astonishing about the new Australian film industry has, in fact, been the number of films that have been artistic and critical successes. However, a depressing number have been far more artistically successful overseas than at home, for we still have the remnants of a cultural cringe, though we have no reason to hang on to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The new wave of Australian films is receiving praise all round the world, with remarks being made such as 'maturity', 'intelligence' and 'clarity' or, as an English critic said about one film:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . exciting, subtle, beautifully made, beautifully photographed, superbly acted and extremely moving-I regard it as just about perfect. </PARA>
<PARA>The prominent English actor James Mason recently confessed that he was 'tremendously jealous' of the Australian industry. Formal international recognition is starting to come too with Jack Thompson winning a best supporting actor award at Cannes, Judy Davis winning the best actress British Academy Award and no less than three nominations for this year's American Academy Award oscars. Of course, it is not only feature films that have been in the sensational new wave. Bruce Petty won an American Oscar in 1976 for the best animated film and documentaries such as The Last Tasmanian and Frontline have been winning widespread acclaim. </PARA>
<PARA> What caused this dramatic turn around? I think the most important thing was that by 1970 Australia's cultural cringe-a deplorable expression but all too true-was starting to recede a little. For this we owe a lot to the post-war tide of non-British migrants. While we remained an intellectual and cultural dependency of Britain the cringe would have stayed. As part of this developing sense of national identity the establishment of the Australian Council for the Arts-now the Australia Council-in 1969 was both a reflection and a catalyst. The Australia Council has had an enormous influence on the arts in Australia. Perhaps it can be seen most dramatically in the theatre, an activity closely related to film. Before 1970 no one wanted to know about an Australian play, yet in the years 1975 to 1978 a total of 175 Australian plays were given their first production by the 18 major drama companies. </PARA>
<PARA> In the film world, the establishment by the Gorton Government in 1969 of the Experimental Film Fund was of critical importance. It was part of a package approved by Prime Minister Gorton. The package consisted of a film school, a film bank along Canadian lines to support feature films, and an experimental film fund to make it possible for new film makers to have a go. Gorton was something of a maverick nationalist and nothing of a film buff but he was the central figure in the development of the new Australian film industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, he did. The film bank, initially called the Australian Film Development Corporation and later the Australian Film Commission, started in 1971 and the Australian Film and Television School in 1973, having been slightly delayed by Gorton's loss of office. In the last five years the Australian Film Commission has supported about 50 feature films, and without doubt it has played a major role in the Australian film renaissance. The example of the Australian Film Commission was soon copied by the States until it seemed that every State had to have a film corporation in the same way as every newly emerging nation has to have its own airline. Of course, by no means all the money invested in films came from government. Two of the film distribution chains-Roadshow Distributors Pty Ltd and the Greater Union Organisation Pty Ltd-have been substantial investors. The third-Hoyts Theatres Ltd, which is controlled by Twentieth Century Fox-has been a minor investor. Other investors have covered an extraordinary range, from the Bundaberg Sugar Co. Ltd investing in The Mango Tree to the International Women's Year Committee investing in Caddie.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The trouble is that costs are steadily rising. The Adventures of Barry McKenzie, which was made in 1972, cost $250,000. Picnic at Hanging Rock cost $450,000 in 1975 and My Brilliant Career cost $890,000 in 1979. A realistic average cost for a film now is probably $1.5m. There is no way an average film can recover its budget in Australia alone as cinema audiences have actually declined since colour television was introduced. As a rough rule, for a film to break even it has to gross $5 at the box office for every $1 invested. There is no way a $1.5m film could gross $7.5m in Australia. So such a film, if it is to break even or actually make a profit, has to make substantial sales overseas. It is vital for us to remember that the films that have done best overseas-critically, anyway-have been the distinctively Australian ones. Attempts to make films specifically for the American market have usually been disasters. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this legislation is to try to improve the trickle of non-government money coming into the film industry. The Australian Labor Party seems to abhor this approach, if Senator Ryan is representing the ALP's attitude accurately. It seems to want government controlled production. In fact, it was said by Senator Walsh that the Government could more economically make films itself and then give them away. The problem is that I doubt whether anyone would want government controlled films. We are seeking to get away from too much government intervention, to encourage support of the film industry by others. To that end, in April 1978 the Government announced a scheme to permit investment in Australian films to be written off income tax over two years instead of 25 years. 'The legislation contains safeguards against tax avoidance', said the Treasurer (Mr Howard), hopefully, at the time. The heartbreaking thing about tax incentives for the arts is that most of them seem to be immediately corrupted by the tax avoidance industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that in a moment. I think we have sufficient safeguards in this legislation but certainly it is an area we have to watch. As I was saying, the effect of the 1978 tax concession was not very great on film production but it was certainly very great on tax avoidance for by August 1980 the Treasurer was announcing retrospective measures against expenditure recoupment schemes on film investments, including tax gearing-a tax manipulation scheme that was giving up to $5 deduction for every $1 invested. Such schemes were designed to provide tax benefits whether films were successful or not. Perhaps the Commissioner of Taxation was somewhat heavy handed with his crackdown, for some genuine investors felt that their 100 per cent write-off over two years was at risk, the money dried up and production dropped to a minimum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clearly something had to be done. Although I was a lobbyist for an improved scheme, I must say that I was a bit startled by the generosity of the scheme announced last December and implemented by the present Bill in modified form. The scheme provides for an income tax deduction of 150 per cent of the value of an investment in a film production. The person who invests $100,000 in a film would have permissible tax deductions of $150,000. At the maximum marginal rate of 60 per cent, that would be worth $90,000, so at a net cost to himself of $10,000 he would have a $100,000 investment in a film. Of course he might lose his $10,000. Promotion and distribution costs have to be covered before there is any return to the producers. Quite a few films in the past-and certainly there will be as many in the future-have not returned anything to the producers. If there is a return to the investors there will be an exemption from income tax for the first 50 per cent of the investment. This is pretty generous. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I was startled by the generosity of the scheme. I was even more startled to hear from the Treasurer that the Treasury's original estimate of the cost of the scheme was $2m a year. I think that figure came from the Australian Film Commission. The Treasurer has since revised his estimate to $20m a year, a fact which must be causing some teeth to grind in the Treasury. Actually, I think the cost is more likely to be $30m a year, based on 20 feature films at an average cost of $1.5m each. By the time that figure is reached Treasury officials will be grinding their gums. I offer them one consoling thought. Although $30m is a very great sum-it is more than the total grant to the Australia Council, for instance-the Taxation Commissioner might not have been able to collect the money anyway. It might have gone in paper tax avoidance schemes which have no redeeming social benefit. At least this money from the tax avoidance industry will have a useful output. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to a key point. The only justification the Government can have for such large subsidies for the film industry is that it will raise the level of Australian film culture and the output of high quality films. There can be no other justification. So let us look at what is intended to be helped and then at the safeguards to prevent abuse. The tax concessions will apply only to films produced for exhibition to the public in cinemas or on television. They must be feature films, including animated feature length movies and telemovies, documentaries or mini-series of television drama. I must say I was delighted to see documentaries included in the scheme. We are making some excellent documentaries-for example, Frontline and The Last Tasmanian-and a first class documentary seen on overseas television by an audience of millions may do more to improve Australia's international image than anything else we could do. </PARA>
<PARA> What controls are there to prevent abuses of this scheme? There have been suggestions of various uses of the scheme by the sleazy tax avoidance industry whose morality would make Al Capone look like a saintly figure. There have been allegations of flagrant cost inflation through the use of excessive brokerage fees and commissions-up to 45 per cent has been mentioned-spurious management charges, so-called producer fees and doubtful overheads. Several suggested schemes have involved special loans to investors so as to give tax deductions at no real cost to themselves. This last gimmick was one of those that wrecked the 1978 scheme. These devices should not work. The Commissioner of Taxation has the authority, which I am sure he will use, to disallow such expenditure as not being directly related to the production of a film. But this danger of abuse is what has forced the Treasurer to alter the scheme so that the tax concession is not available until a film has been completed and is earning money-that is, until it has obtained its copyright-although the original promise to permit the concession in the year of expenditure will be allowed for films started before 28 May. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to pay a tribute to the Treasurer, who spent many hours with some of us examining various suggestions for improving the assistance to genuine film makers without leaving the scheme wide open for the tax avoidance industry. Sadly, we could not find a scheme better than the one we now have, which, by the way, is still a very generous scheme. Much of the criticism of the changes has been stirred up by the tax avoidance industry and some of its acceptance has been by people who do not understand how the provisional tax system works. </PARA>
<PARA> A key role in all of this will be played by the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson). He has to certify a film as having a significant Australian content and also that it is an eligible film produced for exhibition to the public. It remains to be seen how the Minister will interpret the expressions 'significant Australian content' and 'produced for exhibition to the public'. The Department of Home Affairs and Environment has produced a formidable questionnaire to be filled in, but tough interpretation of 'significant Australian content' will be essential if the aim of raising the standard of Australian film culture is to be achieved. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the document headed 'Application for Certification of a Film as an Eligible Film with Significant Australian Content'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So far, so good, but who is looking at the quality of the films? Someone has said that it would be possible for a man to make a blue movie starring his mistress, pay her a fee of $300,000 and claim the lot as a tax deduction. The film would have a significant Australian content and could be exhibited in the so-called adult movie houses that have sprung up all over the place. This may be an extreme case, but how do we weed out the rubbish? The market place is not effective with such a heavily subsidised scheme. I toyed with the idea of moving an amendment imposing an additional requirement in order to qualify for the tax deduction-that at least 10 per cent of an investment should be put up by one or more of the seven film commissions. At least, I thought, the film commissions should be aiming at quality. The trouble is that their track record is ambiguous, to put it at its kindest. But we may have to come back to such a scheme if the film making boom shows signs of heading off in the wrong direction with tax avoidance quickies being made which will damage rather than raise the level of film culture in Australia. As a possible refinement of this scheme of control, it might be worth looking at having as an alternative a certificate from the Film and Television Producers' Association of Australia that the script is a developed one, the production arrangements and costs are reasonable and the film, if produced, is likely to be creditable. The Opposition seems to underestimate the extent to which we can trust film makers. In my experience they are very honourable men and I reject totally the description of them by Senator Walsh as being 'a noisy, greedy, egocentric bunch of tax dodgers'. I think that is a most reprehensible description of a very honourable group of creative people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The type of control I am talking about is all in the future. The Treasurer has said that he will review the working of it, to see that it is not going off in the wrong direction with tax avoidance quickies being made, in six to 12 months. We might have to look at such a scheme then. I hope that this type of quality control, which by its very nature is clumsy, will not be necessary. But we must be prepared to act if it looks as if this wonderful scheme is being distorted. It is a wonderful scheme. It looks as if soon we may well be producing feature films at a rate of about 30 a year, plus a greatly increased output of documentaries and shorts. We have the chance to make a dramatic impact on the world cinema scene and an impact on mass television audiences. The increased affluence of the industry will enable all involved to be paid a fair rate for their work. In the past they have been badly underpaid. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there are dangers. There is always a reverse side to any coin. There is no doubt that the Treasury knives are waiting for any transgressions and it is up to the industry itself to try to police the scheme to see that they do not happen. This waiting in the Treasury will be particularly thorough because the loss to revenue is going to be at least 10 times as great as was originally thought. This is of course the reason why it is so desperately important that the scheme should not be exploited by unscrupulous tax avoiders and also that the quality and ultimate international prestige of the films produced should match the Government's investment. But these are not all the dangers. There are probably at present enough first quality teams to make four feature films at any time. Although plans have been announced for training schemes to produce new production crews, this will take time. It is not the top people that we are going to be short of. There are plenty of well-trained top people just waiting for their chance. The scarcity will be in the assistants-the assistant directors, assistant cameramen, gaffers, grips, boom operators, continuity people and so on. It will probably take a year to train them in the numbers needed. In the meantime, some of the new wave of films will be produced by relatively inexperienced crews. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the consequences of this will be that the ordinary laws of supply and demand, coupled with the new affluence of the film industry, will bid up the price of the experienced crews. This is already happening with high budget films such as The Earthling. A substantial increase in film industry pay is desirable, but it must not go too far. There is a further danger here. If the present boom is followed by a relative slump, there will be pressure for the kind of feather-bedding that is chronic in Britain in order to provide work for the surplus crews. This would of course only make the slump worse and recovery from it less likely. One of the most impressive things about our recent film production has been the economy in the use of resources, largely as a result of the use of a sort of sub-contracting system among the production crew. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is the question of exhibition. If the top estimate of 50 feature films a year comes true-and talk of 170 or 200 films a year, as Senator Ryan was saying, is absolute nonsense-that will be one world premiere a week. Where on earth will we find the cinemas? Of the 30 or so feature films being produced in 1981, only 10 or 12 so far have firm distribution arrangements. The possibility of reasonable distribution should be one of the things closely watched by the Department of Home Affairs and Environment. The Australian Film Institute, with its cinema outlets in Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart, can exhibit some Australian films which would otherwise not achieve commercial release, but there is a limit to how many. Besides, it would be totally unreasonable to expect the AFI to exhibit low quality films made as a tax lurk. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator. The final danger-and the most deadly-is that we will cease to have an Australian film industry, and have instead a mid-Atlantic film industry subsidised by the Australian taxpayers. The ghastly examples of Britain and Canada should always be in our minds. There are ominous signs of stirrings in this direction-Tony Ginnane's execrable Harlequin for instance. Here again the attitude of the Department of Home Affairs and Environment will be crucial. How it defines 'significant Australian content' will determine whether we continue to have an Australian film industry as opposed to a film industry producing films in Australia. For we must have the confidence to be ourselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That brings me to the role of the various film commissions. Obviously, their funding role will diminish greatly. It can be said, I think, that government funding created and saw the revived film industry through its first decade. Now we are in a dramatic new phase. This is not to say that there is no role for the film commissions. Script development is an obvious need. Scripts are perhaps the weakest part of our film industry. Promotion, particularly overseas promotion, is the other obvious need. The Australian Film Commission, after a shaky start when promotion was in the hands of the Film Australia people with no knowledge of feature films, has now reached the stage where it can perform effectively in overseas promotion. Of course, there is more than script development and promotion for the Australian Film Commission to do. It has to run Film Australia, the Government's documentary film-making unit. It has to administer the vitally important creative development fund, the seed bed of the next generation of film makers. It has to support the Australian Film Institute as a key organisation in raising the level of the film culture in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As if that were not enough, I should like to give the Australian Film Commission more to do. I mentioned earlier the vital role the Minister for Home Affairs and his advisers have to play in administering this new scheme. He has to decide whether a proposed film has sufficient Australian content. He has to decide whether the proposed distribution arrangements are honest and adequate. This troubles me on two counts. First, neither the Minister nor the public servants working for him in this field are likely to have any practical knowledge of the film industry. To put it bluntly, they are just not qualified to make such vital decisions. Secondly, the concentration of power of this type in the Minister's hands violates the arm's length policy of arts administration which we are supposed to be following. The Minister's predecessor recently relinquished his power of approval of proposed productions of Film Australia because he had found it embarrassing and inappropriate. The sort of power the Minister will exercise over proposed films under this new scheme will be a hundred times more embarrassing. The idea of an arm's length policy in the arts is that one takes funding decisions out of the political arena and gives them to a body of experts, operating under broad public guidelines from the Minister. The expert body makes the decisions and it takes the flack from the disgruntled, who always outnumber the satisfied. Such delegation is sound politics and sensible administration. For that reason I suggest the Minister should delegate his powers under this new film scheme to the Australian Film Commission. I agree with Senator Puplick that a further overhaul of the Australian Film Commission is very desirable. </PARA>
<PARA> It is vital that this new scheme should be well administered and should have the confidence of the public in general and the Treasury in particular. In the last decade we have arrived on the world scene as a significant, though minor, film producer. If this scheme is wisely administered and sensibly used by the film industry we have the chance to become a major film producer with dramatic effects on Australia's international prestige. For films are of universal appeal. After all, films are the one new art form of the twentieth century. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is considering the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1981. We have had four very interesting speeches giving a variety of views. I pay tribute to Senator Hamer. He was too modest to state that he is the Chairman of the Australian Film Institute which is carrying out an important function in this area. As a member of the Australia Council, he is closely involved in the administration of the arts in Australia. I also pay tribute to Senator Puplick for the speech he made. I say to my colleague and my former research worker that he has had a very distinguished first three years in the Senate. I think the speech he made today set out the issues before the Senate. I wish him well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matters before the Senate have been set out by Government speakers who have stated that what we are intending to do is make it possible to produce more Australian films and encourage the film industry in this country. The Government's decision has been one which, as my colleagues have pointed out, will seek to encourage the industry, expand film production, offer incentives to Australians to participate themselves, develop more pride in what we can do ourselves in the area of film production, give Australians more opportunities to involve themselves at every level and work in the film industry to develop the skills to which Senator Hamer has referred in some detail in the speech which he has just made. Because the scheme is designed to operate by way of taxation incentives and inducements, it is being presented as an Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill. It was to some of the details of the scheme as it will apply to income tax law that Senator Walsh addressed his remarks. I must say that it was sometimes quite difficult to know who was speaking for the Opposition. The messages that came from the two speakers from the Opposition were quite disparate and separate in their emphases. I hope that Opposition senators share our delight in the new opportunities which will flow to those actually working in films in Australia from what the Government is proposing to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is an important one. The scheme has been subjected to much public examination and gaze. It has been discussed at some length. It has also been discussed at some length in the debate. Time is pressing in the Senate. We have a considerable program ahead of us. Because of the exhaustive and comprehensive way in which the issues have been canvassed and in which questions have been answered I do not intend to go over the issues again. Honourable senators may raise particular questions during the Committee stage which will follow. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill is the long awaited re-write of section 260, the general anti-tax avoidance provision in the Income Tax Assessment Act which has been, of course, notoriously emasculated by the High Court of Australia over the last 20 years and for most of that period has been a hopelessly inadequate weapon against tax avoidance. The Opposition does not oppose this Bill but we do have a number of major reservations about the approach which has been adopted by the Government and which we seek to explain, not in any carping spirit but rather a constructive one. We regard the fight against tax avoidance as one which should proceed, so far as humanly possible, on a broad bipartisan basis because tax avoidance is such a destructive phenomenon in the community at large.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It continues to be a problem of quite staggering dimensions with the war upon it, as a result, properly remaining and continuing to be a matter of the highest parliamentary priority. Estimates as to the size of tax avoidance and tax evasion necessarily vary because inevitably it is the sort of thing about which precise information cannot be known. But as a crude rule of thumb it probably remains fair to say that avoidance and evasion, between them, fall into three broad categories each of which produces a loss to revenue and to the community as a whole of something around $1,000m per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> The first category is straight out crude tax evasion, the most obvious example being undisclosed cash transactions. The only way we can really deal with that approach to one's taxation obligations is by heavy criminal sanctions of the kind that were enacted last year and also by effective on the ground enforcement. The size of crude tax evasion is, in fact, probably more than $1,000m per annum but it is really anybody's guess as to how much of that black economy exercise is now going on. </PARA>
<PARA> The second category takes us into the area of avoidance, properly so-called-the distinction being that avoidance is behaviour which is arguably within the literal letter of the law whereas evasion is behaviour which is unapologetically outside it. The category of avoidance is divisible into two. The first kind of avoidance, and the second broad band of things we need to worry about, is avoidance in the form of blatant, contrived, artificial schemes-the kind of notorious scheme like the original Curran scheme and its various successors. These schemes have no conceivable redeeming commercial or family justification. They are recognisable at 40 paces as being wholly immoral tax avoidance schemes. The magnitude of this band of the problem is again hard to assess. These days it is probably a little less than $1,000m, but still very substantial indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The third category, which in terms of the magnitude of the impact on revenue is again of the order of a thousand million dollars, probably plus in this case, is the other kind of avoidance-avoidance in the form of more ambiguous or less obvious artificial arrangements not involving particular kinds of transactions which always, in every case, must necessarily, by their very nature, be avoidance-motivated, but rather arrangements involving income-splitting and tax shelter arrangements of various kinds which may or may not have the character of reprehensible tax avoidance depending on all the circumstances-in the particular context. The kinds of things which have traditionally been involved here are various kinds of family trust arrangements, service trusts in a partnership situation, administration companies of the kind used by professionals, some sorts of exercises involving, for example, inflated mark-ups in the purchases of trading stock and arrangements of this kind which one cannot completely outlaw by their very structure because they may have a legitimate operation in a particular commercial situation but which are capable of being misused in circumstances where there is no real justification for them other than that of tax avoidance and which are, as a result, producing a very significant drain on revenue. Again I suggest that something of the order, in very broad-brush figures, of a thousand million dollars a year is involved. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the sort of situation we are confronted with. For the purposes of the rest of this debate, tax evasion drops out of consideration. What we are concerned with-I want to make this distinction clear-are the two broad categories of tax avoidance, properly so-called. On the one hand there are the crude, blatant, manifestly contrived, artificial schemes and, on the other hand, there are the more ambiguous arrangements of the kind I have described. The traditional legislative strategy for dealing with tax avoidance back in the days before avoidance really did become a significant phenomenon in the community at large was twofold. It was to close off prospectively as many specific loopholes as could possibly be envisaged within the detailed language of the tax legislation and then to back that up with a general anti-avoidance provision, namely section 260. That was the original approach, the original motivation of those who drafted our present tax legislation. That kind of approach worked reasonably well for a number of years. To put on the record what it is that we are talking about-section 260-I seek leave to incorporate the text of existing section 260 into Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The section read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> 260. Every contract, agreement, or arrangement made or entered into, orally or in writing, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, shall so far as it has or purports to have the purpose or effect of in any way, directly or indirectly-</PARA>

<PARA> (b) relieving any person from liability to pay any income tax or make any return;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) defeating, evading, or avoiding any duty or liability imposed on any person by this Act; or</PARA>
<PARA> (d) preventing the operation of this Act in any respect,</PARA>
<PARA>be absolutely void, as against the Commissioner, or in regard to any proceeding under this Act, but without prejudice to such validity as it may have in any other respect or for any other purpose. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That strategy began to miscarry a little over 20 years ago with Newton's case and then the whole succession of familiar High Court cases largely taking real effect and really beginning to bite during the Chief Justiceship of Sir Garfield Barwick. In the course of those cases the language of section 260, which seems on its face to be very broad indeed in giving the Commissioner ample discretion to pick and choose between illegitimate and legitimate schemes, that broad-based language, was steadily read down and reduced to impotence by the High Court in particular cases-the most notorious and recent of which is probably Cridland's case in 1978-inventing and applying what has become known as the 'choice principle'. This is the principle that if the scheme in question consists of the arrangement of the taxpayer's affairs or the casting of a transaction into a particular form so as to attract a tax advantage specifically contemplated by some provision somewhere in the Act, then the scheme is no more than the product of the making of a choice provided for by the Act and is therefore invulnerable to attack. That principle was invented, as I said, by the High Court, particularly under Sir Garfield Barwick and became the vehicle through which the broad-brush discretionary annihilation power vested in the Commissioner by section 260 was emasculated and reduced to complete impotence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Encouraged by this development in the High Court and the failure of the legislature through successive governments to do anything about it-I readily acknowledge that the Labor Government was less active than it might have been in coping with this phenomenon-and perhaps also as a result of various structural problems showing up in the tax legislation-for all these reasons, in recent years tax avoidance has become a rampant phenomenon. It has become necessary for the Government to square up completely again, to confront a wholly new phenomenon and to devise a wholly new legislative strategy for dealing with it. That legislative response of the Government has taken a particular form during the first five years of the Fraser Government which I will describe as soon as we resume after dinner. It is because of the failure of that particular strategy that the Government has now moved to the further strategy that is embodied in this legislation. We will proceed to that also after dinner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Senate will rise tomorrow for the winter recess. I will not be here when senators say farewell to the 12 senators who from tomorrow will no longer be here. Tomorrow will be their last sitting day. I have sought the indulgence of the Senate for a few minutes to say my own personal farewell to those senators who are leaving us. I do not want to mention all of those things that can be found in the Parliamentary Handbook. All the senators who are leaving have made different and significant contributions to the work of the Senate-in parliamentary debates, in committees of the Senate and to their own political party. They have served for different lengths of time and with different attributes, talents and degrees of enthusiasm. I might just say to the six Government senators who are leaving that I propose to send them a copy of my only original artwork which is called Still Life in the Senate and which I am happy to say got the highest price in the Warrnambool art gallery bargain sale. I hope that will be a reminder to them of their time here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Davidson, who I think is the longest serving senator on the Government side-I am not sure about that-was a colleague of mine on the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts. I will remember him for his very diligent work on that Committee, particularly his contribution to broadcasting policy and his concern about television programs for children. I will also remember him for the speech he made last week at the dinner for retiring senators. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Maunsell, has been, I think, a universally liked member of this Senate. He will be remembered for many things but I must make reference to his contribution to Australian culture, Australian history, in the form of that memorable prawn night. In fact, when one of my colleagues was speaking at some length yesterday, I said: 'Can't somebody put on a prawn night for him?' That just shows how much Senator Maunsell's contribution has crept into the language. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sim will be remembered particularly for his thoughtful and courageous contributions over some period to foreign affairs debates and the committees concerned with foreign affairs. I will always remember him-and I apologise to him-because one memorable night I kept, for some unknown reason, calling him Senator 'Slim' instead of Senator Sim. It is a matter of which Senator Bishop, who is now laughing, has continued to remind me over the past two and a half years. I do apologise to Senator 'Slim' for that. I wish him well in his retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick and Senator Neal have been with us for much less time than the other retiring senators have been. Senator Puplick will be remembered for his long and esoteric contributions to debate. I understand that he intends to come back here. We will watch his future career with interest. Senator Neal will be remembered for the very sincere and thoughtful contributions he has made in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> You, Mr President, will be remembered and respected by us all for your courtesy, kindness and gentlemanly conduct of the affairs of the Senate in your period as President. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my personal wish that those Government senators who are retiring will not be lonely in their retirement. I wish to assure them that we on the Opposition side will be doing our best to ensure that a number of their colleagues join them after the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On my side of the Parliament I mention first my colleagues Senators Bishop and Cavanagh. Sometimes I have had disagreements with them. Perhaps they belong to a different generation from mine. But I say in all sincerity that I have always been grateful for their very sound advice. They have both been great Labor men. They understand the Australian Labor Party and its traditions. The advice which they have given me I have valued very much. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McAuliffe has always been, I think, a colourful senator; he has made a colourful contribution to this Parliament. I am personally disappointed that he did not develop more as an economic spokesman for the party but he has made a considerable contribution in that area over some time. Of course, we will all miss him. Senator Melzer is a senator who should not be leaving this place. She is leaving this place because of things which sometimes happen in political parties which involve triumphs of small minds over big ones. I am sure that everybody will agree that she has been a most diligent senator. Again, we wish her well in her retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked Senator Wheeldon what could be said about him and he told me that the nicest and the most accurate thing to say about him was that he had served this Parliament with distinction. He has made great contributions to debates in this place. He has had a distinguished career and his contributions have always been enlivened by a great sense of humor. He leaves as a relatively young man. I like to describe him as 'a relatively young man' because it makes me feel better. I hope that he has a worthwhile career ahead of him in some other field. </PARA>
<PARA> The last senator I mention is our mutual colleague, Senator Justin O'Byrne. There are all sorts of attributes which I could ascribe to Justin O'Byrne. From my point of view his greatest attribute, I suppose, is that anybody who can spend 35 years in the Senate is a man of great fortitude, persistence and courage. He is the father of this place. Again, I think he, like Mr President, is one of the true gentlemen of the Senate. We will all miss him. On my behalf, in a sense, and perhaps on behalf of some of my other colleagues I take this opportunity of saying to all those senators who are leaving us: 'We wish you well in your retirement. We thank you for your contributions to the Senate. We hope that you all enjoy long, healthy, productive and happy retirements'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I might now return the Senate to the much less diverting topic-certainly a less sentimental one-of the Income Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2). I remind the Senate that before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was describing the unhappy state of affairs that had developed with respect to High Court interpretation of the existing general anti-avoidance provision-section 260-and the unhappy implications in terms of that section for the escalation of the tax avoidance industry. The way in which this Government has in office hitherto responded to that situation has been by a series of after-the-event remedial changes to try to correct problems as they have arisen, to plug the loopholes after they have been disclosed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since 1975, there has been a whole succession of such legislative initiatives each occupying some 20 or 30 pages of the statute book and adding in all something over 400 pages to the Income Tax Assessment Act. But none of those remedial pieces of legislation have been fully retrospective in their operation or effect. They may have been retrospective back to the date at which the artificial scheme in question first came to the attention of the Government and first prompted a government announcement of intention to overcome it, but they have never been retrospective back to the date of the first known operation of that scheme. That has resulted in a situation whereby, for successive years-I am now going back five or six years-non-taxpayers willing to participate in highly blatant, contrived avoidance arrangements of this kind have been getting a start on the Commissioner of Taxation. Usually they have had one year's advantage from this scheme in question before it has come to the notice of the Commissioner of Taxation, or come to his notice in a sufficient way as to enable legislative steps to be taken to retrieve the situation for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The search for new loopholes has been continuing year after year. The problem of artificial schemes has simply not been solved by this kind of legislative strategy. Not surprisingly, the Government has sought an alternative anti-avoidance legislative strategy. It is this search for an alternative in terms of a catch-all anti-avoidance provision, prompted by the demise of the original section 260 and the necessity to replace it, which has produced the legislation before us tonight. Admittedly, it must be said it is before us after a really quite extraordinarily long gestation period-an unhappily long gestation period because all of us have been wanting to see much more effective remedial legislative techniques in operation much sooner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe, but Senator Messner will see that we are a bit quicker when our turn comes in 1983. What people, I think, were expecting was a redraft of section 260, a new provision which would enable the Commissioner to range effectively over the whole field of tax avoidance or what I have described as the two basic areas of it-in the first place, the blatant contrived schemes, and, in the second place, the ambiguous arrangements of the kinds I earlier endeavoured to describe. What we in fact have in the Bill before us now is something rather narrower. What we have is an extensive new Part IVA of the Bill which is clearly designed to have an effect and which clearly is capable only of having a potential effect in a narrow area, and that is the area of blatant and contrived schemes. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) has been at pains to make it clear that this is not intended to bite in any way on the area I have described as ambiguous arrangements. It is intended to exclude completely, as the Treasurer said on numerous occasions in the debate in the other place, what are described as 'ordinary business or family dealings', even, it seems, if those business or family dealings have a colour of tax avoidance about them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me describe what the Government seems to have succeeded in doing in this Part IVA before us. It has produced an anti-avoidance provision which has three main characteristics. First, it very narrowly defines the schemes to which the Part is to apply. There are a number of ways in which this narrow definition operates in terms of the behaviour which is encompassed by the provisions. There is an omission of preliminary steps or partial steps in the creation of an avoidance arrangement. Really, one has to have gone the whole way and to have fully completed the anticipated plan of action before this provision begins to bite. Again in this respect the definition of 'tax benefit' has been quite narrowly defined in such a way as to refer really only to specific identifiable deductions which actually have been obtained or specific identifiable amounts which have not been included in assessable income. That is to be compared with the kind of definition of tax benefit which would include anything which amounted, in effect, to less income tax being payable than otherwise would have been the case. The other aspect of this first element in the Commissioner's plan is its circumscription of the tax avoidance purpose to situations in which the avoidance purpose is in fact the dominant one as distinct from simply being one purpose among others or being merely a less than incidental purpose. In this variety of ways, first of all there is a very deliberate legislative narrowing of the kinds of schemes and arrangements to which the part is to apply. </PARA>
<PARA> The second main characteristic that comes through this part IVA as we now see it is that no broad statutory discretions are vested in the Commissioner of Taxation and the boards of review either, in the first place, to decide whether a tax benefit as defined has been obtained or, in the second place, to determine whether that tax benefit was obtained for a tax avoidance purpose. What we have is a series of very precisely worded objective tests for application, in essence by the courts, to determine when these requirements are being satisfied. It is not the Commissioner, in the exercise of a broad discretion, exercising a feel on the ground for the character of the situation, that is to prevail here. It is the very precisely worded objective tests which are set out in very precise terms in the language of the draft. </PARA>
<PARA> The third and remaining characteristic of Part IVA is that it creates heavy penalties. Automatically applicable, non-discretionary, non-flexible penalties are imposed upon people found to have offended this general anti-avoidance provision equivalent to 200 per cent of the tax avoided. So the tax avoider who is caught out as a result of the operation of this scheme will have to pay not only the additional tax that should have been payable but also he will have to pay this amount twice over by way of a penalty. There is no doubt that that will have a deterrent effect of some significance, but clearly, and I think this point is an important one, it will encourage the courts to be very careful indeed in determining how and when this section should be applied. They will undoubtedly read it in the same way as they read, and properly so, all substantial penal provisions on the statute book. They will read it in such a way that it gives the benefit of the doubt to the person who is subject to these very heavy, very savage penalties. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that Treasurer Howard wants the courts to operate in this way. He has indicated that that heavy penalty aspect of it and the precision with which the tests have been drafted and so on is very much part of the legislative approach that has here been adopted. He seems to take the view that this combination of techniques will be appropriate to bite on at least the blatant, the contrived, the artificial schemes. But what has happened, and what seems to us to be very likely to be the case, is that though it may bite on those schemes it will not bite on anything else. We have a situation where Part IV as it has been drafted represents an application of traditional drafting techniques. It is our concern that as a consequence it will achieve only traditional results, that is, not very successful results. As I have said, it may be successful. It may prove to be successful against the cruder paper schemes of the Curran variety. </PARA>
<PARA> However, even in that respect it cannot be expected to get quick results. The innumerable complex provisions which now will have to be carefully applied, not only by the Commissioner but also by the courts-undoubtedly they will be second guessing what the Commissioner does in this respect, because that is the way the legislation is drafted-will have to be interpreted. There will be prospects of appeals and counter-appeals and endless delays. It is for those reasons that we have people like the appalling Peter Clyne publicly rubbing his hands with glee, saying: 'Instead of creating a broad set of discretions for the Commissioner to apply which will rub out people like me very successfully, giving me very little avenues of appeal, very few legal points to take, here you have created a whole new statutory minefield, a field of roses for someone like me, creating the opportunity for me to pick my way through them for years ahead in the courts'. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation we confront is a piece of legislation that may ultimately be successful against the cruder arrangements, but even then only at the price of taking a lot of time to bite and being the product, in the process, of a pretty long-winded anticipated series of court proceedings to determine what these various provisions mean. Furthermore, it is a provision which cannot be expected to be successful at all in relation to the ambiguous schemes-those kinds of tax splitting, tax shelter arrangements which may have a commercial or domestic justification in some circumstances, some contexts, but certainly have not in many real world situations. Certainly it seems that this approach is at best going to be unsuccessful in covering the field that in our view, and I think in the community's view generally, needs to be covered by effective anti-avoidance legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> By contrast, the Opposition's approach is really quite different. Let me try to explain what it is. We believe that it is possible to have effective legislation counteracting both these main classes of avoidance. We believe it is possible to have legislation operating very effectively, and indeed very quickly, against blatant, contrived, artificial schemes, the ones that, as I have said before, one would recognise at 40 paces. We also believe it is possible, in a way that Treasurer Howard and this Government do not seem to think it is, to have legislative sanctions operating fairly so as to enable the authorities to pick and choose between the legitimate and illegitimate arrangements within this broader ambiguous category. </PARA>
<PARA> How is it that we would argue that this could be done? It is as follows: The first leg of our approach would involve, in relation to the blatant, contrived, artificial schemes, the unashamed application of retrospective legislation. By this I mean fully retrospective legislation with the taxation benefits of the schemes in question being wiped out right back to the date of the first known operation of the scheme; not just back to the date on which the Government finally cottons on to the existence of the scheme and says that it will legislate against it, but right back to day one to wipe out the tax advantage. There is no doubt about the efficacy of that kind of approach. It concentrates the mind of tax avoiders quite wonderfully. It means, if it is applied in any particular case, that they lose the particular tax advantage that they otherwise would have derived. They lose the opportunity to get into some other more legitimate tax minimisation scheme for that year of income, and also in the process they will very often lose the very substantial fees that they pay to the promoter of these shonky schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, retrospective legislation of this kind is an instrument which has to be wielded with a great deal of care indeed. In everything that I and the Labor Party have been saying about the operation of such legislation-I have said it at greater length than I will be able to tonight, for example, in a speech on 12 September 1979 in this chamber, and on a number of other occasions subsequently -we have been very careful to try to explain that we have in mind a very narrow operation for this kind of legislation. We see it as operating only against those schemes which are unambiguously blatant, contrived and artificial and would be so understood by everyone who had a look at them. We regard legislation of this kind, fully retrospective legislation, as appropriate only in the case of specifically identified schemes in the terms of very specifically drawn legislation. It is quite inappropriate for retrospectivity of this kind to apply in a discretionary context where the Commissioner of Taxation, for example, can apply his own discretion, extending backwards for some years. That is quite wrong. It must be only when Parliament has had an opportunity to say: 'Yes, this is a scheme of a blatant, contrived, artificial kind and it is appropriate that that be wiped out from day one, because nobody could have gone into that scheme with his eyes closed. It would only be an unambiguous tax avoider, a social parasite, who would do that'. Parliament would have that judgment in its hands in each such case. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in respect of such schemes, they would certainly have no penal content. It would be quite inappropriate for any retrospective legislation to impose penalties against the persons and schemes to which it applied. It would only operate to wipe out the tax advantage that otherwise would have been derived and create a situation in which the taxpayers simply had to pay tax at the marginal rate that would otherwise have been applicable in the circumstances in question. The idea is becoming better understood and better accepted that there be retrospectivity of this kind. I have no doubt that it is an idea that is personally accepted by the present Treasurer. I also note with some interest that it is an idea that seems to be very much in the forefront of the Government's present thinking, according to an article in the Bulletin of 16 June 1981 by someone who describes himself as 'the officious bystander' but is better known to be the ubiquitous and indeed rather well connected Mr Malcolm Turnbull of the Sydney Bar, and who says:</PARA>
<PARA> I am informed, by the highest authority--</PARA>
<PARA>I have no doubt that in his case it is the highest authority:</PARA>
<PARA>that if the Federal Government's revamped anti-avoidance provision . . . does not meet with success in the High Court and fails to stop those tax-dodging schemes which are not explicitly covered in the Act, the Government will legislate retrospectively to counter tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA>It is very much there as an option up the Government's sleeve. There is a bit of backing and filling and shying away from it at the moment, but everyone knows that retrospective legislation can be fairly and precisely applied, and it is proper to apply it against blatant, artificial schemes of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> That is our approach, and we are quite unapologetic about it. We believe that it is effective and fair and we believe that it will be understood. The other side of the coin, the other part of our approach, is to enact a genuinely effective new version of section 260 of the Act to deal with the more ambiguous arrangements, to give the Commissioner a non-punitive discretion-a non-retrospective discretion, too-to pick and choose between these schemes which are illegitimate in the sense that they manifestly involve a tax avoidance motive of a significant kind as distinct from those schemes which may be similarly constructed but which do clearly in the context have a proper commercial or domestic justification. The opposition has a pretty clear idea of its own on the basis of really quite long discussions which extend back now for some months with a highly qualified group of tax lawyers brought together-anonymously, it must be said, because their identity would be quite startling if it were known-under the auspices of the Australian Society of Labor Lawyers taxation working group. On the basis of that consultation, we have produced an alternative draft of section 260 which I believe will touch all the bases that need to be touched in a broad-ranging discretionary anti-avoidance provision of the section 260 variety. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard an alternative draft to section 260. </PARA>

<PARA> (2) The Commissioner may be satisfied that a person acted or omitted to act in relation to a scheme for the purpose of tax avoidance notwithstanding that the scheme or any part of the scheme or any tax benefit obtained in relation to the scheme was or might be contemplated by another provision or other provisions of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Cancellation of tax benefits, &amp;c. </PARA>
<PARA> 260G. (1) Whenever this Part applies, the Commissioner may at any time in relation to the year or years of income in which the tax benefit is obtained, or in relation to any other year of income-</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Where pursuant to sub-section (1) any income is included in the taxable income of any person or any adjustment is made to the liability of any person to income tax, then for the purposes of this Act such income shall be deemed to have been derived by virtue of this section by that person and by no other person or such adjustment shall be deemed to have been made by virtue of this section to the liability of that person and of no other person, as the case may be. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Where the Commissioner has adjusted the taxable income or liability to income tax of any person under sub-section (1) in relation to a scheme to which this Part applies, the Commissioner may, in relation to any taxpayer (in this sub-section referred to as the 'relevant taxpayer')-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) if, in the opinion of the Commissioner-</PARA>

<PARA> (ii) it is fair and reasonable that that amount or a part of that amount should not be included in the assessable income of the relevant taxpayer of that year of income. </PARA>

<PARA> (ii) it is fair and reasonable that that amount or a part of that amount should be allowable as a deduction to the relevant taxpayer in relation to that year of income,</PARA>
<PARA> determine that that amount or that part, as the case may be, should have been allowed or shall be allowable, as the case may be, as a deduction to the relevant taxpayer in relation to that year of income,</PARA>
<PARA>and the Commissioner shall take such action as he considers necessary to give effect to any such determination. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) Where the Commissioner makes a determination under sub-section (3) by virtue of which an amount is allowed as a deduction to a taxpayer in relation to a year of income, that amount shall be deemed to be so allowed as a deduction by virtue of such provision of this Act as the Commissioner determines. </PARA>
<PARA> (5) Where, at any time, a taxpayer considers that the Commissioner ought to make a determination under sub-section (3) in relation to the taxpayer in relation to a year of income, the taxpayer may post to or lodge with the Commissioner a request in writing for the making by the Commissioner of a determination under that sub-section. </PARA>
<PARA> (6) The Commissioner shall consider the request and serve on the taxpayer, by post or otherwise, a written notice of his decision on the request. </PARA>
<PARA> (7) If the taxpayer is dissatisfied with the Commissioner's decision on the request, the taxpayer may, within 60 days after service on the taxpayer of notice of the decision of the Commissioner, post to or lodge with the Commissioner an objection in writing against the decision stating fully and in detail the grounds on which the taxpayer relies. </PARA>
<PARA> (8) The provisions of Division 2 of Part V (other than section 185) apply in relation to an objection made under sub-section (7) in like manner as those provisions apply in relation to an objection against an assessment. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment of assessments</PARA>
<PARA> 260H. (1) Nothing in section 170 prevents the amendment of an assessment at any time before the expiration of 6 years after the date on which tax became due and payable under the assessment if the amendment is for the purposes of giving effect to sub-section 260G (1). </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I will describe the elements of that scheme in very broad terms. The Opposition and I believe that any broad based discretionary scheme should have six characteristics. Let me briefly identify them and refer to the text of the draft provision that I have just incorporated so that if not listeners to the debate then certainly readers of this speech-if there are any-will appreciate what we are getting at. The first thing that any such provision has to have is a clearly articulated objects or purpose clause which indicates to the courts the desire of the legislature that the legislation be interpreted in a purposive way that has regard to the manifest intention of Parliament. This matter has been the subject of a deal of public and parliamentary discussion in a variety of contexts recently. Perhaps I can have a word or two more to say about the clause-the proper content of it and the implications of it-in the Committee stage. Proposed new section 260A in the draft just tabled is the objects or purpose clause.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second element that any such draft has to have is a broad definition of schemes which seek to avoid tax which are the subject matter of the legislative sanction. There should be an extremely wide definition, in our view, of the threshold conditions defining the schemes prima facie caught by the provision. The basic approach that we regard as appropriate is to cast the net as widely as possible with discretion placed in the Commissioner and the boards of review not to apply the operative provisions-for example, to bona fide family and commercial transactions. This in turn requires broad definitions of all the various constituent elements of this threshold test. I refer to the definition of what constitutes a scheme that is referred to in proposed section 260B (1) in the draft, the description of what constitutes a tax benefit, and that is referred to in proposed section 260D in the draft, the description of persons who obtain the tax benefits-this draft makes it clear that the provision extends to any taxpayer-the description of the purpose of tax avoidance which is in proposed section 260F, and the specification which is in proposed section 260B (4) that the tax avoidance purpose need not be the dominant purpose in the particular transaction but must be not merely an incidental purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The third element in the Opposition's proposal-the third criterion of likely successful legislation-is that which would give a broad discretion to the Commissioner and boards of review to decide whether the anti-avoidance provisions should apply to a particular scheme. The provisions should be cast in such a way-they are in our draft section 260E-that the Commissioner must be satisfied that a tax benefit was obtained or was reasonably expected to be obtained and that the tax avoidance purpose was operative. The discretion to determine these things should, we say, be vested in the Commissioner. (Extension of time granted). I am indebted to the Senate and my ministerial colleague for the indulgence. It will assist matters in the Committee stage. I assure the Senate that I will not trespass on its time on two occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me complete this recitation of the elements of a likely successful scheme. The Commissioner ought to have a broad discretion with respect to determining for himself in all the circumstances of the case these basic elements. There ought to be accordingly the widest possible set of criteria to which the Commissioner may have regard in assessing whether the relevant purpose was present, in particular by being able to look at the whole transaction and its implications for any person affected by it. As an indication of the additional criteria as compared with those which the Government has seen fit to adopt and those which we would regard as appropriate, I refer briefly to paragraphs (i) and (j) in our proposed new section 260E (2) which provide for additional criteria for the Commissioner to take into account. Paragraph (i) states:</PARA>
<PARA>the extent (if any) to which the relevant taxpayer used or committed his own funds in the scheme;</PARA>
<PARA>That is the United States test which has proved very effective as a guide to what is in fact a tax avoidance situation. Paragraph (j) states:</PARA>
<PARA>whether the scheme created or failed to create rights or obligations which normally would not or would (as the case may be) be created between persons dealing with each other at arm's length. </PARA>
<PARA>That is another well-understood legal concept-it is a very well-understood commercial concept too-which we believe would have a practical and very useful application in aiding the Commissioner in the exercise of this discretion. The fourth element in any successful anti-avoidance scheme in this area must be a specific legislative exclusion of the choice principle which I described this afternoon before the suspension of the sitting for dinner-I will not repeat it-and which is the subject matter of our proposed new section 260F (2). </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth criterion which is necessary is a reconstruction power vested in the Commissioner subject to safeguards and under the supervision of the boards of review; that is, a power vested in the Commissioner-this is articulated in proposed new section 260G of our draft-to construct a liability to tax after declaring the scheme void and to adjust taxable income without having to justify the adjustment by reference to a particular taxing provision of the Act. The problem with the existing section 260 is that it has been repeatedly held by the courts to be an annihilating provision only, so that once the scheme has been struck down there is no actual liability to tax which can then be created out of that particular wreckage unless there is left some identifiable income of the taxpayer which would have been taxable if the scheme had not been entered into. It is a necessary part, and indeed that is acknowledged by the Government in the Howard draft. It is necessary that there be a reconstruction provision of that kind. The Opposition thinks that its provision is a little more successful than that which the Government has built into Part IVA. </PARA>
<PARA> The final element is a delicate and sensitive one, but it raises a very important point. I do not believe it is appropriate that in any such broad-ranging discretionary catch-all provision for there to be a penalty provision. I do not think it is appropriate for there to be any penalty provision at all, other than, of course, a requirement that the taxpayer pay the tax that should have been payable and the interest upon it. This kind of scheme certainly is not appropriate for the application of savage punitive measures such as the 200 per cent penalty that is provided for in the current Part IVA. Once penalty provisions of that kind are put in the whole nature of the scheme is changed. In this sort of legislative measure one loses the capacity to create, fairly anyway, broad-ranging discretions vested in the Commissioner. This I note, as honourable senators no doubt would have noted, has been a point that I think has been very effectively made in the current public debate about the present Part IVA in letters to the Australian Financial Review. I refer first to a letter written on 5 June by Mr P. M. Burgess, Senior Lecturer in Law at the University of New South Wales, and, second, to a letter dated today, 11 June, and written by Geoffrey Lehmann from the University of New South Wales. That point, although perhaps not acceptable to all of my college, I personally regard as indispensable to the fair operation of a genuine broad-based discretionary catch-all anti-avoidance provision of the section 260 variety. That certainly is built into the kind of scheme that I am proposing for the future. Summarising what I have said in one sentence, I believe it is possible to have effective legislative constraints against both classes of avoidance. This double-barrelled approach will do the job of countering tax avoidance across the board in a way that simply will not be managed and cannot be managed by the Government's own proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to say finally that if the Government will not accept this approach-it seems it is unlikely to do that at least tonight but I hope it will bear in mind what I have said for the future-there might be a great deal to be said at least for keeping the existing section 260 intact rather than effectively repealing it as is accomplished by clause 10 of the present Bill, thus making it inoperative for the future. There are two things which suggest that the existing section 260-the emasculated and impotent section 260 which the High Court in previous years anyway has well and truly worked over-might have some life left in it. There are two things encouraging me and many other people to believe that it might be worth a punt to keep section 260, particularly given the highly penal nature of new Part IVA. It might be worth while keeping the existing section 260 to operate as a non-punitive, general discretionary power to cope with the sorts of ambiguous arrangements that I referred to previously. I urge that point very seriously upon the Government for its consideration. There are two things which suggest it might be worth while. One is the manifestly changing attitude of the Court itself, spectacularly demonstrated in the Cooper Brookes case decided last week on 5 June in which the Court, not consisting in this instance of Justices Murphy and Brennan whose approach to this sort of legislation is well known to be purposive but consisting of all the other justices, came down nearly unanimously in favour of a totally non-literal and purposive construction of a tax provision. Chief Justice Gibbs and Justices Stephen, Mason and Wilson made it very clear indeed that they were no longer prepared to tolerate the sort of approach which in the past has been synonymous with Sir Garfield Barwick and which in this case was doggedly ahered to by His Honour Mr Justice Aickin. There is some evidence before our eyes as to what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA> The other new card in the pack is the new section 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act. Perhaps I can say a little more about that because its effect has been given again wildly misunderstood in many quarters in the recent public debate on it. I believe section 15AA, while not amounting in itself to any kind of legal revolution, does amount to a clear legislative statement of its intention that in these ambiguous statutory situations when there appears to be a conflict between what the Act says and what the manifest intention of the Act is the courts ought to go down the path of the manifest intention of the legislature. With this change in attitude which seems to be evolving quite independently in the Court itself, together with the reinforcement offered by the legislative direction now embodied in new section 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act, I believe there is a very real chance that section 260 could rise like a phoenix from the bed of ashes which it has been inhabitating for so long and could operate, without any amendment at all, as a potentially quite effective weapon in the area at least of these ambiguous avoidance arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I have sought not to be destructive in what I have said but rather to share with the Government the Labor Party's thinking in this area-we have devoted quite a bit of thinking to it, as I hope is reasonably evident, over the past few months-and also its hope that the Government's resolve will be stiffened to introduce some of the sorts of approaches which I have described. We believe that what has been done by the Government in this Bill is inadequate for all the reasons I have outlined, but we do not oppose the Bill because we see it, on balance, as having some advantages and as representing something of an advance. We are not trying tonight, as my colleague Ralph Willis said in the other House, to score party points in any way at all, but simply to improve this legislation in the national interest because the fight against tax avoidance in all its aspects is one that concerns all the community and is one that we, as parliamentarians, will have to share responsibility for if it is going to be won. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to comment very briefly on the Income Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) which replaces the old section 260 with a new Part IVA, aiming to eliminate blatantly artificial tax avoidance schemes while at the same time not inhibiting normal business, commercial and family arrangements. I hope it works. It has good prospects, because its tighter wording is reinforced both by the recent and proposed amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act and also by signs, in a recent case, that the High Court is at last taking a more sensible attitude to tax legislation. But it will certainly be tested by the tax avoidance industry, and if a blatantly artificial scheme gets through on some legalistic technicality, the Treasurer will have to legislate to ensure that those concerned get nothing out of it. Such legislation would be legally but not morally retrospective. The tax avoiders have been given fair warning, but the only way we will destroy them is to convince them that, even if they win on a technicality, they will make nothing out of it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps we could incorporate his speech and I could then proceed to make mine. The Senate is currently debating the Income Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1981, which, as Senator Evans and Senator Hamer have pointed out, seeks to replace section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act with a much more complex provision. I must say that the layman, in trying to follow what has happened in relation to section 260, would no doubt be very confused. Section 260 contained a very simple provision to the effect that any scheme by any taxpayer which was designed to avoid income tax, which was payable to the Commissioner of Taxation, would be invalid. Listeners may think that was a fairly simple and not unreasonable provision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What happened was that taxpayers then started to enter into arrangements which seemed designed to change their tax position. Upon an examination of the provisions of section 260 these arrangements were upheld by the High Court of Australia. I refer to simple matters such as a partnership under which, for example, an electrician might share his income with his wife. To some, that might have seemed to have been a scheme which was designed to avoid taxation, in that it reduced the taxation of the electrician. Some might have thought, under the original section 260, the scheme should have been held invalid. However, the High Court held that such schemes were valid. I suppose that if one looked at them in all reasonableness they might be seen as genuine. Perhaps the wife had to answer the telephone, send out the accounts or engage in some other activity in relation to the collection of income by the electrician. It may have seemed reasonable that the income should be shared in order to reduce the liability to tax of both parties. </PARA>
<PARA> What happened was that the High Court looked at the actions of the parties to see whether the taxpayer was organising his affairs so as to minimise his tax or evade tax. If the High Court believed in the circumstances, all he was doing was attempting to minimise his tax it did not disapprove the rearrangement of his affairs. That seemed reasonable. I might add that when I first went into practice as a lawyer some 25 years ago it seemed to me to be reasonable, and in many cases the arrangements which parties seemed to enter into in those days seemed to be genuine. However, in the past 25 years, the interpretation of the taxing Acts by the High Court has altered so that, in recent years the taxpayer and his advisers seem to have been able to get away with any scheme of rearrangement of affairs, even if the scheme seems not to be part of a genuine business arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> I first started to talk about this problem back in 1978. I am aware that for at least the last three years the Government and the present Treasurer (Mr Howard) have been looking at the problems created, in effect by the decisions of the High Court, in relation to its interpretation of, what then seemed to be, a simple provision that if any scheme were designed to avoid income tax it would be invalid against the Commissioner of Taxation. What has happened in recent years is that the interpretation of section 260 by the High Court has been such that it is almost as if the Court has said that those words are meaningless. I do not say that that is what the Court has said but it has found legal ways of saying that. The result has been of great detriment to the revenue of the governments of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot explain or justify these decisions by the High Court. I do not attempt to, but I can and I do criticise these decisions because the results of those interpretations by the High Court is that the payment of any tax by a business man in Australia has become a voluntary thing. If a taxpayer in business in Australia wants to pay tax, he goes to his accountant and tells him, in effect, the amount of tax he wants to pay. They discuss this and arrange so much of a scheme as would enable him to pay that amount of tax. The businessman pays the accountant a fee and then the return is lodged with whatever contrivance they have managed to arrange. If he wants to pay no tax at all he can find accountants, lawyers-the infamous Mr Clyne-around Australia who will devise a scheme that will enable him to pay no tax at all. This is regardless of income. It could be $500,000 or $1m. It does not make the slightest bit of difference because a scheme can be devised to enable him to pay no tax at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this greed has seeped through the community to such an extent as to be almost unbelievable. The result has been that many people in the business community who are able to enter into these schemes which are designed to avoid or evade tax have been made millionaires. One reads about people paying $1m for houses, units and penthouses around Sydney and Melbourne. There can be no doubt as to who is paying those prices for premises for those people. There is no doubt. It is not necessarily those people's incomes but the taxpayers of Australia who are making those contributions because the tax avoidance industry is now robbing the nation of revenue of about $2,500m a year. The sort of greed that has seeped through this society in relation to tax avoidance is almost unbelievable to me. It has happened in my lifetime. It has happened during my time as a lawyer involved, partly, in this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Try as this Parliament might it has been unable to prevent that. Decisions of the High Court have constantly found against the legislation and in favour of the taxpayer. As I said, the result has been that the burden of providing the services upon which this nation depends has passed from the businessman to the wage and salary earner who has his taxes deducted by an employer before he receives his income. The result is that the defence of this nation, social welfare payments by governments, our roads, education and health expenditure are all being paid by the wage and salary earner and not by the businessman. </PARA>
<PARA> I find that meeting after meeting I attend I get attacked because the Treasurer of the nation is determined to strike out tax avoidance. I find businessmen putting to me propositions that they have to avoid tax in order to cope with inflation and other problems. When I put it to them that that is rubbish and that their incomes might exceed $50,000 or more and that they are not paying tax on that, but paying substantial accountancy fees, I see a lowering of eyes and a cowering as they move away. I point out to them that the fellow sweeping the streets outside might be on $180 or $200 a week and he is paying his fair share to revenue. But I point out to them that they, on incomes of perhaps $50,000, $100,000 or $500,000, are paying, in fact, no taxation at all. More and more this burden has fallen on the wage and salary earners of the nation, and the burden has become intolerable. For three years this legislation has been in gestation. For three years I have been pestering the Treasurer to find out when the legislation would hit the Parliament and for three years he has been telling me of the difficulties involved in the preparation of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I can say only that unless the High Court of Australia gives this legislation some sort of more favourable interpretation-more along the lines of the precedence given to taxation legislation in the High Court by Sir Owen Dixon rather than along the lines of that given to it by the High Court in more recent judgments-the inevitable result will be that we will get more and more oppressive legislation and more and more discretion to impose taxation granted to the Commissioner of Taxation. We will get more and more of the legislation suggested by my colleague from Victoria, Senator Evans, who suggests in his propositions that the Taxation Commissioner should have discretionary powers and there should be retrospectivity. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that members on my side of the Parliament are opposed to retrospective propositions and I know that there are senators and members on the other side of the Parliament who are opposed to retrospective propositions. As a matter of fact, when I look back at the debate that occurred in 1978, it is very interesting to see that my then colleague from Tasmania, Senator Sir Reginald Wright, who followed me in the debate talked about discretions and the problems that have been created in the Parliament. Senator Sir Reginald Wright is reported in Hansard of 8 June 1978 as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> I am indebted to Senator Lewis for drawing attention to the question of discretions, as Senator Messner did. I just remind the Senate that in 1964--</PARA>

<PARA> I think it would be appropriate if I were to intervene just briefly at this time to reaffirm the opposition of the Australian Labor Party to retrospective legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Parliament has no wish to introduce retrospective legislation. It has no wish to grant discretionary taxation powers to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation. We have been saying this over and over again. Unless the interpretations of the legislative provisions of this Parliament by the High Court are more generous in favour of the Commissioner of Taxation and more harsh to the taxpayer and unless there is a much more open interpretation, as I have said, along the lines of that given to it by the High Court when it was constituted under the Chief Justiceship of Sir Owen Dixon, the inevitable result will be harsher and harsher and more oppressive taxation legislation as the legislature and the executive government endeavour to extract taxation from those greedy taxpayers who are not prepared to pay their fair share of the contribution to revenue which it is necessary for all people in the nation to make. </PARA>
<PARA> After those words, may I say I am delighted that, after this period of gestation, this legislation has finally come into the Parliament. I welcome it. I certainly hope that the Senate will pass it this evening and I certainly hope that it will be given a fair and reasonable interpretation by the High Court of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with pleasure that I rise to speak on the Income Tax Laws Amendment Bill. I apologise to the Senate for not being present at an earlier moment, as I was taken by surprise by the succinct nature of the contribution made by Senator Hamer. Nevertheless, I rise because of the very real seriousness of the matters under discussion. This Bill at last embodies the Parliament's response to that most crippling phenomenon within our society whereby people whom I have described at other times as the tax bludgers, the real subversives within our society, have been undermining the very fabric of our democratic institutions. Not only have these tax avoiders been refusing to make their fair contribution, as Senator Austin Lewis has said, to the revenues necessary to sustain the programs of a democratically elected government but also they have been creating within the community a sense of disparity in treatment, a sense of unfairness, such that the very social cohesion which binds us together as a nation of free people is beginning to feel the strains of this greed, this avarice, which has manipulated the tax laws of this country in favour of those who were described so well by Senator Lewis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that we have had within our society greed operating on an unparalleled scale, such that many commentators, including I think Professor Mathews, and Senator Lewis have made the point that for those earning high salaries or deriving large incomes within that free democratic wealth-producing society the payment of taxes has become discretionary; taxes are paid if it suits the taxpayer to pay them. The sorts of arguments they put up for taking that stance and employing the lawyers and accountants whom they do are specious. I will come to them in a short time. The scope of the problem is well known. In fact, Mr Howard, in answering Mr Ralph Willis, the economic spokesman for the Australian Labor Party, came to the conclusion that at least $1 billion a year was involved in Treasury revenue losses through the operation of these tax avoidance schemes. That means that the ordinary taxpayer-the wage and salary earner within our society, the person subject to the pay-as-you-earn scheme-is funding the roads, the hospitals, the education system and the very defence of the nation, within which the tax bludgers operate and enjoy a standard of living within a free society unparalleled, I would say, in the entire world. </PARA>
<PARA> The main argument put forward by tax avoiders, as has been commented upon earlier-and I must say that I am finding it very hard to follow the train of my own thoughts with the competition from Senator Kathy Martin on the other side-is that over the last few years their contribution to revenue has become so intolerable that they have had to find these means of avoiding making a contribution according to the tax scales set down by this Parliament. It has been pointed out in an article by Mr Ross Gittins in the Sydney Morning Herald of 4 June that those taxpayers earning over $18,000 a year in 1976 real terms have had a decrease in their average tax rates in the five years 1976 to 1981. In other words, with the tax indexation system such as was partially adopted and operated by this Government, those who in 1976 were earning around $20,000 a year in assessable income paid tax, on average, at the rate of 34.8 per cent. In 1981-82 they paid an average tax rate of 33.9 per cent. But more startling is the fact that in 1976-77 those who had an assessable income of $50,000 a year paid a tax rate of 51.8 per cent while in 1981-82 they paid a tax rate of 48.8 per cent. In other words, there has been a decrease of 3 per cent in the average tax rate payable by the earners of such large incomes. In other words, the argument that the tax scales have operated adversely against the earners of large incomes is not borne out by the facts. Of course, that argument is circular anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> One reason why personal income tax rates have to remain as high as they do is simply that the Treasury has to take into account the likely loss of revenue in the year for which the tax rates are set. In other words, it is a catch-22 situation. The only way for tax scales to be moderated is for tax avoidance to cease. The fact is that if tax avoidance ceased the average wage and salary earner would be paying some $4 or $5 less a week in his contribution to Federal revenue than he pays now. At present, as is well-known, the burden of personal income taxation is inexorably falling onto the average wage and salary earner, the pay-as-you-earn person, who cannot afford to pervert the best legal and accounting brains in this country for his greedy purposes, such as is the case with the large income earner. This is where the social cohesion within our society is breaking down. It is the ordinary taxpayers like the Reg Frosts of this world who are given the appearance of being mugs by smart-Alick, glib-tongued people of Peter Clyne-I was going to say 'stature' but that would have been quite the wrong word. I was delighted to see that only last week the High Court knocked back a case in which he, I think, refused to make available a tax return to the Commissioner of Taxation in the year of income 1977-78. Mr Peter Clyne was found to have feet of clay. Those who pay thousands of dollars to attend his seminars ought to keep in mind the fact that in the personal case that he took to the High Court last week, he lost, and lost badly. I for one was delighted to see that that was the case. </PARA>
<PARA> I think what is very important about this legislation is that it re-establishes, reaffirms and asserts the view of this Parliament in relation to the High Court-a matter which has already been commented on by senators on both sides of the chamber. What we have had in the last several years is a situation in which the clear intention of the elected representatives of the people, in both chambers of this Parliament, as expressed in section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, has been totally frustrated and impeded by a non-elected bench of justices of the High Court. I say 'non-elected' to make the point that in a strict sense they are politically irresponsible. They are responsible to no-one for the consequences of their judgments within this society, whereas we, of course, are subject to the disciplines of the ballot box every three or six years as the case may be. That politically irresponsible, non-elected bench of justices has undermined and frustrated the clear intention of this Parliament. I for one would have thought it would be almost sufficient for this Parliament to negate section 260 for a day and then relegislate that section simply to say to the High Court that it is the firm intention of the elected representatives of the people that those who engage in these schemes ought to have them vitiated, rendered null and void as against the Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA> For some time the Treasurer, Mr Howard, has dealt with schemes on a piecemeal basis. Such a basis is invariably ineffective, because without retrospectivity we catch up with a scheme only after it has been become known to the Taxation Commissioner and in any case it encourages the sporting atmosphere of 'one for the Commissioner, one for us'-the constant to and fro between the skilled draftsmen on the one hand, protecting the revenue, and the accountants and lawyers on the other hand, serving the interests of the greedy within our society. When one scheme is cut down ten more spring up in a hydra-headed manner to replace it. That piecemeal approach is superseded at last by a more comprehensive attempt to legislate in a way which expresses the intention of the Parliament that schemes which obtain a tax benefit for a taxpayer in a way which is described should be dealt with so that, if the case is established, the taxpayer faces double the tax payments that he or she sought to avoid. I will come to how the case should be established in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I simply say how surprising it is that within this legislation there is no statement of objects or purpose. There is no preamble. Even in the Title of the Bill itself there is no lengthy statement which would enable the High Court to see what purpose or object the Parliament had in mind. The Title merely states: 'A Bill for an Act to amend the law relating to income tax'. One would have expected that at least a longer Title or even a preamble or objects clause within the body of the Bill would have been provided in order not only to express the intention of the Parliament but also, in doing so, to take advantage of the Acts Interpretation Act amendment which was passed by the Parliament only this week and which made it clear that in the view of the Parliament the High Court should promote the purpose or object underlying the Act. Why has the Government not seen fit to state clearly the purpose or object underlying the legislation? In my view, of all the amendments to be moved by the Opposition in the Committee stage of this Bill, none is more important than that which proposes a statement of the object of the legislation. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The object of this Parliament is to ensure a fair sharing of the tax burden and to promote the revenue-raising, economic and redistributive functions of this Act by preventing or counteracting tax avoidance, and accordingly the provisions of this Part shall be deemed to be remedial and shall be given such large, liberal and purposive construction as would best ensure the attainment of the object of this Part. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that with such a statement of Parliament's clear intention in framing these provisions the High Court would be bound to promote the purpose or object underlying the Act, if there were any question in its mind about the extent, range or reach of these provisions in relation to any artificial contrivance which had been dreamed up in the offices of the accountants or lawyers of this country. It seems to me that the High Court is pre-disposed to be sympathetic now to that sort of objects provision. Of course, one was extremely pleased to see that only last week the High Court in a landmark judgment decided in favour of the Commissioner of Taxation and against an artificial tax avoidance scheme. It appeared, certainly in the opinion of the High Court, that there had been such a miscalculation in the drafting of the Act that a literal interpretation would have allowed the taxpayer to claim $44,000 in tax losses in a completely artificial way. Within that judgment, for example, Justices Mason and Wilson, talking about various rules of construction, stated that they had to ascertain the legislative intention. They said that the propriety of their looking to the object of the Act rather than relying on a literal interpretation 'extends to any situation in which for good reason the operation of the statute on a literal reading does not conform to the legislative intent as ascertained from the provisions of the statute, including the policy which may be discerned from those provisions'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that in a general sense the policy can be discerned from the various provisions of this taxation law. But how much more strengthened the hand of the High Court would have been if, as is proposed by the Opposition, a very explicit objects section were written into the Act. I repeat that we need to assert in the revenue-gathering legislation of our society the dominance of those who are the elected representatives of the people, answerable to the taxpayers and voted for by the taxpayers over the non-elected Bench of High Court justices. </PARA>
<PARA> Conscious as I am of the time of the Senate and the enormous program of legislation still to be dealt with, I will only briefly mention some points on which I would otherwise have elaborated. Firstly, because of the failure of the Government to include an object clause in this amendment, and because of the lingering mistrust of the courts which the Opposition still has in this area, the Opposition has thought it wise and prudent to place more clearly in the Commissioner's hands the determination of whether a scheme has been contrived to confer a tax benefit on a taxpayer of the type described. In other words, it is thought quite proper that the Taxation Commissioner should have this power-a power which of course is subject to appeal in the normal way through the taxation Boards of Review and so on. It is not an unreviewable power. It is a power to determine questions of fact and to make some assessment of their impact, but it is not unappealable and we think it ought to be largely in the hands of the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> As to retrospectivity, whilst it is not a feature of the present Bill before the chamber the view of the Opposition is well known. On the whole, I have never been one to support in the general run retrospectivity where penal provisions are provided and where penalties and monetary imposts are made on ordinary citizens. Nevertheless, it is a fact that in the very country which has given us our judicial and political institutions, namely the United Kingdom, it has been recognised from the Second World War onwards, by both the judicial and political wings of the United Kingdom, that retrospectivity in this area is necessary and justified in order to enable society to deal with those who would undermine the very fabric of society by refusing the democratic government its revenues and creating this sense of unfairness between citizens who are taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in certain situations where a tax avoidance scheme has been found to operate, it is a fact that there are provisions which will penalise the taxpayer to the extent that he will have to pay double the tax which he has sought to avoid. There have been outcries that this is an outrageous impost or penalty on the taxpayer, but to my mind it does not go far enough. I have often said in this chamber that the penalty of payment of moneys by people of this character and with these resources is not the way to deal with them. What is needed is a penalty which clearly states that such persons are beyond the pale of democratic society. I emphasise that to my mind they are undermining the very fabric of our democratic institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> One finds, for example, in the Commonwealth Electoral Act that no person attainted of treason shall be entitled to have his name placed on or retained on any roll or to vote in any Senate election or House of Representatives election. In my view, these people ought to be placed in the same category because ultimately they are just as dangerous to the democratic institutions and way of life of this country as are people who are more clearly and more easily seen to be subversive or treasonable. To put it in the form of a slogan and with due deference to the American Revolution, there should be no representation without taxation. If these people refuse to pay taxation, they should have no right to a voice in the election of persons to the councils of government of this nation. It they demonstrate an unwillingness to contribute to the revenues of the Government, they should have no say in its formation. I support the most stringent penalties, the most onerous monetary imposts on these people, but I go further. In relation to these subversive persons I summarise my beliefs by saying: No representation without taxation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government, in introducing this measure, has certainly approached the subject of tax avoidance in a very novel way. Clearly we have, over the last few years, adopted an approach, as has been outlined by all speakers, based on a specific approach to particular problems that have occurred from time to time. Certainly, that has been, on the whole quite successful. Speakers for the Opposition have demonstrated that maybe it has its weaknesses insofar as it is an ex post facto operation and we do not always catch up with those who succeed in getting through the tax avoidance net quite cleanly. In that respect, I think that particular problem has been addressed in this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to point out one or two aspects of that approach from the point of view of the difficulties which I think have been handled in this amendment. As we look at the question of tax avoidance, I think it is quite clear that the approach of the legal and accounting professions of the last 10 years has changed significantly from one which relied upon the arrangement of the affairs of a family or business in such a way as to minimise taxation liabilities to one in which straight-out avoidance became the main objective. Certainly, that has been the main thrust of the well-known practitioners in this field over the last few years. We have seen the rise of a consortia of legal accounting operations and even public companies involving themselves in widespread dividend-stripping and asset-stripping operations and schemes of that kind. They have attracted people who, on previous occasions and in normal circumstances which may have been present in previous years, would not have found themselves attracted to those kinds of schemes. In fact, I think it is clear that persons who believed in the past that there were certain limits beyond which people would not go in this area have found attractions in dealing with practitioners in this twilight zone of the accounting and legal professions. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the fact is that we have seen these developments in the last few years. I recall, in particular that before Senator Evans came to this House there was a very good debate on the question of retrospectivity in respect of the Curran case. That was in, I think, May or June of 1978. That case raised many substantial issues in connection with this whole area of tax avoidance. Senator Lewis referred to that debate earlier tonight. He quoted some of the remarks of Senator the Honourable Sir Reginald Wright in that debate. Clearly the considerations which were mentioned by Senator Sir Reginald Wright in that debate-the question of retrospectivity and the question of discretion being given to the Commissioner of Taxation in particular circumstances-are matters which have been widely canvassed in this Parliament and ones which I think all honourable senators appreciate and properly understand. </PARA>
<PARA> In connection with the particular matter of this debate, we come down to an amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Act which lays down a new set of criteria by which tax avoidance schemes, contracts and various transactions might be judged. The difficulty in these circumstances is always to establish a criterion, a test, which ascribes tax avoidance in fairly clear terms but which, at the same time, does not produce the kinds of effects in respect of legitimate business and of family arrangements and transactions in such a way as to annihilate them. The point is that we should not take the baseball bat to swat the fly. We should allow normal business transactions to be carried out without a high level of concern being imposed on businesses by the Commissioner of Taxation. That is the fundamental dilemma which any government faces in designing the kind of legislation of which we can see the fruits in this Bill. The legislation has been drawn in a very careful manner. Over the last two years there has been considerable consultation among the Government, its counsel who have been appointed to advise in respect of these sections of the law and the Taxation Advisory Committee which was established recently by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and which consists of experts who are currently practitioners in taxation law. In addition there has been considerable political input into this whole area through the Government members committee on taxation, and that has been a worthwhile contribution to this whole area. </PARA>
<PARA> I now address myself to several of the remarks of the Opposition senators who have spoken chiefly in support of their own amendments which will be put during the Committee stage. In particular the Government sees some dangers in some of the approaches which have been outlined by Senator Evans and Senator Tate in particular. They have spoken of the area of retrospectivity in respect of this kind of law. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad Senator Evans has made that clear. He has referred to specific transactions. Firstly, let us examine the position with regard to the philosophy of that matter. Whilst this Parliament did pass a Bill in 1978 which introduced a degree of retrospectivity in respect of Curran type situations, the general approach of this Government has been to oppose retrospectivity in its various forms. That is not to say, however, that having given notice to the public by way of an appropriate public statement that certain areas of the taxation law would be subject to legislation at some future time the law would not be proclaimed to take effect from the date of the statement. I believe that is a different concept from that of straight retrospectivity which the Opposition is currently supporting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of the whole area of retrospectivity one should also test such a proposal by a consideration of its effectiveness. Would an effective tax avoidance system be brought into effect by virtue of such an amendment? Certainly one of the chief objectives of those engaged in tax avoidance schemes is not merely to avoid taxation permanently but to delay the effect of taxation. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Evans" NAMEID="VD4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point here is that, notwithstanding the effect of retrospective legislation such as the Opposition proposes, we would be placed in a situation in which action could not be taken by a government until the facts of the case became known to the Commissioner of Taxation, until the facts were properly assessed and until all the legal processes were finally brought to a conclusion. This, of course, involves appeals through the normal channels in the income tax law structure such as boards of review and the courts including the High Court. During that time taxpayers have the advantage of not having to have paid the tax that may have been due under any amended assessment that might have been made by the various judicial authorities in that circumstance. Consequently, these processes may take a considerable time-two years, three years or more. This confers a great advantage on taxpayers in this situation. One could argue very strongly that that form of retrospectivity-given all the side effects and all the deleterious effects it may have on the legal system generally and particularly on the view of the public towards the Parliament-could endanger the whole system of law under which we live in this country. I think the point has been made that the system outlined by the Opposition would not be regarded as the most effective approach to this problem. This scheme, as outlined in the legislation, gives us a full opportunity of approaching the matter from a new standpoint.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clearly, the general question of discretions is and has been for a long time a matter of great debate in this Parliament. The ability of this Parliament to confer a wide discretion upon the Commissioner of Taxation in respect of particular transactions is one of those powers which ought to be very jealously guarded by the Parliament. This Government will be very careful to ensure that this sort of thing does not become widespread. I might just point out in regard to that matter that to give effect to a discretion through the law may bring about only a very modest increase in the potential for fighting tax avoidance in its usual form. We cannot see that that would achieve very much at all. One has to have regard to the fact that the Commissioner's decisions will be subject to review by the boards of review and other courts of appeal. Consequently, the Commissioner would not necessarily be in a position where his word was final. Again, the Opposition's view on this matter, upon which it has heaped much support, could well fall to the ground in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted that Senator Evans mentioned that the penalty of 200 per cent was manifestly excessive and that this amounted to a clear command to the courts to be very cautious in their approach to the interpretation of the proposed new Part IVA in this legislation. Counsel to the Government have advised that the penalty provisions could lead to strict construction, but they are agreed that the proposed penalty is necessary and appropriate. In fact what is proposed is little different from the present legal situation. The penalty is always subject to remission and as such is well contemplated by the law and certainly by those who administer the law. This will not have a great effect upon the ability of the Government to enforce this law against tax avoiders in the way proposed by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I think it is apt to observe that in recent times there have been some very well-known cases of tax avoidance. Senator Tate mentioned the case of Mr Peter Clyne. He has been very public in his approach to the whole question of tax avoidance and indeed tax evasion. In recent times he probably has become the very epitome-if one likes, the very image-of tax avoidance and has carried the fight against the Taxation Commissioner to the nth degree. The fact is that this man, who clothes himself as some kind of Robin Hood looking after those people who are oppressed by the law in certain ways, is robbing not only the rich but also the poor to feed the rich. It is that kind of man whom this country does not strongly support, and certainly this Government has no interest in supporting. This man, who claims to have been so successful in the area of tax avoidance, in fact has not won a case against the Taxation Commission. Senator Tate drew our attention tonight to the fact that he lost a case last week in the High Court of Australia with respect to the non-lodgment of his family's taxation returns for the year ended 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the community demands action of the kind represented in these amendments against persons like Mr Peter Clyne and against other tax avoiders. That is the basis on which the Government has been taking a continual action not only in respect of specific schemes over recent times but now through these very important amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act which are based upon a whole new concept of tests in respect of tax avoidance schemes. As I think the Opposition has acknowledged, it certainly is a major step forward in this area, and consequently I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>I add that in the light of the Minister's response, there is one additional reason for my co-operation in keeping the Committee stage short; that is, my profound disappointment at what can be described only as the fat-headed intellectual level of the response that has been forthcoming from the Minister in this chamber and, indeed, from the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in the other chamber. I make no distinction as to the level of fat-headedness by the Government respondents in either case to what have been very carefully thought out, constructive arguments put forward not in a polemical spirit but in an attempt to raise the level of what hitherto has been a pretty abominable standard of argument and understanding of tax law and tax avoidance law in this country. Having removed my spleen in that fashion, I now proceed more constructively to say that the object of these amendments is to improve Part IVA to make it more effective than it is at the moment by going a good way down the track that I outlined in my second reading contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> I make it clear that, although there are many points of similarity between the proposed new section 260 that I put into the record in my speech at the second reading stage and the changes that are here proposed to the Part IVA, we are not in fact by these amendments seeking to go the whole way and embody the whole of the approach that was adopted in the separate section 260 proposal I put at the second reading stage. To do that would be to try to graft onto the Government's own approach here what is in essence a quite different approach. So I think all we can reasonably try to do is to improve the Government's own approach and to indicate some of the ways in which the Bill as it presently stands might be made more effective on the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> To explain what our various amendments are about would be a long and technical business and would undoubtedly try the patience of the Committee, not to mention anyone who might be listening to this debate, quite considerably. Moreover, that explanation was done quite effectively, I think, in the other place. I believe it might serve the purposes, if not of this Government then at least of posterity, to put in the record an explanatory memorandum, if I might so distinguish it by describing it as such, of our own indicating how it is that these amendments differ from the Government's Bill and indicating rather succinctly, nonetheless very effectively I believe, the arguments in support of those amendments and those changes. So I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the Opposition's small 'e' explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA>sub-section</PARA>
<PARA>(1)</PARA>
<PARA>The express statement of the object of the Part is entirely new. It is not a novel legislative technique (refer e.g. Freedom of Information Bill 1981, Clause 3; Liquor Control Act 1968 (Vic.) s. 3). The inclusion of an object clause follows logically from the amendment to the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 effected by the Statute Law Revision Bill 1981 directing courts to construe legislation so as to promote the purpose or object underlying the legislation (''whether that purpose or object is expressly stated or not''). The clause should provide clear guidance to judges who look only to the words of the statute itself to discern Parliament's intention. </PARA>
<PARA>177A (1)</PARA>
<PARA>1</PARA>
<PARA>sub-section</PARA>
<PARA>(2)</PARA>
<PARA>INSERT definition of ''liability'' (taken from New Zealand Land and Income Tax Act 1954, s. 99). This definition is necessitated by the concept of ''purpose of tax avoidance'' (see below) and ensures that the avoidance of a potential or prospective liability-which because of the scheme may never become an actual liability-is nevertheless tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA>Definition of ''scheme'':</PARA>
<PARA> -in sub-para (b), DELETE the word ''scheme'', INSERT the word ''omission''. The former is circular, the latter widens the definition;</PARA>
<PARA> -after sub-para (b), INSERT new sub-para (c) to include steps preliminary to or forming part of a scheme, so that the Part applies to preparations for and parts of schemes as much as to complete schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> -new sub-para (d) corresponds with Government sub-section 177A (3). </PARA>
<PARA>177A (3)</PARA>
<PARA>1</PARA>
<PARA>sub-section</PARA>
<PARA>(4)</PARA>
<PARA>DELETE ''the carrying out of a scheme by a person'' and INSERT ''a person acting or omitting to act in relation to a scheme''. This formula has been adopted throughout the Opposition amendments and is intended to avoid any problems involved with the requirement to prove that a person was ''carrying out'' a scheme. All that is now required is an act or omission which relates to a scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>177A (5)</PARA>
<PARA>1</PARA>
<PARA>sub-section</PARA>
<PARA>(5)</PARA>
<PARA>DELETE ''dominant purpose'' and INSERT ''not merely an incidental purpose''. The intention of this amendment is to prevent the imposition of any restrictive ''dominant purpose'' test. It is sufficient if tax avoidance is one of a number of purposes of a transaction, provided that it is not merely an incidental purpose. The structure of the sub-section is modelled on s. 4F of the Trade Practices Act (without the reference to ''substantial purpose''). The reference ''not merely an incidental purpose'' is based on s. 82KH (1A) of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA>177B</PARA>
<PARA>2</PARA>
<PARA>DELETE sub-sections (3) and (4), because our reconstruction and cancellation provision (Amendment 5) does not depend on the disallowance of a particular deduction but gives a general power to adjust taxable income to the extent necessary to counteract the tax benefit. Further, these sub-sections might be taken to limit the operation of the cancellation provision by requiring a particular deduction to be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA>177C (1)</PARA>
<PARA>3</PARA>
<PARA>DELETE the Government's definition of ''tax benefit'' entirely. The danger in this definition is that it leaves the general anti-avoidance provisions vulnerable to attack (such as was mounted by the Barwick High Court on Section 260) via the ''antecedent transaction doctrine''. Mobilising this doctrine it could be argued that, if a completely new transaction is entered into to avoid tax, there is no ''amount'' which ''would have been included or might reasonably have been expected to have been included'' in the taxpayer's assessable income, and therefore there is no tax benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>3</PARA>
<PARA>New section</PARA>
<PARA>177C</PARA>
<PARA>-para (a)</PARA>
<PARA>INSERT a new definition of ''tax benefit''. </PARA>
<PARA> -Paragraph (a) is deliberately general and is certainly wide enough to cover the specific cases spelt out in the Government's section 177C (1) i.e. the obtaining of an allowable deduction which would not have been obtained but for the scheme, and a reduction of the taxpayer's assessable income by means of the scheme. The two types of ''tax benefit'' specified in the Government's s. 177C (1) may not only be interpreted as being mutually exclusive but may also require the identification of a specific amount which is not included in the assessable income or a specified deduction which is allowable. Our broader approach is designed to include both those cases and also to cover situations where the effect of the scheme might not be specifically identifiable in this way, but where, by the particular arrangement of the taxpayer's affairs, a more complex tax benefit is obtained which is only identifiable in terms of the net result to the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA>3</PARA>
<PARA>-para (a)</PARA>
<PARA> -Note in the Opposition's para (a) that where it is not clear that the taxpayer would have been liable to pay more income tax but for the scheme, it is sufficient if the Commissioner reasonably expects that he would have been so liable. </PARA>
<PARA>3</PARA>
<PARA>-para (b)</PARA>
<PARA> -New paragraph (b) is intended to counter the acknowledged tax benefit which flows from the postponement of a liability to tax to a later income tax year. </PARA>
<PARA>177C (2),</PARA>
<PARA> (3)</PARA>
<PARA>3</PARA>
<PARA>DELETE Government clauses 177C (2) and (3), which give an exemption to tax benefits attributable to the making of a declaration, election, selection, notice or option expressly provided for by the Act. The Opposition does not consider that there should be any blanket exemption for such tax benefits since the provisions of the Act providing these declarations, elections, selections et cetera are often misused for tax avoidance purposes. </PARA>

<PARA>177D (a)</PARA>
<PARA>4</PARA>
<PARA>para (1) (a)</PARA>
<PARA>DELETE paragraph (a)</PARA>
<PARA>INSERT new sub-paragraph (a)</PARA>
<PARA> -the Commissioner must be satisfied that a tax benefit has been obtained or may reasonably be expected to be obtained in the future. This replaces the Government's ''objective test''-that a tax benefit has in fact been obtained-and is consistent with the Opposition's view that the Commissioner's discretions to combat tax avoidance should be strengthened in order to cast the net as widely as possible and reduce the scope for judicial interference. </PARA>
<PARA>4</PARA>
<PARA> -sub-paragraph (1) (a) (iii) in the Opposition's amendment is new and is intended to cover future tax benefits which the Commissioner reasonably expects the relevant taxpayer to obtain. </PARA>
<PARA>177D (b)</PARA>
<PARA>4</PARA>
<PARA>para (1) (b)</PARA>
<PARA>INSERT new sub-paragraph (b)</PARA>
<PARA> -the relevant purpose is now ''the purpose of tax avoidance'' (as defined-see below) and once again the Commissioner must be satisfied that the requisite purpose was present.

<PARA>Sub-section</PARA>
<PARA>(2)</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition's sub-section (2) replaces the Government's 177D (b), with the following changes:</PARA>
<PARA> DELETE ''having regard to-''</PARA>
<PARA> INSERT ''the Commissioner may have regard to any one or more of the following-''</PARA>
<PARA> -once again, the discretion is conferred on the Commissioner rather than on the courts or some unspecified person. </PARA>
<PARA> -the Commissioner has a discretion to have regard to any one or more of the factors (a) to (b) but is under no obligation to consider all the factors. This provision will prevent his exercise of discretion being struck down for failure to consider all factors. </PARA>
<PARA>4</PARA>
<PARA>Sub-section</PARA>
<PARA>(2) cont. </PARA>
<PARA>INSERT new sub-paragraphs (j) and (k):</PARA>
<PARA> sub-para (j) adopts the United States anti-avoidance test of ''real money at risk''. The underlying principle is that the more real money which the taxpayer has at risk, the less artificial is the scheme. A scheme may, of course, fail on other grounds but this is one factor to be taken into account. This concept has been used by the Government in relation to the proposed film tax deduction scheme (see Income Tax Assessment Bill 1981, proposed Section 124ZAM). </PARA>
<PARA> Sub-para (k) invokes the well-known and well-understood ''arms length'' concept i.e. based on a normal course of business dealing between two persons with ordinary commercial purposes. This concept is used elsewhere in the Income Tax Assessment Act e.g. section 31C. </PARA>
<PARA>177D (b)</PARA>
<PARA>4</PARA>
<PARA>Sub-section</PARA>
<PARA>(3)</PARA>
<PARA>INSERT a definition of ''purpose of tax avoidance''. This formulation is taken from the N.Z. Land and Income Tax Act 1954 (s. 99 (1)) and is very similar to the provisions of the existing section 260. It is a comprehensive definition. </PARA>
<PARA>The explanatory paragraph beginning ''and references in this sub-section . . . '' was inserted to meet the claim of the tax avoider who says ''because of the scheme, I was never liable for income tax, so there is no liability to tax which can be said to have been avoided, reduced, postponed et cetera''. </PARA>
<PARA>4</PARA>
<PARA>Sub-section</PARA>
<PARA>(4)</PARA>
<PARA>INSERT new sub-section (4) which expressly ousts the ''choice principle'' as enunciated in such cases as a W. P. Keighery Pty Ltd v. F.C.T. (1957) 100 CLR 66 and Cridlands Case (1978) 52 ALJR 96. This principle states that, if a taxpayer creates a situation by entry to a transaction which will attract tax consequences for which the Act makes specific provision, the validity of the transaction is not affected by s. 260 merely because the tax consequences which it attracts are advantageous to the taxpayer and he enters into the transaction deliberately with a view to gaining that advantage. He is merely making a choice as to the arrangement of his affairs or the conduct of his business for which the Act makes provision. </PARA>
<PARA>177F</PARA>
<PARA>5</PARA>
<PARA>Sub-section</PARA>
<PARA>(1)</PARA>
<PARA>DELETE Government sub-sections 177F (1) and (2)</PARA>
<PARA>INSERT new sub-section 177F (1) which states simply and concisely the Commissioner's power to treat the scheme as void and cancel the tax benefit. In particular, the complicated provisions in the Government draft, as to when this power of cancellation is activated (see 177F (1), (3)) are replaced by the simple test ''whenever this Part applies'' i.e. whenever, in the terms of the amended s. 177D, a tax benefit is or may be obtained and the purpose of tax avoidance is present. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistently with the redefinition of ''tax benefit'' (Amendment 3 above), there is no provision restricting the cancellation power to the disallowance of an identifiable deduction or the inclusion of an identifiable amount in the taxpayer's assessable income. </PARA>
<PARA>Note that by virtue of this new sub-section the Commissioner may adjust the taxable income or the liability to tax</PARA>
<PARA> -in any year of income; and</PARA>
<PARA> -''to the extent necessary to counteract the tax benefit . . . or to any lesser extent''. The test of necessity here is, unlike the earlier tests, objective i.e. it is not left entirely to the Commissioner's discretion to decide what is necessary to counteract the tax benefit. Further, there is no requirement that the tax benefit be fully counteracted. </PARA>
<PARA>177F (2)</PARA>
<PARA>5</PARA>
<PARA>Sub-section</PARA>
<PARA>(2)</PARA>
<PARA>INSERT new sub-section (2)</PARA>
<PARA>This sub-section provides that any additional taxable income (or adjustment to tax liability) is deemed to be derived (or made) by virtue of this reconstruction section. The Commissioner is therefore freed of the obligation to relate the adjustment he makes to a particular provision of the Act. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are just three particular matters to which I believe specific attention should be drawn. With the indulgence of the Committee, let me say something reasonably briefly on each of them. Those three matters are in turn: Firstly, the objects clause which we propose; secondly, the question of dominant purpose which we propose to amend; and, thirdly, the question of the choice principle which is technical but which is indispensable to an understanding of how this whole extraordinary situation developed legally. As far as the objects clause is concerned, the Opposition is proposing, as Senator Tate read into the record, an objects clause in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The object of this Part is to ensure a fair sharing of the tax burden and to promote the revenue-raising, economic and redistributive functions of this Act by preventing or counteracting tax avoidance, and accordingly the provisions of this Part shall be deemed to be remedial and shall be given such large, liberal and purposive construction as will best ensure the attainment of the object of this Part. </PARA>
<PARA>That sort of language is rather novel in Australian legislation. It is not completely novel; it does, in fact, appear, for example, in clause 3 of the Freedom of Information Bill. Of course, that is not yet Australian legislation and indeed may never be, given the attitude of this Government. It also, even more immediately, appears in the language of some State enactments. One example is, of all things, section 3 of the Victorian Liquor Control Act. That in turn has a pedigree in some other Commonwealth jurisdictions, notably Canada, as was noted in a very interesting article by Geoffrey Sawer in a recent edition of the Canberra Times. Some people have suggested, indeed Geoffrey Sawer did, that in those other jurisdictions, and to the extent that these sorts of clauses have hitherto appeared in the Australian jurisdictions, they have not been especially effective in concentrating the mind of the courts on giving legislation of this kind a purposive construction. </PARA>
<PARA> It is our belief that times are changing, that judicial minds are becoming a little more sensitive to socio-economic realities. The evidence for that is cases like the one in the High Court last week-the Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd case, which I mentioned in my speech at the second reading stage. We also, of course, have as an additional crutch for limping judicial minds to rest upon the new section 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act which was introduced and carried through this Parliament quite recently and which has been the subject of a good deal of attention. To make clearer what I am talking about, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard section 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act as recently adopted by this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA> I take this opportunity to say a brief word about the application of section 15AA. There has been a lot of misunderstanding about it, not only within the community at large but also within the legal profession. Before we can even think about giving some application to section 15AA there has to be one or other of two threshold considerations satisfied in the particular statute that we are trying to interpret. Either there has to be some ambiguity of an obvious kind in the language of that statute or there has to be some manifest incongruity between the language of a particular provision in the statute and what the rest of the section, the rest of the Part, the rest of the Act as a whole, seems to be trying to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> An example of ambiguity is easy to find. The statute book is littered with them. Let me take just one which recently came to my attention. If a statute such as the trade practices provision operates only in respect of trading companies, one of the questions that can arise is: What sort of company is in fact a trading company? One situation which has arisen recently is an incorporated football club which is in the business of running football matches, putting teams on the field and running associated activities and which happens, among other things, occasionally to pay transfer fees and so on to buy footballers from interstate or from other clubs. Is that corporation a trading corporation? There is an ambiguity about it. It is not what we would think of, at first blush, as being a trading company, but it is a company which does happen to do a bit of trading of a peculiar kind on the side. That is just one example. There are literally millions of examples that one could find in the statute book of ambiguities with which courts are occasionally confronted. </PARA>
<PARA> The other sort of situation that I said has to arise before we can even begin to apply this sort of provision is where there is some manifest incongruity between the language of a particular provision by itself, which might be quite plain but sit very oddly with what the rest of the section or the rest of the statute as a whole seems to be about. It was exactly that situation that was in issue in the Cooper Brookes case. If neither of those conditions obtains, if there is no ambiguity or if there is no incongruity, then the job of the court is plain. It has simply to apply the language as it comes, to give the words in front of the court's nose the plain meaning of those words, and that is all there is to it. If that means that some stringent procedural safeguard, for example, in a breathalyser test law, has not been satisfied and someone who manifestly deserved to be slotted gets off, so be it. The court under those circumstances will have no option, in the absence of ambiguity or in the absence of incongruity of the kind I am mentioning, to do otherwise than apply the direct words of the statute. But, if one or other of those threshold considerations is satisfied, what happens is that the court confronts, as it were, a fork in the road. It can either go down the literal path, giving the words, whatever oddness seems to flow from it, their literal meaning, or go down the path which seems to reflect the express or implied intention underlying the legislation when looked at as a whole. The utility of the section 15AA provision as it stands is to operate as a signpost at those particular forks in the road. It is sitting there as a legislative signpost saying to the courts that when they confront one of those forks in the road they should go down this way, down the purposive path. They should not do down the literal path. If it is that sort of situation, that is what they should do. Section 15AA by itself does not take the court very far at all down that particular road. If the court is to be able actually to identify what the purpose is and to step down the purposive road--</PARA>

I am trying to act constructively, to contribute to what has been a very difficult debate and to communicate to the community why it is that sections of this kind do have an enormous utility. What I am saying about a section such as 15AA is that it does operate as a signpost. It does not necessarily take one very far down the track, unless there is some other aid by which the particular purpose can be identified-for example, the explanatory memorandum, other extrinsic material or a purpose or object clause of the kind that is in issue here. That is why there is a real utility in having a purpose or object clause of this kind, particularly when it is in association with the recently enacted section 15AA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Much more briefly, I will deal with the other two points that I wanted to make. The dominant purpose question is one that does cause some heart searching in a number of breasts because this amendment is trying to say that what the Commissioner should have regard to is not a situation where the tax avoidance purpose is the dominant purpose and only give the section its operation in that situation; rather what is being said is that the Commissioner should require only to be satisfied that the tax avoidance purpose was 'not merely an incidental purpose'. In respect of that, although there has been some concern that that is too far-reaching, I simply draw the attention of the Government and the chamber to the existence of similar provisions contained in section 4F of the Trade Practices Act, the New Zealand general anti-avoidance provision and, most relevantly of course within the terms of this legislation that we are adding to here tonight, section 82KH (1A) of the Income Tax Assessment Act. In the context of tax avoidance in the situation of carry forward losses, this provision appears:</PARA>
<PARA> In determining for the purpose of the Subdivision whether an argreement is a tax avoidance agreement, no regard shall be had to a purpose that is a merely incidental purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that the Government can hardly quibble about the use of the sort of language that the Opposition is proposing here when it appears in the Government's own Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining point that I wanted to make-again I can do it in just a sentence or two-is about the necessity for there being an explicit renunciation of the choice principle if legislation of this kind is to be successful. What we propose in our amendment in this respect-in this case it is the amendment to add a sub-section (4) to proposed section 177D-is to put down or suggest language which, in our view and in the view of all the highly qualified and experienced tax lawyers with whom we have been consulting in this matter, will be effective in removing the possibility of that choice principle being applied by the courts. I described that principle in my speech at the second reading stage. It has been the fundamental barrier in the way of a sensible application of these kinds of discretionary clauses in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> It was very surprising and very peculiar that Mr Howard, in his response to what the shadow Treasurer, Mr Ralph Willis, had to say in the other place, seemed to take the view that the Opposition, by the general thrust of its amendments was going back down the track of exposing itself to the operation of the choice principle and having the effectiveness of these things accordingly modified. I cannot imagine that the Treasurer read-or if he did read it, understood-what was involved in proposed sub-section 177D (4) because clearly, in our view, that deals with that particular situation. I believe the amendments proposed by the Opposition would improve this Bill, although they could change the basic approach that the Government seems wedded to.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health Acts Amendment Bill is a multi-purpose Bill and an important Bill which was presented to the Senate with inadequate notice as this parliamentary session ends and, therefore, will get inadequate consideration by this place. It is worth while noting that the explanatory memorandum to the legislation reached this chamber only this afternoon, but when the Bill, which is long and complex, was presented to the House of Representatives the haste in its conception and its drafting was demonstrated by the fact that the Government had to introduce its own amendments to correct the difficulties which had obviously arisen in its preparation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill amends the Health Insurance Act, the National Health Act, the Nursing Homes Assistance Act, and the Therapeutic Goods Act. I suggest that it should not have been presented to the Senate and this Parliament in this omnibus way. In the past Bills to amend each of those Acts have been presented separately. This legislation should have been presented as separate Bills because it amends separate Acts and because the clauses of the Bill have clearly separate and unrelated functions. As a crude attempt to avoid opposition to the undesirable and reprehensible changes to the health insurance system, the Government has tacked on a series of unobjectionable pieces of legislation to cloud the issue. I repeat: It is a practice which should not be followed in the future and which in my view should not have been introduced at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition in fact supports parts of the Bill. It supports the extension of the Isolated Patients Travel and Accommodation Scheme to orthodontic procedures for those who are under the age of twenty. It supports the assumption by the Commonwealth of responsibility for all nursing home benefits. We support the updating of the Therapeutic Goods Act. In general we support the amendments to the legislation concerning pathology services. But because of the time and because of the limitation of debate we will not be able to deal with those measures which we support. The amendment which I shall move to the motion for the second reading takes into account our support for those measures. I must of necessity concentrate on the prime purpose of the legislation which is the introduction of a regressive, inequitable and unfair system of health care delivery and insurance in this country. Together with the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Bill, which we debated some two days ago, it represents a complete abrogation of the Government's promise of the pre-election days of the past to maintain Medibank. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1969 the Liberal Party Government of the day became concerned about the health system. It was concerned about increasing costs, about the number of people who were not covered by health insurance and about the lack of access of numbers of disadvantaged people to adequate health care. The Government established an inquiry under Mr Justice Nimmo, who reported on the inadequacy and inefficiency of the health funds, the fact that they did not provide adequate cover, the fact that consumers were not represented on their boards, and the multitude of deficiencies in their operations. Above all, he criticised the complexity of the voluntary health fund system. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that my microphone is not working and that I must move. Apparently I am allowed to speak out of my place, which is incredible. I hope that I am not offending against the Standing Orders, Mr President. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that Senator Withers is not interested in the health and care of people in this country. The health costs problem and the other difficulties with the system continued in an uncontrolled manner until July 1975, when Medibank, a system of universal health insurance, was introduced. I remind honourable senators that Medibank was not introduced until July 1975. After its introduction the acceleration in health costs began to level out. Ever since then the voluntary health funds have been fighting for a return to those great days of the past when they purchased aircraft for their executives, built large and grandiose buildings in the capital cities and used contributors' funds to provide loans for houses and cars for their executives. To achieve that goal they have donated funds to the Liberal Party, have provided public relations men for it at election time and have conducted anti-Labor advertising campaigns-all with contributors' funds. This package of legislation represents the final pay-off. Not only is the Government returning to those days; it is attempting to force people into the private health funds. This, with legislation passed earlier to force State governments to charge fees in public hospitals and to introduce demeaning means tests, is a pay-off to some of the biggest parasites in this community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Health care should be accessible to all at a cost they can afford. It should be provided and funded at an adequate standard on a community rating principle, through a levy or progressive taxation system. It will not be so provided under this legislation, as it has not been under the four previous health schemes that this Government has introduced in the last four or five years. We remember that those health schemes were introduced with great fanfare and were going to solve all our problems. In 1976, the then Minister for Health, Mr Hunt, said in the debate on the changes of that year:</PARA>
<PARA> The changes we are proposing are also designed to provide incentives to the medical profession, and private insurers, to constrain costs by establishing competition between the public and private sectors. Competition between private insurers and Medibank should maintain both the quality of services and their cost efficiency . . . What it does . . . is provide the widest ranging choice that any health scheme has ever offered the Australian people . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That scheme did not last long. Senator Baume said of the 1976 changes that he saw Medibank as basically a form of State capitalism, another Post Office. It seems that all the private funds will be that now. Dr Sax, in the document Paying for Health Care, said in 1978:</PARA>
<PARA> A health financing system should be equitably financed, easy to understand and administer and be acceptable both to the public and the providers of services. </PARA>
<PARA>In introducing the 1978 health changes on top of the 1975, 1976 and 1977 changes, Mr Hunt, the then Minister, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a particular feature of these arrangements is their simplicity. </PARA>
<PARA>They were not simple. The Opposition knew they would have to be amended. Certainly, these latest changes cannot be considered simple. Senator Baume, in debate on the 1978 changes, said:</PARA>
<PARA>If we are ever to get some incentive into the health insurance system it is essential that community rating be done away with and that experience rating or individual rating be adopted. I welcome the opportunity to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>So at that time Senator Baume had given up his previous support for community rating in favour of the 1978 changes, which he said got rid of it. This year Mr MacKellar in the second reading speech on the Health Acts Amendment Bill said about this policy:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . recognises the importance of the community rating principle for a viable health insurance industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I will be interested to hear Senator Baume explain to us how anything in this legislation resembles anything like a community rating principle in the provision of health care. As I said, this legislation introduces the fifth Fraser health scheme in as many years. It provides for incentives for private health insurance programs in private hospitals such as these organisations never dreamed of before. By its nature it will force people into contributing to private health insurance on a flat rate basis, with no concern for ability to pay. It provides for a system for the provision of health care for the disadvantaged which is narrow in its definition and restrictive in its operation. Administrative costs will increase, bureaucratic complexity will increase, and inevitably many will be at a disadvantage and suffer a demeaning means test under this system. </PARA>
<PARA> The idea of a simple universal system of health care funded on the basis of ability to pay, side by side with a private health system, has been thrown overboard. I suggest that this is the creation not of health care experts or of humanitarians but of economic theorists and venal health fund executives, who have conned a Minister and a Cabinet obssessed with the theories of Milton Friedman and Ayn Rand. As a side effect of this legislation, some women needing terminations of pregnancy will be bereft of all Government assistance, despite their payment of taxes. In fact, the way is open for funds to introduce very selective health cover and I will deal more with that later. </PARA>
<PARA> I will explain now how this legislation will work. Firstly, through clause 8 of the Bill, apart from the rigidly defined group of disadvantaged people provided for in this legislation, only those who are in private health funds will receive the Government medical benefit. Only this group will receive 30 per cent of the schedule fee. Only they will receive the benefit of a maximum gap payment of $10 per service. Despite paying taxes, despite being citizens of this country, those people who do not join a private company will receive no share of their contributions to general revenue. What an enormous benefit this is to the Government's friends. What an enormous pay-off it is for past assistance. What an extraordinary purpose it is for legislation in this country to put a severe and direct financial penalty on those who will not or do not deal with private health funds. Add this to the removal of accessible and non-means tested public beds and we have a complete destruction of the concept of a universal health scheme. The Opposition deplores this, as I suggest should all reasonable people. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Bill defines the categories of people who will be treated as disadvantaged. At the same time, it removes completely any discretionary ability of a doctor to treat a patient as disadvantaged and accept a lower fee. I was critical, as was the Opposition, of the previous scheme which, apart from the case of pensioners and other beneficiaries in this community, left discretion completely to the doctor. We sought some definition so that there would be a clear right to be treated in this way. We did not seek so narrow a definition as to leave any compassionate or thoughtful doctor with no way to treat deserving cases outside these guidelines as disadvantaged other than to charge them nothing. This is a complete reversal by a party which 12 months ago assured us that the only reasonable way to judge whether a person was disadvantaged was, in fact, to leave it to the doctor. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government said that. Of course, under the present system existing pensioners will get their cover. As every honourable senator knows, pensioners live in fear and dread of losing their health benefit cover. But when they do under the present system they can at least use the public hospital beds and, if necessary, go to the out-patients department or their doctor can treat them as disadvantaged. All that will go. They will now be faced with paying $5 or $6 a week for insurance for a single person or $10 or $11 a week for insurance for a family. They will be up for other increased health charges. Everyone in this place is aware of the fear that exists in the minds of the pensioners who receive small superannuation payments or other incomes. How much more fear will be there now? What sort of burden will be placed on them, and on the chronically and recurrently ill aged in this community? The safety net of free hospital care-the altruistic doctor for the pensioners, up to 100,000, just over the fringe benefit level-is gone and we are left with the very hard landing of increased costs and worry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The disadvantaged are defined by the Government in this legislation as migrants and refugees in the first six months, pensioners and social security beneficiaries under the fringe benefit level and what may be described as the working poor. In this legislation there is no reference to the chronically ill. There is no reference to those who have frequent illnesses and difficulties. The fee paid to the doctors for treating these people will be increased from 75 per cent to 85 per cent of the schedule fee. At the same time the Government estimates, as it said in a reply to my colleague in another place, Dr Klugman, that in fact the present system will save some $9m. I believe this is the real reason for this measure. In the Government's view, doctors have been too generous in treating the disadvantaged. Anyone who knows the situation will know that there are in this community large numbers of disadvantaged and worthy people who are unable to be treated as disadvantaged because some doctors do not do so. </PARA>
<PARA> What is of greater concern in this definition is the administrative nightmare which is introduced by these rigid requirements of definition of disadvantaged and disadvantaged people who are not working. It is estimated that there will be some 800,000 potential applicants and they will need to be assessed twice a year at least. That many new files will need to be established in the Department of Social Security, with all that that involves in manpower and bureaucratic complexity. If, as will often occur, people do not apply before they need hospitalisation or other treatment there will be the extra administrative burden at the point of service, be it in the surgery or the hospital. The Department of Social Security is well aware of these problems. In instructions that have gone out to officers of the Department of Social Security it is obvious that the Department is quite aware of what has happened. These instructions state:</PARA>
<PARA> Media coverage of the new health arrangements as they affect pensioners beneficiaries can be expected to cause a flow of enquiries from people unsure of their position. </PARA>
<PARA>The new scheme comes into effect from 1 September 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . In the meantime, however, the following information may be useful, particularly in respect of the around 340,000 pensioners, supporting parent beneficiaries and sickness beneficiaries who are not eligible for a pensioner health benefits card. </PARA>
<PARA>So, the Department is immediately anticipating 340,000 people from this group in the community. It goes on to say later:</PARA>
<PARA> All people over 70 are entitled to an age pension irrespective of income. Many people over 70 do not test their eligibility for a PHB card because they claim the pension at the basic rate and do not disclose details of any income they may have-while many may have incomes over the PHB limits or may prefer to take out or continue private health insurance cover, others may now wish to test theit PHB eligibility. </PARA>
<PARA>Not only is eligibility being tested but also the ability of the social security system. We are told that claim forms will be available from the Department of Social Security and post offices after 3 August. A large number of people who previously have not had much contact with the Department of Social Security will come into this category. The old subsidised health benefits scheme-the first legislation to be removed by this Government when it came to power in 1975-was a similar scheme. It failed. There was only a 30 per cent take up. This scheme may well fail for the same reason. We have had penalties introduced into this legislation and we will have bad debts for hospitals because of people who thought they were covered but found they were not. </PARA>
<PARA> A further problem arises because of the sudden death cut-off point of the means test in this case. The family with two children earning $199 a week will receive cover as disadvantaged. On $201 a week the family faces $12 a week insurance costs. To anyone's way of thinking, this is grossly unfair. This is the inequity faced in Senator Mason's proposed amendment to this legislation. The Opposition will support his amendment as a second best alternative, but we believe that a solution within the bounds of administrative possibility will not be found by the committee of inquiry that he has suggested should investigate this matter. The only solution is a universal, progressively funded scheme, and we believe that the committee proposed by Senator Mason's amendment can reveal only inequity, injustice and complexity beyond belief. The whole concept of this sort of disadvantaged provision introduces unnecessary complexity and categorisation which in fact will stigmatise those who are so categorised. It smacks of the nineteenth century concept of charity in an area where such a concept is unnecessary. It should not occur in a modern society. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said initially, a fair and equitable health system should provide universal cover, be easily understood and be funded on the basis of the ability to pay. It should be an economic operation. This system will be complex, will not provide universal cover and will be funded largely by a flat rate system unrelated to the ability to pay. The cost burden will fall far too much on the frequent users-the chronically ill. It provides no hope for economic restraint. In fact, the fault inherent in the fee-for-service system will be increased with the forcing of people into private health funds and into private health care. It contains injustices at the cut-off point for the disadvantaged which we believe are beyond repair. We will go back to this matter in the Committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to mention one section of the Bill which is causing some concern. I believe it concerns people on both sides of this House. I refer to the clauses which amend section 73F of the parent Act. This provision allowed a health fund to obtain an exemption for services by applying to the Minister for Health. In fact, it applies to the termination of pregnancy, or abortion, and has been used by two general health funds to avoid paying a benefit. It is argued that one should allow such funds to do this when such treatment is carried out on religious or conscientious grounds. It was of little significance when there was an alternative and such patients had recourse to public hospital treatment, to which they had contributed through their taxes, therefore receiving a government benefit. As has been pointed out by members on both sides of the other place, under this legislation people who join one of the health funds applying this exemption will be considered as uninsured. Not only will they not receive a benefit from the health fund, but also they will not receive a Government benefit. They will have no fall-back position and in many cases they will not be able to go into a public ward because of the means test. Certainly, there is a provision that the organisation should advertise what it is doing. In some cases an adult age dependant of a contributor may not agree with the contributor's views. Faced with circumstances which he or she had not thought of previously, a contributor may have a change of mind. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that it is one thing for the Government to allow a fund to have in the legislation this restrictive clause and it is another thing to allow the fund to inflict its judgment on the Government and for the Government then to refuse to pay its contribution. The Opposition opposes this provision both for its direct and potential effect on the patients who may be concerned. The legislation does not state clearly what it is about. It allows for further and wider exemptions when quite clearly the exemption was intended to apply only to abortion. The situation, we suggest, should not exist where the disbursement of Government funds depends on the moral judgment of any such organisation. At the very least the legislation should make clear what the Government intends to be accepted as an exemption and the Government should pay its contribution to all unfortunate people who may fall into these circumstances. I believe, in the absence of an alternative public health system, the Government must consider whether such an exemption should exist at all. If organisations which claim that they are providing universal health cover introduce restrictions such as this one, they will be providing the sort of optional health cover to which the Government, in another part of the legislation, says that it objects. The legislation in its present form, as far as we see it, is unamendable in this regard. That situation arises because the Government has got away from the principle of universality and from providing to the ordinary taxpayers of this country the right of access to health care to which they have contributed. The difficulty has arisen because of that basic fault in the legislation. If the Government persists with this sort of legislation it really must consider whether it will allow this sort of exemption in the future. As I have said, there is a perfectly good argument for such an exemption under a different health system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will be opposing many of the clauses of the Bill in the Committee stage. We do not believe that this legislation is amendable in any way to provide a fair and decent health system. We have some sympathy with Senator Mason who wishes to improve this health system by introducing some sort of sliding scale means test. We have no objection to a committee looking into that matter but we believe the complexities of the system will be such that the only answer the Committee will be able to come up with is that what we need is a universal system. For these reasons and for the other reasons that we will advance in the Committee stage, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out all words after 'That', insert 'the Bill be withdrawn and re-drafted-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) to enable those sections of the Bill dealing with the Isolated Patients Allowance, Pathology Services, Nursing Homes Assistance and Therapeutic Goods to be separately introduced and separately debated;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) to delete all provisions dealing with the Government's health insurance changes; and</PARA>

<PARA> (c) remove the necessity for the categorisation of the disadvantaged, so prominent a feature of the present Bill,</PARA>

<PARA> (e) contain costs by effective constraints on the providers of health services, neglected by the concentration on inappropriate and ineffectual restraints on patient usage in the present Bill'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps listeners to the debate could be excused for being disappointed if they had hoped to glean anything of the Health Acts Amendment Bill from listening to Senator Grimes tonight. They heard for about 10 minutes how greedy the health funds were. I believe that people are basically very happy with the way their funds have looked after them over the years. Listeners to the debate then heard Senator Grimes's socialist philosophy for the next 10 minutes. In the last few minutes of his speech he went over the whole thing again. He has given us little information of the actual workings of the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Senate will be aware, last year the Government set up an investigation into the hospital system. This was the result of the tremendous increase in hospital and health costs generally which has occurred over the last five years. In 1974-75 the cost of health care to the Commonwealth Government was $1,283m. Then the Labor Party brought in Medibank. In just one year that cost doubled. The following year the cost was $2,953m. The majority of people were still paying for private health insurance, yet the cost to the Commonwealth Government-the cost to the taxpayer-doubled in one year. It was in the light of this increase and the increases that have occurred since then that the Commonwealth Government decided there should be an inquiry into the hospital sphere. It was in this area of health care that the greatest expense had occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> The Jamison Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals came out with a very clear report in which it said that there was waste, inefficiency and unnecessary duplication of costly equipment in public hospitals. The reason that Jamison report gave was that nobody had responsibility for health care. Funding was divided. While anyone pays only half of a bill he will not really care about cost efficiency. He will not really care about those few extra dollars on the bill because he is paying only half. The Jamison report made it very clear that the major reason for this escalation in cost was that the shared responsibility between the Commonwealth and the States made it no one's direct responsibility. The recommendation from the Jamison report was that the States should bear their constitutional responsibilities and look after hospitals. Let us not forget that even if the Commonwealth wanted to take over the States' hospitals it could not do so. Constitutionally, the States must bear the responsibility for their hospitals. I will deal with the Bill in two separate areas-the hospital area and the medical area. Firstly, I will deal with the hospital area. Senator Grimes is correct in saying that we on this side of the House believe that private hospitals play a very important part in this country. They are able to care for people at a much cheaper rate than the big public hospitals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was saying that it is cheaper in a private hospital and rightly so because the big public hospitals have very expensive treatments and intensive care units. They teach medical students and this adds to costs. The Government is well aware that the private hospitals play a very important part in the health care of this country. Consequently it has decided to raise the Commonwealth benefit for the cost of a bed per day in private hospitals. This will apply to surgical beds only. The benefit will be raised to $28 a day while medical beds and obstetric beds will stay $16 a day. According to the definition in the Bill, surgical procedure means a service which is a prescribed item. The regulations will deal with that in more detail. Surgical beds are described as any surgical item that has a doctor fee of about $100.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now refer to public hospitals. As I have said, their responsibility is seen as a State responsibility. The Commonwealth's agreements with the majority of States fall due this year, and that is why we have undertaken this big change at this time. All States except Tasmania and South Australia-the agreements with them fall due in 1985-are working under this new arrangement. For the year 1981-82, the Commonwealth grant will be the same as it was this year, plus 10 per cent inflation, minus 60 per cent of what the Commonwealth estimates that a State can raise in revenue. The Commonwealth is also looking after about 3 million people whom it has classed as disadvantaged. There will be a review at the end of this year when the States can put their case if they feel that this arrangement has not worked as they believe it should. As far as Tasmania is concerned, I believe it has the best of both worlds. The Minister of Health in Tasmania has decided to charge patients in public hospitals in that State. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He had the option because Tasmania's agreement with the Commonwealth does not end until 1985. So it was completely up to the Minister of Health whether he abided by the present system or encompassed the new system. He decided-I believe rightly-that he could have the best of both worlds for that period. So he has accepted the system by which Tasmania will get the same grant in 1981-82 as it received this year, plus 10 per cent inflation, minus only 50 per cent of what that State decides-not what the Commonwealth decides-it can raise in revenue. There is also the fact that the Commonwealth is looking after that area of disadvantaged people. So my State is particularly lucky.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Grimes spoke very disparagingly about the fact that our Government decided to extend the area of disadvantaged in such an enormous way. I believe it is quite a breakthrough. For the first time the Commonwealth Government has decided to look at families' incomes in relation to the number of children that they have. I will go through the various classifications of disadvantaged because clearly Senator Grimes seemed to keep away from this area. He spoke of it in a disparaging way but did not give any information about the groupings of these people. Pensioners who are already holding the pensioner medical card will experience no change. They will remain as they are. Refugees and migrants, for the first six months after their arrival in this country, will require no means test but will be classed as disadvantaged. They will be informed of this on entry so there will be no problems there. Any person receiving any part of the unemployment benefit will be automatically eligible. He will not have to apply. He will be automatically issued with a card or he may be entitled to use the unemployment benefit cheque butt. This has yet to be decided. He will be automatically included in this group. Those on special benefits will also be included in this group. </PARA>
<PARA> Outside these social welfare areas another group that could be considered disadvantaged are married couples whose income is $160 per week plus $20 for each child. That can be quite a considerable amount if one has a large family. A married couple with four children can earn up to $240 a week. If they have seven children they can earn up to $300 a week and still be classed as disadvantaged and still receive free health and medical care. The income for a single person is $96 a week, but the income of a single mother with a child is $160 a week, the same as that of a married couple. A single mother with two children will receive $160, plus $20 for that extra child. As I said, this gives these people free hospitalisation and free bulk billing of any medical costs. Doctors will receive 85 per cent of the schedule fee. This takes in about three million people. </PARA>
<PARA> The rest of the Australian community is expected to cover itself by insurance. Senator Grimes said that this was not a universal scheme. I say that it is a universal scheme. As a matter of fact it is far more universal than I believe the scheme has been in the past because the Government has said that there should be two tables only, the basic table and the ancillary table. Everyone who is covered by the basic table gets medical benefits, that is, the assistance subsidy from the Government of 30 per cent of the medical schedule fee. </PARA>
<PARA> This scheme comes into force on 1 September. Because the Government has decided that there will be no waiting period between 1 September and 31 October, people will have plenty of time to cover themselves. Anyone who is a pensioner or who is classed as disadvantaged will have no waiting period-if they fall outside that eligiblity they can join a fund immediately. Indeed, anyone classed as disadvantaged does not have to have his health card before he can receive a medical service. He can go along and receive some medical service and then apply for his disadvantaged eligiblity and be able to receive his card up to 13 weeks after that service. The Commonwealth medical benefit payable to those people who are insured is 30 per cent of the fee for any item of the medical benefits schedule. Any fund-Senator Grimes seemed to concentrate on this aspect of the legislation-that seeks the permission of the Minister not to have to pay benefits for certain items on the schedule will be entitled to do so as long as the Minister agrees. The funds will be excluded from having to pay benefits for those items but in this respect the advertisements must be extremely clear. The people must be made aware. If a fund has decided to cut out benefits, for instance, for cosmetic surgery, this must be clearly put in the advertisements. </PARA>
<PARA> The main concern seems to be about a couple of funds-and this is not new; this has been going on for some time-that have decided for religious reasons to drop payments in respect of abortion. As Senator Grimes has complained bitterly about this I feel it probably needs some explanation. In this country we have a freedom of choice on religion. I believe this is something of which every Australian is proud. We do not have any restrictions in this respect. If people believe according to their religion that abortion is murder-a considerable number of Australians do-they are entitled, I believe, to pay their contributions to a fund which does not provide cover for abortion, something which they vehemently oppose. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Melzer" NAMEID="OL7">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Melzer has said, they must know. The legislation points out very clearly that advertisements on this aspect must be clearly spelled out. I have undertaken that if any information is brought to my notice which indicates that the position is not clearly spelled out I will be only too happy to take the matter to the Minister who will insist upon this being done. Senator Grimes spoke about the distribution of Commonwealth medical benefits, which is the reponsibility of the funds. People who claim abortion expenses from funds with such a policy would not get either the fund benefit or the Commonwealth benefit. As I have said, this is a choice. Contributors may not believe in abortion, they may not want their contributions to go towards abortions, they may not want their taxes to go towards abortions. This Commonwealth benefit is a small area in which their taxes can be seen as not going towards this item. I believe that has been clearly spelled out in this Bill. I have no problem with that. I believe in this country, where we have freedom of religion, this is the least we can do to fulfil the desires of those people who hold this belief.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government-Senator Grimes certainly left out this aspect too, as is his wont-has introduced a rebate system. We have gone back to the system of giving people some incentive to insure. The Government has decided that the rebate should be 32c in the dollar for basic table insurance. Nobody can say that those people who can afford to pay for the ancillary services which are provided by a private hospital will get any extra tax benefit from this provision. They will not. Everyone will get exactly the same rebate of 32c in the dollar for basic table insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> There seems to have been some confusion about entitlement to the rebate depending on when insurance contributions are paid. There have been some confusing articles published recently in the Canberra Times. If I may put the position pretty clearly, anyone who pays his contributions-whether they be half yearly, yearly or monthly-will be entitled to the rebate. People are concerned that they will not get the rebate. If I pay my contribution now, in June, and I make another yearly payment next June, I will be entitled to a rebate because the payment has been made in the one financial year. The position is exactly the same as if I pay my contributions in September. So there is no need for concern on this aspect. I believe that people have been going along to the funds and saying: 'I will pay my contributions for only the next couple of weeks because unless I pay my yearly amount after 1 July I will not get my rebate'. That is not the case. So long as people pay their contributions within the one financial year, no matter in what month the payment is made, they will be entitled to a rebate at the end of that financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has decided that it will take full responsibility for the payment of nursing home benefits. I believe this is an extremely good idea mainly because people who go into nursing homes are not really insurable. The system is such that there is some benefit from being insured but these people are not really insurable. The Government has decided to provide insurance for these patients by taking over full responsibility for their payments. This will make the contributions by the funds much lower than if they had to foot the bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The philosophy of this Government is that the taxpayer should pay for essentials and that people should pay what they can afford to contribute towards their health services. Taxpayers should pay also for those who cannot afford to look after themselves. Technology has given us the opportunity to enjoy perfect health care. It could be said that the best health care for a pregnant woman would be for her to have a scan every time she visits her doctor. Many doctors say that this is excessive and that women should have a scan once or twice during their pregnancy but certainly not on each visit to the doctor. However, it could be argued that, if a scan was done on each visit to the doctor, some abnormality could be picked up at an earlier stage. We could talk about all the new technology under the sun and we could come up with a health system that would cost the earth and that the taxpayer would never willingly take on. A judgment has to be made about the sort of health care that we want and the sorts of costs that that health care would entail. The costs of this health care could be excessive, extreme, or the ultimate but is the taxpayer prepared to pay for it? I am sure that every honourable senator in this place has had representations concerning the lowering of taxation. Not one honourable senator has not had people say to him or her: 'We are paying too much tax'. </PARA>

If the Jamison report says that, if no one is responsible for hospital costs, inefficiency, waste and duplication will take place, this is a problem that has to be cured. We can produce the best possible health care in this country but it will be at a cost. The Government has noted that the taxpayers have said that there is a limit to what they are prepared to pay for health care. That limit has been defined by the Government. It has said that if the majority of people can afford to pay for their own health costs through insurance, they should do so, and that the taxpayer will only look after those who are the real needy, that is, those who cannot afford to look after their health. That is the philosophy of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health Acts Amendment Bill is a very important one indeed for the Australian people since it brings into being virtually a whole new ball game in the area of health care with the demolition of the Medibank concept and its replacement by the concept that people should pay for their own costs. The Australian Democrats have seen a rather tragic dichotomy between the view of the Australian Labor Party and the Government over this matter because we see problems on either side. It is true that the Australian community cannot go on indefinitely bearing the enormous costs of health care, yet at the same time it is very important, if one is to deviate from that point of view and say that people are to pay for themselves, to be absolutely certain that one will not place large and unprotected sections of society at risk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats have done a little homework on this matter. We are absolutely convinced that the Bill as it stands will put hundreds of thousands of Australians at risk-not only Australians of whom it might be said that they can look after themselves but also those who cannot and whose interests and needs we as a society should be watching more than anything else. I refer to the next generation, the children of this nation, who are in no position to guard themselves but who face the world and its problems, including illness and injury, only by virtue of the extent to which their parents can afford to help them to see that they are provided with medical attention when they need it or, failing that, that the State does in some way. I suggest that here lies the dilemma which we should be considering at this time. This is the reason why the Australian Democrats are taking the action in this debate which we are taking. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this Bill ought not to be passed in the Senate at this time in any case. It should be given much more mature consideration for a number of reasons, not the least being that last October the Australian people elected a new Senate, and their intention then was expressed clearly. Their intention, which was expressed as I said last October, removed the control of the Senate from the Government. Due to the provisions of the Constitution which say that a new Senate will not be constituted until 30 June after an election, the new Senate in fact will not assemble in this place until the Budget session-the next session of Parliament-begins on 18 August. The Australian Democrats find it intolerable that the Government should use this procedure on the last sitting day of the Senate to force through a Bill of tremendous importance and significance to so many Australians. The Government has no moral right to push through this legislation, and it knows it full well. It is legislating, in any moral terms at all, against the will of the Australian people as expressed at an election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When was the will of the people expressed, Senator Baume? Last October! Senator Baume knows that only too well. He can wriggle on the pin but there is no way he can escape that point. The first point about this Bill is that it should not be here in the first place. The Australian Democrats recognise that the Bill will be passed by the Senate simply because the Government has, for the moment, the numbers to get it through legally if not morally. Of course, it is absolutely immoral. However, it will be a fact of real life. Following on from that, the Australian Democrats concern is to see that this new system of financing health care will not create too many victims within the Australian community. It is for that reason that I shall move a motion following the second reading of this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is the problem? It is basically the heavy burden the costs of health insurance will place on families which are just above the levels of income that would permit them free health care on the grounds of being disadvantaged. I felt a tremendous sense of irony and unreality when Senator Walters pointed out that the exempt level for a family with seven children would be the princely sum of $340 a week. I wonder whether she feels she would be in a position with a husband to bring up seven children on such an income. I wonder whether she would consider that an adequate income from which to pay medical expenses as well as everything else that is involved with bringing up a family. I was amazed and appalled to hear her stand up in this place and actually say that the people are adequately provided for. An average family consisting of a young married couple with two young children is allowed to earn the princely sum of $200 a week. If it earns any more it would not be regarded as disadvantaged and would have to meet the total cost of health insurance. I would have thought that $200 is not very much with which to bring up, properly house and look after four people. </PARA>
<PARA> I am especially concerned about and I have a special anxiety for the tens of thousands and possibly hundreds of thousands of people in that category who live in my home city of Sydney. My reason is, of course, that rents in Sydney are so high. They are higher than rents in any other parts of Australia and very much higher than most other parts of Australia-to the extent that an unfurnished unit that would minimally house a family of four costs from $60 to $90 a week. Rents are actually rising. When I say that such accommodation would minimally house people, I should point out that children would not have separate bedrooms. The family would be living in a two-bedroom unit which would not be too close to the centre of Sydney. Rents for a two-bedroom apartment in central Sydney are now up to $130 to $150 a week. The payment of $12 to $15 by such a family for medical insurance will create severe, not just minimal, pressures and hardships. Families will not have to do without only some things. I believe that in some situations families will have to decide whether to insure against the contingency of illness or else cut back on food. I think we have reached the disgraceful stage where the Government cannot see this problem. The Government is going to impose that hardship not on a few people in this country, not on people who perhaps we could say should have been more provident but on young married couples with young children who have married with good hopes and intentions for the future. In many cases the wife is looking after her children and cannot work. Those are the kinds of people who will be the victims of what the Government is doing. It is not sufficient for the Government to say that it is going to victimise people who do not have children; it is also going to victimise children. Children will be victims from the moment they are born. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that states part of the problem quite fairly. I would like to raise another matter which reveals just how absurd and poorly thought out this legislation is. We have the absurd situation that a man with two children earning $205 a week-I must say that Senator Walters did not say that the incomes she quoted are before tax; they are gross incomes-will be worse off financially than a man who earns $199 a week. The man on $205 a week is worse off even after existing tax concessions because he has to pay medical insurance whereas the man on $199 a week is classified as disadvantaged and pays no medical insurance. So we have this unjust and anomalous situation which I suggest will affect many people. The man on $205 a week would probably be better off from 1 September going to his boss and saying: 'Please, sir, reduce my salary'. I commend that idea. If this mad hatter legislation goes through I suggest to anybody in that position that that is probably the best thing to do. If people sit down and do their arithmetic for a few minutes they will see that it would be well worth their while to follow that course of action. </PARA>
<PARA> The subsidy plan that the Australian Democrats envisage would at least remedy that situation. We do not want to be hard and fast about how this plan should be implemented. That is why we suggest that this matter should be referred to a committee which we recognise would have more wisdom and experience than we have. We are merely posing this problem and suggesting a possible way of overcoming it. We say that there should be a subsidy plan which operates on a sliding scale covering people, say, up to $100 per week better off than the present cut-off figure. We think that not unreasonable. With an income of $200 to $300 a week, a family with two children is still pretty much up against it, and we believe they need assistance. The greatest assistance should obviously go to the ones who are poorest, at the bottom of that range. We believe it is desirable that a family with two children should pay perhaps $2 a week for health insurance if its income is $210, and that a family on $290 per week, on the other hand, should attract only a $2 subsidy. We have done some costing on this, within our resources. We estimate the average cost per subsidy to the Government to be some $5.50 a week on what it would appear at this stage that medical insurance will cost. We estimate that between 550,000 and 600,000 families would be affected, and we suggest it would cost the Government about $180m in a full year. However, as the Government would otherwise be returning one-third of this amount to the taxpayer in any case, since medical insurance is tax deductible, the actual cost to the Government would be closer to $120m, and indeed should be less than that, for reasons I will detail in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> What would we get for $100m? Literally hundreds of thousands of the young people of this country would not be in a situation in which their families had to take a desperate gamble, and it would be that. No parents want to be in a position where they cannot take their children to a doctor. But unless the Government accepts this measure, or something like it, it will force them into a position where they will have to say: 'We cannot afford it. We cannot afford to get out of this flat'-or whatever they have-'Where do we live otherwise? The children have to have shoes, they have to be decently clad. What about those things?' I suggest that any honourable senators who believe that that sort of dilemma will not happen have never tried-let them be honest with themselves-in today's society and today's cost structure to look after a young wife and bring up two young children on $200 a week, from which tax is deducted, of course. If honourable senators consult their consciences on that, I think they will realise that what I am saying is true. It is particularly true of our major cities, where the bulk of our population lives, because of the high costs involved-not only the high cost of rent but also the high cost of transport. The breadwinner in that place has a very high charge coming out of that same $200 per week, on which he has probably already paid out $70 in rent, for his transport to and from work, and he has to be decently clad for his work. It is not a matter then of these people simply giving up luxuries to pay health insurance. They will be compromising with necessity, and that is something that no government has any right to ask of its people. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that health funds ought to be able to reduce their costs in the future. We have a number of areas of policy in this regard which we hope they will look at and do something about. It is insane and ought to be illegal for health funds to spend lavish sums of money on advertising, turning out lavishly coloured printed brochures, putting advertisements in newspapers and so on, and having expensive secretariat and offices in expensive buildings. If they do that, they are merely adding elements to the cost of health care which ought to be there, and that also is something which needs to be said. Any Australian who picks up a beautiful and attractively printed brochure from a health fund should bear in mind that he, the average Australian, is paying through the nose for it and that it is being added to the cost of looking after his children in a hospital, and so on. We believe it is contemptible that the Government should be supporting and continuing to support organisations which it has told us will solve the problem of health care for us, and allowing them to go on with that kind of wasteful practice. There should be the strictest type of audit over the costs incurred by health funds. As the Government has said, those organisations have enormous power. We have given to them the means of life and death virtually over our people, over whether or not they can afford to go to a doctor. Therefore those organisations should reasonably be subject to the most extreme strictures and should be compelled by law to bear their responsibility to society. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said before, and I now say it again, the Australian Democrats believe in private enterprise; but we believe in enlightened private enterprise, one which sees its obligation to society first and regards its obligation to make money as secondary. Organisations such as the health funds which have now received a mandate from the Government to carry out essential services for society should be even more closely scrutinised than other organisations to see that they meet their responsibilities. I trust that they will do so. If the funds do reduce their costs by eliminating some of the wasteful practices I have mentioned it would be possible to reduce the cost of the subsidy and the total cost to society would be lower. It is in the hands of the Government itself to insist that that area of costs be reduced and that subsidy brought back to an even smaller amount than the $120m I have mentioned. I am not saying that there would be huge savings, but perhaps we could get the figure down to $100m. An amount of $20m is an appreciable sum of money in anybody's terms. I believe that it could be saved. </PARA>
<PARA> We are worried that if this is not done our children will be at risk because their parents simply cannot afford to take out insurance. We think that the Commonwealth-this is a matter that a committee could look at-should pay that subsidy direct to the funds. That would follow the principle already established by the Commonwealth agreement to guarantee health care to the aged and chronically ill. The Australian Democrats cannot see any real difference between that area and the area which I have been talking about. It is possible that there could be even more flexibility. The Australian Council of Social Service, with which I was talking today in Sydney, mentioned some points to me that are worth putting forward to the Senate at this stage. The Council says that essential commitments, such as mortgage or rent and the cost of running a car if needed for work, should also be taken into account when assessing eligibility for government assistance, as is the case with eligibility for legal aid. Otherwise, as ACOSS says and as I said earlier in the debate, people will have to decide whether to take out health insurance, lose their homes or keep their homes and possibly go bankrupt if a major health crisis occurs in the family. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point made to me by ACOSS was that ill health in itself causes poverty. A person suffering from a severe chronic illness cannot work in a full time occupation. Here we have a catch-22 situation. People who are ill and who are perhaps just struggling along-we could look at a case where there have been two breadwinners in the family and they have two children but one of them is sick-are placed in the situation, at its worst. This ought to be squarely faced. Because of certain matters, the only mechanism that I can adopt to put an idea to the Senate is to foreshadow that after the second reading of this Bill I shall move pursuant to Standing Order 196A:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Social Welfare for inquiry, with particular reference to the provision of a sliding scale of subsidies for health insurance which would apply to families earning more than the aggregate amounts at which they would qualify for free health care as disadvantaged persons, and report by the first sitting day in August 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats suggest that this is the last chance for the Senate to take a second look at this area of gross and mass hardship which is about to be inflicted on the Australian people by this Bill. The Senate should try to do something about it. We should at least take another look at it in order to do something ourselves before the scheme commences on 1 September. I commend that thought to honourable senators. I ask them to give it the most earnest consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are considering the Health Acts Amendment Bill 1981. It is an absolute disgrace to bring forward such an important piece of legislation so late in the parliamentary session. In fact, the rush of legislation which has faced this chamber over the past couple of weeks shows the ineptitude of the present Government. If the Government cannot manage its legislative program any better than it has done over the past two weeks it is hard to understand how it thinks it can run the country. When this current session commenced we waited for weeks for legislation to come forward for debate. In the last three-week bracket of sitting days we have been assaulted with legislation as the Government panics, knowing that it will lose its majority in this place at the end of this month. As Senator Mason so eloquently put, it is determined to use the numbers given to it by the senators who were rejected by the electors in October last year but who, by a quirk of the Australian Constitution, remain here until the end of the month.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the late introduction of this legislation in some ways comes as no surprise. The behaviour of the Government in the first half of this year has been marked by its indecision and by its inability to agree within itself on possible legislation to bring before the Parliament. Although the late arrival of the Health Acts Amendment Bill 1981 comes as no surprise, that does not make the Government's tardiness in any way indefensible. This is the type of legislation that should have been placed before the Parliament in the first or second week of this session. The Parliament should have been given ample time to examine the legislation and the public also should have been given an opportunity to offer its opinion on these changes to Australia's health system. That, of course, would not happen with this Government. It has the simplistic idea that what it thinks is good for the Australian people must be good for the Australian people. But sadly this assumption is so often incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA> In discussing the Health Acts Amendment Bill 1981 it is worth examining this Government's record in health insurance since it came to power in 1975. I can well remember the 1975 election campaign as many honourable senators who were candidates can remember it. One of Mr Fraser's catchcries at that election was that he would retain Medibank. Of course he would, in 1975, say that he would retain Medibank. At that stage the Australian people understood what a sound scheme Medibank was. It was simple, it was effective and it was a health scheme which even the medical profession was willing to accept, after having been a bitter opponent in Medibank's developmental stages. Mr Fraser said, indeed he pledged, that he would retain Medibank. What happened? Less than six months after it had been elected in 1975, the Fraser Government announced a number of major changes to Australia's health insurance scheme. Amongst those changes was the imposition of a levy on income for those who wanted to remain in Medibank. It is worth remembering that when in Opposition the same parties blocked the Labor Government's efforts to introduce a Medibank levy. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1976 changes Australians could opt out of Medibank but if they did they were obliged to take out private health insurance. They could not opt out altogether. Health insurance of some type was compulsory. Two years later there were other major changes. In May of 1978 medical benefits were reduced from 85 per cent to 75 per cent of the schedule fee. Bulk billing was abolished. Further modifications were announced in August of the same year. Health insurance was no longer compulsory and a universal Commonwealth benefit of 40 per cent up to a maximum patient contribution of $20 was introduced. That $20 was the maximum patient contribution per medical service where the schedule fee was charged. But this did not last long. In 1979 the 40 per cent medical benefit was replaced by a patient maximum payment of $20 for each medical service. Now we have the provisions of the Health Acts Amendment Bill before us. Since 1975 the Fraser Government has consistently altered the 1975 Medibank system which it has so solemnly promised to maintain. The Bill being debated today removes all vestiges of Labor's Medibank. It replaces Medibank by a giant medimuddle. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall outline some of the aspects of this Bill to which my colleagues in the Opposition and I take exception. Before I do so I mention something of the broad aspects of the Bill. At first blush it might be thought that this is a straightforward Bill. The term 'Acts' in the Bill's title, however, suggests that there could be more than meets the eye, and indeed there is. This Bill actually amends four Acts, the Health Insurance Act, the National Health Act, the Nursing Homes Assitance Act and the Therapeutic Goods Act. The fact that the Bill actually amends four Acts supports my earlier argment that it is a disgrace that this Bill should come to the Senate so late in the session and, along with other Bills, be pushed through the Parliament with indecent haste. It must also be remembered that one clause of another Bill relates to the current changes to health insurance, namely, clause 27 of the Income Tax (Assessment and Rates) Amendment Bill. It is worth mentioning that this introduction of amendments to four Acts was a deliberate ploy. Mr MacKellar let this slip the other day. Last Tuesday, 9 June, on the Australian Broadcasting Commission program AM Mr MacKellar said, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government has made it clear that it's amending about four Acts in this current omnibus bill which is coming before the Parliament. I think it's due to come before the Parliament today. It's taking the opportunity of amending, as I say, these four Bills at the one time to avoid a series of debates over what are in many cases just machinery changes to various Bills. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr MacKellar was admitting there that the four amending Bills were put together so that the Government would avoid a series of debates over each one. The basic objection I raise to provisions of the Health Acts Amendment Bill is concerned with amendments to the Health Insurance Act. Certain provisions of this Bill are deliberately designed to force people to take out health insurance. Rather than be open about the matter and actually compel Australians to take out medical or health insurance, a course of action which would appear to be contrary to the expressed philosophy of this Government, the strategy has been, if not to compel, at least strongly to induce most people to take out health insurance. Why is that so? Australians have been leaving health insurance schemes in droves. The Government is rushing to get people back into the health insurance funds. Senator Grimes mentioned that earlier. He outlined the reasons why the Government was so keen to get people back into health insurance funds and what those health insurance funds have done for the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Even a cursory examination of the figures made available by the Australian Bureau of Statistics reveals that Australian people are becoming less and less satisfied with Australia's health insurance mess. From March 1979 to March 1980 the number of Australians who were covered by some form of health insurance fell from 62.4 per cent to 59.4 per cent, a drop of 3 per cent. In each of the six States the downward trend was the same. For some reason that I have not been able to ascertain the trend was reversed in Australia's two Territories. However, the overall message was quite clear-health insurance contributors were expressing their dissatisfaction by opting out. Whilst Australian contributors thought they had the right to opt out, the Government thought otherwise. 'Get them back into the funds', is the message in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> How does the Government intend to persuade people to take out health insurance? If I may, I refer brieflly to a Bill that is not under discussion. The Government intends to offer a tax rebate of 32c in the dollar for the cost of basic hospital and medical insurance from 1 July. The fact that any personal savings in this area will be offset by the elimination of tax indexation seems not to concern the Government. As well, Commonwealth medical benefits of 30 per cent will be restricted to those who have basic medical cover. I find this provision to be totally objectionable and regard it as almost immoral. Why should any taxpayer who through his or her taxes makes a contribution to Commonwealth revenue not be eligible for a Commonwealth benefit because he or she decides not to join a health fund? As a senator for Queensland, I am even more opposed to such discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> An examination of the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures indicates that the sunshine State has the lowest health insurance cover of any State. By using the figures I referred to earlier it may be seen that in March 1980, 45.4 per cent of Queenslanders had health insurance. That compares with a high of 66.7 per cent in South Australia. For the purposes of an Australia-wide comparison, however, it should be noted that Queensland's 45.4 per cent compares with an Australian average of 59.4 per cent. Obviously fewer Queenslanders see a need for health insurance than do residents of other States. Naturally the Fraser Government's moves will force more people in Queensland into health insurance, but I expect that Queensland will still retain the distinction of having the lowest rate of health insurance in Australia. What does this mean to Queensland residents? Obviously, many will not receive a Commonwealth medical benefit if they incur a medical expense, whilst their neighbours who have taken out health insurance will receive it. Admittedly, this will occur in all States but the statistics available suggest that it will occur to a higher degree in Queensland than in other States. All this could be offset by the uninsured seeking medical treatment at Queensland's free hospitals. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, as a Queensland senator you would understand that this involves a very important point. Many Queenslanders will not take out health insurance because they know that they can fall back on the free hospital system which still remains. However, many of those who do not will not necessarily use that system for routine medical vistis and might well go to a private medical practitioner. They will know that if they run into really serious trouble they can fall back on the free hospital system. People who have not taken out health insurance and who go to the general practitioner, knowing that they may have to go to the public hospital at some stage, will not receive a Commonwealth medical benefit. My argument is that the percentage of such people will be greater in Queensland than it will in the other States. Only time will tell whether my argument is correct, but it is worth considering and has a basis of validity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I return to my discussion of Queensland's free hospital system: The Commonwealth has attempted to close that loophole by making it more difficult for that free system to continue. However, I have no doubt that Queensland will win through. I suggest that, despite the problems for Queensland that might result from this discriminatory type of legislation, people from other States should keep the fare to Queensland handy. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage of the debate I will mention just one other aspect of the Bill. Any previous attempt by the Commonwealth to provide some security to those who decided not to arrange some health benefit cover or who, through a variety of other reasons, did not do so has now vanished. At present Australians are given some protection against catastrophic illness. The $20 maximum patient contribution fee to which I referred earlier however will not apply from 1 September. The uninsured from that date will be liable for all their medical expenses, irrespective of how high those expenses may be. Uninsured patients are now facing the greatest gamble they have been confronted with since the early 1970s. The withdrawal of this benefit, of course, is another element of the Fraser Government's strategy of forcing Australians to take out private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> I digress here to mention the free hospital system that we have in Queensland. This is probably one of the major benefits that Queenslanders have at the present moment. Probably they will not have the same gamble as do people in other States so that if the worse comes to the worse and they have a major illness or a major accident they can fall back on the free hospital system which has been a feature of Queensland for over 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill which amends four Acts has 87 clauses, some of which are highly complex. I do not intend to pursue this Bill any further at this stage except to say that at the time of the last election the people of Australia did not expect that the Government would make such radical changes to the health insurance as has been done in this and associated legislation. The Labor Party made its position clear in relation to health policy prior to the last election. Labor leader, Bill Hayden, said amongst other things in his 1980 election policy speech:</PARA>
<PARA> A Labor Government is committed to restoring universal health insurance. It cannot be done immediately, but as a first step we announced 11 months ago we will extend free medical care in the next Budget to all expectant mothers and all dependent children. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, the electors understood what Labor's plans for health were if it were returned to government. They understood that a Labor government would be committed to restoring a universal health insurance scheme. It was pointed out well before the election that Labor realised at that stage that it was not possible to do that in one fell swoop. It did say it would move in that direction by extending free medical care to expectant mothers and to all dependent children. The people of Australia were able to make a choice. They were able to look at that policy outline stated almost 12 months before the election took place and compare it with the policy of the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fraser in his policy speech mentioned nothing about health at all. If one read the supplementary statements which accompanied his speech-I wonder how many electors actually read the supplementary statements-a reference to health would have been noted. Even that reference to health in the supplementary statements gave no indication that the current changes to health insurance would be introduced. In short, the Government has no mandate for the changes it has introduced in this current session of the Parliament. It may be 2 1/2 years before we go to the polls again, but the electors will remember this legislation. They will remember that the Fraser Government brought this legislation before the Parliament without having a mandate for it. In my estimation the electors will react accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak just briefly to the Health Acts Amendment Bill tonight to raise one aspect of health insurance which has been raised publicly in the last few days. Some publicity has been given this week to the effects of health funds having the right to opt out of offering insurance for certain items. It has been plain that this has a very particular effect on women who might want to have an abortion and that it removes something that is presently available. I understand from my reading of the Bill and from assurances made by the Minister that this Bill does not, in fact, do that. But it has revealed an aspect that I think has not been realised or recognised by this Parliament in the past, an aspect which was emphasised by one extra factor in the policies put forward by the Government in this Health Acts Amendment Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1978 the Parliament passed amendments to health insurance legislation which gave two funds the opportunity to apply to a Minister to have the right not to offer insurance for certain items. That application, subject to approval, applied only to medical benefits. Clause 60 of this Bill extends that right to hospital insurance. It has been suggested that something is being taken away from people that they have now. In fact, nothing is being taken away. What is revealed is a deficiency in the 1978 legislation, reinforced by an additional factor in this legislation. In 1978, when the Bill gave to funds the right to opt out under certain conditions, it was never suggested that the funds would take away from contributors their entitlement to the Commonwealth contribution to health insurance. That is what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> If a fund says to its contributors that it will no longer offer insurance for certain medical items and that is approved by the Minister and all the procedures are gone through, the contributor not only loses access to a fund payment which he may or may not object to, but also he loses access to the Commonwealth payment. I am assured privately that that was not the intention of the Government. I went back to the debates on various health amendments during 1978 and found reference in those debates to something called 'optional deductibles'. This reference arose in the first instance in a speech made by the then Minister for Health to the House of Representatives. The speech was a statement on health policy which preceded the introduction of certain legislation. It was not a speech on the legislation itself. In that speech, referring to optional deductibles, the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> The rising cost of private health insurance has brought forward a significant number of proposals to the Government for further modification of health insurance arrangements. One suggestion is that people should meet a specified amount of their health costs in each year before becoming eligible for benefits. This concept, known as 'deductibles' is somewhat akin to arrangements to pay an 'excess' in comprehensive motor vehicle insurance. Other suggestions have been that medical services rendered in certain circumstances should not attract benefits-for example, some forms of cosmetic surgery and some terminations of pregnancy. Consequently, the Government has decided that in addition to offering the present standard or basic medical and hospital benefits tables, private health insurance organisations will be permitted to offer optional deductibles in those tables within reasonable limitations to be approved by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Certain legislation was introduced into the House of Representatives on 6 June 1978 and was debated there on 7 and 8 June. The legislation was introduced subsequently in the Senate and was debated on 9 June. Reference was made in that debate to deductibles but the debate was entirely in terms of this excess motor vehicle insurance type of analogy that people could undertake to pay a certain amount of their own medical costs or gamble on a certain level of medical costs, pay that and be insured only after that. The debate that raged at that time was, of course, that the young and the healthy would not insure or else they would take very low cost insurance with a large gap in excess. The high cost insurance would fall on the elderly and the infirm. The one sentence in the Minister's statement on health in May 1978 relating to certain medical services not attracting benefits was at no stage subsequently in the health debate either on those Bills or subsequent Bills in 1978, picked up. In September 1978 some further amendments to the National Health Bills were brought in by the then Minister. On 28 September, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> New section 73F, in clause 14 of the Bill, provides for the Minister, upon application by a medical benefits organisation, to grant an exemption to the organisation from paying out of its basic medical benefits table benefits for specified professional services. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have understood from that, and apparently both Houses of Parliament understood from that, that the only payments to a contributor that were affected were those out of the fund's medical benefits table. We have an arrangement with the funds whereby the Commonwealth benefit is actually paid by the fund to a contributor for an item. The fund then applies to the Government for reimbursement of that section of the payment which represents the Commonwealth payment. When we gave to funds the right not to pay benefits for certain medical items we took away the mechanism for paying the Commonwealth benefit for those items. I do not believe that was the intention of the Government and it certainly was not the understanding of Parliament because that issue was at no time addressed by either Government or Opposition members or senators. A couple of assertions were made earlier in the debate this evening in relation to that but I find no evidence in any of the speeches, from either side, of that matter. I believe it was not understood by Parliament that when it gave the opt out provision it was also setting up a situation whereby not only would fund benefits be not paid but also Commonwealth payments would not be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, I put it to you, and through you to the Minister representing the Minister for Health (Senator Peter Baume), that an undesirable effect of approving the application of a fund, on conscientious grounds or whatever, not to offer certain items in its benefits table is that Commonwealth benefits are taken away. I do not suggest for one minute that this is the Government's motivation but a cynical extension of this situation would be that a government of the future faced with an application by a fund to not pay fund benefits on certain items would see an advantage in approving that application because Commonwealth benefits would thereby be saved. There would be a financial incentive inherent in any such application for the Government to approve it because by the fund opting out the Commonwealth also would opt out. I do not believe that was the Government's intention. There is no indication in the debate that it was understood, much less was it the Government's intention, that that was what should happen. This has been highlighted in this debate because of the provision that in order to be paid Commonwealth benefits in future people must belong to private health funds. That makes the situation just a little different-undesirable as it was previously, although it was a situation that was overlooked or not brought to people's attention. </PARA>

All health debate during that year was on the subject of bulk billing, on the subject of whether there should be this excess provision and so on. This present debate has highlighted for everyone that there have been for the last three years people who have belonged to private health funds who have not received Commonwealth benefits for certain procedures if approval had been given to the fund to not pay fund benefits for those procedures. Now the Government is saying that any person who wishes to get the Commonwealth benefit must belong to a private health fund. That takes an element of competition out of the market place for the private health funds. To get the Commonwealth benefit, people must join a private health fund. That puts pressure on people to join a private health fund. That takes away an element of competition. The private health funds will not have to try quite so hard to get contributors. More people will join private health funds. It is possible that in the future with our range of health funds and with the funds not having to compete so hard for contributors, more funds will seek to get opt-out provisions, whatever their reason, and contributors or potential contributors will be faced with a range of choices where there are possibly none.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly it is a potential protection, but it is possible that no fund will offer benefits for a certain item although the Commonwealth still prefers to pay benefits for that item. It may be Government policy that benefits are payable for the item but there may be no way, through mechanical means, of paying the benefits to people who are insured and who may have become insured in order to get the Commonwealth benefit. It is possible that people will be faced with a range of health funds, each one of which has opted out of paying benefits for selected items. In that situation people may be faced with making a choice as to the best of a bad lot.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We cannot buy our health insurance piecemeal. We buy a package. We buy the entire thing from a health fund. We cannot buy part of our health insurance from one health fund. We cannot insure ourselves for certain items with one fund and insure ourselves for certain other items with another fund. We have to buy the entire package. In those circumstances, I think we have to take care to make sure that people get their Commonwealth entitlement, and that we do not give incentives to any fund to find means of opting out and have inadvertent casualties. At the moment the range is very limited, but it is not good enough to say: 'With notice, you can go to another health fund', because in the future there will not be as much competition amongst health funds to attract contributors as there is at the moment. I cannot accept that when a contributor joins a fund, because that fund does not offer benefits for a certain item, there is any suggestion of an endorsement, a compulsion or a direction on the Commonwealth on how it ought to pay its benefits. The funds do not determine what Commonwealth benefits are payable. The Commonwealth Government determines what Commonwealth benefits are payable. The funds do not determine to what medical application Commonwealth taxes may go. The Commonwealth Government determines the medical application of Commonwealth taxes. The Government has never claimed that in giving funds an opt-out provision, in giving contributors access to a fund with an opt-out provision on moral, religious or conscientious grounds, it was giving any sort of opt-out to itself in relation to paying Commonwealth benefits. The Government has never claimed it; it has never been an objective. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek from the Minister an assurance that the Commonwealth will try to rectify this situation. At the moment it is essentially a mechanical matter. It does not arise in relation to hospitals because the Commonwealth hospital benefit goes to the hospital. The benefit is taken off the top of a hospital's bill. There is no question of a refund to the patient who receives hospital treatment. The Commonwealth benefit is paid before the bill is received. The contributor is not billed for it. In the case of medical benefits, I believe that we have inadvertently taken away the trigger mechanism whereby the Commonwealth benefit reaches the contributor. I ask the Minister for an assurance that the Government will rectify this situation and an assurance that when a fund opts out of paying fund benefits it is not thereby given a means of taking away from its contributors or depriving them of-I am not suggesting that this is necessarily intentional-their entitlement to a government rebate. As I said, I do not believe that this was intentional. There is absolutely no suggestion in any of the debate that any moral judgment was applied to the payment of Commonwealth benefits whilst the Government might have allowed moral judgment to apply to fund benefits. It was not suggested that the same judgment was given to Commonwealth funds. I ask the Minister to address himself to this aspect of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to the Government that it act to rectify this mechanical problem. I realise that it is not a simple one but I believe it is important because the flow-on consequences could be very serious. I think the problem is serious enough now. I do not know how many people are affected but the principle is serious enough, I believe, for the Government to take a good hard look at the matter and, perhaps, in the future make some move to rectify an anomaly. I believe it is just that-an anomaly, not an intention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I thank honourable senators who have taken part in this debate. I will respond to some of the points made. I start by taking up the point that this Bill includes amendments to a number of Commonwealth Acts. This has been done in a constructive way and quite deliberately. In no sense has it been an attempt to short circuit or otherwise mistreat the Senate. Honourable senators will be aware that the legislative load in this place has been increasing year by year. A number of senators have expressed the view from time to time that there should be some sensible move to reduce the number of pieces of legislation we have to consider. There is some sense in aggregating a number of matters for the purpose of debate. The Parliament, of course, is in charge of how it debates and considers issues. It is able to determine which parts of a Bill it might hold up or not pass. The object has been to minimise in some way the number of pieces of legislation with which honourable senators are presented during each session. The Government can say to honourable senators that there have been no gags and there has been no guillotine. Although we have sat late, honourable senators have been able to speak to the Bills. We have accommodated the Senate. Whatever else can be claimed, we have not in this session attempted to truncate debate or to abridge otherwise the rights of honourable senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The difficulty for anyone speaking in this debate, whether from the Australian Labor Party or the Australian Democrats, is that everyone knows that the new scheme will work to provide access and equity for Australians in terms of health care. Since it has not come out in the debate, I mention that this omnibus Bill covers four major areas. It covers amendments to the Health Insurance Act which themselves cover a number of areas. There are alterations to Commonwealth medical benefits to make arrangements for benefits to be continued for pensioners, to define and make arrangements for disadvantaged people and to provide for the payment of 30 per cent of the Commonwealth medical benefit as a universal cover for medical services for those who are insured. The amendments to the Health Insurance Act make provision for new pathology arrangements. They make arrangements for medical service committees of inquiry which themselves are serving a useful function in regulating the activities of those who provide medical services. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the omnibus Bill provides for some amendments to the National Health Act. These relate to areas of administration of health insurance and, of course, to the Isolated Patients Travel and Accommodation Scheme. The third Act which is amended by this Bill is that concerning the Nursing Homes Assistance Act. The amendments proposed by the Government in this area are significant and have been welcomed. Finally, this omnibus Bill amends the Therapeutic Goods Act to include a number of changes which are desirable in that legislation. So it is a very comprehensive piece of legislation which is before the Senate. It covers a number of areas and a number of them confer considerable benefits upon the community. It is a new and coherent health package. I was interested to read in the May 1981 edition of the Hospital Journal of Australia an editorial concerning the changes in the health insurance system. It was written by a guest editorial writer, Milton Noble. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> There may be one consolation and that is concerning health insurance. It will be a relatively simple system. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the view of Milton Noble, President of the College of Health Service Administrators, New South Wales branch. His considered opinion is that the proposed system of health insurance will be a relatively simple system. It is also a generous system in terms of the provisions which have been made for the treatment of disadvantaged patients. For some time I have been worried about the way the previous system has been working. There can be considerable geographical disadvantage. There were areas in which none of the medical providers chose to classify anyone as disadvantaged. Under this system there will be a formula under which people can identify themselves as disadvantaged and that can increase the access to the health care system for those people. </PARA>
<PARA> People have commented about the drop-out rate over recent months from health insurance and have seen some sinister significance in the Government's desire to have people return to health insurance. I remind honourable senators that those people who drop out are generally those who are good risks. If the good risks drop out it makes the system that much less viable for those who remain. I think honourable senators will be aware that a year or so ago the Mutual Hospital Association Ltd, South Australia published a table which showed that just 9 per cent of its contributors were responsible for just over 50 per cent of all the services rendered. If the other 91 per cent drop out the system becomes impossible as an insurance system. One of the effects of extended coverage of a greater number of people coming back into the system will, of course, be a return of the better risk patients and a chance to share the insurance risk. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not address each of the matters raised by honourable senators. I am perfectly happy to answer any of these matters in Committee, if it is so desired. But it is necessary, I think, to address the question which was raised by Senator Martin and also Senator Grimes concerning the fact that some services can be excluded from the benefits which are offered by particular health insurance funds. The fact is that the Government is aware that under its policy certain health funds are able to apply for exemption from paying benefits for particular services. That is the policy of the Governmnent. The Bill provides some extension of that system. That is government policy, and it is intentional. Nevertheless, I have been interested to listen to the debate and to the considerable detailed argument which has been advanced. It is not the intention of the Government to hold up the passage of the amendments which it has proposed. However it would be our intention to go away and examine the Hansard record of the debate, check out the arguments which have been raised and apply the most serious consideration to the matters which have been put before us. I repeat the determination of the Government to provide for a fund, such as the Hibernian Society of Australia, to be able to apply for the exemption of a particular service is a decision which the Government deliberately took. If honourable senators are concerned that particular results flow from that, then it will be the desire of the Government to examine those very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA> It only remains to speak briefly to the amendment which is to be moved by Senator Mason and which he was good enough to foreshadow during his speech on the second reading of the Bill. That amendment seeks to refer the Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare in lieu of our going into Committee and completing consideration tonight. If that course were followed then there would be some undesirable results. I think it would create confusion in the minds of most Australian consumers of health care about where they would stand until the Committee reported. It would not enable us to bring people back into the health insurance system to support the community rating principle. It would mean, particularly, that those parts of the Bill which the Opposition and everyone else regards as desirable for passage would not be implemented. These include such things as the Commonwealth picking up nursing home benefits now paid by the health insurance funds. They include the strengthening of medical service committees of inquiry. They include the mechanisms for peer review. A number of items which are considered desirable for passage now would be delayed. Particularly in relation to the nursing home benefits, there could be some disadvantage to a large number of people if these were not put into place. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment itself would do nothing to simplify the health insurance arrangements. It would not allow for the new levels of Commonwealth medical benefits to be put into place. Of course, by providing 30 per cent of the cost of all medical benefits to insured people, it extends a certain universality which is lacking at the present time. It would not allow for the new benefit levels of 85 per cent with a $10 limit for schedule fees services. It would mean also that the Acts concerned would not reflect changes to the States' and Territory funding arrangements in relation to the funding of hospital services, which we know are to apply from 1 September 1981. While there may be merit in having this matter referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare, while it may be the wish of the Senate to refer this or other matters to the Committee, I believe it is not appropriate that the Bill be held up and referred as the honourable senator has suggested. Having said that, I thank the Senate for its consideration and commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

As I said in my speech in the second reading debate, the situation is so administratively impossible that such an inquiry could only come up with the answer that we need to go to a universal health insurance scheme. I speak merely to point out that in summing up the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) said that there was nothing sinister in introducing the legislation in this way, namely, to amend four Acts in one Bill, the Health Acts Amendment Bill. He said that the Government did this for reasons of simplicity and for other reasons. At the end of his summing up he said he could not support Senator Mason's amendment because the amendment would have the effect of stopping the application of that desirable part of the legislation, namely, the Therapeutic Goods Act and the Nursing Homes Assistance Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If this amendment is passed, there is no reason that the Minister should not go back to his Government and do what has been done in the past; that is, bring in individual Bills to amend those pieces of legislation. The Minister cannot have it both ways. He cannot say that there is nothing sinister in the legislation, and then say that he opposes Senator Mason's amendment because it will affect those inoffensive parts of this Bill. We hold no hope that Senator Mason's amendment will achieve much but, if the Government is willing to accept it, we believe any fair-minded committee would demonstrate the administrative impossibility of the legislation which the Government has presented tonight.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek some information from Senator Peter Baume, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, who represents the Minister for Health in this chamber. Perhaps I could use myself as an example and refer to the pre-Medibank concept and the post-Medibank concept. I put the test to the Minister this way: In the 1953-55 era I joined the Hospital Benefits Fund and the Medical Benefits Fund. Also, becasue I worked in the New South Wales Railways, I joined the railway hospital fund. I have got nothing out of the funds although I contributed to them for 16 years. In 1969 I was in Lewisham Hospital for 10 days for minor surgery on a leg as a result of a football injury. I was robbed because I was not able to get money from all the funds. I was told that I could get money out of only one fund. I ask the Minister: If people in this post-Medibank era join several health funds, will they be able to get money out of all of those funds following medical treatment or will they be entitled to get money out of only one fund?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point I raise also concerns my own saga. In the days of the Whitlam Government, a crane driver in the railways paid less in health insurance than did a senator. Under the Government's post-Medibank system I take it that a process worker and a production manager would both make the same contribution. To me, that is not equitable. They are the two questions I throw at the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might be wise to dispose of these questions because unlike most of the others I might receive I think I can answer them. The answer to the first question is that one can draw benefits from one health fund only. The honourable senator will be aware that in making a claim one needs to certify certain matters on a claim form. This enables an assessment to be made as to whether one is also claiming from another fund. So that, short of false certification, people are required to identify whether another fund is involved. A person can claim from one fund only.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator is correct in that whilst rates may vary between funds-whilst it may be cheaper to belong to health fund A than to health fund B-everyone who belongs to the one table in the same fund will contribute the same rate of premium. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are in some difficulty because Senator Mulvihill succeeded in doing what other people cannot do, that is, rendering Senator Baume speechless. The Opposition opposes clauses 1 to 8. In particular, we oppose clause 8 because this is the clause which restricts the Commonwealth benefit and provisions to those who only insure with private health funds. We think this is an outrageous use of legislation by the Commonwealth. In fact, the aim of this legislation is to force people into private health funds and to restrict the citizens of this country who are taxpayers or whose spouses are taxpayers from receiving benefits through the health system unless they join private insurance organisations. We consider this outrageous. We consider that the reasons given by Senator Baume to be quite specious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the fourth Fraser health scheme was introduced, Opposition members pointed out that the inevitable result would be that the fit, the healthy, the young and those who were willing to gamble would not join health funds, and therefore the health funds would be left with high risk patients. That in fact happened. The way to overcome that is to introduce a universal system which is funded through a levy on taxation or through Consolidated Revenue so that people pay according to their ability to pay. When this is done, there is no need for the great definitions of 'disadvantaged', the extraordinary series of clauses which involve penalties for those who give false information and the cut off points that Senator Mason talked about under which a husband and wife and two children in receipt of an income of $205 a week are in fact worse off than a man and wife and two children on $199 a week because of the penal effect of the sudden death cut off point. We point out that this new system is futile. On the seven previous occasions that I as shadow Minister for health in this place have spoken on health insurance, I said that we would be back again next year to make up for the mess that the Government had made of the matter this year. I predict that we will be back next year to make up for the inequities and the mess that the Government has created now. It is for that reason that we oppose these eight clauses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These clauses relate to a matter referred to by Senator Martin and the question of the amendments to section 73F of the principal Act. Senator Martin pointed out that on the previous occasion there was little debate on this matter which provides for certain funds to opt out of providing benefits for certain items provided they advertise that they will do so. This applies particularly to the benefits paid for the termination of pregnancy or abortion. At that time we had a health insurance system-unsatisfactory as it was-whereby people who found themselves in this situation had the option, if they required this procedure, of going to a public hospital, having it done there and, therefore were penalised. We now have a new ball game. The Government has introduced a general system whereby people who do not take out insurance with a private health fund receive not only no benefit from those health funds but also no government benefit at all. People who join the organisations which refuse to pay a benefit in this regard not only do not receive a benefit from those organisations but also they do not receive a government benefit despite the fact that they are taxpayers and despite the fact that they may have had a change of heart or may be adult dependents of people who hold such views.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two aspects to this matter. The first relates to the situation regarding those who seek, for medical reasons, the termination of pregnancy. Under the proposed legislation they will receive no benefit and will have to pay a considerable amount of money. The second aspect is that the Bill as it is written opens the way, as Senator Martin said, for health funds to set up optional tables whereby other items can be excluded. Obviously this is not the intent of the Government which has in this case legislated against optional tables. We believe, as I understand Senator Martin believes, that this is wrong in principle. One should not have government payments determined in these situations by organisations which have personal, conscientious or religious objections. The Opposition and, I understand, Senator Martin and others, have sought a means of amending this legislation. There seems to be no way in which we are able to do so. The simple fact is that the Government's intent is that people who are not insured will not receive government benefits. The Government considers people in this situation as not being insured. </PARA>
<PARA> Our concern is that the provisions of the original legislation and this legislation may be extended by some other organisation which only needs to apply to the Minister for Health and have the application approved and can extend the provisions of this legislation to consider all sorts of other items. The Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) has assured us that there is no intention that this will happen but it could happen in the future. We believe it is wrong in principle for legislation to be open in this way. We believe the legislation should name the items that were considered when this provision was inserted. Obviously the item is the termination of pregnancy. </PARA>
<PARA> We wonder why there cannot be the specific item of termination of pregnancy and we wonder what requirements the Government has for the two organisations in particular which wish to make this exemption. How do they have to advertise? Is it required that they point out to the applicant for medical benefits that it is quite clear that they have this exemption and it is not just something in fine print somewhere? Is it a fact that the organisations can state, 'We will not pay benefits for the evacuation of a gravid uterus' which means nothing to the average patient in the community? Many people just would not understand what those terms mean. Is there any requirement that these organisations actually point out to their potential contributors that this is what they are about? Finally, I ask: In a situation where there is no alternative as there was in the past and where the Government wishes health funds to provide comprehensive health care, is it desirable that we should have these restrictions?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply want to say that the clause, as Senator Grimes said, has applied only to the two particular funds that have applied in relation to item 6469. It is not intended that it should apply to any other item. I pick up the point Senator Grimes made that it can be done only with the approval of the Minister. I am advised-Senator Grimes would know this-that there is a procedure required if a fund embarks on seeking a new exemption. It is a fairly complicated procedure which would ensure that all contributors to a fund knew of any new exemption.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator's question was different. He wanted to know what happens to a person who goes along to join the fund in which the exemption has been in place for some time. That is the way I understand his question. I am advised that the brochures which the fund put out in fact would contain that information. I understand that in New South Wales and Victoria only 24,000 people are in those two funds. They are fairly small operations. It is known generally that those funds have that exemption but the brochures which they put out would in fact contain that information. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Finally I take up a point that Senator Martin raised. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) assured the Senate that the Government was in fact going to look at this matter. Does the Government believe that it is fair that government payments should be restricted in this area in the way they are? Does the Government intend to reconsider the situation in view of the remarks made by Senator Martin and by Mr Steele Hall and others in the other House? Has the Government any intention of extending exemptions beyond this item, a concern which has been expressed by me and by Senator Martin?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know of no intention to extend the exemption beyond this item. That is the first matter. The fact that is important is that there is a choice between funds. People have a choice to get away from a fund if they object to the particular exemption in question. As I have said, provisions in the Act ensure that all contributors are informed of the entitlements to benefits should those entitlements alter. I refer now to the matters which have been raised by Senator Martin and by other honourable senators. As I said earlier, the Government now wants to examine very carefully what has been said and what has been put forward, to make an assessment of what exactly is comprehended by the comments and to make decisions from there. I do not think I can commit the Government any further.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Koongarra Project Area Bill is to change the boundaries of the Kakadu National Park so that the original Koongarra special mineral lease excision area is included in the park and a new area of the park is excised for the proposed Koongarra uranium mine. In the view of the Opposition, the means by which this is being carried out are deceitful and dishonourable. The Bill retrospectively amends the proclamation by the Governor-General of 5 April 1979 to substitute a new Koongarra project area as defined by Denison Mining for the area originally excised. Sub-clause 3 (2) of the Bill deems that amendment of the proclamation shall have been made in accordance with section 7 of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like honourable senators to pay attention to what section 7 of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act says. That section requires that before park boundaries are varied 60 days be allowed for public comment, that the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service consider any comment and make a report to the Executive Council and that the Executive Council then consider the Director's report and commend a resolution to this Parliament. It also requires that excision of an area of a park not take place except in accordance with a resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament after 15 sitting days notice of motion. The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson) in his second reading speech had the effrontery to call sub-clause 3 (2) of the Bill 'a technical provision'. It is not a technical provision. It is a gross abuse of the legislative procedures of Parliament. It introduces an insidious legalistic form of doublethink whereby honourable senators know full well that the provisions for public consultation and parliamentary scrutiny laid down in section 7 of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act have not been complied with. Yet we are asked to pass a piece of legislation which deems that they have been complied with. In other words, the Parliament a couple of years ago passed a law which said that certain things should happen before the boundaries of the park should be changed. The Government refuses to carry out the provisions of its own legislation and instead introduces a new piece of legislation, saying: 'We will pretend that those provisions have been complied with'. That is a dishonourable and deceitful tactic. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is true that the Parliament has the power to make laws and to repeal them. That is a proper exercise of the Parliament's function. It is when laws are applied selectively, when they are riddled with exemptions and when things are deemed to have complied with the law when in fact they have not, that the whole integrity of the Parliament is called into question. How can the Government criticise tax dodgers for constantly seeking legislative loopholes to avoid their moral and legal responsibility to pay tax when the Government itself seeks to create legislative loopholes through which to avoid its moral and legal responsibilities to ensure public participation and thorough scrutiny by Parliament of legislation? If members of parliament are not prepared to comply with the spirit and the letter of their own legislation, they will command little public respect or credibility by calling for the rest of the community to do so. I think it is fairly clear at this stage of this parliamentary session just how little public credibility and respect the Fraser Government is able to command. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation retrospectively changes a Governor-General's proclamation and enshrines in legislation a lie by deeming that legislative requirements for public consultation and proper parliamentary scrutiny have been complied with when in fact they have not. On those grounds alone it ought not to be passed by this Senate. Why is it being forced through the Senate at this stage? The only reason for changing the boundaries of the Kakadu National Park at this time and in this manner is to ensure that no impediment to the Koongarra project can be presented by a new Senate which more accurately reflects the views of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill clears the last legislative hurdle in the path of the Koongarra uranium mine, a mine which in the public interest should never go ahead. The Government is fond of saying that this legislation does not allow uranium mining to proceed at Koongarra; that it does not change the status of the Koongarra project area as Aboriginal land; and that it does not bypass foreign investment guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> It is correct to say that after the passage of this legislation the Government will still face two obstacles in its quest to mine Koongarra: First, resistance to the project by Aboriginal traditional owners, who have a right of veto over mining on Aboriginal land under sub-section (1) of section 40 of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act and, second, the fact that the project is 100 per cent foreign-owned by Denison Co. of Canada, which puts the project in contravention of the Government's foreign investment guidelines which have a 75 per cent Australian equity objective. However, these obstacles can be overcome without further reference to the Parliament. The foreign investment guidelines are just that-guidelines. They can be changed or ignored by the Government, as has been done in other cases, for example, Yeelirrie. As for the Aboriginal traditional owners, the intense pressure on them to allow mining has already begun. The passage of this legislation will only intensify it. They will be hounded by Territory and Federal governments and by the mining company until they sign an agreement. Does any honourable senator really believe that if this legislation is passed mining will not go ahead?</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate must look realistically at what it is doing in passing this Bill. In effect, it will be giving the final legislative nod to the Koongarra uranium project. As the Senate is aware, the Australian Labor Party has an anti-uranium policy. We believe that the risks inherent in uranium mining and processing outweigh the potential benefits and would therefore oppose the legislation on these grounds. However, even for senators who do not share the Labor Party's concern about the hazards of the uranium industry there are three major and compelling arguments as to why this particular uranium project should not proceed. First, it threatens a unique and beautiful environment of great ecological significance and would cause massive environmental disruption for a relatively small amount of uranium. Secondly, Aboriginal people have not been properly consulted about what is planned for their land. The development of another uranium mine in the Kakadu area would stretch the fabric of Aboriginal society to breaking point. Thirdly, Koongarra may well turn out to be an uneconomic proposition if proceeded with at present. The value of, and demand for, uranium on the world market has plummeted steadily for six years. It is simply not a sensible time, in market terms, to develop a uranium mine. </PARA>
<PARA> I could present a number of arguments concerning the environmental damage which the park would cause. Because of the lateness of the hour I will not go into them in detail but I remind honourable senators that Justice Fox said that any contamination of Woolwonga wetlands, which is the area under consideration, would threaten 'the most important refuge and habitat for aquatic wildlife in the Northern Territory'. I am sure that the Acting Deputy President, Senator Mulvihill, will be well aware of the pertinence of those remarks. His Honour went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>We would oppose in principle any mining development upstream of it-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Woolwonga area-</PARA>
<PARA>Until it had been demonstrated by experience that it could take place without environmental damage. </PARA>
<PARA>Reports of a collapse of Ranger uranium's heavy metals tailings dam in its first wet season is the only experience we have had so far of the environmental safety of uranium mining in areas which experience tropical wet seasons. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, Mr Justice Fox recommended that if mining were to proceed in the Kakadu region it should be restricted to the Magela drainage basin so that environmental damage could be geographically contained. Jabiluka and Jabiru are within the Magela drainage basin. Koongarra is not. Mining Koongarra would open a whole new drainage basin-the Nourlangie Creek catchment area-to potential environmental disaster. The passage of this legislation must put in jeopardy any serious consideration of the Australian application for inclusion of Kakadu National Park in the World Heritage List. It is nonsense for the Government on the one hand, to argue, for the uniqueness and value of the environment and, on the other hand, to do everything in its power to extend mining in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now direct my remarks to the Aboriginal people affected by this legislation. My claim is that there has been a lack of consultation. Of course, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) has made a counterclaim about consultation. The Aboriginal traditional owners of the area have been angered by the lack of consultation over the whole Koongarra issue. We can understand why. Put yourself in their position. They are the traditional and legal owners of the Kakadu region. First, they are told they are to have a uranium mine on their land. Then they are informed that the site of the mine-which they have not yet agreed to have-is to be changed. They are told in a letter by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs that that area of land which they have leased to the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service is to be the new mine site and that legislation is to be passed nullifying that lease. Understandably this treatment angered the Koongarra traditional owners and they put out a Press release on 5 May this year, the full text of which I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>PRESS RELEASE BY TRADITIONAL OWNERS OF KOONGARRA PROJECT</PARA>
<PARA> On Friday 1st May a large meeting of Traditional Owners and the Gagadgu Association Inc was held at Patonga in the Kakadu National Park. </PARA>
<PARA> The meeting was held in response to a letter sent by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Baume) to the Northern Land Council which advised that the Federal Government had decided to excise a further area from the Kakadu Park in response to a request from Denison (Australia) Pty Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> Denison have for some time been negotiating with the traditional owners of the area, through the Northern Land Council, for the right to mine Uranium at Koongarra, which is 20km south of the uranium mine at Jabiru. </PARA>
<PARA> Denison delared that the existing mining lease was unsuitable for their proposed mine. Denison asked the Federal Government to excise a further area from the Kakadu Park, thereby excluding any control over their mining lease by the ANPWS which presently manages the Kadadu Park under a lease from the traditional Aboriginal owners. </PARA>
<PARA> On 28th April, the Northern Land Council received a letter from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Baume which advised that the Federal Government would implement Denison's request. </PARA>
<PARA> At no time were the traditional owners of the area, the Kakadu Association (The Aboriginal Owners of the entire area of the Park) nor the Northern Land Council invited to give an opinion about the application for the new lease, although the Northern Land Council were aware that a submission was to be made to the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, for the owners of the area, the very first they heard of the lease question was that Denison's application had been already implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> The day after receipt of the letter by the Northern Land Council, a meeting was held at Patonga to discuss the issue. The meeting lasted two days and was attended by the traditional owners of the mine site and surrounding areas, representatives of the Gagadju Association, the members of the Northern Land Council negotiating team and representatives of the Northern Land Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The traditional owners, after considering various options decided to ask the Northern Land Council to write the Minister and declare their opposition to the granting of the new lease. They demanded that the Minister revoke his decision until such time as the traditional owners had been consulted regarding the matter and until they had the opportunity of having from their own advisors as to possible effects the excision would have on the management of the Kakadu Park. </PARA>
<PARA> They also resolved to immediately suspend all negotiations until further notice with Denison (Australia) Pty Ltd in respect of the Koongara Project. </PARA>
<PARA> They further demanded that Denison cease having any contact with the Aboriginal people of the area. </PARA>
<PARA> The traditional owners expressed their absolute disappointment that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs regardless of the rhetoric about consultation by himself, his officers and those who went before them could again make decisions about what would happen to Aboriginal land. </PARA>
<PARA> As the traditional owners ask 'How can it be that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs can give our land away to a mining company without asking what we think'. This is not self-determination, this is the same as always, white fellahs making their own decisions about what is good for Aboriginals. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator Susan Ryan</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra, ACT</PARA>
<PARA> As traditional owners in the Kakadu National Park we are feeling very unhappy and frightened by the Government because it wants to pass a law about changing the Kakadu National Park boundary in a hurry. We have only just had a letter from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to say that the Government wishes to push the law through. It is all very well to say that the boundary will not be changed until or unless we reach agreement with Denison Mines. That is still holding the gun at our heads. As some of us told the Minister before it seems that the Government is determined to mine the area regardless of what we say. We have also made it clear that we feel threatened by the mine in this area and would like a lot of time to think it over. As it now stands we might be a tiny group of people saying no almost as the conscience of the whole of the Australian people but we own this country. We love our land and this park which we are trying to share with all the world. The Government itself has said it is one of the great wonders of the world to be put on the world heritage list but in the next breath it wants us and us alone to stand up against putting something big in the middle of one of its best areas Nourlangi Rock. We think there are many things for all the people of Australia to think about and not just us. The mine is upstream of one of the best water bird areas of Australia. Also we still use some of this area for hunting as our fathers did for thousands of years. No one can guarantee that this will not be polluted by the tailings or silted up in some way. We also think about all the disturbance in the area. There will be loud noise a lot of traffic and thousands of people for miles around the mine. We feel that we could be saying goodbye to Burrunggui Nourlangi Rock which has been a big part of our lives and also the people who came before us. Senator Baume has written to us in sweet words about this but on the same day we have got a rough letter from the Minister for Home Affairs and the Environment saying that the Government will dump us to the Northern Territory Government which fights against Aboriginal land. This is our land and our fathers land and the Federal Government agreed with this. We have lent our land freely to the people of Australia to make a great national park for use of all people and to protect that land. We therefore ask all senators to defer this Bill until we have had a chance for discussions amongst ourselves. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The impact of Ranger and Queensland Mines Ltd developments on Aboriginal people in the Kakadu region has been significant and in some respects devastating. The Aboriginal people are still adjusting to these developments and they need time to make those adjustments if their traditional society is to survive. Yet Aboriginal people are not being given even this breathing space. This week negotiations between Aboriginal traditional owners and Pancontinental Mining Ltd are due to commence. Many of the traditional owners of the Jabiluka area are also traditional owners of the Koongarra area. The Government therefore intends to put these Aboriginals under double pressure to sign mining agreements. That is what the passage of this legislation will mean.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now proceed to a brief discussion of the economic argument. Koongarra contains only small reserves of uranium. Australia's biggest uranium reserves are at Ranger and at Jabiluka. Ranger is estimated to have reserves of 110,000 tonnes of yellowcake and is capable of an annual production of 6,000 tonnes. Jabiluka has estimated reserves of 206,000 tonnes of yellowcake and is capable of an annual production of 3,000 tonnes. Koongarra has only 13,300 tonnes of minable yellowcake and is capable of producing only 1,000 tonnes annually. Currently, there is a world over-production of uranium. The price of uranium yellowcake has crashed from $US43 per lb in mid-1979 to $US28 per lb at the end of 1980. In 1981 the price fell to $US25 per lb. This is indicative, honourable senators will agree, of world overproduction. World demand has not increased at the rate predicted in the mid-1970s and may decline even further. I refer honourable senators to an article in this week's National Times entitled 'Nuclear Power Falls on Hard Times'. The article is written by Mr Anthony Parisi, a well-known energy correspondent in the United States of America. He argues:</PARA>
<PARA> The prognosis for nuclear power in America is bleak . . . and not because it is too dangerous. Rather it is too costly and may not even be necessary in a new era of slackening demand. </PARA>
<PARA>In this context Australia has nine uranium mines on the drawing board for the 1980s. These are: Ranger, Jabiluka, Yeelirrie, Koongarra, Beverley, Honeymoon, Lake Way, Ben Lomond and Roxby Downs. If all of these mines go ahead Australia could be producing at least 14,200 tonnes of yellowcake a year. Yet, even the most optimistic Australian Atomic Energy Commission reports estimate that we could only sell between 8,000 and 9,000 tonnes a year. Developing Koongarra at this stage in this context does not make economic sense. Of course, there are other arguments against Koongarra proceeding. The Fox report, for instance, recommended that if uranium deposits in this area were to be mined they should be mined in a sequential fashion. However, this is not the first time that the Government has demonstrated its disregard for the findings of Justice Fox. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Government has gone about this exercise in a shoddy and deceitful way. All the arguments are against facilitating the development of Koongarra now. It threatens a unique natural environment and Aboriginal traditional society in the area. The Aboriginal people have not been sufficiently consulted and have indicated that they do not want the mine to proceed. Finally and, one would hope with this Government, most persuasively, it makes no economic sense. These are compelling arguments against the project. There are no good reasons why it should proceed, and I urge the Senate to vote against the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Ryan has said, the purpose of the Koongarra Project Area Bill is to make changes to the boundaries of the Kakadu National Park. The first thing I want to say is that I think all Government senators would want to reject the assertion that making changes in the boundaries of the national park by passing an Act of parliament is somehow improper or immoral or contrary to parliamentary practice. One would have thought that nothing could have been more open and more squarely within the framework of the democratic procedures of an elected parliament than to change the boundaries of a national park by an Act of Parliament, subject to scrutiny in both Houses of Parliament and subject to the full amount of public debate which regulations and changes to administrative procedures very often manage to avoid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Currently, within the framework of the Kakadu National Park some 15.7 square kilometres are excluded from the 5,700 square kilometres which constitute the park as a whole. Apart from the exclusion which currently exists so far as the Koongarra site is concerned, there is the exclusion of the area around the border store, two exclusions at the Cooinda Hotel-Motel area, the exclusion at Spring Creek Garden and the exclusion of the Dampier mine mineral leases. This proposes a change in the park which in fact will add marginally to the total amount of the park. An area of 1,197 hectares goes out of the park; an area of 1,228 hectares comes back into the park. Those who have had the opportunity, as I have, to spend some time walking over the area will know that the area which is going out of the park is not one of as much scenic beauty or significance as the area that is being brought into the park. What is being brought in is the Nourlangie Rock area, and the massif and foothills of Mount Brockman. Within that area not only are they amongst the most attractive and significant parts of the park from an ecological point of view but also, in the case of Mount Brockman, they are certainly the most significant areas in the whole region of northern Australia in regard to Aboriginal culture, sacred sites, paintings and totemic significance. All that is being brought into the park. It has previously been excluded; it is now being brought in. As to the way in which the management plan for the Kakadu National Park has been drawn up and developed, one can see quite clearly that the original plan of management states:</PARA>
<PARA> The area of the Koongarra Special Mineral Lease application located close to Nourlangie Rock is not included in the Park. In order to facilitate the finalisation of an environmental impact statement by Noranda Australia Ltd in relation to the Koongarra uranium deposit, work of an investigative nature, such as drilling to determine soil and subsoil properties, will need to be carried out in the area of the Park adjacent to the deposit and may be authorised by the Director. </PARA>
<PARA>It was, in fact, so authorised, and I will come back to that in a few minutes. Senator Ryan has sought to make out a great deal about the processes of consultation with the Aboriginal people. I draw the Senate's attention to clause 2 (2) of the Bill, which refers to clause 3, dealing with the changes in the park. Clause 2 (2) states:</PARA>
<PARA> Section 3 shall come into operation on a date to be fixed by Proclamation, being a date not earlier than the date on which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the relevant Land Council have consented, in writing, for the purposes of sub-section 40 (1) of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, to the making of a grant of a mining interest in respect of the relevant land, whether or not that consent also applies to the making of the grant of a mining interest in respect of any other land. </PARA>
<PARA>There, in a piece of legislation that the Parliament is asked to pass tonight, is a clause that says the legislation will not come into effect until there is an agreement in writing between the Minister and the relevant land council. I cannot see how any intelligent person would say that the processes of consultation with the Aboriginal people are being subverted, are being ignored, and are not being complied with when the Bill itself is dependent upon the signature of the Northern Land Council and the Minister on a document before it has any operation. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at section 40 (1) of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act and one is aware of the procedures, as one would have thought the shadow Minister would have been, one would accept that there, in a piece of legislation that could be altered only by an Act of this Parliament, is a guarantee that no proclamation of that clause of the Bill can take place until the Northern Land Council has signed a written agreement with the Government on that matter. The 1979-80 report of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service stated, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA> Steady progress was made in the development and refinement of consultative processes with both the traditional Aboriginal owners of land in the Park and the Northern Land Council. </PARA>
<PARA>That refers to the Kakadu National Park. To come along here and say there is no consultation when the Act is dependent on an act of consultation committed to a legal document with the signature of the Northern Land Council is to make an absolute farce of the meaning of the words in the English language. It is quite clear from what Senator Ryan has said, and quite clear from the representations I have received from groups such as the Total Environment Centre, that one thing they have not bothered to do-I do not particularly blame them for it-is to look at the document I have here, which is one of the four volumes of the environmental impact statement which deals with the Koongarra project and which was prepared by Noranda at the direction of the Commonwealth Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development in 1977. That company was instructed under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 to prepare this environmental impact statement. </PARA>
<PARA> I will come back to that briefly because the accusations made about the protection of the Woolwonga wildlife area, the accusations made about the tailings dam, the accusations made about development in the Magela Creek region and the accusations made about developments that will take place as far as the actual siting of any work which may be in progress are all answered in the environmental impact statement. I put it to the Senate that what we have had from the Opposition is a statement which is not based upon a reading of the environmental impact statement which has been prepared to cover this development. Perhaps the first of these matters on which I might touch is the question of the siting and location of the tailings works. Rather than detain the Senate by reading it, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard page 395 of the statement, which deals with some of the technical aspects but concludes with these words:</PARA>
<PARA> It must be concluded that on the weight of evidence and experience, placement of the tailings, as proposed, in an engineered and excavated retention structure on the divide between Hickey Creek and Koongarra Creek is best practicable technology and is entirely within the overall concept of a no release objective. Close monitoring of the system is proposed and the facilities for this have already been established. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate that page in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>5. Advantages of the proposed rationale</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed tailings retention pond represents a fully engineered, largely subgrade disposal site for the tailings, which will achieve the highest levels of compaction and monitoring of tailings leachate movements and effects, before the cessation of operations on site and before the completion of rehabilitation on site. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed tailings retention pond also provides for a high likelihood that the leachates which will escape in time will never appear in the surface environment in a form which will present a significant environmental problem. At this time and at Koongarra, no guarantee can be given that these statements are true, but given overseas experience and the advantageous mineralogical and density situations which exist, the concepts and effects discussed herein must be accepted as probable. Monitoring of the system over the next 18 years will prove the situation and if it proves incorrect, alternative measures can be taken. </PARA>
<PARA> Inherent in the programme is the acceptance of the worked-out Koongarra Mine as a lake, but this is to be a clean lake, not a contaminated lake such as exist where tailings were returned at Rum Jungle (Whites Open Cut and Dysons Open Cut). </PARA>
<PARA> The depth and unnatural boundaries of the lake can be modified if this is desirable, but its use as a sub-grade burial site for tailings is to be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the tailings retention pond currently proposed will result in a reduced period for rehabilitation and a reduced impact of the overall environment. </PARA>
<PARA> From the viewpoint of the long term safe retention of tailings and their byproducts, the current proposal incorporates virtually all the barriers identified by Kaufmann, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> Sub-grade disposal-internal borrow pit</PARA>
<PARA> Engineered barriers-bunds, walls, caps and rock encasement</PARA>
<PARA> Geological barriers-geochemically active formations with a long flow path</PARA>
<PARA> Environmental barriers-deep percolation, resulting from density, to a low flux groundwater environment</PARA>
<PARA>6. Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA> It must be concluded that on the weight of evidence and experience, placement of the tailings, as proposed, in an engineered and excavated retention structure on the divide between Hickey Creek and Koongarra Creek is best practicable technology and is entirely within the overall concept of a no release objective. Close monitoring of the system is proposed and the facilities for this have already been established. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. It would also not be true to say that this is simply an attempt to clear hurdles so that one can go rushing into the mining of uranium from the Koongarra deposit. That matter was specifically addressed by the Minister in his second reading speech on 28 May in the House of Representatives when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The establishment and definition of the Koongarra project area provided for in this Bill does not imply approval for mining. </PARA>
<PARA>As we know, a number of things need to be addressed. There needs to be a full assessment by the Commonwealth of all the issues raised in the environmental impact statement. There is also the question of the 100 per cent ownership of the Denison company and the question of other government priorities and policies concerning uranium development. I turn very briefly to the three matters that are raised in the environmental impact statement. The first of these deals with the visual impact of the Koongarra project. The EIS states:</PARA>
<PARA> During the life of the Project, the visual impact of the project will be localised and distinct. After completion of rehabilitation the Project area will be returned to the Park in an appropriate state for Park use and the long term impact will be minimal. </PARA>
<PARA>So not only under this legislation is the park getting a far more significant area included within it, but it is also, in terms of the EIS, to get back when the project has been completed, the exclusion that this Bill makes, and it will be returned to the park in an appropriate state for park use. The long term impact will be minimal. There has been a great deal of discussion-this is the second point arising from the EIS-about Aboriginal sites in the area. There is a very lengthy description in the statement of the several hundred sites which are either in or adjacent to the proposed area. One of the things that is said, particularly in an archeological sense, in the EIS is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Noranda is not aware of any site of significant archeological interest in, or in the vicinity of, the Project Area. </PARA>
<PARA>One can go through the document and see that that statement is correct. One can again address oneself to the statement that the area that is coming back into the park and which is currently excluded from the park contains one of the most significant collections of Aboriginal paintings and among the most important sites anywhere within that part of northern Australia. The area was previously excluded from the park and, under the terms of this legislation, it will now come back into the park. The sites will be protected under the normal regime of the parks service. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn finally to the criticisms that somehow this is an overturning of the Ranger uranium inquiry recommendations concerning this part of the park or this particular development. Section 7 of the environmental impact statement, in the summary which runs over four and a bit pages and which I will seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard, deals with each and every one of those points. I shall go through them as quickly as I can. Reference is made to the positioning of tailings. The EIS states that original design concepts have been altered to provide for the neutralisation of tailings, the construction of the tailings and evaporation ponds in a particular fashion, the covering of the tailings, the returning of the tailings to certain pits and further developments. As to the criticisms made by Mr Justice Fox, the EIS states that the original design concepts have been altered to provide for them. The recommendations of Mr Justice Fox in relation to sulphur stockpiles are taken care of. The recommendations of Mr Justice Fox as to test blasting are taken care of. As to water release, the subject of the point that Senator Ryan raised in relation to the Woolwonga wildlife area, the EIS statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Noranda has elected to implement a water management system designed with a 'no release' objective. </PARA>
<PARA>So the criticisms made about the pollution of creeks and about the water system have been entirely taken care of in the environmental impact statement. As to the question of the use of respiratory devices and rehabilitation, the EIS states:</PARA>
<PARA> Noranda accepts responsibility for rehabilitation of the Koongarra project Area. </PARA>
<PARA>The return of the tailings, the acid plant, the use of explosives and the development of the Koongarra project in general are all dealt with in the environmental impact statement. Every single one of the references that Mr Justice Fox made has been taken up in the environmental impact statement and has been answered and, I believe, answered in full. For instance, on the question of the overall development of the project, the statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of Koongarra, there will be no release of water into the downstream environment. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet Senator Ryan has criticised the project, saying that that will be done. The Total Environment Centre people, who clearly have not read the environmental impact statement, say that water release will occur and that pollution and degradation will result. The very statement that the developers have produced for the Commonwealth Government says quite clearly:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there will be no release of water into the downstream environment. </PARA>
<PARA>So that honourable senators can have the chance to study the responses of the environmental impact statement to Mr Justice Fox's comments, I seek leave to have that section of the report incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA>The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SECTION SEVEN</PARA>
<PARA>References to Ranger Inquiry</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>7.1 Introduction</PARA>
<PARA> Although primarily concerned with the Ranger Project of Ranger Uranium Mines Pty Ltd, the Second Report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry contains some comments and recommendations which warrant reference in this draft EIS. The matters involved are dealt with in detail under other sections of this draft EIS, and are summarised below with page references to the Ranger Inquiry, Second Report. </PARA>
<PARA>7.2 References</PARA>
<PARA>Tailings Dam (Pages, 165, 166, 289, 327) The Inquiry was concerned at Noranda's original proposal to store tailings from the Koongarra Project in an acid condition in a pond to be formed by damming a natural gully at an elevated location north of the plant. It was felt that seepage, eroded material, and any release of contaminated water from this dam would enter Nourlangie Creek and be a potential threat to the Woolwonga Wildlife Sanctuary. </PARA>
<PARA> Original design concepts have been altered to provide for: Neutralization of Tailings. </PARA>
<PARA> Construction of the tailings and evaporation ponds on an impermeable sub-base on flat lying ground south of the plant and within a hydrological cone of depression which will ensure that any seepage does not escape from the Project Area during the life of the Project. </PARA>
<PARA> Covering of the tailings, upon cessation of operations, with impermeable material to eliminate leaching by surface waters. </PARA>
<PARA> or alternatively</PARA>
<PARA> Returning the tailings to the open pit should that be shown by detailed investigation and monitoring programs to be more desirable environmentally. </PARA>
<PARA>Sulphur Stockpile (Page 325) The Inquiry recommended that sulphur stockpiles be surrounded by an embankment. </PARA>
<PARA> The sulphur stockpile at Koongarra will be bunded. </PARA>
<PARA>Test Blasting (Page 325) The Inquiry recommended that before mining begins, small test blasts be carried out on site to predict ground vibration from blasting. </PARA>
<PARA> This will be done at Koongarra as soon as approval for such tests is granted. Proposed blasting patterns and programs will be modified as, and if, necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>Water Release (Page 326) The Inquiry expressed concern about the possible effects of discharge of water from the Ranger project area into the down-stream environment of the Magela Creek catchment, and recommended this be permitted only under certain strict conditions and controls. </PARA>
<PARA> Although not in the same catchment as Ranger, similar principles and considerations apply to Koongarra. </PARA>
<PARA> Noranda has elected to implement a water management system designed with a 'no release' objective. This design will ensure that no release will occur, except during the February to March months of an unusually wet year which is part of a prolonged wet cycle with an estimated recurrence of 1 in 1000 years. In the unlikely event of these rare conditions occurring during the 12 year life of the Project, the high volumes of naturally occurring surface water flows will dilute the small quantity of low contaminant-level water released. </PARA>
<PARA>Respiratory Devices (Page 327) The Inquiry recommended that, if possible, operations in pits be planned so as to avoid the need for habitual use of respiratory protection devices. </PARA>
<PARA> Pit mobile equipment at Koongarra will be fitted with filtered airconditioned cabs. Calculations indicate that radon and dust levels will be below those set out in the Code of Practice. Accordingly, respiratory protection devices are likely to be required by personnel only intermittently and on an occasional basis. </PARA>
<PARA>Rehabilitation (Page 327) The Inquiry recommended that the operator be responsible for all rehabilitation work and recommended measures to be taken to ensure that such work is carried out satisfactorily. Noranda accepts responsibility for rehabilitation of the Koongarra Project Area. </PARA>
<PARA>Return of Tailings to Open Pit (Page 327) The Inquiry recommended that tailings and any remnant low grade ore stockpiles from the Ranger Project be returned to the open pit. </PARA>
<PARA> Any low grade ore stockpiles remaining at Koongarra after milling ceases will be handled through the process plant for impoundment with the tailings or returned to the open pit, whichever is environmentally preferable. While return of tailings to the pit remains an option, subject to continuing investigation and monitoring, Noranda believes that the tailings disposal scheme proposed in this draft EIS is more secure environmentally. </PARA>
<PARA>Acid Plant (Page 327) The Inquiry recommended the installation of a stack gas scrubber to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions from the Ranger acid plant. </PARA>
<PARA> The acid plant to be installed at Koongarra will be of a double absorption, double catalysis type which produces lower SO2 emission levels than the plant considered by the Ranger Inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>Explosives (Page 328) The Inquiry indicated that explosives should be stored at a safe distance from the tailings dam and ecologically significant features. </PARA>
<PARA> Primary blasting in the Koongarra pit will be with ammonium nitrate and fuel oil mixture which is an inherently safe blasting agent. The storage of pre-mixed bagged blasting agent will be in magazines meeting all applicable codes. </PARA>
<PARA> Only limited quantities of high explosives for secondary blasting are required and these will be stored in an approved magazine. </PARA>
<PARA>Jabiru Reginal Town and Impacts on Aboriginal Society (Pages 328, 329) The Inquiry was concerned at the possible impact on Aboriginal society of an influx of a large number of non-Aboriginal people into the Region. The Inquiry therefore recommended that the number of non-Aboriginals be kept to the minimum both in construction camps and the planned Regional Town. </PARA>
<PARA> The workforce needed for Koongarra is very small compared with the total work force which will be resident in the Region. The construction camp will be in an area remote from Aboriginal populations and the incremental effect of housing Koongarra employees and their families at the Regional Town during operations will be minimal. </PARA>
<PARA>Development of the Koongarra Project (Pages 165, 166, 289, 322) The Inquiry was concerned at the potential for environmental damage from contaminants being injected, or escaping into, water drainage basins downstream from the proposed projects. In the case of Koongara, there will be no release of water into the downstream environment. The Inquiry's concern about the initial Koongara concept for tailings disposal is referred to earlier in this Section. The Commonwealth recognised and accepted the Inquiry's comments and, in announcing its Uranium Policy in August 1977, the Prime Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The Government has decided to accept the Inquiry's recommendation that the Ranger and Pancontinental lease areas should be excluded from the National Park. On the same basis, the Government has decided that the Noranda lease area should be excluded. The Government has made these exclusions without commitment in order or timing of any development. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the Government's requirement that it be satisfied as to the acceptability of the impact of each development on the environment, a considerable amount of planning and investigation into the environmental effects of any development of Noranda's deposit at Koongara will have to be undertaken. That deposit has particular environmental problems because of the sensitivity and fragility of the environment of the area and the location of the deposit upstream of a major wetlands area'. </PARA>
<PARA>Noranda has taken particular note of these comments in the complete revision and subsequent adjustment to its design concept and water management system. Noranda is confident that its revised proposal is environmentally secure. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say in conclusion that the criticisms that have been made of this Bill are entirely improper and wrong. It has been criticised on the basis that it should have been done in some other way. I put it to honourable senators that the way to deal with major changes in national parks is by Act of Parliament. Any honourable senator who believes that there is some better way to deal with things than by Act of Parliament should perhaps seriously consider what his role as a legislator would be reduced to. There has been a quesion about what goes in and what goes out of the park and the relative value. It has been clearly demonstrated that the area going out of the park is of less ecological value of less value to the Aboriginal community and of less historical, archaeological and artistic value, and that the area going into the park, the Nourlangi Rock-Mt Brockman massif, is of considerable importance and will obtain under this Bill its first real protection in the plan of management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been said that there has been no consultation with Aboriginal people. Yet the Act cannot come into force until there is a written agreement with the Aboriginal people. It has been said that the Bill ignores the recommendations of Mr Justice Fox. Yet the environmental impact statement clearly demonstrates in every single regard that the comments by His Honour have been taken care of and responded to in a most responsible and intelligent manner. It has been said that there will be a visual pollution and desecration of Aboriginal sites. Both these claims are false. Above all, I say in support of this legislation that the environment, the Aboriginal people, the demands and the proper requirements of the Commonwealth Government and the Parliament have all been satisfied. The legislation should be enthusiastically supported by all honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support to the hilt the fears expressed by my colleague Senator Ryan. I well remember the famous occasion when the second Fox report was released. A spate of reports from about four Ministers were delivered in the Senate. It was as well that they delivered those reports which I regarded as a snow job. They told us what lessons they had learned about protection for the future. At the time Mr Nixon produced a paper which said that the Federal Government was spending $1.5m to rehabilitate the Finniss River in the Nortern Territory which had been seriously damaged by the Rum Jungle operations. That announcement was preceded by promises that everything was all right. The message there is that we cannot take environmental impact statements at face value.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Puplick has argued that the matter has gone before the Senate. Of course, that is a laudable thing. But to me this is a gigantic snow job. I say that for this reason: The second Fox report referred to Ranger and Jabiru. Mr President, I have been asked to seek leave to continue my remarks. I seek leave to continue my remarks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The allowance of a deduction for income tax purposes for expenses incurred by particular categories of taxpayers in obtaining child care would lead to anomalies. Under the half tax indexation proposals for 1981-82 a sole parent will not be required to pay tax if his or her income in that year is $6,007 or less. A single income family will not be required to pay tax where the income in that year is $6,788 or less. Accordingly, an income tax deduction for child care expenses would be of no benefit to those whose incomes are below these levels and who may have the greatest need for assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is, however, well aware of the financial difficulties often encountered by single parent and low income families and its actions in introducing the special sole parent tax rebate and in increasing the rebate for a dependent spouse evidence its concern for people in these categories.</PARA>

<PARA> As indicated in the answer to the honourable senator's question No. 2410 (Hansard, 15 April 1980, pages 1457-1458) the Department of Social Security is developing a collection of statistics on terminations of unemployment benefit.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industry and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Cost effectiveness was demonstrated by the impact which the 1980 Australian delegation to IBOP had on the European and other businessmen attending Davos. This was evidenced by the 70 direct enquiries received by the delegation during the symposium, by the comments subsequently received from European and other participants and by the European management forum's decision to invite Australia back for a second year in succession-an almost unprecedented step. Australia's acceptance of that invitation led in turn to a further 158 business enquiries from participants in the 1981 symposium.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The total cost to the Commonwealth of the 1980 Australian delegation to IBOP was $51,258, including (a) fares of $15,045, (b) accommodation costs of $5,290, (c) travelling allowance of $4,925 and (d) other costs of $25,998.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) While it is not possible to attribute increases in business or investment directly to this visit, it is noteworthy that western Europe sent some 18 major trade, investment and energy missions to Australia in the succeeding twelve months, compared with seven in the previous year, and that a survey which EMF took of its members following on Australia's 1980 appearance at Davos reportedly showed that Australia was the non-European country of greatest interest to European businessmen.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is insufficient information available to the Department of Social Security or the Taxation Office to answer the question. But the following information may give some guidance on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA> For those social security pensioners eligible for an incometested pension but exempt from personal income tax, that is invalid pensioners (except the permanently blind) below age pension age, no tax would be payable for 1980-81. In the case of those whose pension is income test-free and exempt from tax, that is the permanently blind under age pension age, tax would be payable if non-pension taxable income was above the tax threshold.</PARA>
<PARA> The tax threshold for a single person (other than a sole parent) in 1980-81 is $4,041 ($77.71 a week). The maximum rate of basic pension payable in 1980-81 for a single person is $3,299 ($63.45 a week). Tax may therefore be payable by a person who is a maximum rate pensioner in receipt of a taxable pension for the whole of 1980-81 if his taxable non-pension income exceeds $741 ($14.26 a week).</PARA>
<PARA> The position of married pensioner couples is more complex due to the operation of the separate net income test for the dependent spouse rebate. However, a married person in receipt of the maximum (married) rate of a taxable pension for the whole of 1980-81, whose spouse has no non-pension income, would not generally be liable to pay tax because the level of non-pension taxable income required-$1,908 ($36.70 a week)-is above the pension income test free area.</PARA>
<PARA> Because of the operation of the sole parent tax rebate, the sole parent pensioner in receipt of the maximum rate of pension for the whole of 1980-81 would be unlikely to be liable to pay tax unless he or she had five or more children, as the non-pension taxable income required would also exceed the pension income test free area.</PARA>
<PARA> At December 1980, some 60,000 single pensioners with no children receiving taxable pensions had non-pension incomes in excess of $14.26 a week ($741.52 year) but below the income test free area of $20.00 a week ($1,040 a year). Not all these, of course, would necessarily be liable to pay tax.</PARA>
<PARA> The latest statistics available from the Taxation Commissioner refer to 1978-79. For that year, taxable individuals included over 250,000 people in receipt of Commonwealth Government pensions and other benefits. Few would have been maximum rate pensioners.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 5 December 1980 (Hansard, page 440) Senator Button asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Science and Technology, a question relating to comments in the Foreign Investment Review Board Report 1980 which revealed a significant increase in foreign takeovers of Australian manufacturers of electricity generation and transmission equipment. In particular Senator Button asked why, in view of the fact that this industry is in the forefront of Australia's development plans, and given the remarks made by my colleague, Mr Thomson, that the Government is 'working on' the problem of the entrepreneurial side of the technology issue, is the Government allowing this industry to fall increasingly into foreign hands? The honourable Senator asked also whether the Government would review the situation as quickly as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Science and Technology has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> In the House of Representatives, on 4 December 1980, I referred to a number of Government initiatives designed to increase industry competitiveness through encouraging inventions, innovation, the development of new products and the introduction of new technology. In particular, I noted the importance of matching Australian inventiveness with the entrepreneurial spirit required to take inventions to the market place and mentioned a workshop in innovation and entrepreneurship sponsored by my Department.</PARA>
<PARA> Initiatives to develop Australian entrepreneurship comprise only one element of a balanced range of measures designed to stimulate increases in manufacturing competitiveness. Of equal importance are those elements of the industrial development component of the Government's industry policy directed at assisting Australian industry to cope with adjustment problems, to gain increased access to foreign markets and to take advantage of the latest technology.</PARA>
<PARA> Government innovation programs, including the workshops in entrepreneurship, are primarily directed at encouraging the creation and development of a 'seed-bed' of smaller technology-based companies to provide stimulus to economic growth and employment generation. Measures such as productivity development and technology transfer programs are primarily directed toward strengthening Australia's existing manufacturing base. It is these latter measures, therefore, which are of greater relevance to our existing industrial capability in the manufacture of components for electricity generation and transmission equipment.</PARA>
<PARA> The activities of foreign companies also have a significant impact on the strength and structure of Australian industry; the electricity generation and transmission equipment industry is no different to other industries in this respect.</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Foreign Investment Review Board Report 1980 commented that a number of takeover proposals concerning companies manufacturing components for electricity generation and transmission equipment had been submitted to the Board, it should be emphasised that each foreign investment proposal is considered on its own merits against national benefits criteria. If net economic benefits cannot be demonstrated and a proposal is judged to be contrary to the national interest, no approval can be given.</PARA>
<PARA> The recent proposals submitted to the Board have concerned companies engaged in the manufacture of small to medium sized transformers, electrical switchgear, heat exchangers, steam generating units and electrical carbon products. In most cases, the parties were able to demonstrate that net economic benefits would accrue to Australia from the proposal through access to overseas technology, the introduction of new products, exports, access to financial resources and, in relation to the transformer industry, through rationalisation of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA> In one major proposal, not only were net economic benefits expected to result because of better access to advanced technology but, in addition, the net result of the proposal was for Australian equity in the target company to be significantly increased resulting in control becoming Australian. In two cases where net economic benefits were only marginal or not sufficient to offset a loss of Australian control, approval was given by the Government on condition that significant Australian equity be maintained or reintroduced at a later date into the businesses.</PARA>
<PARA> In one proposal, where no net economic benefits could be demonstrated and because it was judged to be contrary to the national interest, no approval was given.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government acknowledges the need for foreign investment in Australia because of the contribution such investment has made, and will continue to make, to the development of Australia's industries and resources. Equally, the Government is taking many initiatives which should lead to Australian companies right across our range of industrial activities being better prepared to compete in both domestic and foreign markets. The combination of foreign expertise and capital with more competitive companies will lead to Australia and Australians gaining increased benefits from the development of our resources and skils.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 1 April 1981 (Hansard page 966) Senator Lajovic asked me a question, without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in the Senate. The question asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whether an article which appeared in the Australian newspaper of 22 March 1981 was correct. The article, datelined Washington, reported that officials of the United States of America and Australia were having informal discussions with a view to eliminating on a reciprocal basis the necessity for short-term tourist visitors to obtain visas.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> While the newspaper article is not strictly correct it is true that on 4 March 1981 the Consulate-General of the United States of America made an informal approach to the Regional Director of my Department in Sydney to enquire whether Australia might be interested in extending, on a reciprocal basis, the maximum validity of visitor visas from 48 months to 60 months or even to indefinite, or whether Australia might be interested, again on a reciprocal basis, in waiving the visa requirement for visiting US citizens.</PARA>
<PARA> The workload involved in issuing visitor visas throughout the world has increased dramatically in recent years and there are no indications that this pressure is likely to ease within the foreseeable future. Consequently, it is necessary to adopt any reasonable measures which will alleviate the burden of issuing visitor visas while at the same time maintaining to the maximum extent possible the protection and security afforded to Australian society by the checks encompassed in our visitor visa procedures.</PARA>
<PARA> Following a recent preliminary study of the practicability of Australia entering into no visa agreements with certain countries it was concluded that in the absence of any internal controls within Australia such as social security cards, registering with policy, penalties for employers who employ visitors, and so on, which most overseas countries have, it was not possible for Australia to agree to abolish visa requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> However as a further step towards reducing the visitor visa workload and streamlining visitor visa procedures I have agreed that the United States' authorities be informed that we would be prepared to extend, on a reciprocal basis, the validity of visitor visas issued to United States citizens for the full period of the validity of the US passport in which the visa is placed (this is normally five years) and for multiple entry to be permitted.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 2 April 1981 (Hansard, page 1038) Senator McClelland asked me, as the Minister representing the Treasurer, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the Minister aware that the tax avoidance industry is currently marketing on a large scale throughout Australia a recoupment-type tax avoidance scheme whereby the taxpayer obtains an offset against his tax for moneys invested in an afforestation company but in circumstances where the taxpayer is reimbursed all of his investment less the scheme's seller's fee by means of a combination of loans and dealings in shares of the afforestation company? Is it a fact that under this type of arrangement the taxpayer obtains the tax benefit but at no time is he at financial risk? Will the Treasurer investigate this type of scheme in accordance with his statement of 1978 and take action accordingly to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation is currently investigating the scheme mentioned by the honourable senator. To date, however, the information available is insufficient to identify the full nature of the scheme. When the enquiries are completed no doubt the Commissoner will advise the Government of any further legislation that he may consider to be required.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 2 April 1981 (Hansard, page 1037) Senator Elstob asked me, as the Minister representing the Treasurer, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How much longer will new home owners need to wait for the implementation of the initiative, announced in the October Federal election campaign by the Prime Minister, for the allowance of an income tax deduction for the cost of the insulation of a person's first home, which was stated to be effective from the date of the announcement.</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The provisions to authorise an income tax deduction for expenditure incurred on home insulation are contained in the Income Tax Laws Amendment Bill 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> The deduction is available in respect of amounts paid by a person for the cost of insulating his or her home (or, in the case of a married couple, their home) where the home is the sole or principal residence of the taxpayer in Australia and neither the taxpayer nor (in the case of a couple) his or her spouse previously owned and used as a residence another dwelling in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The concession applies to the cost of insulating a dwelling purchased under a contract entered into on or after 1 October 1980 or, if built by the taxpayer, the construction of which started on or after that date. The deduction is granted in respect of the cost of thermal insulation materials and their installation.</PARA>

<PARA> Will the Treasurer explore the possibilities of granting tax deductibility for donations to sporting clubs and associations which, in the practical interest of health, have seen fit to reject previous or existing funding from tobacco companies, but which, as a result, need to solicit support from individuals whose normal donations, unlike funding from the tobacco company sponsors, are not currently tax deductible?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> There are many pressures on the Government to expand the gift provisions of the income tax law to include gifts made to various bodies and in various circumstances. It is necessary to consider these in the context of the Budget. The honourable senator may be assured that gifts by individuals in the circumstances outlined will receive consideration in this context.</PARA>

<PARA> (1), (2) and (3) The Government remains committed to an amendment of the income tax law as outlined in my statement of 25 September 1980 and in my further statement of 13 October 1980 in which I indicated that the amendments would apply from the beginning of the 1977-78 income year. It has not proved possible to have the necessary legislation prepared in time for introduction before the winter recess. It will be introduced early in the Budget sittings.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 28 May 1980 (Hansard, page 2250) Senator Kilgariff asked me a question, without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in the Senate. The question concerned the migration of East Timorese in Portugal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Implicit in the interim reply provided by Senator Durack is the fact that the Timorese in Portugal are not refugees. Timorese leaving Indonesia have automatic right to Portuguese nationality and are accorded this status by the Portuguese authorities on request. As a consequence, they have a country willing to accept them and offer them protection.</PARA>
<PARA> Over 3,000 Timorese have arrived in Australia since 1975 under a variety of programs:</PARA>
<PARA> The initial group of evacuees from East Timor;</PARA>
<PARA> the group specially agreed upon between the Australian and Indonesian governments in 1978;</PARA>
<PARA> specially relaxed humanitarian programs; and</PARA>
