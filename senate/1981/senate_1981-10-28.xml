<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 19 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That it is clearly apparent that Australian society is becoming more polarised-that the rich at home and abroad are becoming richer, profitting from Australia's mineral wealth, whilst pensioners and the disadvantaged, some three million people, are becoming a race apart.</PARA>
<PARA> That, of necessity, the Federal Government take action that all Australians share the wealth of their country by the transfer of resources to income security, health care and housing therefore, your petitioners urge that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. All pension and benefits be raised to at least 30 per cent of the National Average Male Earnings seasonally adjusted.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Removal of the means/income test on the Pensioner Health Benefit imposed by Federal legislation 1973.</PARA>
<PARA> Reintroduction of Medibank in so doing restore all Australians to equality of citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. To alleviate Australia's shortage of housing stock within the capacity of people to pay (rental and ownership) the Federal Government immediately inject $200 million into State Housing Authorities, which will, in addition, alleviate unemployment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 154 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> Governmental deregulation of interest rates and the resultant competition for investors' funds is against the national interest. It is inflationary and penetrates every sphere of the economy. It is an intolerable burden on first home buyers and individuals or families already in possession of a mortgage. Constantly increasing interest rates have a staggering effect on the future budgetary planning of these people. Those most affected are, of course, the poor, but recent increases have hit even the middle income earner. Ordinary Australians should not be forced to pay for the excessive profits announced regularly by financial institutions.</PARA>
<PARA>Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should pass an Act amending the Banking Act (1959), providing that increases in the rate of interest be limited to 1% per annum, and that any increases above that amount be made subject to the approval of both Houses of Parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 1,545 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that the introduction of tuition fees for post-graduate and second degree students will:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) severely limit access to such levels of study. The ability of a student to pay tuition fees will be the main criterion for entry to such courses. The restricted availability of Commonwealth post-graduate scholarships and the difficulty of finding part-time work in employment related areas further restricts the ability of post-graduate students to pay tuition fees.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) result in higher attrition rates in post-graduate and second degree studies. Recent surveys have indicated that up to 50% of students would be unable to continue their studies if tuition fees at the level of $1,000 per year were introduced. Inability to continue study is both a personal tragedy and a waste of the community's resources.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) limit Australia's capacity to cope with technological, economic and social change. Many degree students who will have to pay tuition fees undertake further study to upgrade their qualifications to cope with changes in their area of employment. Many are forced to undertake retraining in areas outside their current employment because of declining job opportunities in such areas due to economic change. Further study for many students will bring no financial benefit but simply allow them to extend their contribution in the course of their work. For example, thousands of teachers have undertaken further study to gain expertise in such areas as migrant education, remedial literacy and numeracy teaching, curriculum development and so on.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) further restrict access to such study for women students. As a result of the abolition of tuition fees the proportion of women students in tertiary education has increased significantly. Mature age women students have benefited by the opportunity denied them when they left school.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) seriously undermine Australia's research effort. Approximately 22% of Australian research takes place in tertiary institutions. The bulk of Australia's basic research is undertaken in universities. The introduction of tuition fees threatens Australia's capacity to cope with major structural change in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therfore humbly pray that the Senate will reject the introduction of tuition fees.</PARA>

<TITLE>Tertiary Education Fees</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable, the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that the introduction of tuition fees for post-graduate and second degree students will:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) severely limit access to such levels of study. The ability of a student to pay tuition fees will be the main criteria for entry to such courses. The restricted availability of Commonwealth post-graduate scholarships and the difficulty of finding part-time work in employment related areas further restricts the ability of post-graduate students to pay tuition fees.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) result in higher attrition rates in post-graduate and second degree studies. Recent surveys have indicated that up to 50 per cent of students would be unable to continue their studies if tuition fees at the level of $1,000 per year were introduced. Inability to continue study is both a personal tragedy and a waste of the community's resources.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) limit Australia's capacity to cope with techological, economic and social change, Many degree students who will have to pay tuition fees undertake further study to upgrade their qualifications to cope with changes in their area of employment. Many are forced to undertake retraining in areas outside their current employment because of declining job opportunities in such areas due to economic change. Further study for many students will bring no financial benefit but simply allow them to extent their contribution in the course of their work. For example thousands of teachers have undertaken further study to gain expertise in such areas as migrant education, remedial literacy and numeracy teaching, curriculum development and so on.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) further restrict access to such study for women students. As a result of the abolition of tuition fees the proportion of women students in tertiary education has increased significantly. Mature age women students have benefited by the opportunity denied them when they left school.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) seriously undermine Australia's research effort. Approximately 22 per cent of Australian research takes place in tertiary institutions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for National Development and Energy to my question to him last week relating to the transfer to the States of all responsibility for soil conservation and the grave situation which this could create for Australian agriculture in the years to come. In light of the Minister's answer to me last week, did he write to the Minister for Agriculture of New South Wales on 29 June of this year? I ask Senator Carrick whether, in his letter to the Minister in New South Wales, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do appreciate your disappointment at the termination of what may have developed into a productive area of Commonwealth States co-operation in developing a national approach to safeguarding the nation's soil resources for future generations.</PARA>
<PARA>Does this indicate that Senator Carrick regrets the fact that the Commonwealth, at the behest of the so-called razor gang, has withdrawn the small sum of $3m previously allocated for soil conservation work? Is it the Minister's view that there should be, as he put it in that letter, a national approach to safeguarding soil resources?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1719" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remember my answer to Senator Button last week. Indeed, yesterday I gave a more extensive answer on soil conservation. I pointed out that historically, and in terms of sovereignty, land and therefore the management of land and its soil, is a State matter. I said that what had happened was that the Commonwealth had made a relatively modest gesture towards it and that in no way could it be seen to be one that would supersede or even be predominant in terms of soil conservation. I said that it had been decided that the amount of money should be absorbed into the grants and, therefore, it would be available to the States for them to manage. By and large the State systems of the management of soil conservation have a considerable expertise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not recall a letter dated 29 June. But I imagine that what Senator Button said could be true. I send only approximately 100 letters a day; so it is unlikely that I would recall one letter on 29 June. Indeed, if what Senator Button read is correct, I said that I understood the disappointment of the Minister in the State. I think they are his words. I did not express my own disappointment in the matter. I will look up the letter and refresh my mind on that. The Cabinet has made a decision in which I concur. The fact is that we will be developing in many ways as I said yesterday-particularly through water schemes and similar schemes and through the various ecological protections that come under other departments-matters which will overall preserve the topsoil and ensure the general conservation of the natural resources of Australia.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for National Development and Energy. I refer to the subject of methanol as a gasolene extender in Australia and in particular the study carried out on the marketing and production aspects of methanol prepared by Davy McKee Pty Ltd for the Department of National Development and Energy, to which the Minister referred in his Press statement on 13 October 1981. The report examined three possible plant sites-one in Queensland and one in New South Wales, both using coal feedstock, and one in Victoria which would utilise natural gas. Is it not the case that the known gas reserves in eastern Australia would be insufficient to meet current demands as well as provide the feedstock for the methanol plant? Is the Minister aware that work done by the South Australian Department of Mines and Energy, summarised in a paper in June 1981, estimated that the cost of gas produced by a gasification plant located at the Wakefield coal deposit would be $3.50 to $4 per million British thermal units, which is less than the raw materials price for Victorian natural gas upon which the Davy McKee assessment of the Victorian project was made? Is the Minister aware that the estimated cost of coal recovery at Wakefield is $10 a tonne, a more than favourable figure when compared with the New South Wales and Queensland coal projects? Is the Minister also aware that in pilot studies the Wakefield coal has been found to be uniquely suited to gas production and that the Westinghouse company in the United States found it to be the most reactive coal that it has yet analysed? Can he say whether the New South Wales or Queensland coals have been tested in gasification plants? Is it not the case that, on location criteria specified in the report, the location at Wakefield is at least the equal of the proposed sites in Queensland and New South Wales? Finally, in selecting sites for further consideration, did the consultants consider the Wakefield site in South Australia and, if not, why not?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My Department has, through the National Energy Advisory Committee, arranged for five research papers to be done on methanol. That which relates to production and marketing is the first, and it is available for discussion. The fact is that the report did address itself to Queensland and New South Wales coal and to Victorian gas. In general terms, at this moment it would be true that insufficient proving of natural gas in eastern Australia has been done to be sure that one could readily use it for some other purpose than that for which it is used now, such as extensive use in the production of methanol. For example, the tapping of methane from coal mines in the Appin area of New South Wales is regarded as being productive. There are signs, incidentally, that more gas fields are being located. One hopes that that will prove to be the case in the Gippsland and Otway basins. There are very significant signs that the west coast of Australia will emerge as noteworthy, perhaps even in world terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Hill described as encouraging the location of coal in South Australia, which was not known previously to have considerable coal resources. I understand that to be correct. I do not know the exact pricing of these matters. The report directed itself to the production of methanol from coal. It may well be that it could be done more cost effectively in South Australia. If we can find a large gas field, the production of methanol from gas is a very ready and much cheaper system. Also the liquid product can be carted much more readily than compressed natural gas. I am as eager as the honourable senator to see the development of the coal resources, the fossil fuel resources, in South Australia. I will direct the attention of my Department to his comparative figures as between the likely cost feasibility in South Australia and elsewhere and ask it whether it has a comment to make.</PARA>

I ask: Is the Minister aware that today in the Supreme Court of New South Wales His Honour, Mr Justice Nagle, in a very lengthy judgment awarded Noel Latham damages of $100,000 against 41 of the 75 Broken Hill unionists who were the defendants in the case.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may not surprise Senator Tate on two counts that I do not recall his question of 27 September 1979 because I would fancy that it was about a week or so before I became the Minister, but I may have been the Minister at that time. I have been asked whether I have seen the Auditor-General's report. I ask Senator Tate whether he has seen the latest Auditor-General's report, because so much of his question will be answered when I read from the Auditor-General's report for 1980-81, tabled on 24 September 1981, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Procedures for measurement and allocation of production to the separate fields in the Bass Strait area and for the calculation of royalties and excise on this production are complex. Important questions of principle also had to be resolved before formal agreement could be reached with the licensees in relation to the basis for ascertainment of the value at the wellhead of the production on which the royalties are payable. Royalties which have been paid by the licensees since 1968-69 were calculated on an interim basis pending recalculation after formal agreement was reached.</PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Although the action now taken or in progress is long overdue, the results when finalised should ensure that there is a satisfactory system of control over the substantial amounts of revenue involved.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because Senator Georges interjects, I point out that the Public Accounts Committee and its Chairman acknowledge that the report is dated, that it is about a year old in its findings and it does not take account of this Auditor-General's report. The Auditor-General's report, on which I am questioned, says that the procedures now in place will be satisfactory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, secondly I must say that the report of the Public Accounts Committee does not say that $100m has been lost at all. The report says that there could be errors one way or another-that is, that there could be an overpayment or an underpayment by the companies concerned in any one year to the extent of $10m; but nobody knows. I am now asked what was done based on the Auditor-General's situation. The fact is that there is perhaps no more complex procedure in existence than that involved in attempting to solve this problem. No doubt Senator Tate has far more omniscience and omnipotence than those who put forward a solution. It is considered that there is only one expert in the world who could give advice better than the advice we have now and we are employing that expert.

<PARA> I am asked what has been done. As to the first point, I want to say that we have no reason to believe that the licensees are not operating within normal engineering tolerances. To ensure that this is the case, the Commonwealth and Victorian Governments have engaged an international consultant to ensure that the licensees' sampling procedures are accurate and consistent with good oil field practice, to review the licensees' inbuilt controls and to verify that the procedures and standards are correctly applied. In addition, the Governments have encouraged the licensees to apply for registration with the National Association of Testing Authorities in relation to hydrocarbon fluid quality measurement. Registration will involve regular review of procedures by independent engineers and technologists. The technical procedures are presently being reviewed by the international consultant and by NATA. In addition, the measurement procedures have been examined by the National Measurement Laboratory of the Division of Applied Physics of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA> Having said that and having drawn attention to the fact that the Auditor-General has said in the report-which Senator Tate conveniently did not read-that the procedures are now satisfactory, I should say that in an enormously complex problem what we have done has been to get the best expert advice in the world. We cannot answer whether in fact we have been collecting more or less money than we might from the oil companies, but we are endeavouring to find out. The fact of the matter is that the Auditor-General approves of what we are doing.</PARA>

I point out that for the several years that I have been Minister the Commonwealth has been in association with the Victorian Government, the companies and experts to try to get an answer. Indeed, this was proceeding before the Auditor-General drew attention to the matter. I think Senator Tate fails to understand that the problem is one that is so complex, so the Auditor-General says, that in itself it does not lend itself to straightforward answers at all and the probability is that what has been happening is in line with the giving of the correct answer. But we have not regarded that as good enough and, without prodding from the Auditor-General, we set in train a series of scientific actions to get the money.

In general terms, it seems that approximately 70 per cent of the population-we will be able to confirm that figure only within the next month or so-have some health insurance cover and another 25 per cent or so are covered. That figure may in fact be greater when the facts emerge, but it is very hard from the available figures to identify the veracity or the accuracy of the ACOSS assertions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are provisions in the Social Services Act which permit payments to be made to persons other than the beneficiaries. Those conditions are fairly limited but they cover a wide range of circumstances, ranging from some Aboriginal communities which appoint somebody to receive their cheques en masse to some individual pensioners who, for health reasons or other circumstances, require the assistance of some member of their family or some other person. I think it is possible for somebody who is not a relative of a pensioner to receive an appointment with the consent of a pensioner. I have come across some isolated cases of complaint and those complaints are always very carefully investigated. It is a basic principle of the social security legislation that the pensioner or beneficiary is primarily entitled to the receipt of benefit. Any pensioner or beneficiary requesting that, of course, gets it. Specific arrangements to the contrary are required to be made for the cheque to be made payable to any other person. I will examine the point raised by the honourable senator in more detail and see whether I need to give her a more detailed reply.</PARA></TALK.START>

So the resistance aims at destabilisation and at lowering living standards. The Government is determined to ensure the development of the uranium mining industry in the Northern Territory and throughout Australia and is proceeding in accordance with these policies. Nothing could demonstrate more starkly the importance of the industry in the Northern Territory than recent publicity given to the closure of the Tennant Creek copper smelter and, now, the scaling down of activities at the Gove alumina plant. The consequent employment effects should be evident to all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is an interjection: 'What about pig iron?' The Western Australian State Labor Government made an application to the Federal government of the day for the export of pig iron. Let history be put in its true position. It was a Western Australian State Labor government. The Australian uranium industry has a major contribution to make as a supplier to nations around the world which are seeking long term, reliable energy supplies. As I said yesterday, there are now some 450 reactors operating or under construction throughout the world. Australian companies with development approval have commitments to supply in the order of 54,000 short tons of yellowcake over the next 15 years. Australia is a reliable supplier of resources. The Government is determined that its reputation be maintained. I repeat that the International Energy Agency, comprising 21 nations of the free world, has indicated that unless resort is made more and more to the use of uranium for the generation of energy the living standards of people throughout the world will decline and, in fact, there could be destabilisation in the developing world. Those who stand in the way of the use of uranium are in fact bringing about that imperilment. I also want to see those who are talking about pollution from uranium look towards the pollution that the alternative huge use of coal will cause to the ecosystem. Let us be balanced on this matter.

Under the normal call relief measures, the Commonwealth is meeting on a dollar for dollar basis with Tasmania the cost of assistance for the relief of personal hardship.

<PARA> The Commonwealth has also advised the State of special assistance measures for Zeehan bushfire relief and the Commonwealth will provide assistance for State expenditures on rehousing loans to owner-occupiers under the natural disaster relief arrangements and, as a separate matter, will contribute on a $3 for $1 basis towards the cost of reconstructing the Zeehan scout hall, a central point for community activities. Furthermore, expenditure on welfare housing by the State Housing Commission also will be eligible for funding on a matching basis under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement.</PARA>

The State usually submits a formal claim for this and then the Commonwealth would, for its part, match on the basis that I have outlined the various items of expenditure.

I will refer to the Minister any points in the question that require specific information.

On its front page is a photograph of myself and a very inappropriate headline, linked with that photograph, which I claim misrepresents me and, I believe, the Senate. The headline states: 'More attacks on colleges'. The article refers to the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts inquiry into academic tenure. That headline implies to the readers employed in advanced education colleges around Australia, and to other people, that the current inquiry of the Senate Committee into academic tenure has some motivation springing from Government decisions that appear to be cutting back or in any sense attacking the colleges. I only want to say that all the members of the Senate Standing Committee endorsed the suggestion that the matter should come to this Senate for referral to us. It was the Senate that formally gave us that reference. In the prior discussion of the possible reference of this matter of academic tenure I had no consultations whatsoever with Government Ministers, nor is the inquiry in any way linked with Government decisions. I believe that when a headline such as this is published, it may mislead members of the public to believe that there is a prior motivation unworthy of the Senate in taking on such an inquiry. I only want to make the statement that it is a bona fide inquiry which will be carried out in the same manner as Senate inquiries. I add very briefly on the same subject that the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations-FAUSA-some weeks ago made a similar allegation in talking about the knives now being out for academic tenure. But I was able to speak with the Secretary of FAUSA and he acknowledged that he had no basis for making such statements and he has apologised for them.

This matter of sexual discrimination is particularly serious. Sexual discrimination is defined as discrimination on the grounds of sex alone-that is, that generally women are precluded from or have their access to such things as politics, education, employment and general community activity cut simply because of their sex. It is a problem which has been concerning women publicly, certainly since the suffragette movement in Britain at the turn of the century but for a lot longer than that, and it is a problem that we have not yet solved completely. Despite all the efforts of the women's movement in Australia over the last decade, despite the activities and lobbying of women's groups as widely diverse as the Women's Electoral Lobby and the National Council of Women and despite the fact that there is probably no intellectual or biological reason why women should be treated by society as second rate citizens in a country, allegedly anyway, as advanced and civilised as our own, the fact still remains that there is a vast amount of both overt and covert discrimination against women in the work force, in the home, in education, in business and in the community generally in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

The reason I contend this is that the barriers to achieving equality for women are as much attitudinal ones as they are legal ones, particularly in a country like Australia. To illustrate this point-this rather subterranean restraint that exists on women-I would like to refer to the opening paragraph of a paper by Elizabeth Fennema on the problems facing girls and women in the area of education. She began her thesis with a somewhat whimsical comparison between the general attitude towards women in the United States of America and the specific attitude expressed towards a new one dollar coin when it was introduced in the United States.

<PARA>Elizabeth Fennema went on to make the point that many of the remarks made about the coin are equally attributable to women and that in fact women, and their work outside the home in particular, are less esteemed, more service-orientated, their employment is seen as a problem, they are seldom found in the higher status and/or well paid jobs. She said that the reasons for this are many and varied, deeply rooted in the mores of each society and far beyond what can be addressed in her paper. They certainly go too far to deal with in the time I have in this discussion today. Nevertheless, the paper does make the point that women in Australian society and in society in America are still tainted with what amounts to a slave caste aura and that this is due almost entirely to discriminatory attitudes which are buried deep in the mores of our society. It is in fact all the more appalling that the present Government apparently refuses to acknowledge that fact, or if it does acknowledge it, is not doing anything in particular at the moment to rectify it. </PARA>
<PARA> We are half way through the decade for women. I wonder how much further into the decade we will have to go before the Federal Government is prepared to pass at this level, and not just leave it to the States, an equal opportunities Bill. Some States have that sort of legislation but of course it applies only in those States. I suggest that we will be waiting until Doomsday for the Western Australian and Queensland governments to introduce legislation granting women equal rights under State laws. Of course, Federal government laws affect women in only those jobs falling within Federal government jurisdiction but they will help if only in a fairly limited way. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make the point particularly in view of the Minister's extreme kindness at the beginning of this discussion that I am not saying that this Government has never in the past done anything to rectify discrimination against women or that it is being malicious in its slowness, in its tardiness in doing anything now. Last Wednesday I was prepared to congratulate the Government on recognising in its Domicile Act the situation relating to women in Australia, that the need for them to have independence of domicile was important and that the situation which existed prior to last Wednesday was quite out of kilter with modern social mores. I congratulated the Government then on its action in that regard and I congratulate it again now. But the major problem is not one that can simply be overcome by legal means. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will have to face the fact that many of the problems associated with sex discrimination in Australia are attitudinal ones and that it will have to do something in that regard as well as closing legal loopholes. It could start, for instance, by ratifying the 1979 United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. It could, as a petition read out earlier today requested, take back from the States control over the funding and oversighting of women's shelters, rape crisis centres and so on. It could acknowledge that women have to be encouraged to undertake certain educational courses, particularly in view of the technological change which is occurring in this country, and certain career paths that they have not previously been encouraged to do because those paths have been seen traditionally as male areas of interest and ability. </PARA>
<PARA> The ratification of the United Nations Convention to which I referred would cause the Government to take all those other steps. In doing so it would be doing nothing more than bringing this country into line with a number of European countries which operate positive campaigns to see that women are given equal opportunities in the work force and in education. It may be of interest to honourable senators to know that Sweden, Belgium, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Austria and Norway all encourage the diversification of women in the paid work force. Not only have these countries undertaken legislative measures designed to help women break out of the low pay, low status, low satisfaction, low job security occupations, but also many of them have embarked on expensive, extensive and positive educational campaigns aimed at showing women just what their potential is and how they can best fulfil it in the labour force. It is extremely unfortunate, it seems to me, for this country as a whole and the 51 per cent of its population which is female that Australia is not prepared to make full use of the talents of women. Clearly the countries that I mentioned, whether they are signatories to the Convention or not and whether they have ratified it or not, are operating according to the spirit of that Convention and in some cases of course they are operating it to the letter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Convention is a long one. It contains some 30 articles which it sees as providing a solution to problems besetting half the world's population. It is an extremely comprehensive document. The preamble at the beginning of the convention states that it:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . reflects the depth of the exclusion and restriction practised against women solely on the basis of their sex, by calling for equal rights for women, regardless of their marital status in all fields-political, economic, social, cultural and civil. </PARA>
<PARA>It calls for national legislation to ban discrimination and recommends temporary special measures to speed equality in fact between men and women and action to modify social and cultural patterns that perpetuate discrimination. Other measures contained in the convention provide for equal rights for women in political and public life, equal access to education and the same choice of curricula. It calls for non-discrimination in employment and pay and guarantees of job security in the event of marriage and maternity, a fact which would no doubt be of some interest to the women in Broken Hill. It also stresses the social services needed, especially child care facilities, for combining family obligations with work responsibilities and participation in public life and, interestingly enough, it underlines the equal responsibilities it sees men having with women in the context of family life. It goes on in considerably more detail to cover a number of other things, including the particular problems facing women in rural areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator was not excluded by me. The most serious of the barriers facing women is the one which leads to and perpetuates the problem of women who want to break free of the limited range of careers and job opportunities which have previously or up to now at least been available to women. I make that qualification because many of the traditionally female occupations will not be accessible to women in the next few years. The advances in technology in the Australian work force are hitting hardest at women and it is the majority of women who are clustered into that very small range of jobs, in clerical and assembly line work, the very ones, I contend, which are most susceptible to technological change. Before anybody in this chamber chooses to point out that technological change will create jobs, I point out that the jobs which are created will not be suitable for the women made redundant by the technological changes. In fact, they will not be particularly suitable to many women in the community as the majority of women are not educated to take up the sort of scientific work which is involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer honourable senators to page 34 of today's Australian newspaper which contains an advertisement which indicates quite clearly how firm a hold educational and occupational stereotypes have on employers and the community generally. It is an advertisement taking up something like one-third of the page. It is headed: 'Satellite communications and jobs for the boys'. On the right hand side it has a substantial photograph of a rather angelic looking boy of about seven years. I do not want to give the advertisers any free publicity so I will not mention their identity, but the advertisement states:</PARA>
<PARA> Young Australians have the right to learn the skills this new industry--</PARA>
<PARA>The communications industry-</PARA>
<PARA>Offers and to share in its growth. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly the industry concerned considers that the only young Australians who really do have the right to learn and to be involved in this new and growing industry are males. This is the sort of thing which should be actively discouraged by the Federal Government as it serves only to cement outmoded social traditions concerning women. </PARA>
<PARA> A more serious question arises, however, for the women, those hardy souls, who do manage to break through the barrier of male-dominated employment areas. What happens to them when they do break through? All too frequently the women concerned are faced with what is to me a contemptible fact of life that in order to get on in and to get on with their job they have to put up with resentment and antagonism from their male colleagues. This has a number of effects. It occurs, of course, in different areas and to different women in different jobs in different ways. It can vary from being passed over for promotion, because it is assumed by management that the woman does not need the money as much as a male colleague, or some other equally irrelevant reason, to actual sexual harassment. The latter, of course, can again come in many forms, varying from the telling of off-colour jokes to in fact actually making sexual intercourse with the boss a condition of promotion or of keeping the job itself. </PARA>
<PARA> It is one of the hardest forms of discrimination for anyone to combat since it usually comes down to one person's word against another or to the fact that the woman concerned is made to feel dirty, guilty, somehow to blame for what has happened to her and certainly too embarrassed to tell anyone. It is exacerbated by the fact that some forms of harassment are still considered socially acceptable and passed off either as jokes or as compliments which a woman is too churlish to accept or to see. The women who complain are ridiculed and dismissed as having no sense of humour or as being radicals or lesbians, or, for that matter, all three. In the last minute of my speech as an example I bring to the Senate's attention a situation of sexual harassment which, ironically enough, occurred in the Defence Research Centre at Salisbury in South Australia. To save time in explaining the matter, I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a letter that the woman concerned wrote to Dr Gail Radford. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Gail,</PARA>
<PARA>SEXUAL HARASSMENT</PARA>
<PARA> I have been employed as a Public Servant since 8th March 1971 when I started work at The Weapons Research Establishment under the Department of Supply. With restructuring my place of employment is now The Defence Research Centre Salisbury under The Department of Defence. My Australian Government Staff number is 235 60094; my Third Division seniority date is 3rd October 1973. </PARA>
<PARA> I have set out below several complaints arising from an incident which occurred on 10th November 1980 at work. Would you please help/advise me?</PARA>
<PARA> On the afternoon of 10th November 1980 at work I was working in my office in building 21 labs in the capacity of Technical Officer 1 with the Data Reduction Section of Rocket Propulsion Group of Propulsion Division. I was returning a handkerchief to my bag hung on a hook behind the door of the office. Peter Drake a Technical Assistant from the same building rushed into my office and, without conversing, grabbed my left breast. I scolded him, thumped him and chastised with ''I will grab you'' while making a cupping motion towards his chest, where upon he raised both arms in the air and replied ''Please, please''. </PARA>
<PARA> Several times that afternoon he returned to my office and embarrassed me. For example he later handed me a wrapped article. On unwrapping I found underwear which Peter told me came from a London sex shop. When I passed him in the corridor later I held up a folder to my chest and Peter said, ''No, you only get it once a year''. The next morning Peter was still harassing me. At about 9.45 a.m. while walking to a computer centre I passed Peter Drake driving to a parking place. On noticing me he took both hands off the steering wheel and made a double cupping motion. </PARA>
<PARA> Peter Drake has frequently sexually harassed me. The first occasion I remember was his comment, ''Careful, they'll wobble'', probably back in 1971. The intensity and style of taunting has varied. On occasions he cupped a hand at me, or stood at my office door and told dirty jokes, or frequently inquired if I was wearing a bra, or handed me pornographic magazines or sexually orientated books, and twice asked me to stay weekends with him at Victor Harbor both of which I refused. </PARA>
<PARA> Eventually I told our supervisor Delwyn Carson, who thought that if I feigned lack of embarrassment the matter would resolve. It did not. I tried walking away from him, not talking to him for days and avoiding his office unless work made it necessary but he did not stop the harassment. I complained again to the supervisor who passed it off with the comment that he acts like that towards her also. </PARA>
<PARA> On 11th November, 1980 I handed a letter of complaint to the Principal Officer, Bill Bradfield outlining the problem. A copy of the letter is enclosed. He was unhelpful. Between 11th November 1980 and 1st December, 1980 Bill Bradfield's comments included: That is Peter Drake's ways; you have over-emphasized; you are too sensitive; that is how men greet women; he has not been offensive to me; he was only giving you a present when he flung his arms around you; what is wrong with a gift of underwear; it is only your word against his; you can be sued for libel; you have slandered Delwyn; you won't dare take this any further; if you take this further I will have you demoted. </PARA>
<PARA> Bill said that Peter remembered in 1978 being chastised by me on touching my bottom. This does not tally with Peter's statements that he did not know that he had offended me, and did not know what was offensive to me. Another ambiguity is apparent in a postcard sent by Peter in 1980, a copy of which is enclosed. The wording on the card make it very clear that Peter Drake knew exactly what reaction it would receive. </PARA>
<PARA> My Union (ADSTE) the welfare officer and personnel were then contacted and I was temporarily moved to building 75 with different Rocket Propulsion personnel. Bill Bradfield had stated that I could not continue my work in the nearby building so the Chief Superintendent, Jim Crompton was arranging my transfer elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> On 27th November 1980, Bill Bradfield arranged a lunchtime interview with me in a locked office, and among other things told me to resume working in building 21 on the following Monday, and asked for my decision before the afternoon was over on his request for my resignation. </PARA>
<PARA> A lesser example of non-co-operation involves Tom French of Personnel who told me that Peter Drake would be disciplined on all of the charges (including molesting which occurred without a third person present) or not at all. I enquired why he could not be disciplined on the proven sexual harassment, but the question was parried. I believe on 15th January 1981 Drake had not been disciplined. </PARA>
<PARA> On 13th December 1980 I discovered that all of my data sets stored on the IBM computer had been taken away from me. I had not been informed of this action. A computer Services person told me that Delwyn Carson had arranged it. It is possible that other persons were also involved to give the necessary authority. One reason given for the action was the security risk yet I had been cleared to do the work initially, the work was not considered at risk to warrant password protection, and also some data sets were plagiarized from universal IBM manuals and not at risk. Another reason given was that Delwyn was afraid that I would corrupt the data sets. If my data sets were needed by Rocket Propulsion Group copying could have been arranged through myself or Computer Services. Denying me access to my work impedes future work. It also prevents publication of two technical memoranda, the drafts of which I stored on computer, and thus decreases promotional prospects. </PARA>
<PARA> On 4th December, after acting as TO1 since 7th March 1978 the higher duties were taken away and I was reduced to my substantive level as a TO2. Earlier I studied an internal course in rocketry until the course was eliminated. Considering this I was informed that a decision was made in Canberra enabling me to stay as a TO1 permanently. Could you check the validity of this? Since then the possibility of losing higher duties was not mentioned to me prior to my written complaint. I acted as a TO1 for two years and eight months, received increments and am not aware of any inability to perform at that level. I am currently employed below my capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> During November 1980 I learnt that I was inappropriately classified in the technical grades. The computing emphasis was more suited to a programming assistant grade. I learnt that Peter George, Principal Officer of Ionospheric Studies Group required a PA3 and, although he thought I was the best applicant, I was not permitted to take up the job. PA3 is on a par with TO1. I was told to report on 4th December 1980 as a Technical Assistant 2 (a reduction of $45.85 gross per fortnight) with Aerodynamics Group. </PARA>
<PARA> I am told that Delwyn Carson as well as Peter Drake are considering sueing me with libel. </PARA>
<PARA> The stress has affected my health. I have suffered from recurring diarrohea and headaches and my hair has started to fall out. I took sick leave between 4th December and 14th December 1980 and then used my recreation leave which started on 24th December to give myself time to recuperate. Despite the respite from work I am still suffering the effects of stress and continuing to bald. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the coincidence of events surrounding the recent change in the nature and status of my work has been a direct result of my action in submitting a written complaint about the sexual harassment I have been subjected to by a fellow staff member. Not only has my health been affected by the pressure placed on me by my superior officers but I now feel unable to return to my previous position even if it were to become available. I understand that the Public Service Board is able to act in cases involving sexual harassment, and I seek your assistance in redressing the wrong which I believe has been perpetrated against me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the matter of public importance introduced this afternoon by Senator Haines. I am very pleased that she has introduced this subject for discussion because, as she said, it is a most serious subject indeed. I think that the signing of international conventions by Australian governments is a matter of great importance to the Parliament. The failure of this particular Government to take any substantial action following its signing, in Copenhagen in 1980, of the United Nations Convention outlawing all forms of discrimination against women is something to be deplored.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the outset I endorse some of the remarks made by Senator Haines to the effect that we are not saying that the Federal Government actively discriminates against women or even, indeed, actively opposes any progress in this area. But that is not enough. The Fraser Government has signed an international Convention but it has failed to ratify that Convention even though it has now been ratified by other countries. It has failed to take any steps in its own country to ensure that the provision of that Convention, which it was very happy to sign in Copenhagen last year and about which it made a great fuss in the media, are being implemented in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators that, as of 3 September 1981, the United Nations Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women came into force after having been ratified by the requisite 20 countries. I say that it is a matter of great shame that Australia was not one of those countries that ratified the Convention. The first process in bringing the international Convention into force is the signing of that Convention. The Australian Government did that. The second step which brings about the implementation of the Convention and brings it into force in international forums is the ratification of the Convention. Of course, the Australian Government has failed to do that. I think the reason it has failed to do that is the reason the Fraser Government fails to do so many things in the area of human rights and progressive legislation. That is the reluctance, or in some cases the hostility of certain conservative State governments within this country, to act accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Australian Government is to ratify the United Nations Convention, it must ensure and guarantee in international forums that all laws within Australia are in accord with that Convention. Of course, that means that laws in the States of Western Australia, Queensland, as well as all the other States, must be in accord with that Convention. The States of Tasmania, South Australia and New South Wales provide no particular difficulty. In the case of New South Wales and South Australia, anti-discrimination legislation and equal opportunity machinery have been in effect for some years. Tasmania is on the verge of such action. In the Northern Territory, a private members Bill was introduced by the former Opposition Leader in the Northern Territory, John Isaacs, to provide for this. But, of course, in the States of Western Australia and Queensland there is absolutely no intention to legislate to outlaw discrimination against women as required by the international Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only is the obstacle provided by those States obstructing progress in their own States but also it is obstructing Federal progress. If the Federal Government were to be prepared to enact Federal anti-discrimination legislation, I believe, and many constitutional experts believe, that that legislation would apply in those States where no such legislation existed. The Federal Government would have overriding power and Federal legislation would provide some protection to women in the States of Western Australia and Queensland. But, of course, the Federal Government, as ever, full of good intentions and full of fine words is reluctant to stand up to these reactionary anti-progress States and is reluctant to force the issue. I believe that that is why we do not have anti-discrimination legislation throughout this country. I believe that is why the Australian Government has failed so shamefully to ratify the international Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter arose from the Copenhagen conference and the signing of that Convention. That concerns the matter of a national plan of action to achieve equality for Australian women over a 10-year period. Honourable senators will recall that again, very unfortunately I believe, the Australian Government failed to vote for the world plan of action at Copenhagen because of political matters which really had nothing to do with the status of women. </PARA>

The Australian Government nonetheless offered to have an Australian plan of action which would be its commitment to equality for Australian women over the next 10 years. Where is that plan of action? Why have we not seen it? Many months have passed since that Copenhagen conference and since that commitment was made. I believe that the plan of action is with the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson), who is the responsible Minister. We are still waiting for any squeak out of that Minister as to his intention with regard to this plan. Given the snail's pace activity which is characteristic of that Minister, I think we will be waiting for a long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree with Senator Haines that the matter of social change, of changing people's prejudices and expectations about the proper role of men and women in Australia is a long and difficult process. Indeed, some of the interjections that Senator Haines had to endure demonstrate just how slow social change can be. I agree as she said that attitudinal change is required. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point now in some detail that, although matters of attitudinal change are fundamental and important to all of us who believe in these forms of equality, there are serious practical economic consequences of inequality. We are not just engaged in an academic debate about equality. We are not just engaged in a sociological debate about attitudinal change. Why I, on behalf of the Federal Labor Party, choose to support this matter raised by Senator Haines is that there are very dire economic consequences to this country because of inequality. There are women living in poverty and there are families supported by women living in poverty because of discrimination. That is of fundamental concern to the Labor Party. That is the main reason for my enthusiasm in supporting Senator Haines today. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is really a matter of hypocrisy that the Government on the one hand is prepared to sign this international Convention eliminating all forms of discrimination against women and, on the other hand, through its policies, relentlessly pursues a decline in the economic circumstances of Australian women. The Fraser Government mouths the rhetoric of equality for women while promoting economic and administrative policies which contribute to the growth of inequality. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, as Senator Walsh says, women are not singled out for this treatment. However, they are the subject of our debate this afternoon. For example, the number of women who have been forced into permanent economic dependency on the state through the Fraser Government's economic policies is alarmingly high and growing. The Fraser Government consistently has attacked the living standards of low income earners, the majority of whom are women. Almost two thirds of those who now rely on social security benefits for the major portion of their income are women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The single most important factor in determining income levels and therefore living standards for any Australian is access to employment. Not only has the job market declined in line with the Fraser Government's policies but also women's access to the job market has declined. Women's unemployment, particularly female youth unemployment, has grown under the Fraser Government. I do not want to burden the Senate with too many statistics. I simply say that the current measured rate of female youth unemployment is 18.3 per cent and that the current measured rate of adult female unemployment is 7.1 per cent. Of course, that is only the measured rate. Some economists, such as Margaret Power of Sydney University, have suggested that if we measured the hidden unemployed-that is, those women and girls who are not registered as unemployed-we could double those rates. I believe that my colleague Senator Sibraa, who spends a lot of his time in rural areas of New South Wales, where the problem is even worse, would endorse that extrapolation by Margaret Power.</PARA>
<PARA> When we pass to the area of migrant women we find much higher rates of unemployment for both young and adult migrant women. When we pass to the area of Aboriginal women, as my colleague Senator Coleman would endorse, the situation is infinitely worse. </PARA>
<PARA> Why has there been such a growing rate of women's unemployment? First, and this is a very fundamental problem, there is the inadequacy and unavailability of child care. Senator Chaney, the Minister for Social Security, recently proposed that a universal means test be imposed so as to restrict the application of the child care subsidy to the very needy. On the face of it, that might sound like a sensible use of restricted resources but I reject that policy completely. I believe that it will have the effect of making quality publicly funded child care more expensive and therefore less accessible to the majority of women who, although in need of child care assistance, are in receipt of low incomes but not on pensions and therefore unable to qualify for the extremely needy category that Senator Chaney is apparently considering. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem is the Government's decision to abolish a large number of jobs in the public sector which, of course, represents a high area of women's employment. The last Budget contained cuts to Public Service staff ceilings to the extent of a further 3 per cent. This will result in the destruction of about 9,000 jobs in the public sector. Many of those will be women's jobs. An example was brought up in the Senate last night-that of the cleaners who are to be sacked from the Public Service. Of course, many of them are women-women who, I might point out, because of the kinds of factors to which Senator Haines has referred, have not had the opportunity of gaining the skills and experience that will enable them to compete for other jobs in this very restricted job market. </PARA>
<PARA> There has also been a destruction of jobs in traditional areas of women's employment, such as clerical, service and sales areas, through technological change and structural change in the economy brought about by the resources boom. Of course, there will be some new jobs in areas associated with high technology and resource development, but traditionally very few women have been able to obtain employment in those areas. I suggest that the Government has failed completely to respond to this problem. Whereas, training programs that are specifically designed to qualify women for work in the resources areas are needed, the Government's training measures will exclude women further. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, since 1975 Government spending on employment and training has fallen in real terms by 44 per cent. The majority of training programs that the Government has funded have not been based on the fundamental manpower principle of channelling people away from areas where there is unemployment and into areas where there is a demand for labour. Rather those programs have simply been employer subsidy kinds of schemes. Their aim has not been the retraining of women displaced through technological change. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently I pointed out to the Senate that more than $1m was being spent by the Department of Defence to bring from Britain engineers, technical officers and other skilled personnel, while in Australia young women could not get jobs. Of some thousands of engineers, draughtspeople, naval architects, technical officers and trainees employed by the Department of Defence, less than a dozen are women-less than 12 of all the thousands of jobs in the Department of Defence are occupied by women. </PARA>
<PARA> The Defence Force also implements employment policies which discriminate against women. Women are still not accepted as officer cadets at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, and on current plans will not be accepted at Casey University when it opens either. This is a case-I refer specifically to the Department of Defence-not only of a Government failing to ensure the elimination of discrimination against women but also of one of its departments upholding blatantly discriminatory policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of the increase in Government expenditure on training in the last Budget is directed towards the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training Scheme. Since 90 per cent of apprentices are males, women will get minimal benefit from this expenditure. The increased Budget allocation for skills in short supply will also go mostly to males, because the areas of need are not traditional areas of female employment. There are no legislative mechanisms, indeed no Government policies, to ensure that women get equal access to these schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> When we turn to the area of education, which is so vital if we are to ensure equal opportunity for women, we find equally discriminatory polices advanced by the Government. In association with the lack of job training opportunities, the Government is putting obstacles in the way of women who seek access to tertiary education. Part of the Government's Budget package was the imposition of fees for second and higher degrees. Women who have spent some years out of the work force raising children are much more likely to need to upgrade or update their qualifications, or to take a second or higher degree to prepare for the job market. They are much less likely than are men to find themselves in any of the fees exempt categories outlined by the Minister and I believe, certainly many vice-chancellors and staff associations believe, that the ultimate effect will be to force out those mature age women students who will simply not be able to pay fees. </PARA>
<PARA> If other areas, such as health or taxation, are looked at, the picture of discrimination against women, which is perpetuated and promoted by the Fraser Government's policies, is repeated. The key to breaking the cycle of disadvantage lies in ensurang that women have adequate income levels. A comparison of male and female income levels provides clear evidence of the extent to which discrimination still exists and of the Government's failure to redress it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Council of Trade Unions Working Women's Centre has just compiled a review of equal pay based on figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This shows that more women work part time than do men, that women perform less overtime than men and are paid less for it on average, and that women are less likely to get over-award payments or bonuses. As of March 1979, women made up only 8 per cent of the full time managerial and executive employees, although women make up 37 per cent of the work force. Moreover, the review shows that the majority of women workers are concentrated in a small range of jobs-clerical and secretarial work, teachers, nurses, waitresses, cleaners, factory workers, shop assistants and telephone operators. As honourable senators know, these jobs are mostly low paid, have a high labour turnover and present few opportunities for advancement. Moreover, even within the female dominated areas of employment, men are paid more than women. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget figures on the taxable incomes of males and females for 1980-81 show that while 90 per cent of men earn less than $30,000 per annum, about 90 per cent of women earn less than $15,000 per annum. Some 55 per cent of women who pay tax have incomes of less than $10,000, compared with 27 per cent of men, and a quarter of all women who pay tax have incomes of less than $7,000 per annum. This is the case despite the fact that in 1973 the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission awarded an equal pay decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore it is not just a matter-and here again I must agree with Senator Haines-of simply getting the awards and the legislation right. Other steps must be taken-positive training steps, positive encouragement and equal opportunity policies-if this area of discrimination is to be effectively redressed. Consistently, the Government has failed to implement policies which would challenge this basic economic inequality. In fact, the Government's policies have reinforced and promoted inequality. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government wishes seriously to pursue the elimination of discrimination it must adopt policies and enact legislation, such as Federal anti-discrimination legislation, which will attack institutionalised discrimination in Australia. The Government ought to do a number of things if it is serious in its signing of that international Convention. They are, as I said, the enactment of Federal anti-discrimination legislation to provide equal opportunity throughout the whole area of Commonwealth public employment; the insistence that State governments enact parallel legislation or, otherwise, respond to Federal legislation; the public endorsement of a plan of action for Australia; and, finally, the allocation of appropriate funds to ensure that the matter of equal opportunity and the elimination of discrimination does not remain merely a matter of rhetoric in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two interesting speeches have been made this afternoon. We have heard from women senators the attitude of the Australian Democrats, I take it, and the attitude of the Australian Labor Party towards the subject of discrimination against women. I should say at this stage that the objectives of those two parties and the Government parties are not vastly different. Senator Ryan's speech pointed out the difference in how we would achieve those things. We can debate the value of modus operandi; however, we have to go a little further than that. There has to be some taking to task, certainly, of Senator Ryan for her mis-statements during her speech in relation to Government actions and attitudes towards a range of issues. Notably, she raised the subject of our ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the beginning I say that, in a sense, it is impossible to debate the subject sensibly in this chamber as it is worded by Senator Haines. To say that 'the failure of the Federal Government to ensure the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women in Australia' is a matter of public importance seems to indicate that there was some sort of target date and that it should all have been done by now. It is the objective of the Convention on that subject to eliminate all forms of discrimination. But I think the fact that the Convention was signed only last year would indicate to honourable senators that it would not be expected to be done just 12 months later. It is a very large Convention with many articles. Obviously, it will take some time to be put into effect. that is not to apologise if it could be alleged subsequently that the Government was tardy, but in fact the Government is acting. The fact that it has not all happened in 12 months-indeed, it cannot happen in 12 months-does not mean that the Government has failed in its pursuit of the elimination of discrimination against women. </PARA>
<PARA> There are four aspects to a debate on our Government's policy and what we have done to do away with discrimination against women. Quite a long story can be told about the things that have been achieved by the Fraser Government, none of which Senator Ryan gave the Government credit for. There are the things that are not yet done, but which are under way and on which statements have been made in this chamber by Ministers, notably by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and also by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) who represents the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson). All of those statements of intention and processes which are under way have been ignored by Opposition speakers in this debate. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, once again. Some things cannot be done by a Commonwealth government but need to be left to State governments to do, if they are to be done at all. In due course I intend to take up Senator Ryan's allegation that because we proceed in a certain way action will not take place. I suggest to her that if we proceeded in her way not only would we not guarantee action, but also we would certainly guarantee reaction and that would not be in the interests of women in Australia. There are certain things which cannot be done by any government but which must be done by society itself and, notably, by women themselves. Both Senator Haines and Senator Ryan touched on those items and I will cover some of the points which they raised and which I think must be put on behalf of the Government in defence of a very strong and, I believe, unwarranted attack on the Fraser Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Haines started her speech by saying that discrimination exists. I accept that Senator Haines was correct. Discrimination does exist. The other side of the coin is that the Government is working on the subject of discrimination and wants to do away with it. I accept that there are long-standing sources of discrimination; I will not accept that there has been no movement, that we have failed to meet those areas of discrimination and how they disadvantage women in our work force. In the last decade, and as notably under the Fraser Government as under any previous government, extraordinary progress has been made for women in Australia. Also, a decade ago nobody could have foreseen the amount of progress which has been made by 1981. I suggest that that is a result not only of government action, but also of social changes in attitudes of society towards women and its expectations of women, and in attitudes of women, towards women and their expectations of themselves.</PARA>
<PARA> I must chide Senator Haines for bringing into the debate, when she was quoting from an article, a tone which I think helps women not at all. She presented a quote in relation to the Susan B. Anthony United States dollar. It is that sort of snitchy, cynical comment that was made in that article which the honourable senator read that does not help women at all. I am not interested in debating the merits--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not interested either in turning the debate into a hen's party. I am not interested in debating the merits of the United States currency but, to put the Susan B. Anthony dollar into its context, it ought to be pointed out that in the entire history of the United States, apart from the obverse side of every coin which depicts one of the great initial national leaders of the United States of America, only three America citizens have ever been honoured to have their faces on a United States coin. Those coins are the Eisenhower dollar which followed World War II, the Kennedy half dollar which followed the assassination of President John Kennedy and the Susan B. Anthony dollar. It does not help to suggest, as that article does, that it is some sort of symbol which enshrines discrimination against women and their poor status in society because Susan B. Anthony struggled against her own poor status and the poor status of women in society. We ought to be reasonable in our judgment. It is a great honour to women that that women's leader in the United States is one of the three citizens of that country ever to be so featured and featured because she was a feminist. I am sure that many honourable senators, particularly Opposition senators, are frustrated at times because governments do not do exactly as they would like them to do. That is not surprising. Sometimes government and opposition agree and sometimes they do not. But if the Government always did what all honourable senators wanted, we would all be in the same political party. There would be one party in Australia. In fact, there are differences of attitude.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Haines raised the subject of an equal opportunities Bill and said that the Government had been tardy. The Government has announced and is acting upon a sex discrimination ordinance in the Australian Capital Territory, which is its initial area of jurisdiction. The objective of that ordinance, as stated by the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment is 'to proscribe discrimination on the ground of sex and marital status in areas such as employment, education, land, housing and accommodation, and goods, services and facilities, including credit, insurance and superannuation'. That objective would have to please the most ardent feminist. The ordinance will provide for the confidential conciliation of all complaints. A time limit is to be placed on conciliation and, if conciliation fails, a complainant will be able to institute proceedings in a civil court. </PARA>
<PARA> It is anticipated that the draft ordinance will be available to the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly by the end of this year. Senator Haines may have liked it to go to the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly at the beginning of this year. Time does not permit me to outline and my intimate knowledge of the event, because I am not the Minister, would not permit me to guess why it did not go before the House of Assembly earlier this year. But it is being drafted. It is being worked on. The objectives are stated. Action will take place. The fact that it has not happened yet does not mean that the Government has failed-not at all. It means that the Government is moving to cover an area which it has recognised must be covered. I note that Senator Haines said that the Government must face the fact that many of the problems encountered by women are attitudinally based. I think we have all accepted that in the debate. We have also accepted in the course of the debate that there are the two aspects of attitude-the aspect of society's attitude towards women and the aspect of women's attitude towards themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it ought to be mentioned somewhere in this debate how far women, in terms of achievement and in terms of attitudinal achievement both in society and on their own part, have come in this place. Prior to the 1974 election there were two women members in the Senate and no women members in the House of Representatives. This year there are 10 women in the Senate out of a total of 64 and three women in the House of Representatives. For the first time ever there is more than one woman member in the House of Representatives. Nobody would have forseen that in 1974 or 1971. That is a measure of attitudinal change. </PARA>
<PARA> No longer do political parties give women the unwinnable seats to contest. They are getting the safe seats on some occasions in both the Commonwealth and the State arena. They are getting increasingly the marginal seat because it is recognised by political parties that social attitudes have changed so far that, given a good woman candidate, there is a better chance in many cases of winning a marginal seat. Even 10 years ago it was common for the political attitude on this subject to be expressed as: 'You cannot endorse a woman because women will not vote for women; they are election losers'. The proof of the pudding is in the eating in this case. The fact is that political parties frequently choose to head their Senate tickets with women and they choose to endorse an increasing number of women in seats that are either safe or winnable. That is a recent change. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that women have come forward in greater numbers and have become more assertive about their potential as candidates is also a change. Every woman senator in this chamber would have to agree with me that the greatest barrier to having more women in public life is that good women still inhibit themselves attitudinally even with the proof before them of remarkable success in comparative terms. We have all had the experience of having discussions with women who we think would be very good in public life but who still have an attitude that it is not appropriate for them to put themselves forward. This is changing. More are coming forward, but it cannot be changed by government. </PARA>
<PARA> Attitudinal change is a matter of process. It is a process that has accelerated and will go on. I will agree that there are some areas where government can influence attitude and that is in the way it goes about its own business. I would like to come to that matter subsequently. Before my time expires, I want to say a few words on the subject of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. This was raised as being noteworthy by both Senator Ryan and Senator Haines. I regret to tell those two very worthy and very able honourable senators that their comments are, in my opinion, precipitate and not reasonable. Because nothing has happened yet in terms of what they demand does not mean that a process is not under way to bring about the objective they seek, perhaps not in the way they seek it-</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just wait a minute. The honourable senator has been waiting a long time for my speech. Several times during her speech she invited me to speak. I am coming to that. Senator Ryan properly pointed out that there are two ways to implement an international convention. The first one is to become a signatory and the second step is ratification. The process of ratification is under way in Australia. It is not to the shame of the Fraser Government that ratification has not yet taken place-not at all. It is to its credit that it is proceeding in a sensible way which will ensure far more the implementation in real terms of the objective of that Convention than by going about it with a sledge hammer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also have to point out to both Senator Haines and Senator Ryan that the fact that a government ratifies does not necessarily mean that one woman in that country is any better off. Senator Ryan invited me to say a few words about the Copenhagen Conference and I will put them in this context. The fact that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has ratified the Convention does not necessarily mean that one woman in the Soviet Union will be any better off in comparative terms and in terms of discrimination. It is impossible for us to examine in the same way that we can be examined and our governments can be held up to public examination, what is happening in certain countries and to apply any objective yardstick. </PARA>
<PARA> There was an interesting incident revolving around a word that led to our not voting for the plan of action in Copenhagen. It should be put on the record that Mrs Beaurepaire, national chairman of the National Women's Advisory Council, in making a statement just before the final vote, said that the Australian Government supported the plan of action and had supported it up to the point where it was so politicised that it was impossible to add our name to it. I say to Senator Ryan that it does Australian women and advocates of women's rights no credit at all to suggest that the Australian Government should have denied its policy towards Israel and the Middle East for the sake of voting yes on that document. The insertion of the word 'zionism', which had nothing to do with the subject of the conference, made it impossible for the Australian Government to vote straight out for that plan of action. But the Government made it clear-as the Press did not-at that conference that it supported the plan of action and would seek to implement it. </PARA>
<PARA> I dare say at this stage and make a forecast that it will be implemented in far more worthwhile terms in Australia than it will be in a number of the countries that have already given their nominal ratification to the Convention. When, in the committee stage of that Convention, the word 'zionism' was sought to be inserted Australia sought to insert the word 'sexism'. Senator Ryan might be interested to hear that the Soviet delegates did not know what that word meant. There is no word or phrase in the Russian language that translates to sexism. When it was explained in Russian to the delegate the delegate had to admit that he had never heard of the concept. So much for the women's movement in the Soviet Union! The Soviet Union opposed the insertion of the word 'sexism'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am saying to the honourable senator that because the Soviet Union has ratified the convention it does not mean that women in that country will be any better off; the indications are otherwise. When we ratify, it will mean something and the meaningful process is under way. Any government can slap its signature on something and ratify it if it knows in the back of its mind that it will never be reasonably held up to have to act on it. The ratification process is under way. In Australia we operate under a Federal system of government. That is a fact of political structure. There are certain things that the Commonwealth Government can do and certain things that it cannot do. There are certain things that must be done by State governments. One can argue that under the foreign affairs power the Commonwealth Government could legislate on just about anything-never mind the other provisions of the Constitution-because this Convention was signed in a foreign affairs context. One could certainly argue that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But to ram down the throat of State governments issues they have not had the opportunity to debate as to how they might participate if they want to participate will not endear the issues to anyone. Conferences of Attorneys-General, who are the Ministers responsible for human rights in Australia, have been under way and are proceeding. Progress has been made. Certainly, in my opinion, it will be better that the six State governments and the Territory Government at the end of the process are at a point of agreement about what should be done about the elimination of discrimination against women than that we beat them over the head with something they have not yet fully debated. The process is under way. Some agreement has been reached. The process will go on. There have been precedents for that in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the process that the Fraser Government follows and it is a process that leads to results. To suggest, as was done towards the end of Senator Ryan's speech, that the Fraser Government has pursued policies which are anti-women, is nonsense. The record is clear. In a number of areas specifically designed towards women-in boards and other activities within the Public Service and in other areas such as crisis accommodation for families in distress, which has a very particular application to women-the Government has acted in a very positive way and has shown that its attitudes are alive and well and that it intends to extend them. I think this has been a worthwhile debate if only to educate a few of our colleagues in some of the issues that we consider to be important.

<PARA>BROADCASTING STATIONS LICENCE FEES BILL 1981</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill and the Television Stations Licence Fees Bill 1981, which I will introduce soon, propose to amend the Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Act and the Television Stations Licence Fees Act 1964 to vary the basis on which commercial broadcasting and television stations are charged for their use of a limited public resource. Honourable Senators will be aware that those Acts impose fees in the nature of a royalty charge, thus following the practice common to all Governments of ensuring that the public gains some benefit from the commercial utilisation of public resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Acts provide for a lump sum payment on the original grant of a licence and for a lump sum and a percentage of the gross earnings of the station in respect of each year after the grant. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills propose an increased fee of $500 on the grant of a licence and tying the annual fee simply to a revised percentage of gross earnings. That percentage varies in relation to increases in gross earnings, subject to specified upper limits. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable Senators will be aware that Bills to give effect to these measures, which were announced in the Budget, have previously been considered in the other Place. The present Bills differ from the earlier ones only in imposing an upper limit on the proposed percentage of a station's gross earnings. These limits are:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) 5 per cent of gross earnings in the case of broadcasting stations; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) 7.5 per cent of gross earnings in the case of television stations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has reconsidered these measures and their long-term effects on licencees. It is believed that the principles of the measures should continue, but it is appropriate that a maximum level be set so that the measures will not result in excessive and inequitable continuing increases in the amounts of fees required to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> Licence fees are calculated on the basis of gross earnings of stations. Honourable Senators will be aware that the effects of inflation will inevitably lead to an increase in gross earnings of stations without necessarily a corresponding increase in disposable income. To impose an open ended obligation would steadily increase stations real expenses. Those expenses will have to be recovered from advertising revenues which will increase the costs to advertisers using medium and larger sized stations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government feels that it is equitable to fix upper limits on the percentages applicable. This allows stations to budget with reasonable assurance and requires that the Government take a positive decision to increase the rate of this taxation, thereby giving the Parliament the opportunity to debate the matter on its merits. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall level of licence fees and their impact on stations will however be kept under review. The Government has decided to re-examine the whole question by 1984 to ensure that the levels of licence fees remain appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> The variations will not substantially alter the position of stations in the short term. Stations with gross earnings of less than $2 1/2m will still pay lower fees than under the current provisions and estimated revenue from this source in 1981-82 remains at an estimated $31.5m. </PARA>
<PARA> This will benefit approximately 120 of 130 commercial broadcasting stations and 20 of 50 commercial television stations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government hopes that this will enable stations benefiting by these changes to improve programming and services to the public. It does not believe that these aspects will suffer in the bigger stations. Advertising revenue is the life blood of commercial broadcasting and television. It is directly related to the audience share of a particular station and obviously this relates to the programming appeal of the station to the general public. No station can, therefore, afford to lower its programming standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The details of the proposed rates are clearly shown in the Bills. The changes will take effect on 1 September 1981. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to authorise the payment to Queensland of $58.5m in 1981-82 as special grants in respect of 1979-80 and 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> The payment of this amount is in accordance with the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission contained in its Forty-eighth Report 1981 on special assistance for States, which was tabled on 23 September 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> Successive Commonwealth Governments, from time to time, on the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission following applications by States, have provided special financial assistance to the less populous States to compensate them for such factors as lower capacity to raise revenue and higher costs of providing government services of a standard comparable to those provided by the financially stronger states. </PARA>
<PARA> Since self-government, the Northern Territory has also had access to the Commonwealth grants commission on the same basis as a claimant state. </PARA>
<PARA> The grants commission has recommended a special grant of $3.3 million for the Northern Territory in 1981-82. However, by virtue of phase-in provisions included in the memorandum of understanding in respect of financial arrangements agreed between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory governments, the territory will receive an additional assistance grant of $20 million in 1981-82 in lieu of the special grant. Provision for the additional assistance grant to the Northern Territory is made in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> When special grants were first paid they constituted the only regular form of general revenue assistance to the less populous states for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> However, for many years now, the main way in which special compensatory assistance has been provided to these states has been through the payment of higher per capita amounts of other general revenue funds. This situation is reflected today in the fact that tax sharing grants paid to Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania are higher, in per capita terms, than similar grants paid to New South Wales and Victoria. Special grants are made available to supplement a state's tax sharing grants. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall distribution of general revenue assistance to the states is currently undergoing a fundamental re-assessment. The grants commission is itself closely involved in this exercise. Arising from consideration by the Commonwealth and the States of its report on State tax sharing entitlements 1981, the commission has been asked to review its report and in so doing to take into account a number of matters including those that will be raised by the Commonwealth and the States. As an interim arrangement in 1981-82, the Commonwealth has provided additional general revenue grants to New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland in recognition of the likelihood that, following the further review, relativities could be adjusted in favour of these States. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly the role of special grants in the future will need to be determined in the context of the re-assessment of the distribution of general revenue funds. The interim funding arrangement for 1981-82 has therefore been adopted on the basis that there will be no applications by any State for special grants in respect of this financial year. As I mentioned earlier, the special grants which are the subject of this Bill are in respect of the years 1979-80 and 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> Queensland has been the only claimant State in recent years. It has applied for and received special assistance in each year since 1971-72. </PARA>
<PARA> The practice of the Grants Commission, in arriving at its recommendations in relation to state claims for special assistance, has been to make an assessment of the 'Financial needs' of a claimant state. In making such assessments, the Commission compares in detail the finances of the claimant state with those of the 'standard' states-the Commission has regarded New South Wales and Victoria as 'standard' states for special grants purposes since 1959-60. </PARA>

<PARA>Queensland Grant (Special Assistance) Bill</PARA>
<PARA>Queensland Grant (Special Assistance) Bill</PARA>
<PARA>Queensland Grant (Special Assistance) Bill</PARA>
<PARA> Normally, special grants recommended by the commission have consisted of two parts. One part is based on a preliminary assessment of the financial need of the claimant state usually in the financial year concerned, and is an advance payment subject to adjustment usually two years later when the commission has compared in detail the finances of the claimant state and standard states for that year. The other part of the special grant represents the final adjustment to the advance payment made earlier and is known as the completion payment. This adjustment might be positive or negative and therefore might result in the final grant in respect of the year being higher or lower than the advance payment for that year. </PARA>
<PARA> The payment to Queensland in 1981-82 of $58.5 million provided for by this Bill consists of a completion payment of $33.5 million in respect of 1979-80 and an advance payment of $25 million in respect of 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> The completion payment in respect of 1979-80, when added to the $11 million advance grant paid to Queensland in that year, brings the final grant in respect of 1979-80 to $44.5 million, that is, $21.8 million above the corresponding figure for 1978-79. </PARA>
<PARA> The advance payment in respect of 1980-81 normally would have been provided during that financial year. However, Queensland requested an advance grant only towards the end of that financial year, after the commission's methodology for its review of tax sharing relativities and the processes surrounding the review became known. A completion payment in respect of 1980-81 will be assessed by the commission in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> The commission's recommendations in relation to the special grants arrangements have been adopted by the parliament since the commission's inception and the Government considers that they should be accepted on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating five Bills concerning the appropriation of funds for schools and universities in the tertiary education sector throughout Australia. Although the Bills cover a number of different matters, they are, as Senator Carrick pointed out, being debated cognately. Many speakers will choose to discuss different Bills and different aspects of those Bills. On behalf of the Opposition, I will give a brief description of the Bills and then speak in some detail on the three Bills concerning tertiary assistance-the Australian National University Amendment (No. 2) Bill, the Canberra College of Advanced Education Amendment Bill and the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill 1981 provides funds for the next triennium to universities, colleges of advanced education and technical and further education institutions around Australia. It embodies the decision by the Government to attempt to impose tertiary tuition fees on students studying for second or higher degrees. It embodies the razor gang decision to effect amalgamations between certain tertiary institutions. I give notice to the Senate that, at the end of my second reading speech, I will move an amendment to that Bill. I request the Clerk to circulate that amendment at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian National University Amendment (No. 2) Bill and the Canberra College of Advanced Education Amendment Bill are primarily consequential Bills resulting from the Government's decision to impose tertiary tuition fees. These Bills are designed to amend the relevant Act so that the governing bodies of these two institutions may impose fees in accordance with the determination made by the Minister for Education (Mr Fife). The Federal Australian Labor Party is totally opposed to the decision by the Government to impose tertiary fees on students in tertiary institutions who are undertaking second and higher degrees so we will be opposing generally, and specifically, all such measures. </PARA>
<PARA> Being debated cognately with the Bills that I have described are two other Bills concerned with schools-the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill and the Non-government Schools (Loans Guarantee) Amendment Bill. The States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill is legislation which provides for the implementation of the program of Commonwealth support for government and non-government schools throughout Australia. The Opposition will, therefore, not be opposing this Bill. However, we will be moving an amendment to the second reading of the Bill, drawing attention to the serious shortcomings of the Government's policy with regard to schools. The Non-government Schools (Loans Guarantee) Amendment Bill extends the provision of a Commonwealth loans guarantee not only to existing schools but also to new schools. The Opposition objects to the proposal to extend the loans guarantee scheme to new schools and will therefore oppose clause 3 of this Bill. My colleagues will be canvassing more fully the issues raised in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Non-government Schools (Loans Guarantee) Amendment Bill is a reasonable statute which gives the Government power to guarantee loans for extensions to non-government schools; that is, existing schools. The Act was legislated for to facilitate the loan raising capacity of non-government schools. The Bill proposes two changes. Firstly, it seeks to expand the guarantee to include interest payments outstanding as well as the principle. The Australian Labor Party has no objection to that. Secondly, it proposes that the guarantee be available to new or proposed schools. Our opposition to this matter will be expressed when we oppose clause 3 of the Bill. The measure would, in our view, encourage the type of school which is currently causing so much dissent and alarm within the community-for example, schools which are not attached to mainstream churches or backed by established community or parents' groups and which often seek to follow eccentric curricula or educational practices. The experience in the United States of America of schools conducted in the fundamentalist tradition provides an example of the reason why so many parents and teachers are alarmed by the development of these schools. I believe that many Australian parents would question whether schools which promote such teaching are in the best interests of children or are deserving of public support. Such schools, I must point out, are not usually subjected to the judgment of their educational standards by State regulations. Registration procedures in most States go no further than dealing with public health and safety matters. Yet, when such schools are registered, they are automatically entitled to recurrent subsidies from the Schools Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the major points I want to make at this stage of the debate, we, as I said, are opposed outright to those Bills before us which seek to impose fees on students in tertiary institutions. I must point out that the fees will be imposed not only on students undertaking higher degrees but also on a large body of undergraduate students; that is, those students who are taking a second undergraduate degree. Honourable senators may be aware that in some universities this body of students is a significant proportion of student numbers. In the university with which I am most familiar, the Australian National University, in excess of 20 per cent of the undergraduate students in the School of Asian Studies are in fact second degree students. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Teague has made a suggestion which is news to me. I would request that the appropriate Minister make that statement of Government policy very clearly throughout this debate. I am referring to students who are undertaking a second undergraduate degree. It would be news to hear from the Minister that this body of students is indeed exempt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the view of the Australian Labor Party, and indeed I think in the view of many people throughout the educational community in Australia, the imposition of fees will result in a reduction of access to education. This is our primary concern. I cannot stress the point too strongly that what we are concerned about with Federal education policy, with the Federal funding of education throughout Australia, is the increased access by Australian citizens to education-to schools education and to higher education. We do not believe, as some latter day elitists are now claiming, that the increasing access by students from low socio-economic families means a decline in standards. We are also committed in the Australian Labor Party to the maintenance of the highest standards within all educational institutions. But in our view, all students who have the ability and the motivation are entitled to education of the highest standard. We believe that the imposition of fees directly obstructs the realisation of that objective. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that we are already getting to a situation in which, because of the Government's mean minded handling of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, only the sons and daughters of the affluent are able to undertake tertiary education. This is an appalling situation for a country such as Australia. It is particularly appalling in that it is a setting back of the clock; it is a reversal of the trend of increasing access to education which I am very happy to acknowledge was started by Prime Minister Chifley and extended enormously during the Administration of Robert Gordon Menzies. The restriction of the access of Australian citizens to higher education on socio-economic grounds alone is an appalling situation. It is a situation which we will oppose in every possible way. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Teague seems to doubt that the situation I am describing does in fact prevail. I would draw his attention to a recent survey carried out by the Australian Union of Students at Sydney's four major tertiary campuses which found that if faced with tuition fees of $1,000 per annum, which is the maximum fee payable under this legislation, 55 per cent of students would defer or not enrol. A breakdown of student responses to the AUS survey according to family income found that, while 4 per cent of those in the $25,000 and upper income bracket would not enrol if a fee of $300 were levied, over 16 per cent of those with incomes under $10,000 would not enrol if such a fee were levied. Women students would be disadvantaged to a greater degree than men. The AUS survey found that if the $300 per annum fee were levied 32 per cent of males would defer or discontinue compared with 45 per cent of females. This, of course, reflects the lower income levels of women in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is also opposing as strongly as it can this measure to impose fees because it believes that it is in fact the thin edge of the wedge. We believe that it is the intention of the Government to impose fees for all tertiary students. As much as the Government may care to deny it, its record speaks for itself. There was a time when it said it would not impose any fees on students in tertiary institutions. First of all it imposed fees on overseas students; now fees are to be imposed on second and higher degree students. If the Government gets this measure through unchallenged by the Senate it would be only a matter of time before fees are imposed for all tertiary tuition. The abolition of tertiary tuition fees and the introduction of a means tested living allowance created a vast expansion in the access to education, particularly for mature age students and for women. As I said, the Fraser Government has attempted to erode such access. It has allowed the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme to diminish to the point where it can no longer be accurately described as a living allowance. Now we are to have the reintroduction of fees. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is proper to ask what the money collected through the reintroduction of fees will be used for. The Government does not intend to require those who can afford it to pay and then use the revenue gained to assist lower and middle income people to undertake tertiary education. It does not intend to use this money to increase the dwindling level of tertiary education assistance. This legislation simply takes money out of education and redirects it elsewhere. The problem of inadequate funding for tertiary institutions has been exacerbated by large increases in academic salaries. Following a 4 per cent interim increase in academic salaries announced earlier this year Justice Ludeke has only recently awarded a further 6 per cent increase in academic salaries. This means that universities and tertiary institutions are going to be faced with a 10 per cent increase in their wages bill at a time of severe budgetary restrictions. Their budgetary problems are going to be almost overwhelming. Unless the Government allocates more funds to tertiary institutions to cover this recently announced increase, I believe that many tertiary institutions will find that their financial position is impossible. I look forward to some comment on this matter by the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) during this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very strongly the view of the Australian Labor Party that at a time of rapid technological and economic change the Government should be encouraging people to acquire new skills and to upgrade their qualifications. Currently both government and private industry spend vast amounts of money importing experts and people with specialised skills to fill jobs for which too few Australians are qualified. The cost of importing skills and expertise will only grow as access to education and training decreases. It simply does not make any sense that at a time when we are crying out for advanced skills in a whole range of high technology areas, in a whole range of areas such as the so-called resources boom, we are importing this talent and expertise and denying Australian citizens the opportunity to acquire the appropriate expertise. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say at this stage of the debate that it simply does not make sense either that we provide a financial incentive for young people to drop out of university and go on the dole. That is precisely what is happening in an undocumented but I believe, through my experience as a local senator in the Australian Capital Territory, very great number of cases. If students are struggling and finding it impossible to live on the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and if they are now going to be faced with fees for higher degrees, then in many cases they will drop out. As we know, rates of youth unemployment being what they are, many young people will end up on the dole. Where is the sense of paying young people to be unemployed and yet denying them sufficient support to continue to develop their education and expertise to a level where they will be of great benefit not only to themselves in their economic circumstances but also to the whole community and economy. It makes no sense at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that compared with other nations the Australian Government ranks education as a low priority. A comparison between Australia and other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries of full time enrolment rates by age groups shows that in the 15 year-old to 19 year-old age group Australia has 46.1 per cent enrolled; Germany has 51.3 per cent; Canada has 66.4 per cent and Japan, to whom we look as an economic partner in so many instances, has 76.3 per cent enrolled. When we go to the higher age group-the 20 year-old to 24 year-old age group-the ones who will perhaps be most affected by the imposition of fees, we find that Australia has only 5.5 per cent enrolments, Germany has 11.1 per cent, Canada has 14.5 per cent, and Japan has 14.5 per cent enrolment. Again this sort of comparison ought to convince the Senate of the senselessness of the measures currently being legislated for by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> How are we to compete internationally or improve our trading situation? How are we to upgrade the whole range of skills and expertise within the economy if we deny our young people and our adults the opportunity to enrol in full time tertiary education? I think the comparison with countries like Japan and West Germany particularly are most instructive. There is no benefit in the community having vast numbers of people unemployed. There is no benefit in the community having vast numbers of people unskilled and undereducated, as is the case in Australia. It has become a very popular fad in some of the editorials of the newspapers in this country to say that we are overeducated and that we have spent too much money on education. I do not know what standard of comparison they are using when they make these sorts of judgments, but no realistic standard of comparison which I can discover, suggests that we are anything other than a severely undereducated community. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I am stressing the importance of education in training for the economy, I would stress even more greatly the importance to a health, progressive democracy of having a highly educated citizenry. People are not able to operate properly and freely in a democracy if they are undereducated, unable to grasp the way institutions work and, I suggest, if they are unable to decide for themselves the objectivity of the news and information that is available to them through the highly monopolised news outlets that we have in this country. To be a truly free person one needs to be competent and to be able to understand and to assert that understanding. One needs to be able to judge governments and indeed, I might add, to be able to judge oppositions. None of those attributes so essential in a democracy can be achieved while we are keeping people at such low levels of education and as such low levels of access to information, ideas and expertise. </PARA>
<PARA> I strongly believe that the current high levels of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, will be exacerbated under the fees proposal which will discourage people from seeking higher educational qualifications. The fees proposal ignores the ability to pay. For example, those post-graduate students already in receipt of Commonwealth awards will also be exempt from fees. Those who get nothing will now have to pay fees. There is no question of ability to pay being a criterion for the requirement to pay. It also ignores the vital contribution of post-graduate students to Australia's research effort. Under Fraser Government stringencies there are now far fewer tutorships and demonstrator positions available at universities and colleges of advanced education to enable post-graduate students to support themselves. Again, what is the fall back position? It is either affluent families or nothing-dropping out. </PARA>
<PARA> The revenue collected by the imposition of fees would be small. I think this is an important point to make. I believe this is not an economic measure, like so many alleged economic measures introduced by the Fraser Government, but it is an ideological measure. We are not really seeking to bring vast revenues either into the Consolidated Revenue Fund or into revenues for campuses by the imposition of these fees. The Government is simply seeking to exclude a certain number of students from access to higher education. </PARA>
<PARA> Appropriation Bill (No. 1) from the recent Budget intends to appropriate something like $1.865 billion for colleges, universities and technical and further education institutions throughout Australia. The Government estimates that in the next calendar year it will get no more than $8m as a result of the imposition of fees. I think that is an extraordinarily optimistic estimate. The figure will probably be closer to $4m. We must subtract from this $4m figure the relatively high cost of collecting the fees. For example, the Griffith University in Queensland has estimated that the difference between the administration cost involved and the amount of fees collected will be no greater than $10,000. The Griffith University has therefore refused to collect fees. </PARA>
<PARA> The other issue raised directly by this legislation is the amalgamation of tertiary institutions. Like the decision in relation to tertiary tuition fees, the decision that 30 colleges of advanced education should cease to exist, was made by the Lynch Committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions, popularly and notoriously known as the razor gang. This decision seems to have little economic justification. It seems that the razor gang believed that if there were fewer colleges, savings would be made in recurrent expenditure. I suggest that such savings are likely to be minimal. Even the Tertiary Education Commission has said that significant economies are unlikely in the short to medium term. The question of what is good or what is best for education in this country just does not seem to have entered the decision. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government seems to be ideologically opposed to educational and cultural activities and to be totally committed to reversing all of the initiatives introduced by the Whitlam Government. I simply point out at this stage that there is one thing that the Fraser Government cannot do. It cannot reverse the expectations of quality and access that were raised during the period of the Whitlam Government. It can dismantle programs, slash funding and impose staff ceilings, but this society had its whole vision of what an equal and fair society ought to be like, greatly enhanced, greatly increased and illuminated during the period of the Whitlam Government, and that, I suggest, cannot be totally reversed by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1973 43 teachers colleges achieved CAE status. This clearly had an impact on the entire tertiary sector. The emergence of a surplus of teachers in the mid-1970s and the subsequent reduced intake in teacher education courses provided justifiable grounds for some re-organisation in the tertiary sector. The Opposition does not oppose such re-organisation. However, we do believe that the current amalgamation proposal is unsatisfactory. The unsatisfactory aspects of this proposal include the likely reduction of overall educational opportunities, a decrease in the diversity of courses and in the recognition of different educational approaches by different institutions, the likely damage to morale at tertiary institutions leading to a decline in educational standards and the problem of redundancy of college staff which will result from amalgamation. I should point out here that the Minister for Education is on record as saying that he is not in the least bit concerned about the problem of redundancy and it is clearly a problem for the States and the institutions themselves. If tertiary institutions are forced into these unsatisfactory kinds of amalgamations the consequences for tertiary education in Australia will be serious and permanent. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of points to be made about the other Bills which are being debated cognately, but as I said in my opening remarks, these will be addressed by colleagues of mine and, I presume, other speakers in the debate. At this stage I want to stress that we are adopting this attitude to this packet of Bills because of our basic belief that access to education in Australia should be increased, that education of the highest possible standard should be available to all with the motivation and the ability to undertake it and that the current series of Bills are designed to attack both access and standards. If we exclude people, if we reduce access to tertiary education to those who can afford to pay for it, we will be excluding people of talent, we will be excluding people who could otherwise make an important contribution to this society. By reducing access we will also lower standards. I do not think there are many people in a position of competence to speak on this matter in campuses throughout Australia who would disagree with me. </PARA>

There have been innumerable examples in our own series of education policies in this country where the giving to people from socio-economically deprived backgrounds the opportunity and access has resulted in outstanding performances by children and adults who without that special opportunity provided by sympathetic government policies would not have been able to develop their abilities. So in our view talent, ability, academic talent, research talent and so on exist in an almost random way throughout society. Therefore, policies which exclude people simply on a socio-economic basis are policies which will exclude talented people and potentially creative and constructive people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is involved in a second reading debate on five education Bills-the State Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill, the Australian National University Amendment (No. 2) Bill, the Canberra College of Advanced Education Amendment Bill, the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill and the Non-government Schools (Loans Guarantee) Amendment Bill-which are being debated together. These Bills cover many issues and it is not my intention to range over the whole of the field or all of the provisions covered in the Bills. Having listened to the speech made by Senator Ryan I think it is time to get back to a few basic points-a few essentials in this education debate. Surely the starting point is that the education vote is finite. It is not an infinite vote. There is not an unlimited amount of money. What this Government has tried to do is to assess priorities and I will have a little more to say about that in a moment or two. Anyone who listened to the speech from Labor Party representatives would think that really no money is going into education at all. The figures belie that thought because the education vote has risen quite dramatically in the last 10 years.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it should, and it has; that is my point. It is not a hypothetical case that this will happen in the future. Apart from the vote for social security and welfare the education vote has risen more than the vote for any other sector in the Federal Budget. For example, 10 years ago in 1971-72, the vote was $349m. This year, 1981-82, the vote is $3,255m which is roughly a tenfold lift. If we have a look at the position of the universities which is a particular point of concern we will see that 10 years ago in 1971-72 the vote for the universities was $126m. This year the vote is $967m. It roughly parallels the great increase in the educational vote. That vote has more than kept pace with inflation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would prefer that we did not charge fees for tertiary students but I can see the need to assess the priorities that we have had in this field. Much is made about free education but I would remind the chamber that there is no such thing as free education. Education is paid for through tax and that means that everyone who earns any income at all and anyone who buys anything in the community that in any way attracts an indirect tax contributes to those who are educated. I think the idea of free education is as nonsensical as the idea of free medicine. That is a point that I am sorry my comrades over the road-those senators who sit opposite-simply cannot understand. </PARA>
<PARA> That leads me to the business of priorities. It is up to the Government to assess priorities as it sees them for the benefit of the whole Australian community. We are fortunate in having a Liberal-National Country Party Government that can operate for the benefit of all the people in the country, not just sections that support those parties. </PARA>
<PARA> The priorities in education that the Government has to look at include first of all how much money is to go to education as opposed to other areas in the community such as the development of this country, welfare payments and the rest, and secondly the proportion of the education vote that goes to tertiary education. The Government has decided that those students who already have one university degree will contribute-only contribute; not pay for the whole cost but make a partial contribution-towards the cost of their second degree. I believe there is a very justifiable argument for that action. </PARA>
<PARA> I have presumed that the Government did look at alternatives to this, such as a percentage reduction in the grants that go to education. The Government decided this was the fairest and best way to go about it. The argument for charging fees for second degree students is pretty clear. These students are well established in their academic careers. They know where they are going. They have career motivation and, having started and been supported by all wage earners and taxpayers in Australia, they are now asked to make some small contribution to the funding of the final part of their educational course. The fee that is to be charged is $1,000 a year. I would not know what the true cost is to provide a year's tuition for a student. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Teague. I am casting my mind back seven or eight years to the position in the United States where term fees for graduate students were, I think, about $4,000 to $6,000. The proposition that has been put by the Labor Party turns on three premises. The first one is that students simply cannot work while they are doing higher degrees. The second one, so eloquently put by Senator Ryan with much passion, is that we are going back to the dark days of the 1950s, that it will be only the rich and elite who will be educated if fees for these students are not paid for by government and that students will drop out and go on the dole. Does Senator Ryan really believe that people make the sacrifice and effort to go through all the rigours of secondary education, through a pass degree, to then become a voluntary recruit for the dole? Really! I would ask why that student ever started the course if he were to do that. The third proposition is that Australia's research capacity will collapse-not diminish-if fees are introduced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should like to deal with the first of these propositions, and that is that students cannot be allowed to work while they are undertaking higher education. As I said before, I should like them to be able to get their education without paying fees. But I cannot accept the proposition that a student cannot work between the period of his pass degree and his higher degree and put some money in the bank to put himself through his course. I cannot accept that he cannot intermit in some degrees, although it is undesirable to take a year off half-way through the course to earn some money. I cannot accept that a student cannot work part time at weekends and in the recesses, which, by and large, are quite extensive-probably 35 to 40 per cent of the year-to earn some money to put himself through his course. It may not be desirable in the best of all possible worlds, but it is possible to make the effort. I reject utterly the concept of education that is going around that we have to bribe students, that we have to cross their palms with silver to encourage them to take a higher degree or any form of education. I find that idea utterly abhorrent. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly the proposition I am advocating does mean that some effort in education is required. But I believe that students are prepared to make that effort. The basic requirements for a successful higher degree student or indeed any sort of student are, firstly, motivation, the will to succeed, the will to acquire that knowledge, and, secondly, the ability to be able to cope with the academic course. I have an unbounded belief in the virtues of human nature. I believe that people will make the effort and that they have the ideals to acquire a higher education. We are talking about students, and students have a thirst for knowledge. That is what scholarship is all about. Scholarship is not a matter of legislating and putting people through universities and giving them degrees pro rata after they have served a period. It is a matter of having able people who want that knowledge and who want to get on. </PARA>
<PARA> At a lesser plane than the idealism of the desire for knowledge, we have the matter of career advancement. A large number of students who enrol for higher degrees do so so that their career will benefit. They know that they will be promoted and they know that a higher range of opportunities and appointments will be presented for them if they have a higher level of education. I believe that that is the motivation that will move students to cope with the difficulties of earning in order to provide some income for themselves while they are students. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to Government priorities and raise two small points. As a senator for Queensland, I have to make a decision whether I support a government that moves to pay a student to do a second degree which will enable him to advance his career or whether I want to see that money directed towards roads or communications. Probably no State in Australia has worse roads than Queensland. I refer to the northern highway and to other main roads where one has to dice with semi-trailers to beat them over priority narrow bridges. I mention also the flooding of highways. People are being killed all the time on our roads and that is a real penalty for society, far more so than a student working for a few hours at the weekend to put himself through university. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take the subject of telephones and television. Most of the people in Queensland live outside the capital city. They have maybe one or no television channel. They do not have the four channels or the countless number of radio stations that the people in Sydney and Melbourne have. Telephones are a very big issue in the country area. Every household in the cities of Melbourne or Sydney which wants a telephone connection can have it. If there is no telephone in the house there is the corner store with a telephone available or the public telephone box out on the footpath. As Senator Robertson would acknowledge there are not too many public telephone boxes 60 miles from Ilfracombe. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had been practising for years. I put myself through. I do not assume any virtue from this at all. It was the only way that was open to me. Seven years after I had graduated, with specialist qualifications and a higher degree, I was happy to take a job at #12 a week in a hospital and pay #7 a week rent. I had a wife and one child. I did that, and I would have paid for that privilege because of the opportunity and experience it gave me in my career. I am no different from anyone else in my generation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not believe that the generation coming on today should do what my father had to do or what I did. The only point I am making is that it is possible to approach this problem in different ways. My ambition in politics is to make life easier for people, to make it more satisfying so that they can do more things. I certainly do not want to inflict on another generation any of the difficulties that I had to go through. But we must never lose sight of the point that human nature can cope if it has the motivation. </PARA>
<PARA> The point that Senator Ryan made about the rich being the only people who are educated really is a load of nonsense. There is no social segment which has the right to be educated under the system of government in this country. By and large I think it is true that those people who have an excess of money simply do not have the motivation to do the hard work that an academic career involves. The basic requirement, as I said before, is motivation, and that motivation of course is more a matter of family values that the child has been brought up with, and how much emphasis has been put on education. That, and not the economic structure of the family is the sole determinant, really. </PARA>
<PARA> While we are talking about the 1950s, it might not be a bad idea to look at what was going on then. Since the 1950s free education at a tertiary level for a pass degree has been introduced. More importantly, in the graduate level that we are talking about, almost every form of training is now available in Australia. Thirty years ago in the 1950s, indeed 20 years ago in the 1960s, if anyone wanted to do a higher degree it was probably desirable for them to go overseas. In many cases it was mandatory for him to go overseas to acquire that qualification. That meant that students had to pay their fares to the other side of the world, either North America or Britain; they had to support themselves in a foreign country without any support from their family while they were there, and they probably had to pay fees. All of that has gone. One of the achievements of the Government in recent years is that we have now a full spread of graduate accommodation available within Australia. That is a point that does not get the recognition it deserves. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point made by the Australian Labor Party is that research will collapse. That is a very loose statement. That point has only a very thin grain of truth in it, and the truth that it has relates to the fact that if manpower is not coming on our capacity to perform research will certainly diminish. But we must take the broader view and look at the whole of the Australian research record. Australia has a very poor record in the field of research and development. As the report of the Standing Committee on Science and the Environment which was tabled last year showed, the effort we make does not compare at all with effort made by similar countries. Probably that is a consequence of the high tariff protection policies that have been followed by all Australian governments over the last few generations. There has not been the pressure on industry to compete. What we need to support an increased research effort in this country is action by the Government to reduce the level of tariffs, to provide taxation incentives for industry, so that more research and development is done in-house in Australia and also an increase in the research grants, particularly in the scientific disciplines, to bodies such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the universities. In general I think there is an obligation on the Government to look at the whole field of post-graduate education in the light of these changes. If it finds that there are some unforeseen consequences, there is probably a need to look at the level of post-graduate scholarships and awards available to the Australian academic community to see that they are adequate in number and in conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter that I will deal with in relation to this parcel of Bills relating to tertiary education institutes concerns the matter of compulsory unionism for students maintained in all Australian universities. To allow the tentacles of unionism to spread into a field where really it has no business at all is really intolerable. Quite simply, what is happening is that, unless a student joins a student union, the university administration does not allow the student to enrol for his course or, if he is allowed to enrol, he is not allowed to enrol for examinations. If those two steps are allowed, the administration will not allow the examination papers to be marked or will block the student on the awarding of the degree. I find that absolutely unsupportable. This Parliament has moved in relation to the only university over whose affairs we can exercise any guidance at all, the Australian National University, to eliminate that practice. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be a matter for State governments of all political persuasions to move in because the power rests with them to see that this pernicious habit of compulsory unionism in student unions is stamped out. Joining a union should be a matter of choice. A student should have the choice whether he joins a union. That should be where the matter ends. Under this principle of compulsory unionism, a great deal of political agitation is being stirred up. It is not doing the student body any good at all because the fundamental premise for any learning is that there is peace in the land and on the campus. It is not possible to teach students when they are out throwing bricks through windows and rioting in the streets. It is not possible to imagine a worse situation for scholarship to flourish in. </PARA>
<PARA> Last Saturday morning in Brisbane, I opened the Weekend Australian and looked at the career positions in the 'Positions Vacant' column. There was an advertisement for the University of Queensland Union. I will read what that advertisement says. It is titled: 'University of Queensland Union Calls applications for the newly-created position of Part-Time Students' Organiser'. Under the heading 'Duties', the advertisement stated:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. To organize and politicize the Unions' part-time members. </PARA>
<PARA>Then the advertisement lists three more duties and the qualifications expected. I repeat that the first duty is:</PARA>
<PARA> To organize and politicize the unions' part time members. </PARA>
<PARA>What are we about in this country? Is this the thousand Year Reich or the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics? We do not need the student body to be politicised by force. It students want to be interested in politics, that is fine; I was, as a student, 20-odd years ago. But to compel people to be politicised as is required of the part time student organiser advertised for here-presumably if there is a part time student organiser, we have a full time student organiser as well-I find utterly intolerable. That is not the sort of society I want to live in. </PARA>
<PARA> What is going on with this compulsory unionism? I will tell honourable senators. There is a compulsory union contribution for political purposes. University union fees are not $5 or $10 but run in excess of $120 for most universities. That is quite a large sum of money. Quite a large fraction of that is diverted for political causes which are quite antipathetical to the students scholarship. The only argument to support the running of a union on a university campus is to provide facilities for students, for cafeterias and for recreational facilities. I believe that even those facilities should be self-supporting. I find it hard to believe that, on the larger university campuses, where there is a student and staff body in excess of 10,000, it is not possible to make a pie stall pay. Most unions now have licences and run bars. I cannot see why the whole thing cannot be run as a normal commercial operation without the taxpayer having to put a subsidy in not to provide food or drink for students but to pay for the mismanagement in the operation of those facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very concerned at the way university administrators, vice-chancellors, senates and the various boards of management, support without fail compulsory unionism in the universities of Australia. They are the very first people to talk about academic freedom. I am prepared to defend academic freedom anywhere. But it is not academic freedom to compel a student to be a member of a union. A more basic human freedom is involved-the freedom of choice whether a person wants to belong to a body. That should be recognised. While we support compulsory unions on the campuses, we are leading to a closed shop mentality which extends throughout the whole of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> One element that is putting this country at risk is the level of industrial relations that we have. We do not need to inculcate bad relationships in universities. I do not believe that this country can survive for more than four or five years unless we modify quite dramatically our industrial relations. The first thing that will happen is that we will lose our mineral exports. We already have a very undesirable reputation as an unreliable supplier. The large bulk exports that the mineral industry trades in simply cannot be accepted by the users in other countries when there is such a degree of unreliability whether they will get their coal, iron ore or alumina. The second thing that is happening is that we are being priced out through the increasing cost of production of these minerals despite the very great natural advantages of cheap extraction that we have. Those aspects are purely matters of union relationships. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no permanency in the development of minerals. There is no way we can lock minerals up and come back to them in 50 years time hoping to derive money from their extraction. The solution to these problems is purely political. It is not a matter for the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission or the trade unions but it is a matter for the government of the day. I am sorry to say that, on this side of the Parliament, all we seem to be involved in is a semantic or legal argument as to what some agreements mean. Of course, on the other side of the chamber, it is just a sell-out to what ever the most demanding union wants at the time. It is a very complex problem. There are many causes of it but essentially it is a political matter. The first thing the Government should do is to do something about the income tax laws because the tax on wage earners is far too high. That is one of the arguments for indirect taxation which the Australian Labor Party is not so keen on. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of overtime is a very real problem in the work force. Penalty rates do not work and the cash in the hand practice and the tax evasion that results from this action are a very real issue in the community. Put quite simply, people are not prepared to work at the weekends and out of hours at the approved penalty rates, whatever the union rates might be, but they will work as long as required provided they are paid on a cash-in-hand basis on which earnings they pay no tax. I think there is an obligation on the Government to recognise these customs in the community and to cope with them. Obviously it cannot prevent them happening. </PARA>
<PARA> The second consequence of high taxation on tax earners concerns the matter of strikes. A lot of disputes result because people feel that they do not have enough money. People do not have enough money because they pay so much tax. They go on strike for a while and get quite a large wage rise but, when tax is taken out, the net gain is very small. The other aspect concerns the high level of income tax which allows strikes to be prolonged until such time as that income tax, paid through the year, has been amortised because the workers are really losing nothing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating five Bills which deal with grants to the States, to the Australian National University and to the Canberra College of Advanced Education for educational purposes. They represent quite an important package of education Bills and, contrary to the suggestions of my colleagues, I have been quite encouraged by Senator MacGibbon's speech, because I have a strong suspicion that at last he is coming to grips with the issues of the 1960s. For him, that is indeed encouraging. However, at this stage I do not propose to dwell on the various points that he made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These are important Bills. In a sense they are important in their absurdity because in no way do they address themselves, as one hopes Bills of this kind might, to questions relating to the educational issues which face this country. Basically, the debate in the Senate on the measures will be about the question of fees and, to a lesser extent, the amalgamation of colleges of advanced education. I begin by quoting from an editorial in the Australian of April of this year which dealt with the question of the reintroduction of fees for second degrees. The editorial stated:</PARA>
<PARA> What Australia needs and has a right to expect is a clear educational policy, not hiccups of reaction or isolated ad hoc decisions. </PARA>
<PARA>In regard to the question of fees, we are confronted with very much an isolated ad hoc decision. According to the Government's estimates when dealing with the economic aspects of fee collection, fees to be collected in 1982 would total approximately $8m, or less than half of one per cent of total Commonwealth expenditure on universities and colleges. Therefore, we are not dealing with a big issue in economic terms but rather one of the issues that this Government has always been concerned about in an ad hoc way, in seeking to indulge in somewhat disciplinarian gestures towards certain sections of the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not talking about the CYSS program; I am referring to university fees. When one contrasts the $8m estimate of revenue from the $1,000 fee to be imposed on individuals with the effect that it will have on many individuals-because that sum represents a substantial proportion of the income of people of student age-one sees the absurdity of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the $8m figure is an official estimate. On 21 October the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick), in answering a question, assured the Senate that in 1982 only 4,000 students would be affected. According to my mathematics, that would bring in an income of some $4m rather than an income of $8m, as projected by the Government. So much for the estimates made by a goverment which is blown up with rhetoric about its efficiency in relation to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> My second point, before dealing with the educational consequences of the reintroduction of fees, relates to the Government's credibility on this issue. That is very important to the Senate as a so-called House of review. Let me say quite clearly that if the Government proceeds by way of legislation with the proposal that it put to the people of Australia, prior to the elections last year, to establish a motor racing circuit in Canberra, the Opposition will support the proposal because that is something that the Government said, before the last elections, it would do. However idiotic the proposal may seem to us, the Government is entitled to do it because it went to the people of Australia and told them that it would. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, let us consider what the Government said about university fees. I am sorry to have to go back to 1977, but the statements made about the fees issue by Senator Carrick, as Minister for Education then and subsequently were quite explicit. It was made quite clear that a Fraser government would not be about introducing fees. Senator Carrick stated in November 1977:</PARA>
<PARA> Cyclically, each year, a series of rumours circulates about a number of aspects of education. Like all rumours, and certainly those that have been circulated about the Fraser Government, they are utterly wrong. Rumours are running in certain quarters that the Government intends to re-impose fees for foreign students. There is no truth in that at all. </PARA>
<PARA>Look at what happened in 1979. The Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It is true that Australia is even more attractive than ever to foreign students . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to deal with that issue. Referring to Senator Lajovic, who had asked the question, the Minister added:</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator referred also, I believe, to the suggestion that fees were to be reimposed in other areas. There has never been, and will not be, an intention to reimpose fees in relation to the primary or co-ordinated degree areas. Nor do we intend to reimpose fees in regard to second degrees. In short, any rumours circulating regarding fees are in error. </PARA>
<PARA>There could be no more explicit statement than that. I suppose that it could be said that it is an old statement, but it is one of intention on the part of this Government. By contrast, look at what the present Minister for Education (Mr Fife) had to say on 8 October 1980 when he was flushed out on the fees issue. The Minister had to be flushed out because he did not understand the issue, but when flushed out he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I have given an assurance publicly, and I repeat that assurance, that no proposals are being considered by the Government for the possible reintroduction of tertiary fees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is quite aware of what it is about. He can work it out for himself and perhaps make a devious contribution to the debate which explains what this Government has been doing. Quite frankly, had this Government adopted an honest approach to the electorate and had it had the guts-it requires political guts-to go to the people of Australia before the last election and state its position on fees we would have been in a very difficult situation indeed in opposing this legislation. But the Government did not do that and that is why the fees issue is causing so much concern now, as are other issues which this Government failed to raise prior to the last election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look briefly at the merits of the fees issue. What we are talking about in terms of fees for second degrees and what we are talking about, in a different sense, in terms of the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill are questions concerning access to education. In relation to second degrees we are talking about access or the right of access to further study. I found all Senator MacGibbon's views on this issue quaint, if I might say so. Most members of this Senate have been through the tortuous experience of having to do a bit of work as students. I did not mind that; I hope that Senator MacGibbon did not mind it either. I do not have any views which would encourage the sorts of soft options which Senator MacGibbon seems to think are being offered young people today compared with what was offered his sturdy generation, which produced senators and the like. At all levels in this debate we are talking about questions of access. The fundamental question about access to tertiary education in Australia, as I think all the experts agree now, lies in the schools area. At a later stage I want to say something about the level of funding for schools and the response of this Government to the increased drop-out rate amongst secondary students and the declining access from secondary schools to tertiary education. But let us deal with the matter of access to post-graduate study of one kind or another. </PARA>
<PARA> The effects of the abolition of fees by the last Labor Government has been a matter of legitimate debate. It has been said, I think with some veracity, that the results which the abolition of fees was expected to achieve in terms of increasing access to education were not achieved. It is very doubtful whether one can generalise or speak with certainty about that issue. Certainly, two or three years ago a survey indicated that one-third of college of advanced education students would not be able to continue their courses, in their view, if fees were imposed. But one of the interesting and exciting aspects of the abolition of fees has been the increase in the number of highly motivated mature-age students who have been attending universities and colleges of advanced education, not only for primary degrees but also for post-graduate and second degrees. I would have thought that they were the sorts of students that Senator MacGibbon had in mind in his vision of the perfect student under Malcolm Fraser's Government-highly motivated students wanting to pursue further studies and all that sort of thing. </PARA>

Of course, the other issue is that of the access of women to education, particularly in respect of the pursuit of education courses as such. As I said earlier, the real question of primary access is at the school level. That is where increased drop-out rates are occurring under this Government. This Government has a capacity to look about 2 hours ahead rather than to the long term future, which we have to look to when considering educational issues. What we are faced with is a real crisis in educational institutions in Australia-a crisis in institutions generally, I think, but certainly a crisis in educational institutions in terms of directions, sense of purpose and sense of ongoing capacity for access to further education.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting we were discussing a package of education Bills and, basically, the effects of the introduction of fees for second degrees. I was trying to illustrate the veracity of a point made by the Australian in its editorial of 23 April. It stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What Australia needs and has a right to expect is a clear education policy, not hiccups of reaction or isolated ad hoc decisions. </PARA>
<PARA>The imposition of fees is a hiccup from the Government which will provide revenue equivalent to one half of one per cent of the Commonwealth's expenditure on education at the tertiary level. At the same time it will impose substantial burdens on individuals. Quite frankly, this Government's education policies confirm the observation made in the Australian editorial in that there is no indication of any educational philosophy in these Bills. There is no clue as to where the Government thinks it is going in education policy. Over the last five or six years we have seen a government which has pigeon-holed reports in relation to education matters. There is a whole list of reports which, of course, we have been asked to wait for almost in a state of desperation. The report of the Williams Inquiry into Education, Training and Employment was to solve all the problems of secondary and post-secondary education. We waited two and a half years for it and, of course, it is virtually a pigeon-holed report. </PARA>

I say to Senator Teague that it will be my speech next year too because I have absolute faith that this Government will have no education policy next year as it had no education policy last year. I will go on saying that. It is an educational achievement of the highest order to have persuaded him of the veracity of that comment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second matter I was raising before the suspension of the sitting for dinner was the credibility of the Government on the fees issue. I pointed out that Senator Carrick in 1977, as Minister for Education in this place, and on a number of occasions thereafter, had made it quite clear that there would be no introduction of fees. That was confirmed quite explicitly last year before the appointment of the present Minister for Education, Mr Fife. That is, of course, why we take the position about fees which we do in the Senate. It is another example of this Government saying one thing before an election and doing something completely different afterwards. </PARA>
<PARA> If ever the notion of mandate, which has been discussed in the Senate over a few years, did not exist in respect of a government, it does not exist in respect of the Fraser Government. It made it quite clear that it would not proceed with fees and it has gone back on that undertaking. That is a matter of political concern to the Senate and is closely related to the attitude adopted by the Opposition. I said that the imposition of fees affects individuals. It affects the question of access to education. This Government has done very little. I challenge anybody to tell me what the Government has done. In fact, I challenge honourable senators opposite like Senator Teague, who will be speaking later, to tell me what measures the Government has taken in the last six years in education policy which have resulted in an increase of access to education at the tertiary or post-secondary level. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate that, but we are talking about the university and college level. The technical and further education program, of course, has been expanding for a number of years now. I would not have thought that that has happened as a result of any effort by this Government other than the shift in the balance of resources to the TAFE sector. It is a matter of bipartisan concern, I think, that that should happen. When I talk about access I talk not only about the capacity to obtain or enter tertiary or post-secondary education at the college or university level but also about the ability to remain in post-secondary education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have debated in this place-Senator Teague will no doubt remind me of it and I will keep reminding him-the level of post-graduate awards and the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowance. Both the eligibility for the allowances and the actual allowances themselves have fallen under this Government. So much for its concern about continuing access to education! One group that I believed had been granted access to education as a result of the abolition of fees was mature age students. It is mature aged students who want to pursue second degrees who will be most affected by the imposition of these fees if this legislation is allowed to go through this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to one or two effects of this imposition. There are many sorts of characteristic mess-ups in the way the regulations which have been sent around tertiary institutions have been drafted. For example, from looking at those regulations is seems to be a correct view that people who have completed a three-year diploma on, for example, education will not be exempt from fees if they seek to upgrade their course to a degree course unless the degree is in precisely the same field as the one in which they took the diploma. That is not a decision about access to education. That is a projection of the view that you sharpen your mind by narrowing it. It has nothing to do with educational access, breadth of education or the capacity to obtain a broader education. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe there are quite a few examples of those matters. I want to look at some other examples. Some of the effects are indicated by the response from universities to the proposed legislation. Griffith University estimates that it will bring in $10,000 in fees. The University says that it will not collect the fees because it is not worth its while. That is an absurd result in terms of that University. There has been the response from the university vice-chancellors who are not people who exactly bounce on radical pogo-sticks every day of the week and project their views about social change in an innovative manner, but they are very concerned about this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter, of course, is the impact on research. Senator MacGibbon made some comments about research. I share his views about its importance in the national scene. He said that Australia has a poor record of research. That is not really true. Australia has a poor record of research in private enterprise. It does not have a bad record of research in terms of government initiative, government-sponsored research, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and so on. If the honourable senator examines the figures as distinct from the rhetoric, he will find that is true. He touched on it himself when he suggested that it was as a result of tariff policy that we had such a poor record. Tariff policy has not affected government research; it has affected private enterprise research in Australia. I share the view that more should be done about Australia's research effort. The important point about it is that 40 per cent of university research, which is an important aspect of Australian research on a number of issues, is carried out by graduate students. I think that is a figure which should be borne in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> The Williams report made the comment that the highest proportions of graduate students in Australia pursuing second degrees were in the disciplines of agriculture, engineering, education and the natural sciences. Day after day, we see comments from the mining industry and elsewhere about a chronic shortage of professional engineers in Australia. That is true. Even if one takes the view that the purpose of education is to serve the mills of industry in this country-I do not take that view-it is not succeeding because we are not producing enough engineers or agricultural scientists, for example, and we are not producing enough highly qualified people in the natural sciences or in disciplines such as the soil sciences, geology and areas like that which are of considerable importance but which again are areas in which there is a shortage of highly skilled people. Yet it is on these areas which carry the highest proportions of second degree students that the imposition of fees will bear most heavily. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say a brief word about college amalgamations and why I support the amendment moved by my colleague, Senator Ryan. I emphasise the Opposition's objection to college amalgamations by quoting the Minister for Education in Victoria, who described the college amalgamation proposals emanating from the Review of Commonwealth Functions as:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . unilateral, blunt, insensitive and ill considered, disclosing no appreciation whatever of the problems involved for staff, students and institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to object to particular amalgamations such as those involving the State College of Victoria, at Hawthorn, the Institute of Early Childhood Development, which plays a special role in the education life of Victoria, and the Institute of Catholic Education. I appreciate that since then some of those problems have come nearer to being dealt with in a more effective way. </PARA>
<PARA> We on the Government side-I am sorry, I am ahead of myself; I should say on the Opposition side-do not retreat from saying that there were too many colleges of advanced education created in that phoney boom of the late 1960s and early 1970s. We do not retreat from that at all. What we say is that amalgamations, such as the one at Townsville between the Townsville College of Advanced Education and the James Cook University, to which the Queensland Government has properly objected, are being carried out at the point of a gun. They are told: 'Do this or we will cut off the money'. That is not a way to achieve results in this area. Well, it may be a way to achieve results but it will not do much for the morale and efficiency of academic communities. It is a bandit approach to government. This is the main objection we have to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The effects on morale on the college campuses and so on, with very little assurance about job security and things of that kind, have been quite shattering for any senator or member of parliament who has bothered to go to those colleges in Victoria or Queensland, as I have done. The Government is damaging a resource. The skilled resources of colleges of advanced education and universities are being damaged. That resource is very important to the future economic life of this country and to the wellbeing of the population, not just this year but 10, 20 or 30 years ahead. If the resources and structures are run down, as this Government has allowed them to be with its ad hoc, ill-considered policies, as the Victorian Minister described them, it is immensely costly to build them up again. That is something which I do not think is adequately considered in the policies of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The absurdity about the amalgamations decision is simply that it was taken by a bunch of educational hillbillies, by Ministers a couple of whom are graziers, a couple of whom were lawyers and a few people like that. It was not a decision made on educational grounds which related to any educational priorities. That is the whole problem with this Government. The Government is not looking forward in terms of making decisions for the future about educational priorities; it is concerned with one-off stunts like the so-called razor gang. As long as it carries on with this one-off stunting, we will not have good government and we will not have a secure and a steady future for the education system in this country. These were not decisions made in the light of educational priorities and the Government parties education committee had nothing to do with them. The members of that committee found out about the decisions, as we did, after they had been made. That is not good government, because they were not consulted about these issues and they should have been. They are here on big salaries, representing people, and they should have been consulted. </PARA>

<PARA> Finally, I want to say something about the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill. I have very limited time but I just want to say this: The situation in Australian schools is at a crisis point. It is at a crisis point because of the same sort of decision-making by this Government which has been apparent in relation to post-secondary education. Anybody who is concerned about the future of this country must be concerned about the current crisis in schools with kids turning off institutions, just turning away from them, because those institutions are not supplying the needs which a society like this should be supplying. Very big educational questions are involved in that issue. But how does the Government tackle it? It has been tackling it by running down the government schools sector and giving a bit extra to non-government schools because, I understand that is where the elite of Australian society is supposed to be taught. This has been done in defiance of the advice of the Schools Commission and I think in defiance of the views of most serious educational bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Schools Commission has had a continually difficult task in coping with the needs of government and non-government schools equally. In 1977, it objected to the transfer of funds from the government to the non-government sector. In 1979-81, it returned to the subject in its report for that triennium. I refer to the results obtained by the Schools Commission which are pointed up in the more recent report of the Schools Commission. The figures show a shift in Commonwealth funds from the government to the non-government sector, general recurrent funds for government schools having fallen by 4.1 per cent and general recurrent funds for private schools having increased by 53.7 per cent. The same sorts of changes-I do not have time to give the order of those changes now-are taking place in relation to capital funds. The Government is developing an imbalance between the two sectors of education which, as a result of earlier Schools Commission activities, had begun to work together in a way which was in the interests of a cohesive society in this country. This Government is not concerned about those sorts of things. It should be and, if it continues not to be concerned about them, it should no longer remain in government. We will be seeing that that is the case at the next election. </PARA>

Though I intend to speak primarily on the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill, I want to say a few words about the other Bills that are in this package. I am concerned and must be concerned as a Government senator who has in the last few months received hundreds of letters not only from students but also from teachers and organisations that have expressed concern with aspects to education expenditure. I believe that there is concern about that in the community. There are, of course, opposite views. There are people who take the view that those who are educated are in a privileged situation and are obtaining more than they should in a community in which moneys are short and needs are great. On the other hand, I believe that there is a very considerable need for people in this country to become highly educated and highly trained. If Australia, as part of the Asian area, is to become a country which is able to offer expertise and skills and to provide the type of product that is attractive to countries in our region, we have to attack more and more the problem of educating the people of this community. I think that this is one of the most urgent needs facing this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the Menzies Government made a great attack on the problems of tertiary education.

The Senate also may not, under the Constitution, amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people.

I will make some remarks in this speech which suggest that I think the Government is being unwise in pursuing the present policy in certain directions. At the same time I will not endeavour, as a senator, to superimpose my views on the views the Government has taken in the Budget and in monetary Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that in a number of areas there is need for a review of the policies which the Government has taken. I have read the arguments that have been presented to me by many people about the position of government schools and the payments that are made to private schools. We cannot ignore the fact that there is a rising feeling in this community of prejudice on the part of the Government in favour of private schools. I have been recently to Chadstone High School in Victoria, which has been trying for some years to obtain an assembly hall. Although that school's request was near the top of the list, it has now disappeared from the list at least for the time being. Many of these schools have told me about the situation at what they call the 'wealthy' schools. I think that Melbourne Grammar School has provision for six gardeners but I have been told that money coming from the Commonwealth is being used for a ski lodge. When one hears that sort of argument one realises that there is danger of some moneys being expended unwisely, in view of the limited funds of the Government. As one who supports payments to private schools and feels that they have a just claim on Commonwealth funds, I believe that we have to be careful about ensuring that funds do not go to schools that are in no real need of funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Likewise, there is a considerable amount of distress in the community about some of the proposals in the area of amalgamations which the education program in this legislation covers. Some of the amalgamations seem to be absurd. There seems to be no common interest in some of the proposed amalgamations of colleges or colleges and universities. In fact, it will be very awkward for them to amalgamate. I believe that in the first place there should be a reconsideration of some of the proposals for amalgamation. In the second place it should be realised that if there is an amalgamation the amalgamating organisations will incur additional costs, not less costs, in the first year or two following the amalgamation. It is important that people should be able to undertake a course with some confidence and with some expectation that they should be able to complete their course. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight I wish to speak mainly about the reintroduction of tuition fees for secondary and higher degrees, which is covered by one of the Bills before us. I feel that the criticisms which have been made by many people who have written to me should be considered very carefully by the Government. I realise that if fees of $1,000 a year were proposed I would not have had a tertiary education, I would not have been a lawyer and probably I would not be here today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am thinking about it. If the honourable senator would only shut up for a minute and listen he would probably realise that actually I am agreeing with him. But it is very difficult to agree with him when he is talking all the time. Probably there were no undertakings, arrangements or considerations at that time. But to change it now is not consistent with what I think is the proper interpretation of what the Minister said. Obviously since then there has been a change of policy and a determination to reintroduce fees. I regret that very much because it seems to me not to be consistent with the general policy which the Government was then expounding.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that we have reached agreement at long last. We have a situation in which the reintroduction of tuition fees will mean that students will have to pay $1,000 a year. It is true, as the Minister pointed out, that this is something like 20 per cent of the cost of tuition. It is a very substantial burden on people who, at that time in their lives, are expected to contribute to fees. As we know, no provision has yet been worked out for any loan arrangements whereby they could be expected to pay. The Canberra College of Advanced Education Students Association has estimated that 60 per cent of its students will be forced to discontinue or to defer their studies if these fees are introduced. I have received the same type of representation from many other groups. It would appear that the groups in the community which will be most affected by the introduction of the fees will be women, part time students, mature age students and students from low income families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know from many personal experiences and from friends of the difficulty students have found in recent years-partly because of the unemployment in the community and partly because of the lack of desire by employers to take on students for a short period-in obtaining part time or vacation work for a period. I believe that this situation adds to the difficulty which the imposition of fees will create. Students should be able to earn for a period during the year. I have seen sons of judges who cannot find work during vacation periods. It is amazing the number of people in this community who have now realised the difficulty which this imposes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator may say that it is a right. It is not a very important question, but it is very desirable that there should be an opportunity for students in the community to obtain work. If fees are imposed then it will become doubly difficult for them during this period. I also believe that the introduction of post-graduate and second degree fees will seriously affect the number of post-graduate students who will come forward in following years. This will discourage many of our most talented students from realising their potential and therefore from obtaining advance in research or professional training. I do not think we need so much the extra few thousand B.As or LL.Bs. We do need the people with specialised training. If one makes a comparison with other countries, one finds that Australia does not stand very well in relation to the numbers. I have here the 1975 figures of full time enrolment rates by aged groups for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries and I do not think they have changed greatly since that time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are very interesting figures in this table. For example, if one takes the 15-year-old to 19-year-old age group, Australia has 46.1 per cent engaged in education, Japan has 76.3 per cent and the United States of America has 72 per cent. It is very obvious where the strength of education is. In the 22-year-old to 24-year-old age group it is perhaps even more striking, because Australia has 5.5 per cent engaged in full time education, Japan has 14.5 per cent and the United States has 21.6 per cent. So one has a situation that the countries which seem to be drawing ahead economically are the countries in which people are continuing with their education for a considerable period.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not waste too much time with the honourable senator because he is in a straitjacket and I am sorry for him. I am rather more concerned to express the argument which hundreds of other people have expresses to me rather than to engage in chit chat across the chamber with the honourable senator. Australia's research effort is something that I think is terribly important and it is something that has lagged behind some Western countries. Our research could be seriously impaired by this lack of post-graduate students. The best post-graduate students I know of do something like 40 per cent of their basic research in various universities. It is important that they sould continue to do that. Tonight Senator MacGibbon said that it was very undesirable for students to take a year off work, earn money and then go back and recommence these things. I think that is correct. It is important that young brains should continue to do post-graduate work. One of the problems is that if they do not do that then the community at large will suffer. Individual students will otherwise have to use their education for financial reward. They do this and they obtain some personal satisfaction, but it is a fact that the individual already pays for higher education through hard work, financial privation and income which is forgone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The future employers of students use the student's education to the benefit of the corporations or public bodies concerned and society at large benefits from a better educated population and a diversity of interests and skills within the community. So it is, as we find in the argument, that the 'user should pay', as occasionally he does and the user which gains very much from the benefit of post-graduate work is often the financial corporation. The user which gets the person of great interest is not paying in this case. The fee here is being paid by the student. One of the other problems with the introduction of fees is that certain categories of post-graduate students will be discriminated against, for example, particularly those who do not have post-graduate awards and thus have to support themselves. Another case is the part time student. As we know, full-time staff will be exempt from these fees, but part time students must pay, although in some cases their salaries were decreased by a decision of the Academic Salaries Tribunal earlier this year. Some information on this subject was given by Professor Low, the Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University. In a letter which he wrote, and which is recorded in the House of Representatives Hansard of 22 October 1981 at page 2387, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The particular issues over tuition fees about which I have pressed my concern, but unsuccessfully, are:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) In view of the exemptions from tuition fees which have been agreed to, tuition fees for research students will fall upon those least able to pay for these, the relatively small minority who whilst accepted as suitable by the university are not the recipients of any exempted awards. This, I have to say, is a matter of considerable concern to us, particularly since there has been a reduction in the numbers of Commonwealth Postgraduate Awards since 1977 of 16 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that it is important that at this time there ought to be an increase in post-graduate awards. If fees like this are going to be imposed on students then at the same time the number of awards should be increased so that students of great ability will gain the benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to another question. What will be the income gain from the imposition of fees? They will yield a minimal revenue. The Federation of Australian University Staff Associations, known as FAUSA, has estimated that revenue in 1982 will be about $3m before deducting administrative costs. The Government has said that it believes in the ultimate about $20m a year will be netted from fees in, I think, the third year of the scheme. But FAUSA has claimed that unless fees double, or higher degree students double in number, such a figure seems to be rather optimistic. The problem therefore, is that we will gain very little from the imposition of fees and at the same time we will probably cause very considerable hardship for a number of people. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned that this is not a case in which we can expect the user pays principle to produce very much benefit for Australia. In a recent publication FAUSA said:</PARA>
<PARA> Who are the users of specialist education at advanced levels? Certainly, the individual student will use his/her education for financial reward and/or personal satisfaction. But the individual already pays for higher education through hard work, financial deprivation and income foregone. The future employers of students use their education to the benefit of the corporations or public bodies concerned, and society at large benefits from a better-educated population and a diversity of interests and skills within the community. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems therefore that the proposed imposition of fees will not mean that the actual user will pay. It also has been argued that one of the problems is that there is some discrimination in this proposal to impose fees. It is said that there is discrimination against universities compared with the colleges of advanced education. In another publication FAUSA said:</PARA>
<PARA> Almost 13 per cent of students at universities are engaged in study for Masters or Ph.D. degrees. Less than 1.5 per cent of students in Colleges are studying at this level. Colleges (excluding Central Institutes of Technology) have a high level of students enrolled in postgraduate diplomas-almost 37 per cent compared with less than 4 per cent in universities. But these diploma students have been exempted from the fees. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, it is suggested that there is some unfairness and some discrimination in the way in which these fees will be imposed on students. We know that many of the Australian universities, including the University of Adelaide, Sydney University and the Griffith University, are unwilling to collect fees. If the fee proposal takes effect, the Government will face the embarrassing prospect of open defiance on the part of some of the more august institutions in this country. About 20 per cent of Australia's research is performed in universities, the major areas being social sciences, agriculture, drug and medical research, veterinary science, engineering, radio astronomy and the earth sciences. Altogether post-graduate students do approximately 40 per cent of the basic research in universities. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe there is a problem because we have in this country a need for much greater post-graduate work. We must, to ensure Australia's future, make certain that we have more people doing post-graduate work. Recently I wrote to the Prime Minister following the receipt of correspondence which I know was sent to him by representatives of the universities. I also had discussions with the Vice-Chancellor of the La Trobe University who pointed out to me that one of the problems was the lack of consultation about the proposed imposition of fees, that in fact if more money was desired to be obtained by universities there ought to have been better consultation to find the best proposal to be introduced to obtain those funds. He pointed out to me that the university had not been consulted as to what were the greatest priorities for a reduction in expenditure. He said that if the university had been consulted the imposition of fees on post-graduate students would certainly not be one of the high priorities. I therefore suggested that the universities be given the opportunity to suggest the alternate areas where expenditure might be saved before the decision was implemented. Unfortunately, the decision has been implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, as has been pointed out by people who have written to me-namely, Professor David Allan from Monash University and Mary Hiscock from the University of Melbourne whose courses will probably cease in 1982-students will continue in the courses they are in but people will not be able to come into the courses. The courses related to international economic finance and matters which could be of great value to the economic community in this country. I believe it is unfortunate that this decision has been taken. In fact, this is one decision that ought to be reconsidered at this time because it means that the chances of Australia becoming the Sweden of the south, of becoming a country with a people of considerable training who will be able to assist here and in Asia in developing our trade may partially be lost. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the Government has a limited amount of funds. In regard to education it has had to cut back in various areas. There are some restrictions. There are reductions in the number of teachers in other areas which have called for some changes. But I do believe that changes in some of the areas have been unwise. I hope that whatever happens following the carriage of this legislation the Government will not stop looking clearly at this subject in the hope that there may be changes in the future and an important increase in post-graduate awards in future. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the legislation for the reasons I have given. I do not believe it is a case for this Senate to change the Budget or money Bills of this Government. But I believe the Government should pay close attention to the criticisms which have been made in this chamber and I hope it will do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill and the other education Bills we are discussing in a cognate debate tonight range over a number of important items in relation to tertiary and secondary education in Australia. These Bills are of the utmost importance and import. Therefore, I think it is necessary to take a wider view than many speakers have so far taken in this debate. I want to raise the general issue of funding of education in the economic life of this country. Unfortunately, the public discussion of the economy that generally takes place in the media and elsewhere tends, probably of some necessity, to look at the next quarter, the next year or, at the most, the next two to three years until the next election. Implicit in that type of debate is that the economy today is basically the same as the economy of yesterday. However, over the years, almost imperceptibly, our economy has changed in its fundamentals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If I may elaborate on that issue, in 1947, 54.7 per cent of the working population in Australia was involved in the production of goods. In 1981 this had fallen to 36 per cent. Employment in the service sector-I define the service sector in the economic sense, and it is fairly broad-had increased by a staggering approximately 300 per cent. Likewise in the 30 years in that period since the War to the 1978-79 financial year, which is the bench-mark for which I could obtain figures, it is interesting to note the following facts: The service sector had risen to be the dominant contributor to the national wealth with 37.9 per cent of the gross national product compared with 4.5 per cent from mining, 7.3 per cent from primary industry and 19.4 per cent from manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is about time that we started to reorient our thinking in this country to find the basis of our economy. The point of raising these particular issues is that tonight we are dealing with education and educational funding. This leads directly to the notion of human capital. The definition of human capital is normally taken to be the skills, dexterity and knowledge of the population. I intend to use that type of definition. My party contends very strongly that the competence of management and skills in the work force, particularly those engaged in the service sector, determines the ability of enterprises to obtain and utilise our essential resources. In other words, our capital enterprise, our materials and our technology are only as good as our skilled manpower. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept of human capital, of course, is not new. Unfortunately, as we have already seen in this place in the last couple of weeks, it tends to be perverted in debate. I think probably the person who has done most in structuring this economic theory is Edward Denison. In his words and documents which have been produced in relation to the American economy I think we find a fundamental linkage with educational expenditure. It is his contention that two-thirds of the growth in the American economy is directly attributable to educational expenditure. Let me repeat that contention: Two-thirds of the growth in the American economy is directly attributable to educational expenditure. I believe that his calculations could be easily extrapolated to the Australian economy without too much dent in those percentages. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not to deny that physical capital plays a dominant role in a country's economics. What I am saying, however, is that the growth in economies such as the Australian, American, Japanese and West German is based very strongly on the growth of the new technological and biotechnological enterprises. In other words, it is in the expansion of knowledge, skills, imagination, ideas and insights of our population that we find the economic answer to the problems which confront us. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, for the past three decades we have found that while federal governments have been quite willing to contribute directly to the growth of a variety of industries in this country, such as car manufacturing, boat building, primary industry and mining industries of one kind or another, very little attention has been paid to the economic viability of investment in education. It is not fortuitous that the major growth industry in America, the computer industry, or the growing industry in biotechnology, are all based on universities. In other words, by putting money into our higher education we can reap extraordinary economic benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been expending money on education in this country. Indeed, in the years following 1972 and the advent of the Australian Labor Party Government we saw a rapid increase in those expenditures. I believe that unfortunately for that particular Government the educational sector of which I was a part failed to recognise that type of shift. While some of us may have recognised it, I felt that we did too little to promote what was a useful and a thoroughly respectable economic trend in Labor Party expenditure, at least in the early 1972-73 period. Unfortunately, in the last Hayden Budget there was a destruction of the triennium funding which has bedevilled this country ever since. But I do not think that that should necessarily take away from the innovative approach to educational funding which was taken at that time. I believe it is a pity that that type of trend, once it was started, was stopped so prematurely. </PARA>
<PARA> The points, then, seem to me to be relatively clear. If we are to have in this country a technological society and if we are to follow the inbuilt logic of the economic changes which have occurred from 1947 to 1981, then instead of looking for some pie in the sky of reindustrialisation or whatever it is that we are on about in this country when we are trying to cut educational funding, what we ought to be about, quite deliberately, is moving larger and larger proportions of our gross national product into education. We know that we can get a much better spin-off if we put money into education than if we put money into almost any other area that one can think of. That was not the case in the past. It was not the case in industrialisation. It is the case now because we are in a different ball game. </PARA>
<PARA> I have discovered since coming to this place that it has great feelings for the past but, unfortunately, its view of the future seems to be almost myopic. When we go past requesting pencil and paper from members of some of our departments which supply honourable senators with the wherewithal their eyes glass over. They are very heavy on pens and rubbers and paper, but when we start talking about some type of computerisation to enable the type of work that we have to do to be done, we get grunts. What is needed is at least some far sighted people to start looking at where we are in the economic race and where we are going. Without any view of the future and without any view of our economy we are doomed to become a second rate country. The types of things that our Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has been talking about and promoting in terms of North-South dialogue are so much hot air because if we do not have the wherewithal we certainly cannot provide it for anybody else. Therefore, we believe that it is of vital importance that the particular sector of the tertiary institutions that can most readily and most directly assist in the growth of those particular industries should be not only exempt from imposts by government but also should be funded deliberately in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> In the speech that I made in this place a week or so ago I was able to point to department after department that had had funds slashed, that had had major research projects of enormous economic value slashed for the want of a measly $20,000, $30,000 or $40,000. I was able to document what I was saying. The information has not been denied by anybody. I have in writing from heads of the departments concerned information to the effect that some post-graduates will not be re-enrolling or coming back into the system because of these cuts in funding. Departments of Japanese studies at the Queensland University and the Australian National University are to be destroyed. Of all departments, Japanese studies is the one that we should be looking at and promoting. But that entire post-graduate sector will be chopped off. The heads of the departments have said that; I have not said it. The heads of departments have said it in writing. They were willing to go that far. In other words, we will not even bother to learn the lanaguage of one of the leading export-import countries in relation to the Australian economy. We will not even bother to train our people so that they can understand the operations of that country. We will destroy those valuable departments, and they are arts departments. Arts does have an economic value, and so do all the other types of departments that we have in our universities. Those departments do have economic value for this country. It is only those with a very narrow view who see those types of departments and others as not contributing to the growth and the life of this country and to what we can offer the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Siddons has proposed a private members Bill through which we hope at some stage to be able to debate ideas such as participatory democracy in our workforce, incentive rewards, flexible scheduling and other types of opportunities to enable our industry base to operate. These types of things are talked about freely. Indeed, even the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) has suggested on one or two occasions that he is in favour of such innovative approaches to industry. That idea at least has got off the ground even if it is still only in the talking stage. </PARA>
<PARA> When we come to trying to put the argument that educational expenditure is not a cost but is a direct investment, as is any other investment in any other area of the economy, we are met with glazed eyes. When we get to this proposal in these Bills, what do we find? We find that we are seeking to penalise a group of people who, in fact, have been selected for and who have reached the top of our expensive and very essential educational process. These are the very people on whom this economy depends for its future development. </PARA>
<PARA> I put aside completely-I will not even bother to debate- the proposition that those people ought to contribute little bits and pieces to their education. To me, that seems to be such a small-minded, mean and piddling-if it is not unparliamentary to use that word-reason for imposing fees as not to warrant debate. For goodness sake, we are not talking here about 3,000 people or whether we will add an extra $1,000 to their fees. We are not talking about that at all! We are talking about the economic health of this country. We are not saying that this little user should pay or that that little user should pay. How about growing up and getting down to some fundamental debates on education and getting away from this utter rubbish. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about very real issues in this country. We are talking about funding our research effort. What is wrong with putting some money into the education of these people who will make money. I ask a free enterprise government: 'What is wrong with making money?' Yes, those people are going to do that, and work hard in doing it. The labourer is worthy of his hire. Is the Government saying that that doctor, that solicitor or that technologist should not be paid those wages? Presumably it is not saying that. Those people are worthy of their hire and they should be paid because they are contributing and should be rewarded for making an input. Those people put in far more than they take out. If education did not work that way, we would not fund schools. If it did not work that way, we would not put one penny into universities. The community gets more out of than it puts into education. It is an absurd economic proposition to say anything different. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not had one real argument put forward tonight in this Senate to justify these despicable suggestions. I am running out of adjectives to describe how mean the arguments have been in relation to this matter. They have not been far-sighted. The Government has not been looking at economic growth. It has not looked at the matter in a global sense. It has not been trying to assess what we really need to assess in this country. I say: 'Yes, let us fund these people'. What is wrong with that? They will put in and put in handsomely and we will all get the benefit from that. If we do not support those people, those people will not remain in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Several weeks ago, when I made my last speech on education, I made the self-same points. They have not been denied by any honourable senator on the Government side. I said that we are losing people at an enormous rate from this country. Why? If we can get top quality people, people who rise above the herd-I put it in that very colloquial form which Liberal senators may appreciate in the elitist view of education-doing the types of things the Government talks about, that is all right. There does not seem to me to be anything wrong in people actually displaying some talent, developing that talent and moving further and further with that talent. Indeed, if that is the case, it seems to me that only one conclusion can be drawn: If we do not provide the base in this country for those people to do productive far-reaching research, they will leave. </PARA>
<PARA> Last time I spoke, I documented one case in the biotechnology area. One such person in the University of Queensland is accepted as the world's leading authority on the subject of oxygen growth in the biomicrobe industry. As I suggested before, that forms the base of 6 per cent of Japan's gross national product at this time and is growing faster than the computer industry. We have the world authority here in Australia. He has put it in writing to me that at this stage he has turned down all offers. But he has acknowledged that the world needs him so he does not feel he can go on much longer researching here. If honourable members wish to read his letter I am quite happy to provide it. It is his cry from the heart which says that we have this talent in this country which we have developed here. That talent should be taken further. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that, given the rate of inflation, we have merely kept pace with funding for tertiary institutions with the funds that we put in last year is not a mode for congratulation but is a mode for wonderment, for scratching our heads and for asking: 'What on earth are we about?' All right, we can talk about putting money into a variety of industries and providing superphosphate bounties. Those matters and the provision of funds for other important areas are talked about at great length. But the tertiary industry and the provision of skilled manpower are neglected. They are neglected badly. I return to the fee issue, not because it is the major issue in these Bills, but because it is symptomatic of the approach taken to educational funding at the tertiary level in this society. What do we know about the vast bulk of those people who will end up paying? The rather nice aspect here is that, while the Government's purpose was to impose fees on students studying for second and higher degrees, now the Government is congratulating itself on the fact that only 3,500 people will pay fees. One wonders why it bothered with the exercise in the first place if it is now going to give us a vast number of exceptions. </PARA>

I am sure that Senator Teague with his own educational background would not deny that we are desperately in need of highly trained personnel in this country. We need to retain and update the knowledge of the people who already have qualifications. Of course, an enormous number of platitudes is mouthed about this subject from time to time. But I will quote one of these nice platitudes mouthed by the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) on 2 October when opening the Technology Park in Adelaide. That was time for a speech. The Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My concern is that while Australia has an impressive record of scientific and technological invention-</PARA>
<PARA>Let us pat people on the back-</PARA>
<PARA>we have not performed nearly as well in the commercial exploitation of this talent. All too often promising inventions and ideas have been abandoned or lost overseas for want of experienced entrepreneurs and institional support . . . The tertiary institutions with their research facilities and intellectual force represent a resource for innovation which few industries can match. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree wholeheartedly. All that the Australian Democrats are asking is that we put money where those platitudes are. The money has to be forthcoming and in large amounts. Without such a movement this country will not progress in the industries that are leading the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the point I made at the beginning-that I am talking not about the base of the economy but about the growth of the economy. That is why this matter is so current. That is where the action is taking place. If we want our economy to stand still, to stagnate, we will not spend money on education. We will slowly slide backwards. If we want real growth in this country we have to foster the real growth industries and pay for it. We have to pay those who give them support. It is as simple, clear and direct as that. If we look overseas we see precisely what has happened. Funds flow through to university research institutes. That is done more and more frequently because that is where the support comes from. </PARA>
<PARA> People, upon looking at the comparative costs for students in Australia and other countries, will say that our students are not badly off. I agree that they are not, in terms of fees, compared to students in many of the countries that I have been talking about, but I do not see that as an excuse for Australia to go backwards. What is not acknowledged is that the vast bulk of people who support the research base in the United States and Japan do not operate on a fee basis. They operate as people who, in our terminology, are tutors and who, in the American technology, are instructors. In other words, they carry both their teaching load and their research. They work in the academic community. In our universities, the people that we are cutting off everywhere are our tutors. In other words, we are getting rid of the new blood. I take Senator Teague's point, raised this afternoon in the course of making a personal explanation, that the whole problem of our universities being able to attract new blood in a steady state situation is one which must exercise everybody's concern. But there is a way out. It is to look at our universities as representing a direct investment in our country's economic future, to stop looking at education as though it were a cost. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or even a privilege. I have tonight stayed away from the whole range of arguments which deal with individuals and their entitlements within the community because I wish to make one point only in what I have been saying. I refer to the economic advantages to this country not merely of failing to impose fees but even of paying people to undertake higher degrees. I would like to give such people a nice wage because, after all, in some fields, such as engineering, at the moment it is very difficult to keep people because one has to live on or below that poverty line that we call our Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme or post-graduate awards. It is expected to be good for the soul. It may be good for the soul but it is rotten for the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Time and time again we thought there was growing up within this community a consensus in relation to our tertiary institutions and funding. Indeed, Liberal Party Ministers reiterated that theme from time to time during the last year. Senator Carrick, in many of the speeches that he made while Minister for Education, repeated that point. We were moving towards a consensus that we ought to be looking at our universities and higher education institutions as a source of skilled manpower; that we ought to be supporting them and considering them from that point of view. The statement of the Minister for Science and Technology which I quoted earlier reiterated that kind of view. Unfortunately, we now find that growing consensus blown apart. We are back to the knockdown bloody battle in regard to education in this country. Once again we are engaged in a brawl concerning where we are supposed to be going in our tertiary institutions when every party in this chamber and in the other place ought to be working together to support wholeheartedly our university students at the second and higher degree levels so that in 10, 15 or 20 years this country will have a skilled, intelligent and innovative work force that is in the forefront of technological development and will carry forward with it this country. We will be living off what it does. Again I ask the Government to reconsider this proposal because it constitutes economic madness. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are debating five education Bills. It is significant that they cover the whole range of primary, secondary and tertiary education. The States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill is perhaps the one that has been debated most so far. It provides grants for tertiary education in the States and in the Northern Territory. Two other Bills also deal with tertiary education. The Australian National University Amendment (No. 2) Bill provides, amongst other things, for fees to be charged at that university. Similarly, the Canberra College of Advanced Education Amendment Bill provides for fees to be charged at that college. The States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill provides for payments to the States and to the Northern Territory in the primary and secondary education fields. Finally, the Non-Government Schools (Loans Guarantee) Amendment Bill does exactly what its title suggests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to dwell on three of the Bills in particular. I refer to the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill, the Bill which relates to the Australian National University and that which relates to the Canberra College of Advanced Education. The reason I intend to dwell upon them is that they will produce a revolutionary change in tertiary education in Australia, namely, the reintroduction of tuition fees at universities and colleges of advanced education. I am not surprised that the Government proposes to introduce tuition fees at this level because in recent times it has done its utmost to undo all of the progressive initiatives of the Labor Government in the field of education. It was only a matter of time before the Government made this assault on students; indeed on those students who, as has been pointed out, should be educated well so that Australia can provide for its future. The assault has been made in this area. During the debates tonight it will be recalled easily that it was a Labor Government that in 1974 abolished tuition fees at universities and colleges of advanced education. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember that in my time as an undergraduate student we had a very narrow view of what we should be doing about fees at universities and colleges of advanced education. In those days most of the arguments centred upon universities because colleges of advanced education were not all that numerous. The argument advanced then by students, especially part time students-students who were trying to update their skills or to gain extra skills in order, perhaps, to obtain a better position-was that perhaps they could make sure that the fees they were paying were deductible for taxation purposes. That was a great argument in those times. </PARA>
<PARA> It took a far-reaching government and perhaps one particular person in that government to say: 'No, that is not the answer. The answer is to abolish fees at that level'. I remember that argument being put forward before the 1972 general election, perhaps in the late 1960s and early 1970s. We said that when we came to power we would abolish those fees. A lot of people believed that it could not be done. They said that the cost would be too high. But the fees were abolished in 1974 and we must remember that when we debate these Bills tonight. That was a great leap forward in the tertiary education field. </PARA>
<PARA> I will return to the fees issue later. That was not the only progressive part of the policy which the Labor Government implemented in 1974. In 1974 the Government assumed full Federal responsibility for the funding of tertiary education. A lot of honourable senators would not remember that prior to 1974 Federal funding for that level of education was not high. However, in 1974 the Federal Government assumed full responsibility for that funding. As I have already mentioned, as well as that there was the abolition of tuition fees. Included in that package of policies implemented in 1974 was the introduction of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme to provide students with finance to enable them to undertake a university or college of advanced education course. </PARA>
<PARA> All three of those measures are under attack. It is significant that they are all under attack this year. I will refresh the memories of honourable senators on the Review of Commonwealth Functions, which presented its report earlier this year. It is significant that that report was brought forward after the 1980 general election but before the composition of the Senate changed. It was certainly brought forward then so that a lot of the recommendations made in that report could be implemented at that stage. When we look at the report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions or, as it is normally called, the razor gang-I actually heard a Minister use that term today; its use is becoming very widespread-we see that one of the matters listed is that student loans are to be introduced. I remind honourable senators that the report states this:</PARA>
<PARA> A loan scheme, administered by tertiary institutions, to be introduced from the beginning of 1982 as a supplement to TEAS. </PARA>
<PARA>It is important that we look at that in relation to the Bills we have before us tonight. I remember well, back in 1977, asking the then Minister for Education a question in relation to student loans. Amongst other things, I said this:</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the increasing concern at suggestions that the Butcher report will result in student loans replacing rather than supplementing tertiary education assistance scheme assistance . . . will the Minister ensure that additional time is allowed for further submissions . . . to be presented for consideration?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Carrick, as the Minister for Education, among other things in his answer stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I make it clear and I repeat that this inquiry is an inquiry into student loans as a supplement to-as an addition to-and not a replacement of student allowances. It is utterly clear that that is so. </PARA>
<PARA>When it was mentioned back in 1977 that student loans were to be supplements to TEAS allowances, I took 'supplement' to be defined as something additional to, something that was to be added to the TEAS allowance. Indeed, the Minister said in his reply that it would be in addition to the TEAS allowance. But what has happened with the Review of Commonwealth Functions? It states this:</PARA>
<PARA> Changes to TEAS rates to be considered in the light of this additional form of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that the loans scheme is definitely to be used to keep the level of the TEAS allowance down. Back in 1977 Senator Carrick, as Minister for Education, in relation to student loans also stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government . . . would regard student loans, if adopted, as being not a replacement for but a supplement to allowances. </PARA>
<PARA>We could have a nice little debate on semantics about what is a supplement and whether the loans will be in addition to the allowance. But back in 1977, when we were talking about student loans, it was definitely stated that the loans would be in addition to the TEAS allowance which was to be provided. The implication of what is happening now is that the TEAS allowance will be affected. In fact, the TEAS allowance is being affected at present, as we were shown during the recent Estimates committees' hearings. But I mention something else about TEAS. One of the things mentioned in the Review of Commonwealth Functions report which sticks in my mind as something which is to be changed is this:</PARA>
<PARA> De facto relations no longer to be an acceptable qualification for independent status. </PARA>
<PARA>At the moment certain people, if they are in a de facto relationship and if they have been in that relationship for some time and can show that it is a permanent relationship, qualify as married people and gain independent status. But now a whole lot of moralising old fuddy-duddies, who put together this report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, are saying: 'You cannot be in a de facto relationship and get the TEAS allowance any more. Get married or lose out on your TEAS allowance'. It is interesting to note that the number of recipients of the maximum TEAS allowance is decreasing. A deliberate attempt appears to be being made to make the means test so stringent that TEAS payments will be depressed. Perhaps I can outline what I mean. During the Estimates committee hearings we were told that this year, 1981, 50,000 students are expected to receive the full TEAS allowance. Next year it is estimated that 48,000 will receive the full allowance. There has been a decrease in every category, in the at home, away from home and independent categories. It is quite understandable that if the means test level is not increased the number of people receiving the full allowance will decrease. </PARA>
<PARA> The Review of Commonwealth Functions report mentions the rationalisation of colleges of advanced education. That is something which has been mentioned in relation to these Bills tonight. It seems to me that 'rationalisation' is quite an in word. If someone wants to cut back on something or to renege on an undertaking, what does he do? He rationalises. What we are doing in rationalising the colleges of advanced education is cutting back. Perhaps we are not reneging on an undertaking because no undertaking was given. But we certainly are cutting back. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall outline one aspect of the razor gang's rationalisation which particularly affects the State I represent. This aspect of the razor gang's rationalisation has effectively robbed north Queensland of an educational institution. I refer to the Townsville College of Advanced Education. In contrast with some other States, there is rapid expansion in Queensland. In north Queensland there is an area with tremendous potential for significant short term and long term expansion. What has been done in Townsville in relation to education? There has been an attempt to force Townsville's College of Advanced Education to amalgamate with the James Cook University. An honourable senator suggested in the debate tonight, it is either a type of shotgun approach or a blackmail approach-I forget the exact words. What will happen is that the Townsville CAE will disappear. It will be merged into James Cook University. Instead of having three tertiary institutions in North Queensland-James Cook University, Townsville CAE and the TAFE college at Townsville-we will have two institutions. Certain people at James Cook University welcome this. </PARA>
<PARA> James Cook University is a high cost university with a very high proportion of higher degree students. The 1980 figures show that 17.3 per cent of the students at James Cook are pursuing higher degrees. This is the highest percentage for any university in Australia. It contrasts with 12.6 per cent of students pursuing higher degrees at all other Australian universities. There is nothing wrong with this. James Cook University is a specialist university. Because it has such a high proportion of higher degree students, it is regarded as a high cost university. If the college of advanced education students come into the James Cook University, the cost per student will be lowered and this may be a good thing on paper for the James Cook University. It will not stand out as much as it does as a high cost university. Of course, the people in the colleges of advanced education are not happy about this situation; neither are the people of north Queensland because they have been robbed of a significant institution. From the conversations I have had with people in Townsville, I can see that it is a matter that the electors of Herbert will remember and register their views about at the next election. This Government can kiss Herbert goodbye as one of the electorates it holds. Herbert will be lost not only because of this move against the Townsville College of Advanced Education but also because of a number of other things. This move will play a significant part of the loss of Herbert. The amendment which was moved by one of my colleagues mentioned, in part this matter. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The University College of Advanced Education amalgamations proposed in Newcastle, Armidale, Wollongong and Townsville should not proceed until arrangements satisfactory to both parties to the amalgamation have emerged. </PARA>
<PARA>We know that the amalgamation will probably go ahead in Townsville because if it does not the CAE will not receive any Commonwealth funding. The State Government will believe that it will not be able to fund it; so the amalgamation will probably go ahead. That part of the amendment which my colleague moved is quite significant. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to return to the tertiary tuition fees issue. The Opposition opposes this as it would mark a significant reversal of one of the many initiatives of the Labor Government in the field of education. We oppose it on educational grounds. We also oppose it because the Government does not have a mandate for this proposal and it is a direct abrogation of an undertaking of the Minister for Education (Mr Fife). In the Liberal Party policy speech issued last year, no mention was made of the introduction of tertiary tuition fees. It was not even mentioned in the speech that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) issued or in the papers associated with that speech. I think two supplementary groups of papers were associated with it. There was not any mention of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The obvious implication was that fees would not be introduced. If one were going to introduce fees, one would have mentioned it. As fees were not mentioned, one implied that they were not going to be introduced. The matter of fees has been raised in this place a number of times since this Government came to power. In 1977 Senator Lajovic asked a question of the then Minister for Education, Senator Carrick. Senator Lajovic asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Can the Minister for Education, in view of certain recent speculation, inform the Senate whether the Government has any intention of introducing fees for foreign students attending Australian universities, or for students undertaking second degrees?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Carrick in his reply, amongst other things, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Rumours are running in certain quarters that the Government intends to reimpose fees for foreign students. There is no truth in that at all. </PARA>
<PARA>We all know what happened. In 1980 foreign students in Australia were paying fees. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we are not contemplating what has apparently been rumoured. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> There has never been, and will not be, an intention to reimpose fees in relation to the primary or co-ordinated degree areas. Nor do we intend to reimpose fees in regard to second degrees. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that there has never been and there will not be a reimposition of fees. There certainly has been. Senator Lajovic thought in 1979-two years later-that he had better update his information; so he asked a similar question. He asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Can the Minister for Education inform the Senate about the current speculation that fees for tertiary education courses might be reintroduced in 1980?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Carrick, amongst other things, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . on Tuesday night I informed the media-and through them the people of Australia-that the Government had decided that its policy which it had stated in the past would be continued, that is, that there would be no reintroduction of fees at any level of tertiary education. I repeat that. </PARA>
<PARA>Later he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . our policies have been stated and are clear. . . There will be no reintroduction of tertiary fees. </PARA>
<PARA>Granted, that was in 1979. But it is only two years ago that Senator Carrick gave a firm undertaking that fees would not be reintroduced. If we do not want to take those undertakings of Senator Carrick, let us go to the last election campaign. I have a document which is the most telling of all in relation to this Government saying that there would not be any tertiary tuition fees imposed for higher education. I can remember well what happened on 8 October last year. I was campaigning in central western Queensland. Many other honourable senators would have been campaigning and I suppose all the members of the House of Representatives were doing so. The Minister for Education, Mr Fife-he is still the Minister for Education-said:</PARA>
<PARA> There continues to be speculation about Government plans to re-introduce fees for tertiary education. I have given an assurance publicly and I repeat that assurance, that no proposals are being considered by the Government for the possible re-introduction of tertiary fees. </PARA>
<PARA>We can twist that around all we like, I suppose, by saying that no proposals were being considered then but that the proposals were considered after the Government was re-elected. Any government with any decency, if it wanted to reintroduce fees, would have said so then. One would have expected that if the Government had any decency it would have given an indication that it was going to reintroduce fees less than 12 months after that statement was made. One would have thought that the Government would have waited until the next election campaign, told the people that it was going to reintroduce fees at the tertiary level and let the people give it a mandate or otherwise. The Government does not have a mandate to re-introduce those fees. Because it does not have a mandate, there is no reason at all why we on this side of the chamber should not oppose the reintroduction of tertiary education fees. It is a clear breaking of an election promise. How else can one accept Mr Fife's statement?</PARA>
<PARA> How much does this Government expect to raise by reintroducing fees at the tertiary level? To be honest, I am not too sure. Firstly we were told that it might be $8m a year and then we were told that it might be $4m this financial year. Let us suppose the fees will raise $4m this financial year. How does this stand up against the total appropriation for colleges, TAFE institutions and universities throughout Australia? When the Appropriation Bills are passed, over $1,800m will be appropriated for this area of education throughout Australia. In fact, it is a little more than $1,800m but I have rounded the figure. Yet, the Government seeks to get $4m from the reintroduction of certain fees. It is not a word that I use but it is a word that Senator Macklin used about half an hour ago; he said it is a piddling amount. It certainly is but it is not a piddling amount for those students who will be required to pay the fees. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the Senate rose in June, we were under all sorts of pressures because the Prime Minister was trying to get as much legislation passed as he could before the composition of the Senate changed. I was amazed then when I heard Senator Baume say-I have not checked his statement because it is so indelibly imprinted on my mind-something to the effect that there would not be any reduction in the number of people going forward for second degrees or higher degrees because, if they do not have a scholarship or some other means of paying their fees, they will be able to get a loan. What a nice state of affairs that would be. How heavy would loans of that amount weigh on post-graduate students. We are going to give them all that worry about the loans hanging over their heads, as Senator Baume suggested might happen, all for $4m a year. Perhaps, as was suggested by way of interjection during Senator Macklin's speech, it could be $20m in three years' time. If it is $20m, how does that compare with a total outlay for education of $1,800m?</PARA>
<PARA> Why would the Government bother to break an election promise for $4m or perhaps for $20m in three years' time? I suggest that clearly this Government has in mind the reintroduction of fees at lower levels. This seems to me to be the thin end of the wedge. If we introduce fees for higher degrees and second degrees, it is probably the thin end of the wedge so we can have fees at the lower levels. One might say that the Government has not said anything about that; it has given us undertakings that it will not bring in fees at those levels. But, previously, we have had undertakings that there would not be fees for overseas students and we have had undertakings that there would not be fees for second and higher degrees. What good is an undertaking at this stage that we will not have fees for primary degrees? It seems to me that this is just laying the groundwork for getting fees and getting much more return from that greater body of students who are doing their primary degree. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many reasons for opposing tertiary fees. I want to raise just one other issue in the time I have left. If fees are charged for second and higher degrees, we will discourage people in Australia from retraining and updating their skills. In a rapidly changing society, it is imperative that we allow people to have the opportunity to update their skills but some will not be able to do this if there are tuition fees for second or higher degrees. Amongst these, in particular, would be married women who have been out of the work force for perhaps 10 or 20 years. If those women once more wish to take their place in the Australian work force and want to update their skills by going to a university or college of advanced education to upgrade or retrain in the course in which 10 or 20 years ago they obtained a primary degree-the fees would be a barrier to them. These people in particular will be disadvantaged if fees are charged for second and higher degrees. </PARA>
<PARA> This evening, members of the Opposition will be outlining their clear objection to the reintroduction of tuition fees at the tertiary level. The Opposition has a non-negotiable stance on this issue. We have made it clear that we will use all the forms of the Parliament that we can to protect students in Australia from a misleading, promise-breaking government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The five Bills before the Senate, which have been debated throughout the afternoon and now during the evening, include two major Bills that come up at this time of the year to distribute money for tertiary and secondary education from the Commonwealth to the States. There are three other Bills, two of which give power to the Australian National University and the Canberra College of Advanced Education to raise tuition fees. The other Bill, the Loan Guarantee Bill, affects secondary education. From what I have heard of the debate so far, there has been a concentration upon what are seen to be cuts in the Commonwealth's provision for education generally in Australia. This emphasis upon cuts has grossly distorted the real facts of the Commonwealth's provision for education and I believe that it has distorted this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What are the facts of the matter in regard to these Bills? With regard to tertiary education in Australia, there is for this year a real increase in the amount of money the Commonwealth is distributing in respect of the total of moneys going to universities, colleges of advanced education and the technical and further education area. There is a real increase in this year's provision for tertiary education in Australia. This is set out very clearly on the first page of the expert report on which these Bills are based. The increase, adjusted for real terms, is from $1,865.3m to a figure for this year of $1,867.55m. It is an increase of only $2m in that vast amount. I prefer to call it a plateauing, that is, the same level of increase. It is certainly not a cut and certainly is not a drastic cut which has been the premise on which most of the speeches we have heard in the Senate today have been based. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the vast increase in public resources for education through the 1970s, the Commonwealth Government now continues to maintain that high level and there is not the same call for further increases given the vast turnaround in recent years. This has been directly referred to by Professor Karmel, the Chairman of the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission, in a speech he gave-the first Archer Memorial Lecture-in June of this year. I wish to refer to a number of tables in that speech. In due course I will seek to incorporate in Hansard three of the tables from Professor Karmel's speech. One of them sets out the proportion of gross domestic product which has been committed to education in Australia. Back in the mid-1950s, 2.35 per cent of GDP went towards education in Australia. That grew to 2.98 per cent buy the late 1950s and it is now double that. The present figure is 6 per cent of GDP. The table sets out a steady progression in the proportion of gross domestic product expended on education in this country. In the last four years, that figure has been steady at about 6 per cent. That is not only Government spending; it is a fair estimate of all resources devoted to education in Australia. The table, as it will appear in Hansard, clearly sets this out. The sources for Professor Karmel's figures are Melbourne Studies in Education, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard people lamenting the so-called cuts in education funding. The speech today from the Australian Democrats' spokesman, which was more appropriate to the situation 15 years ago, referred to the urgent need to increase our national investment in education. As honourable senators know, I have constantly urged the Government parties to allocate a high and increasing proportion of our resources to education. The level of expenditure has been maintained for the last four years at about 6 per cent, which is about three times what it was at the beginning of the 1950s. </PARA>
<PARA> The second table of Professor Karmel sets out the proportion of 15 to 19-year olds engaged in full time study. In the mid-1950s that proportion was 18.2 per cent. Five years later it had grown by another 10 per cent. By the mid-1960s it was 33 per cent. Today it is more than 47 per cent. There has been a steady progression over those 25 years from 18 per cent to 28 per cent, 33 per cent, 42 per cent and 47 per cent in the census of 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> The third table, which has been talked about in a number of speeches tonight, contains a comparison of involvement rates for tertiary students in Australia with other countries. In the list, which is taken directly from the 1981 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development figures, Australia is mid-way in the ranking. It is true that the United States of America, Japan and Canada have much larger proportions of students involved in tertiary studies. However, Australia is a middle ranking country. We outrank Norway, Sweden, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The figures that have been cited from the Australian Union of Students may be partly comparable with these figures. I seek leave to incorporate the three tables in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why has there been a 0.4 per cent decrease in funds for universities and colleges of advanced education and a 6 per cent increase in real terms in funds for the tertiary and further education sector? Overall, that balances out the $2m increase I spoke of earlier. Why is there such restraint or, as I put it, plateauing? Why is there the same level of commitment to tertiary education? I believe that it is because in 1975, 1977 and 1980 the Liberal and National Country parties were elected on the basis of economic responsibility and a program of spending restraint. This led directly, after the 1980 elections, to the Review of Commonwealth Functions, which in turn led to the famous razor gang conclusions. That report led to an overall 1.5 per cent decrease in Government spending. I know that a lot of newspaper editorials regarded that as too small a decrease or cutback in the level of Government funding. However, what was the cut or the decrease in respect of universities and CAEs? It was just 0.4 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, the back bench committee concerned with these matters was not consulted. The Cabinet sub-committee made Cabinet decisions. I am referring to the basic policy, endorsed by the people of Australia in three elections, that the Liberal and National Country parties would exercise economic restraint. I happen to be a strong spokesman for the education provisions of the Government. But am I, as one Government member, to say that all the other 26 portfolios of Government can be touched in this review but not education? I happen to be interested also in social security. Should I say: 'Do not touch that'? As it happened, social security was not touched by that review. I believe, as one member of the Government team in this Parliament, it is being responsible to have a small decrease in the provision of education moneys.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come to the area in which the decrease is to occur. Clearly that can be seen in the partial re-introduction of tertiary fees. The first issue that I have tried to canvass is the level of resources that the Australian Government is making available. I believe that this continues to be at a high level. Nearly $2 billion has been made available for tertiary education. That does not represent the kind of massive decline that some honourable senators have argued in this debate. In fact, I have a pile of letters from the students and staff of some universities, not least from a large group from Sydney. The letters are all in the same terms and they all ask: Why has the Government reduced in real terms spending this year on universities and CAEs by 5 per cent? That is a load of nonsense. There has not been that decrease. </PARA>
<PARA> The second political issue discussed this month has been the autonomy of academic bodies. Some small crowds of students and staff have gathered in universities and some colleges this month. The loudest cry and the first plank on their agendas has concerned the question of autonomy. Reference was made to Deakin University. The proposition here was that the Commonwealth was providing funds for 11 engineering schools in Victoria. The Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission had recommended that there be some reduction in that number so that it can concentrate on education resources for engineering students and provide better training for engineers. The Deakin University was among those being considered in that context. When the Government made a decision on the ground that the taxpayers' money has to be used wisely and responsibly there was an outcry from some academics in Australia about autonomy. For the life of me, I cannot see how that decision was other than a responsible decision in the resources area. Did the Commonwealth Government purport to interfere or even interfere in any factual way with the way engineering was to be taught in Victoria or with the appointment of the staff which would be doing the teaching? Academic freedom in these respects was entirely preserved. Indeed, academic freedom is preserved direcely by statute by the parliaments of the States. This is not a question of autonomy. It is not a question of academic freedom. It is purely a question of political opposition to the Government's proper decisions about resource levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, there has been some criticism of the Government's decision to amalgamate within the whole body of tertiary education institutions some 30 colleges of advanced education. Twenty-three of those amalgamations are proceeding and three more are just about to be finalised. Only in four cases is there some real difficulty that may involve a proposal in this Bill whereby the Government will put money into an unallocated fund for availability to those colleges when amalgamation takes place. I believe that these amalgamations, based upon resource decisions about the taxpayers' money, are appropriate ways of ensuring that we are providing in the best way for students in each of the States in the areas in which these colleges are providing courses. </PARA>
<PARA> The third political issue to which I referred earlier is the implemtation of fees. Senator Colston, who spoke before me, and some other honourable senators have referred to this as a broken promise. Indeed, some reference was made to this by the Opposition spokesman on Education in another place, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins). He referred to some statements of mine at university campuses. He said: 'Senator Teague is really an irresponsible senator because he has been going around saying that you can say anything in a election context. Of course it does not matter that there is some inconsistency between a statement that he may allege was made by the responsible Minister at election time and then the decision of the Government to see a partial reintroduction of fees.' I want to assure the honourable member, as I have done personally, that I seek the highest credibility and honesty in statements that are made in an election context or that are made at any time by politicians. What riled me was that at some of these university meetings at which I spoke this year, students and others were saying: 'Your Minister is a liar. He promised that there would be no fees. Lo and behold, there now is a partial reintroduction of fees'. That is not true. In fact what was said in answer to questions during the election campaign by Minister Fife was that the Government was not at that time contemplating the reintroduction of fees. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not true. It is in that respect that I want to clarify and repeat now what I have said on some university campuses. I believe that the Minister stated what he believed to be true at that time, and that was that the Government was not contemplating the reintroduction of fees. It is a limited reintroduction of fees. Some have said that this is a very small, miniscule amount. All I can say is that for this calendar year the amount of money involved is estimated to be $8m, and in a full year-when in three years time the full process has been taken-the estimate is $20m. If $1,000 is the maximum per capita amount of any one student's fee, that leads to an estimate of about 20,000 students involved. That is about 10 per cent of the higher education students in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To gain some contribution towards the cost of the tuition of that 10 per cent of university and CAE students is not a miniscule nor an insignificant amount. It compares, for example, with $163m expended last year on the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme with respect to 90,000 students and compares with about 330,000 students altogether in universities and CAES. This Bill introduces an amount of about $8m in revenue to be gained from fees, which is about 10 per cent of all students eventually making some contribution to the cost of their own tuition. But that amounts to less than 18 per cent of the cost of the tuition of a student who is paying the fee. It is now a fact that an average undergraduate course in a year costs the taxpayer about $6,000. The maximum amount that is required in any one year by a fee-paying student-that is the small minority of students-is $1,000. The cost of that tuition is considerably higher for post-graduate students and their proportion will be less than 18 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I also note that the reintroduction of fees does not relate to all post-graduate students but rather to what I term the fourth category of post-graduate students. The first category competes, in an open way, for Commonwealth post-graduate awards and students in that category will be exempt from the fee. The second group receives university research grants. The third group receives private, industry and other benefactions. As long as those benefactions amount to at least $3,500 a year, those students also are exempt from fees. I believe it is undeniable that the first three categories of post-graduate students are those who are most capable and best placed to take on post-graduate awards, university research grants or other benefactions. It is the fourth category, the group that has never had the support from those three types of student finance, which will have to contemplate paying up to 18 per cent of the cost of their tuition. Senator Colston says that it is a light matter or it is somehow trivial for the Commonwealth to say that that $1,000 may be available by way of a loan. The important question is that students in that fourth category have already competed for one or other of the awards and the universities themselves determine the priority of those awards. Those who have, as it were, missed out on the scholarships are able to continue with their studies. They are not denied studies, but they will have to make a small contribution. It is estimated that even that amount will be able to be gained by way of loans. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth question that arises in the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill is that of the level of research in Australia. A number of honourable senators have referred to this and, in very scathing terms, have condemned the Government for its small allocations to research. There has been a significant increase in the amount of money committed to research in the Budget this year. The Australian Atomic Energy Commission, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, research grants and university grants, the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the Anglo-Australian Telescope Board, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies and other miscellaneous research bodies last year received $314m, which has been increased by $66m to $380.9m. This is an increase far in excess of the inflation level and it shows, consistent with considerable increases last year and the year before, that the Fraser Government ismaking considerable contributions and increases towards research funding in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the impact of some fee-paying students in this fourth category of post-graduate students in Australia, there may be a small and, I believe, not significant impact on research levels in universities and colleges of advanced education. But if I am wrong in that, given the massive amounts that are available by way of direct research grants and provisions, or by way of direct funding of tertiary staff or by funding of the first three categories of post-graduate students, if there is by some chance some significant estimate, then the Commonwealth Government has already made the commitment that it will look again at the number of Commonwealth post-graduate awards that are available in Australia. I identify myself with that and urge the Government to monitor carefully the level of post-graduate students in Australia to make sure that we do not see the kind of misery or decline that the Australian Democrats and some Opposition speakers have so woefully included in their speeches here today. I do not believe there will be that kind of decline and I for one will seek an increase in Commonwealth post-graduate awards if it happens that there is even a small decline. I believe the Fraser Government can hold its head high in regard to the very adequate and responsible provision for research in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth question, and final question it seems to me involved in this debate, is that of access to education for tertiary students. For the benefit of those honourable senators who looked about the chamber with a little interest, I regarded the first question as one of resources, the second as one of autonomy, the third one of funding, the fourth one of research and the final question being one of access, which was almost entirely the substance of Senator Ryan's speech today and of the Opposition's contribution generally. Senator Button referred to it and he asked me to refer to it when I made my speech. It seems to me there are four questions in this area. The first question is: Did fee abolition in the early 1970s result in a significant change in student composition? The answer from a number of reviews is resoundingly no. The great proportion of students attending tertiary education institutions in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and even in the 1980s is composed of children of professional and higher income families in Australia, and I lament that fact. I had hoped that the abolition of fees might have led to a much larger proportion of children of lower income families coming on to study at the universities. But the Anderson report concerning the social composition of tertiary standards, the Australian Vice Chancellors' Committee and various other reviews have not found a significant change. </PARA>
<PARA> The second question is: Are talented students denied access to tertiary education now? Senator Ryan thinks they are. We had some dialogue, as it were, on that in the Senate earlier today. I do not believe they are. Indeed, any matriculating student in Australia can freely go to any tertiary education institution and enrol for a course. Also, those of lowest means-I talk of the financial means of the family-have full access to the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. Whilst I happen to believe that the allowance at the full rate of $49 a week is too low, nevertheless that $49 a week is available to someone whose family income is low. In comparison, some students have zero financial provision because their family income is higher, even though they do not ask their parents for support or their parents may deny them support. I used to advise students for some six years at the University of Adelaide in these matters and try to help students in need. I used to run the University's loan scheme, amongst other things, at the University. Those who had grave difficulties and who, as the saying was, bombed out of university, as often as not were those who had wealthy parents but for whom there was no provision. In addition, there were students who were repeating subjects because they had failed. They are the kind of students who have a very real need. I also am entirely committed to TEAS which gives direct encouragement to those students from low income families to come to tertiary education. But let it not just be glibly said that because there is a partial reintroduction of fees for post-graduate students, somehow or other by some mixed up logic this relates to first degree students and in particular to children of low income families or, as Senator Ryan said, to women. No one has been able to maintain that those groups are being denied access to tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA> My time in this debate is almost up; I conclude by saying that a lot of nonsense and a lot of misinformation has been brought into this debate by the Australian Democrats and from some of the Opposition senators who spoke today. I believe the Government has made responsible decisions and those of us who seek a continuing high commitment towards education in Australia can still glory in the fact that we have at least 6 per cent of our gross national product committed to education. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>In light of the fact that Senator Gietzelt is waiting to recommence the debate on the education Bills, I seek leave to incorporate my second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill embodies the Government's main Budget proposals for improvements in the field of social service pensions and benefits. The Bill reflects the priority given by the Government to ensuring assistance is provided to high need groups. It provides additional assistance for the children of large families and refugee children, pensioners who are paying high private rents and for certain unemployment beneficiaries. The major provisions of the Bill will:</PARA>
<PARA> increase the maximum rate of supplementary assistance and supplementary allowances for pensioners and supporting parents and sickness beneficiaries who pay private rent, and vary the method of calculating entitlement;</PARA>
<PARA> extend to wife's pension the same general requirements as to physical presence and residence in Australia that apply for age and invalid pensions;</PARA>
<PARA> increase the rates of family allowances for third and subsequent children and for children in institutions;</PARA>
<PARA> extend the circumstances in which double orphan's pension is payable in respect of refugee children;</PARA>
<PARA> prevent payment of unemployment benefit to the spouse of a person, where the person is engaged in industrial action or has had benefit refused, cancelled or postponed in certain circumstances but in cases of severe financial hardship provide for payment of special benefit to the spouse at the single rate;</PARA>
<PARA> increase the rate of unemployment benefit for those aged 18 and over without dependants. </PARA>
<PARA>These measures and those announced in the Budget but not requiring amendment of the Social Services Act demonstrate the Government's continuing commitment to assisting those in the community in greatest need. In this Budget alone the Government has allocated $9,865 million to pensions, benefits and other welfare payments and services provided through the Department of Social Security. Notwithstanding overall restraints on Government expenditure, this represents an increase of $1,265 million more than was spent in 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> The main reason for this rise, apart from increases in the numbers of pensioners and beneficiaries, is the automatic indexation of the major pensions and benefits, introduced by the Government in 1976, to maintain the base rates of these payments. The full year costs of pension indexation are estimated to be $716 million for increases that will be payable from November 1981 and May 1982 and the Budget allocation includes a sum of $281 million to provide for these rises during the remainder of the 1981-82 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> These figures illustrate not only the cost, but also the degree, of the Government's commitment to its policy of protecting basic pensions against inflation. The Government regards automatic rises in the basic rate of pensions and benefits in line with Consumer Price Index increases as a crucial element in ensuring social justice for people whose major or only source of income support is their pension. </PARA>
<PARA> Since coming into office in 1975 the Government's application of its indexation policy has meant that the standard rate of pension has risen by $27.90, or over 70%, in line with Consumer Price Index movements. Sickness benefits for single people aged 18 and over, and unemployment benefits for those single people aged 18 and over with dependants, have been adjusted in the same way. Pension and benefit rates for married persons have also been indexed. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the area of supplementary assistance and allowance. As honourable senators are aware, a pensioner, including a supporting parent's beneficiary, who has little or no income apart from the pension, and who pays rent or for lodgings, may presently receive supplementary assistance to a maximum of $5 a week:</PARA>
<PARA> $1 of assistance is payable for each $1 of rent with a maximum payment of $5 a week; but</PARA>
<PARA> $1 of assistance is withdrawn for every $1 of income in excess of a $1 ''free area'' for single pensioners and $1 for every $2 above the first $2 for pensioner couples. </PARA>
<PARA>Supplementary allowance is payable on a similar basis to a sickness beneficiary who has been in receipt of benefit for a continuous period of six weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is conscious that low income pensioners paying unsubsidised market rents are among the most needy groups in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Government has decided to act to increase the maximum level of assistance available from $5 to $8 per week and to change the income test. It will also remove the overlap created by the independent development of supplementary assistance and rent rebates (or equivalent subsidies) as dual forms of assistance to pensioners renting public housing. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have indicated we have decided to increase the maximum rate of assistance from $5 to $8 a week and to liberalise the income test on it. Under the existing income test arrangements a single pensioner or a sickness beneficiary eligible for supplementary assistance/allowance loses all of any income between $1 and $6 a week. To provide some incentive for pensioners to obtain small amounts of private income this provision will be replaced by a tapered income test-the maximum amount of supplementary assistance/allowance otherwise payable will be reduced by one-half of income. </PARA>
<PARA> In future, supplementary assistance/allowance will be payable at the rate of one-half of rent above $10 a week to the maximum of $8. For example, a person paying $14 per week rent will be entitled to maximum assistance of $2, at $20 he will receive $5 and the maximum of $8 when rent is $26 or more. </PARA>
<PARA> Having established the maximum rate at which the assistance may be payable the income test will then operate to reduce this maximum rate by half the amount of any income. </PARA>
<PARA> The rent rebate formulae used by State and Territory Housing Authorities mean that such pensioners are required to pay only some 17-20 per cent of their incomes as rent. The average value of rent rebates for State public housing at June 1980 has been estimated at over $16 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> Since pensioners renting from State Housing Authorities receive rebates in excess of supplementary assistance on rents which are often, before rebate, less than private rentals it is proposed to concentrate assistance on pensioners paying high private rentals. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with this, it was also decided to take action to direct suplementary assistance away from pensioners and beneficiaries who pay only nominal rents. Pensioners paying rents of $10 a week or less would not generally be any worse off than home owners and could be expected to pay rents of this level from their basic pension. Those paying rents of between $10 to $20 a week would receive assistance under the new arrangements although less than the current rates. Rents in this range are still below market rates. In addition, because a subsidy rate of $1 for each $1 of rent paid may encourage landlords to increase rents in line with any increase in supplementary assistance, the rate of subsidy has been changed to one-half of rent above $10 a week. This is intended to reduce incentives to increase rent while increasing assistance to pensioners paying higher rents. </PARA>
<PARA> Even with the re-direction of available assistance, the increased rate and liberalised income test will mean an increase in expenditure of some $50 million in the first full year. </PARA>
<PARA> This cost also reflects the Government's decision that the changes will not operate to the disadvantage of those already receiving supplementary assistance/allowance. All current recipients, when the new provisions commence, will be able to continue to receive payments according to present rates and conditions until such time as they cease to qualify under these conditions or would benefit from the new arrangements. The estimated cost of protecting the current entitlements of recipients of assistance who would otherwise have been made worse off is of the order of $30 million. </PARA>
<PARA> Over 300,000 pensioners and beneficiaries paying rents in the private sector are estimated to benefit from the new arrangements. Approximately 130,000 current recipents are expected to continue to receive their current rate of supplementary assistance due to the savings provision. </PARA>
<PARA> The new provisions will take effect from February 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided to increase the rate of the incentive allowance which is payable in lieu of supplementary assistance/allowance to everyone receiving a sheltered employment allowance. The rate of this income test free allowance will also be increased in February 1982 from $5 to $8 a week. Some 8,300 handicapped people in sheltered workshops will benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Bill contains provisions to overcome certain deficiencies in the existing legislation relating to wife's pension; this is a pension payable to the wife of an age or invalid pensioner who is not qualified for an age or invalid pension in her own right. </PARA>
<PARA> To qualify for all other pensions a person must both reside in Australia and be physically present in Australia at the time of lodging a claim. Prior to 1973, pensions generally could not be paid to people outside Australia. With the introduction of portability provisions this situation changed and, as it was not necessary to lodge a claim for wife's pension, it became possible for a wife's pension to be granted to a woman living in another country. This consequence, which was unintended, became apparent upon the receipt of legal advice. Thus, as presently drafted, the legislation permits the automatic grant of a wife's pension without the need to make a claim and regardless of the wife's place of residence. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, we have the rather anomalous situation whereby a wife's pension can be granted to a woman who has never been to Australia and has no intention of coming here. To overcome this anomaly the Bill proposes to extend to a wife's pension the same general requirement as to physical presence and residence in Australia for the grant and commencement of pension that apply for age and invalid pensioners. As a result, wife's pension will not be payable overseas unless pension is granted prior to departure from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one exception to the rule that an applicant for an age or invalid pension must be residing in and physically present in Australia on the date the claim is lodged. This exception applies where a person who is in special need of financial assistance ceased to reside in Australia before 8 May 1973, the date the general portability provisions were introduced. Where a pension is granted to such a man, the Bill proposes that wife's pension will be payable to his wife. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes in relation to wife's pension will come into operation on 1 November 1981. Women overseas in receipt of wife's pension at that date will continue to receive the pension. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Government's commitment to the welfare of Australian families is reflected in the Bill, which provides real and very substantial increases in the rates of family allowances payable in the case of larger families, as from January 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The rate of family allowances payable in respect of the third and fourth children of a family has been increased from $26 to $39 per month, an increase of 50%. The amount of $39 per month will also be payable in respect of children in institutions. In respect of the fifth and subsequent children of a family, the increase is from $30.35 to $45.55 per month. </PARA>
<PARA> Additional family allowance will be paid in respect of some 780,000 children in 540,000 families-containing almost half of Australia's children. The cost of this initiative will be $62 million in the current financial year, representing $124 million in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> To meet a particular problem with respect to refugee children who are not technically orphans but whose contact with their parents is effectively broken the conditions governing double orphan's pension will be altered to extend the provisions to them. </PARA>
<PARA> As Honourable Senators will be aware, a person who has the care of a child both of whose parents are dead, or where one parent is dead and the whereabouts of the other is unknown, is entitled to a double orphan's pension of $55.70 a month. In the case of a refugee child, it is often a question of not knowing whether the parents are alive or dead or not knowing where they are. In some cases the parents are known to be overseas, but the parent and the child cannot be reunited and the parent cannot provide economic support. The circumstances of these children are similar to those of a 'double orphan' and so the Government proposes to pay a double orphan's pension to people who are caring for refugee children whose parents are not in Australia or whose whereabouts are unknown. </PARA>
<PARA> The rate of the pension is $55.70 a month and, like family allowances, is not subject to an income test or to income tax. Payment is made in respect of children under 16 years of age and dependant full-time students aged 16 and over and under 25 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I would now like to deal with the provisions of the Bill relating to unemployment and special benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable Senators will be aware that, prior to October 1979, the Social Services Act precluded payment of unemployment benefit to a person who was a direct participant in a strike. However, it enabled unemployment benefit to be paid at the ''married rate'' to the spouse of a person ineligible for unemployment benefit on those grounds. The Act was subsequently amended to provide that unemployment benefit payable to the spouse of a person engaged in industrial action was to be at the single rate. A further amendment precluded payment of special benefit to a person not qualified to receive unemployment benefit because of industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA> The present legislation permits a situation where trade unions can choose to strike knowing that through the operation of the social security system their members will be largely insulated from the effect of their actions. The Australian public for its part is attacked from two directions. First, it has to bear the personal disruptions, inconveniences and associated costs brought about by the strike. In addition, it is then called upon to meet the cost of providing income support for the families of those involved in that industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, there is no good reason why the community should automatically and immediately be expected to assume the normal financial responsibilities of those who are not willing to work, who voluntarily and without good reason give up their job or who are dismissed through misconduct. This is happening at present where the spouses of such persons register for employment in their own right and, if unable to obtain employment, attract unemployment benefit both for themselves and for their ''dependent'' spouses. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been numerous cases where wives of strikers who have appeared to have no genuine intention of joining the workforce have registered for work in places such as mining and construction towns where there is no real possibility of employment for them. This has enabled them under the present legislation to obtain unemployment benefit thus transferring to the taxpayer some of the real cost of the industrial action taken by their husbands. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Bill proposes that a person will be ineligible for unemployment benefit for so long as the person's spouse is disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit because of the spouse being involved in industrial action or being unwilling to undertake suitable work or not taking reasonable steps to obtain such work. Additionally, a person will be ineligible for unemployment benefit for so long as payment of that benefit to the person's spouse is postponed due to misconduct as a worker, becoming voluntarily unemployed or failing to accept an offer of suitable employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with this approach concerning payment of unemployment benefit, special benefit will be withheld from persons not eligible for unemployment benefit in these circumstances, although the Government had decided that the spouse of a person precluded from unemployment benefit and special benefit may be eligible for special benefit at the single rate, with additional benefit for any children of a couple. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic rates of unemployment benefit for those aged 18 and over with dependants, and those under 18 who are married, are subject to automatic increases twice yearly as a result of the indexation provsions introduced into the Social Services Act by this Government. However, the maximum rate of unemployment benefit for persons aged 18 years and over without dependants is not indexed. The Government has decided to increase this rate by $4.65 per week from $53.45 to $58.10 per week. The Bill makes provision for this increase, which will apply from the first payment period after 1 November 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the matter of people disposing of income or arranging their affairs in such a manner that they avoid the receipt of income in order to qualify for a pension or for fringe benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Pensions are paid subject to an income test and the Government is determined to ensure that the income test operates as it was intended to operate. In other words, it is committed to see that the income test remains an effective mechanism for directing taxpayers' funds to those in greatest need. The Social Services Act already contains provisions which are designed to counter attempts to circumvent the income test. However, due to the proliferation and active marketing of sophisticated and contrived schemes in recent times, these provisions have been found to be inadequate in certain respects and accordingly the Government intends to strengthen these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already announced that it has been found necessary to delay the introduction of these amendments. This delay has been necessitated because of the Government's commitment that the proposed measures will work equitably in practice, will not affect the normal everyday financial transactions of bona fide pensioners and will not impose undue restraints upon the way in which such pensioners manage their normal financial affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Given these policy parameters and the extremely wide range of financial arrangements which are available to individuals in a free market economy, the preparation of legislation which achieves these ends, yet prevents abuse of the system, proved more complicated than was anticipated. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have already indicated, work is continuing on this matter and I am confident that the legislation will be introduced during the next session of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is aware, however, that there is a deal of concern as to the likely structure and impact of the proposed legislation. In my earlier statement of 18 August. I indicated the the proposed provisions would not penalise people who liquidate income-producing assets for such reasonable purposes as the purchase of a home or a car, or to finance a holiday. Similiarly, I said that there would not be any restriction on people keeping reasonable amounts of money in non-interest bearing forms, such as cheque accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Director-General, with whom the discretion in this matter resides, has indicated that he would not regard it as unreasonable to retain in a form such as a current cheque account amounts of less than $2000 for a single person and $3000 for a married couple. He still has under consideration whether higher amounts would be regarded as reasonable. Some flexibility would, of course, be necessary to cover situations where amounts held in a cheque account could be higher than the levels indicated for reasons not related to pension entitlement, for example, between the sale of one home and the purchase of another. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to point out to Honourable Senators that it is not proposed that the legislation should penalise people who chose to hold their investments in savings accounts, even though higher rates of interest might be obtainable elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is necessary to postpone the anouncement of the details of other operational aspects of the proposed legislation, I would hope that the outline I have given will prove to be valuable in setting to rest the minds of many of our elderly citiens. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill reflects the Government's concern to assist those in greatest need in the community, at a time when the Government is conscious of the need for overall expenditure restraint. Our approach has been to maintain a steady course, while introducing worthwhile improvements for those whose circumstances are such as to justify a special focus of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a number of education Bills which have aroused considerable interest in the Australian community. Twelve honourable senators are listed to take part in this debate; four from the Government side and eight from the Opposition side-that is, the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party. I think it is interesting that in the debate so far today, of the three Government senators who have spoken, we have had three different approaches to the problems of education particularly as they relate to tertiary education. Senator MacGibbon's contribution can only be said to be one from a nineteenth century Tory. Senator Missen's contribution was perhaps a little more enlightened. He expressed a great deal of criticism of the Government's approach to this matter although he indicated that he would not vote against the legislation. For the last half an hour we have had the defensive speech of Senator Teague in which he led us to believe that all is good in the Garden of Eden. But, of course, that is not the view of the Opposition. It is not the view of academia. It is not the view of the community at large. The Opposition makes no bones about its criticism of the legislation and the upshot of the passage of the legislation as it relates to the training of a very important section of the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are debating the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill and related Bills. Principally the Bill that I want to speak about provides funds to post-secondary institutions in Australia for the 1982-84 triennium. Overall it can be said that the funds provided are totally inadequate for the carrying on of paper post-secondary teaching in this country and the allocation will ensure that Australia stays at the lower rungs of the expenditure on education by the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. We are often regaled by Senator Carrick about Australia's comparative position in many sectors as far as the performances of OECD countries are concerned. I have examined the statement put out by the Australian Union of Students which shows that of the 12 countries that have full time enrolment rates, Australia is at the bottom of the list, surpassed as we are by all of the main industrialised countries of Europe. It shows that only Ireland, New Zealand, Spain and Portugal spend a smaller percentage of their gross national product on research and development, and of course that is exactly what this Bill is about. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been adequately stated in the debate to date that Australia needs people who are skilled in up-to-the-minute methods, and fees for secondary degrees will only deter people from retraining, leaving their skills stagnating in an ever-changing world. That is the essential difference that we have with the Government. We are living in a period of advanced technology. We are living in a period in which change is taking place very rapidly. We must have an education system which provides for the right of students to be adequately trained, both in the area of technical education as well as in tertiary and other forms of education. It is pretty clear that, quite contrary to what Senator Teague suggests, in the whole area of the academic field, from the vice-chancellors down-the administrative, and student levels-there is a unanimity that we have not seen for a great number of years about the defects that are apparent in this Government's approach to education. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to concentrate at any great length on the dire consequences of the general cuts in education funding. I wish to look at the new measure introduced in the Bill; the reintroduction of tuition fees for second and higher degree students. Clause 6 of this Bill, whole of the Australian National University Amendment (No. 2) Bill and the Canberra College of Advanced Education Amendment Bill are relevant sections of legislation which it is the Opposition's role and obligation to oppose. </PARA>
<PARA> This piece of legislation will undoubtedly have an effect on Australian post-secondary education standards. It will force many students into further hardship and will force many students out of the education system altogether. That is a fact which is ignored by Senator Teague in his contribution to the debate. The decision to impose fees is a blatantly ideological decision that pays more regard to establishing the Government's own Tory credentials, its own discredited economic policies and in the current jargon its dryness. Of course, Senator MacGibbon was referring to the drys in his contribution to this debate, the drys that are making such a mess of the United States economy. This decision flows from the creation of the Review of Commonwealth functions, that notorious band of two titled accountants, two half-smart lawyers and a farmer, as one of my colleagues in the other place described them. The teachers, the administrators, the students, the community, the employers, even the Tertiary Education Commission, have not had any say in this matter. It is not their decision. It is a decision made by a government hell-bent on altering the whole structure of our education system. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to address myself to some of the main points arising from this decision. Firstly, contrary to what Senator Teague said, it is a dishonest decision. I suppose we should not be surprised about that any more, because this Government is notorious for its habit of breaking election undertakings. It deliberately misleads the people; and here in this instance it is happening again. On 8 October 1980, the Minister for Education (Mr Fife), in a letter to the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations, said:</PARA>
<PARA> I have given an assurance publicly and I repeat that assurance that no proposals are being considered by the Government for the possible reintroduction of tertiary fees. </PARA>
<PARA>There was no ambiguity or qualification about that. There was no saying 'at this time'; that was a clear-cut understanding given to the organisation, and obviously understood and accepted by the organisation. Students have been reminding Senator Teague in his roundabout on the campuses that the Minister has lied. I say that their assumptions are correct. </PARA>
<PARA> Only a few months after that statement was made the razor gang came out with proposals. Less than one year after the Government's term of office has started, this legislation for which the Government has no mandate is before us. This Government just cannot be trusted. It is no wonder, then, that the Australian Democrats, when they coined the slogan 'keep the bastards honest' swept the pool and in fact increased their representation in this place, and they did so at the Government's expense. Is it any wonder that students and potential students consider this introduction of fees on a so-called limited basis or limited scale to be the start of a wider reintroduction of fees? There is no doubt in my mind that this is the thin end of a very nasty wedge, and that is the way the student movement sees it. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators should cast their minds back a short while. In 1976 the then Minister for Education, Senator Carrick, announced that fees would be introduced along the lines we are discussing today. His Government backed down after huge protests from all over the country. Senator Carrick assured us, both outside and inside the Parliament, that the Government had changed its mind and fees would not be introduced. These assurances have proved to be worth absolutely nothing. In 1979 fees were introduced for overseas students studying in Australia. Again we were told not to worry, that there would be no extension of the scheme to Australian students. Yet less than two years later we have this contemptuous piece of legislation doing exactly what we were told the Government was not going to do. Senator Carrick's promises were useless. He may have opposed fee introductions in the Cabinet and in the party room, but all he got for his trouble was to be shifted sideways from the education portfolio. Mr Lynch, the Treasurer and architect of the 1976 scheme, finally got his way as the razor gang chief in 1981. Mr Fife's pathetic bleatings that this fee introduction is limited cannot be believed. The Government's transparency is laughable. If the consequences of fee introduction were not so severe, we could all pass it off as a good joke. But it is not a joke. The explanation of the Minister for Education for fee introduction, contained in a Press release on 2 July this year, reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The financial demands placed on the Australian taxpayer by the education sector will be kept down. </PARA>
<PARA>But, as Senator Colston has shown, the estimate for the revenue to be raised by this measure, when the Government finally made up its mind, is a paltry $4m in 1982 and $20m by 1984. Even these excessively inflated estimates show the revenue raising potential of this measure to be a mere pittance when compared to the $1,865m to be spent in 1981-82 on post-secondary institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I am stressing here is that this measure will do nothing to ease the tax burden for the Australian people whom the Government so opportunisticly claims to support. They will still be taxed at the same inequitable rates. The working people of this country will still be forced to shell out a disproportionate amount to the tax man while the Liberal and National Country Party Government does nothing to assist them in getting access to the vast range of educational facilities we could offer. To that extent I can share the philosophy expressed by Senator Teague, but this has not been provided for in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> To the average working taxpayers in Australia, this measure will mean, firstly, that they will still have to pay higher taxes and, secondly, that if they or their sons or daughters struggle through the education system, stacked against them as it is, the final barrier will be a $1,000 university fee. Not many will get over that barrier. If there is any credence at all in Senator Teague's contribution he must surely admit that the lower income groups are not getting into the education race, that they need further financial incentive and assistance if their sons and daughters are to be encouraged into the tertiary education system. Why does not the Government address itself to this problem? Why does it not seek to go about levelling the education system so as to ensure that willingness, knowledge and ability are the criteria for further education, instead of the ability to pay as it currently is now. Of course, we have a government of two different postures-a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde type of government. I will read what Mr Hyde, the honourable member for Moore in other place, had to say in today's Australian. Of course, he is the leader of the 'dry' in this Government. We are seeing an increasing influence from that school of thought-hard line Toryism which seems to be taking over the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA> What does Mr Hyde want to do:</PARA>
<PARA> He wants to see a 'user-pays system' replacing the present Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>That is quite contrary to and differs from the contribution made by Senator Teague and also that made by Senator Missen. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> In fact, he makes no secret of the fact that electors he meets are increasingly indicating opposition to free tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know what circles Mr Hyde moves in but certainly that is not the view that I have. It is certainly not the views contained in the hundreds of letters and protests coming to members of the Senate and members of the Parliament generally about what is proposed in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hyde talks about a taxation system that should be neutral. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Under present arrangements we have a situation where the less wealthy and less articulate in Australia are providing money to people from a generally wealthier group-our student population. </PARA>
<PARA> What this means is that this privileged group obtains a private commodity for nothing, which guarantees students an expectation of higher life-long incomes.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the taxation system in this country has a class basis; of course it taxes lower income groups too highly. Of course, it is a taxing system that places an undue burden on the average wage and salary earner in our community. If that is the problem, Mr Hyde ought to be addressing himself to a more equitable taxing system so that we are not in a position where those at the lower end of the scale are contributing to the education of a group of people who may be said to be coming from the wealthier group. We ought to be working out a system whereby the tertiary assistance schemes are providing the necessary financial incentive to children of the lower income groups to come into the tertiary institutions. We should not set about establishing a whole new system. Mr Hyde said:</PARA>
<PARA> Universities which constantly call and argue for their autonomy would truly have it. Government would no longer be involved. There would be no need to look at the education vote. </PARA>
<PARA>He wants the whole education system to be drastically altered and changed. What sort of government have we when so many different points of view can be expressed in looking at this problem of education?</PARA>
<PARA> Government members defend their decision by pointing to the predominance of students from the upper and middle socio-economic background in tertiary institutions. They say that the revolution of access, hoped for by the last Labor Government, has not occurred. No one denies that. Does the Government know why? Has it considered the effects of a world economy depressed since 1974? Has it considered the effects of poor student finances and the decline in recent years of assistance under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme? Has it considered the fact that participation by women students, mature age students and country students has multiplied rapidly, a fact directly attributable to fee abolition? The Government has not considered that. It prefers to go on its own ideological blinkered way and carry out policies which address none of the key problems of access to post-secondary education. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Government even aware of the consequences of introducing fees? Senator Teague, this is what the Minister for Education had to say about this matter just last week. In answer to a question on notice from Senator Watson, the Minister provided this information:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not known to what extent enrolments in 1982 will be affected by fees. </PARA>
<PARA>He also stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It remains to be seen whether the limited reintroduction of tertiary tuition fees in 1982 will have any disincentive effect. </PARA>
<PARA>That was contained in the Senate Hansard of 21 October. How dare the Minister play with the careers of thousands of post-graduate and second degree students with phrases such as 'it remains to be seen'. Perhaps the Minister for Education does not care. Perhaps he does not know of some of the examples from overseas that can be looked at. I will take just two examples. For example, in 1977 in Canada, Ontario and Manitoba shared the dubious distinction of levying the largest fee increases in the country. The result was that enrolment in each province fell by 3.2 per cent. At the University of Wisconsin in the United States, the reverse happened when fees were reduced. What will happen here? The Minister does not know. But he is quite happy to press on with the legislation because he has been told to do so by a Government intent on reducing public sector expenditure, whatever the consequences. I suppose that ignorance is bliss. It will hardly make a convincing slogan for Mr Fife when next he has to walk on to a university campus. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that the effect of these fee charges will be to deter post-graduate and second degree study in Australia. Studies by the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations and associate bodies show that most post-graduate students are living at levels several thousand dollars below the poverty line and receive financial assistance for earnings well below their needs. A burden of an extra $1,000 a student will tip the balance and tip them out of study and research altogether. I do not believe that we can afford to lose our post-graduate scholars as we have been doing for the past few years. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which shows that post-graduate award holders in Australian universities have declined in recent years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. We are moving in a direction absolutely opposite to that supported by such conservative figures as Sir Robert Menzies. Unlike his Tory successors, Sir Robert understood that Australia's research capacity would not be subjected to pure financial constraints. In a 1968 lecture, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Any decision made by those in financial authority which limits or reduced the body of postgraduate students is a wrong decision, because by implication, it gives priority to elements other than that one element which is of supreme importance if great universities are to survive and grow. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement was made on 12 March 1968 in the second Dunrossil Memorial Lecture. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Tertiary Education Commission concurs with this view. In its report for the 1982-84 triennium, it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Participation in higher education in Australia is not high by the standards of many OECD countries, and the increasing pace of technological change will require more rather than less education. </PARA>
<PARA>So, ignoring the advice of both its founding father, its own present-day advisory body, international experience and the community at large, this Government ploughs on. </PARA>
<PARA> About 20 per cent of all research in Australia takes place at universities. Nearly 60 per cent of basic research-that is, research of an original kind which seeks to map out a complete knowledge or understanding of topics of concern-is carried out in Australian universities. These are the figures supplied to us by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. This is the kind of research that the Government seeks to jeopardise for the sake of its own petty financial and economic gains. Rather than take up the time of the Senate, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard three brief descriptions of the type of research that actions of this Government will threaten.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. This then is the sort of situation that faces us. This is the kind of legislation that the Government has before it in the Senate today. This legislation threatens our basic research effort and places higher education out of the reach of an ever greater number of people. If this sort of thing is extended to all courses of tertiary study, as is the Government's long term intention, I am sure that the consequences will be tremendous. Tertiary education will be a pursuit for the elite, and always for the elite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For these reasons, the Opposition is firmly opposed to clause 6 of this Bill. Of course, we have had some instances given of the Governments backfilling on the whole question of tertiary education. I have to agree with what Senator Carrick said in the Senate on 3 April 1979. In reply to a question by Senator Puplick he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> One would have to agree that the future development of this country, including its capacity to trade and the living standards of its people, must depend upon a properly based program of research and development. If Australia is to keep competitive with the world outside it must have such a program and with the growing field of technology this becomes more important. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Colston reminded us that Senator Carrick, in reply to a question by Senator Lajovic, said that there would be no recommendation for the reintroduction of fees at any level of tertiary education. Indeed, he criticised the Minister for Education in New South Wales for suggesting that fees were going to be introduced. Finally, the Minister for Education said in the House of Representatives just a week ago:</PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it abundantly clear that the Government has no intention of reintroducing fees for students undertaking their first degrees. I repeat that: The Government has no intention of reintroducing fees for students undertaking their first degrees. </PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, one can understand why students and all of the educational institutions have considerable concern about this Government's intentions. We have on the public record statements by Senator Carrick, by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and by Mr Fife, all of which have been shown to lack substance when the pressure is really on. It is for these and many other reasons that the Opposition will be taking steps to support the amendments that have been moved and foreshadowed by my colleagues in the hope that at the Committee stage the chamber will remove the deficiencies that are so much a part of this piece of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nobody could deny that the Government's policy in relation to fees for certain university students has been a contentious one. One could well understand that there would be those with a contrary point of view and such a point of view has been expressed by the Opposition, notably Australian Labor Party senators. One has to wonder why, if the Labor Party thinks it has a good case for its contrary point of view, it must so misrepresent the Government's policy in an attempt to make that case. The reapplication of fees at the tertiary level will apply to students enrolling for the first time in 1982 either for further degrees-not first degrees-or for post-graduate courses if such students are not in possession of a Commonwealth post-graduate award.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is a fair mouthful. It is not as easy as saying something about the reintroduction of fees, but in all of the debate that I have engaged in with members of the Opposition, in all of the statements that I have heard from them, that mouthful has not been expressed; the full case has not been given. Apparently it is necessary to misstate the Government's intent in order to make their point. </PARA>
<PARA> One would indeed understand great concern being expressed at a number of levels if an across-the-board reintroduction of fees were proposed. Recently in Queensland there was an education campaign in which the Australian Union of Students paid for a large number of radio advertisements which misrepresented the Government's policy in precisely those terms. Someone taking those advertisements at face value would have concluded that from now on a full time student currently enrolled for a first degree at a university could face payments of up to $3,000 per annum in fees. That is just not true. One has to question not only the integrity of the people who run a campaign in that way but just how good is their case when such snide misrepresentation takes place.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not have the advantage of having in front of me the speeches made by the Opposition in today's debate but I have looked at those made in the House of Representatives in debating these Bills. I would like to refer to part of a speech that was made by the honourable member for Swan, Mr Beazley. In speaking of the legislation, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> What will be the result of this legislation? It will not make a dime of difference to the fact that the low income earners of Australia bear a heavy burden of education expenditure by virtue of the fact that they pay the bulk of the taxes and they do not attend universities. All it means is that, via their taxes they will continue to pay for 80 per cent of university education. If a few of them actually get into a situation in which they might be able to benefit from a university education, they will be hit with a charge currently of $1,000 a year for the privilege of being able to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>The clear statement in that speech is that low income earners, if they manage to get into the privileged position of being able to attend a tertiary institution, will have to pay $1,000 a year. That is the kind of misrepresentation to which I refer. The Government has referred, in speaking of low income earnrs, to those who do not have the advantage of tertiary education. In fact, the students to whom Mr Beazley refers would pay no fees. Such a student would be enrolled for a first degree and would not pay $1,000 a year. The honourable member compounded this misrepresentation by stating:</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, having been excluded by all the many social factors from opportunities for tertiary education, when they actually arrive at the point at which at which they could take advantage of tertiary education they will be denied access to it. </PARA>
<PARA>I have a very high opinion of the honourable member for Swan. I happen to think that he is a man of considerable integrity. The only basis, I think, on which he could make a statement like that, one which is so patently false, is that he has been so confused by his own advisers and the debate within his own party that he has come to believe it. The Labor Party is clearly proceeding on the assumption that if it repeats the assertion often enough everybody in Australia will believe it, will believe that everyone will have to pay $1,000 in fees and that low income people who, because of a lot of factors according to Mr Beazley, have not been able to get access to tertiary education, would be precluded by fees from undertaking a first degree. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, that misrepresentation will not work but it will take a couple of years for people to realise its falsity. It will take a couple of years for the Australian community to understand that that is not the implication of this legislation. Meantime, no matter how often one points out the misrepresentation to the Labor Party, its supporters go on to repeat it. Mr Beazley said further:</PARA>
<PARA> If we take the user pays principle even further, if we take it aside from, say, an arts course for which the average cost per student might be $3,000 or $4,000 a year, and through to the average cost of a medical student at $15,000 a year, the situation is even more ludicrous. In those circumstances that working class person would be paying for--</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that the Hansard record shows '$14,000' but Mr Beazley surely said, or meant, $12,000-</PARA>
<PARA>-$14,000 worth of a $15,000 education and would then be obliged to confront a further charge of $1,000 upon attending a university. </PARA>
<PARA>So the saga goes on so the lie is perpetrated. Mr Beazley said further:</PARA>
<PARA> This wringing of hands and mourning the fate of the working class compelled to bear this colossal burden of tertiary education in Australia via the taxation system ought to be exposed for the ludicrous argument that it is. </PARA>
<PARA>At that point, Mr Barry Jones, the honourable member for Lalor, interjected:</PARA>
<PARA> It is humbug. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Beazley responded:</PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Lalor says, it is humbug. </PARA>
<PARA>I think at that point Mr Barry Jones was actually referring to Mr Beazley's speech, not to the Government's policy, because what Mr Beazley said there, well intentioned as it might have been, was humbug in terms of what the legislation will actually do. The knee-jerk reaction of a number of spokespeople in the tertiary area has given the appearance to the public at large that they are spokespeople for vested interests. That may not be a fair impression to draw but they have brought it on themselves. The members of the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations and some Labor Party members of the House of Representatives and Senate have actually made fools of themselves in their misrepresentation of the Government's policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week in this chamber I asked the Minister for National Resources and Energy, Senator Carrick, as Minister representing the Minister for Education a question relating to allegations that were being made by the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations in relation to how much money would be collected from fees in the category to which we are referring. Namely, further degrees and higher degree students without scholarship. I think that every honourable member and honourable senator would have received a circular from FAUSA and would be well aware of its wording. In that context, I quote from a speech made by the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) in the House of Representatives. Without any attributing of the source-I think honourable senators will recognise this as a straight quote from the FAUSA document, but it was not given in those terms-the honourable member for Henty said:</PARA>
<PARA> On 3 July the Federal Government estimated that $8m would be netted from fees in 1982 and $20m in 1983-84, the first full year of the scheme's operation. Six weeks later in 1981-82 Federal Budget Statements, at page 76, the government had changed its mind and stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to re-introduce fees on a limited basis for student commencing second and higher degrees from 1982 (except for recognised combined degrees and diplomas). The revenue in 1982 is estimated to be $4m; this is expected to rise to $20m in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet it has already halved its estimate a mere seven weeks since the original announcement. Irrationally this Government will stick to its belief that $20m will be netted from fees in the third year of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>It just shows the level of contribution to the debate when FAUSA says something like that and a spokespersom from the Australian Labor party picks it up and parrots it, somebody who is a member of this place and knows something about the difference between a calendar year and a financial year. FAUSA should know the difference too. The Government's original July statement that $8m would be netted from fees in 1982 referred to the calendar year 1982, from the beginning of 1982 to the end of 1982. Budget documents do not refer to calendar years. So when the Budget document referred to $4m revenue for 1982 it really meant that part of 1982 which falls in the financial year covered by the Budget; that is, half of 1982. So, indeed, half of $8m being $4m, $4m was a correct figure on the basis of the Government's estimation. Mrs Child, who so uncritically accepted that allegation from FAUSA, went on:</PARA>
<PARA> My main worry about these changes is that they may work to exclude students from working class backgrounds from the tertiary education system. For many years it was extremely difficult for working class students to enter university or to undertake other forms of tertiary education unless they were able to obtain scholarships. </PARA>
<PARA>Later, she stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Surely we do not want to turn the clock back to the days when advanced education was an exclusive preserve for the privileged. </PARA>
<PARA>I make two points. The first point is that Mrs Child made the same allegation, quite incorrectly, as did Mr Beazley and as have many members of the Labor Party, the Australian Union of Students and FAUSA, in relation to the impact of this proposal that we debate tonight, portraying it implicitly or explicitly in terms of a blanket reintroduction for all students in tertiary institutions next year. The second point is this: Are we in this debate talking about new classes of privilege? There has been quite some debate about why a lower income earner should support, through paying taxes, that person who already has a tertiary qualification and a superior earning capacity that goes with it when the lower income earner does not directly reap the benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been a matter of privilege in many ways. The source of the privilege to have tertiary education in this country is very varied. There was a time when that privilege did attach to those on high incomes. Thanks to the policies of the Menzies Liberal Government, that time changed and access to universities became much more ready and free during the 1960s. I became one of the privileged group not because I came from a high income family-far from it-but because Commonwealth scholarships were available and because there were more places and freer access to universities. So the source of the privileges was a different one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was available to anybody who managed to go as far as matriculation. There certainly would have been quite a number of working class students among them. What would have been the major limiting factor in those days-a factor that did not operate in my case, not typically of women-was expectations of people in relation to education. There was a socialising factor. But then quite a number of people who were not from backgrounds of privilege or of tertiary education or had ever known in their families the direct benefits of tertiary education, nevertheless were motivated to make the sacrifices necessary to send their children on to university. The point is that access was available. The point I was trying to make is that the source of privilege has varied. In that case it was the privilege of more positions being available and more scholarships being available, plus an increase in the general standard of living in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We go on further and come to the abolition of fees overall a few years ago. Now we look at Mrs Child's use of the word 'privilege'. She used the word in relation to the first category of student I talked about, who had the privilege of a well-to-do family. Apparently we are now looking at another source of privilege; namely, the privilege of wanting to have even more tertiary education. We ought to look at who is privileged in this sense because the people who object to this policy do not claim to be privileged; they claim to be deprived if they do not get further education at the cost of the general taxpayer. It ought to be looked at in those terms. That is not to denigrate the person who wants further education, but it is to say to the person who wants somebody else to pay for it when that person already has had someone else pay for his or her first qualification, that that person must be in a specially privileged position if he or she does not have to pay for that service. It is not unreasonable that such people should make a contribution. It is not unreasonable that they should not demand as of right and not consider to be a privilege access to a full, free tertiary education for however far they want to take the meaning of the word 'full'. </PARA>
<PARA> There appears to be a very strong element in this debate of a form of assertion of an inalienable right of the clients of tertiary education to have unlimited access to the public purse. They do not have a claim as against any other sector of the Australian population, to unlimited access to the public purse. Amendments to this legislation have been and will be moved. I quote just one part of the foreshadowed amendment to the motion that the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill be read a second time. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>', but the Senate is of the opinion that--</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (3) the excessive and unplanned proliferation of new private schools beyond the demand for new places at a time of contraction of the school age population is wasteful of resources and will destabilise existing schools creating 'public resentment' as expressed by the Victorian Minister for Education.'</PARA>
<PARA>I want to contrast the attitude of the Opposition on the subject of access to tertiary education, claims of academic freedom and other such terms, with its attitude towards free access to certain types of schooling. The Opposition claims that a government contribution of 20 per cent towards the cost of educating a student at an independent school is too much. But the Opposition claims that a government contribution of 80 per cent of the cost of educating a tertiary student is too little. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, there is an interesting contrast in the attitudes expressed by the Australian Labor Party to the subject of how much of the public purse should be contributed to one type of education versus another. There has been a lot of talk in the education debate in recent weeks on the subject of academic independence. One could apply those sorts of arguments to the schools area. The independent school system provides an alternative which is apparently well subscribed to by the public. The Labor Party deplores the fact that there can be a proliferation of new private schools at a time when there is a contraction of the school age population. Independent schools are expanding with only a 20 per cent subsidy at a time when the school age population is contracting. That does not means that there is a massive input or subsidy given to those schools. It means that, firstly, the prices are reasonable and, secondly, an increasing proportion of the clients of education at the school level in Australia want the independent school system. That ought to be included in any debate on academic freedom. We ought to contrast what the Opposition would claim for the highest level of education in which a small proportion of our population is involved versus what it claims should not be paid-at a much lower rate-for the vast bulk of students in the school system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I, as a Queenslander, must reply to a comment Senator Colston made as a Queenslander. Several times he made the statement that north Queensland has been robbed of a significant institution by the Government's economic policies. He was referring to the Townsville College of Advanced Education. He said that several times. It really sounded very sad to think of north Queensland being robbed of a significant institution. What has happened? The Townsville College of Advanced Education has not disappeared. Nobody has stolen it. There has been an amalgamation. Anybody who has been involved at the tertiary education level and who has looked at resources in recent years would have put the subject of the north Queensland College of Advanced Education at the top of the list when looking at a more sensible arrangement and distribution of funds. It may well be, as Senator Colston said, that this will damage the Government's fortunes in the Herbert electorate. The main reason it will be that way, if that is the consequence, will be due to the nonsense people like Senator Colston have been talking, repeating and going on with and the belief, as I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, that if you say it often enough people will believe it. Townsville and north Queensland have not lost anything in terms of access to education or forms of education. The simple fact is that the Townsville College of Advanced Education was essentially a teacher training institution. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially it was interested in teaching the subject of education. James Cook University is next door. There is not even a fence between the two institutions; so it is difficult for someone who does not know to find physically where the College starts and the University ends. James Cook University also has a faculty of education. The resources are being wasted. Nobody involved in education is surprised when people say that they do not want amalgamations because there are consequences of amalgamations. There are consequences in relation to the staffing levels. There are consequences in relation to who runs the show. Instead of two lots of bosses, there will be one lot of bosses and that is a painful adjustment. Nobody thought that the decisions in relation to James Cook University and the Townsville College of Advanced Education would be easy or painless in political terms because if they had been easy or painless it would have happened years ago. It has been recognised for a long time that it should have happened. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to make a few comments on the subject of the effect of these measures on post-graduate students. It has been impossible to get worthwhile figures on which one could make an objective judgment about the effect in the post-graduate area. A number of figures have been cited and I have not been able to get distinctions in terms of full time and part time students, the number of students funded and the numbers not funded. There are students attending university with financial support other than that received from post-graduate awards. But I have a very real concern. I am not saying that this policy will necessarily lead to the downgrading of the post-graduate effort within universities. I am saying that if it has that effect, that is a very serious consequence and not one that the Government would want. I made certain representations to the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) on this subject. To save time, I seek leave to have the Ministers' reply incorporated in Hansard. If leave is denied I will read it. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>MINISTER FOR EDUCATIONParliament House, Canberra A.C.T 27 October 1981 Dear Senator Martin,</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your representations regarding the Government's decision to introduce fees for second and higher tertiary qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA> As you are aware, the legislation presently before the Parliament provides for the limited reintroduction of tuition fees from 1982 and specifically excludes the charging of tuition fees for students undertaking courses leading to first awards. It also exempts students who commenced second degree or diploma courses before 1982 from paying fees for these courses. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, of course, only reasonable that the Australian taxpayer bear the full cost of the education of students up to and including a first tertiary qualification. It is also reasonable that those who wish to continue their studies beyond the first qualification stage should be required to make a contribution to their education. Under the Government's proposal this contribution represents less than 20% of the average overall cost of educating a person in a tertiary course. </PARA>
<PARA> Insofar as the particular question of retention rates at the postgraduate level is concerned, the Government will keep this matter under review. At the same time it will keep under review the level and rate of postgraduate awards which, of course, are examined annually in the Budget context. </PARA>
<PARA> You are, of course, aware that our Government has no desire to see a reduction in the number of students undertaking postgraduate studies. It believes that the revised arrangements together with additional research measures such as the Research Centres of Excellence initiatives, make adequate provision for the maintenance and, indeed, the extension of research in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has not been my want in the decade I have been in this institution to speak on education. I have tendered to leave that to others whom I perceive to be more au fait with education. It is an area in which I have never really become involved over the years. I suggest that anyone who lives in Victoria and anyone from Victoria who is a member of parliament and who in any way keeps his eyes open as to what is happening to the State education system in that State would have to be totally blind not to know that the State education system in Victoria is in an absolute state of decay. I want to relate my remarks particuarly to the Non-government Schools (Loans Guarantee) Amendment Bill and to the amendment to be moved by Senator Ryan to the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill 1981. Perhaps I should read that amendment. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The Commonwealth Government is ignoring its primary obligation to the government school sector as stated in section 13 of the Schools Commission Act especially in its neglect of Schools Commission advice that the continuing shortfall in capital funds for government schools is unacceptably high;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The advancement of one sector of Australia's schools should not be at the disadvantage of the other sector whether public or private as this will revive tensions within the community which disappeared with the introduction of the 'needs' policy by the Labor Government in 1973, and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The excessive and unplanned proliferation of new private schools beyond the demand for new places at a time of contraction of the school age population is wasteful of resources and will destabilise existing schools creating 'public resentment' as expressed by the Victorian Minister for Education. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not aware as to who within the Australian Labor Party drafted that amendment but it is spot on. It is spot on as to fact and situation in the State of Victoria. Over recent years we have witnessed in that State-I presume across the Commonwealth as well but I am only au fait with the Victorian scene-a whole spate of new non-government schools in the Victorian community brought about, in my view, by elitists in this Government looking after their mates or the future elites in this country, that is, the children of those elitist mates. In my view that is being done at the expense of children within the government school system in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> In my opinion, that view is supported by figures given in the Schools Commission report for the triennium 1982-84 in paragraph 10.5. The latter part of that paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA> Public expenditure on government schools increased by 10.5 per cent and on non-government schools by 32.5 per cent. The Commonwealth reduced its commitments to government schools by 13.3 per cent while increasing assistance to non-government schools by 32.9 per cent. State governments increased their funding of government schools by 14.5 per cent and of non-government schools by 31.8 per cent. Recurrent funds for government schools increased by 20.6 per cent, with the Commonwealth contribution declining by 1.9 per cent and State funds increasing by 23.5 per cent. For non-government schools, recurrent funds increased by 42.5 per cent, with the state contribution up by 31.8 per cent and that of the Commonwealth by 49.3 per cent. Capital funds for government schools declined by 34.9 per cent with generally comparable rates of decline in both Commonwealth and State contributions. </PARA>
<PARA>That fairly epitomises the situation as it is in the State of Victoria at present. The same report, in regard to the two years 1978 and 1979, states that Commonwealth funds have been utilised to assist in the building of 51 completely new non-government schools. The report does not inform us of what group or denomination will build those schools. </PARA>
<PARA> However, as I said earlier, my concern is over what I see as a spate of proposed new grammar schools being built in areas where they can draw resources-both funds and students-only from existing schools. I wish to recall what I have seen go on in the State of Victoria in recent months. In May this year, the Federal Government announced a grant of $200,000 for the building of a grammar school in the city of Shepparton. In my view that is a city in which those resources could be better spent within the present system rather than be spent by people whom I believe perceive themselves to be above the common herd and who are now being allowed to set up an elitist school rather than giving anything that they have to give towards education to the present education system. They are drop-outs from the present education system; they perceive themselves to be something better than the common herd, as I have said, and they believe they are entitled to something better. So this Government is prepared to fund them. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go further into the geography of Victoria. In another area of Victoria in the same month-May of this year-there appeared in that district's local paper, the Warrnambool Standard the following advertisement under the heading 'Alternative education':</PARA>
<PARA> If you are interested in alternative education for your children, we are pleased to announce that a new secondary school, Warrnambool Grammar School, will be established in Warrnambool in the near future. Initial entrance will be Years 7 and 8 and ultimately for all years up to Higher School Certificate. The school, which is sponsored by Warrnambool Presbyterians, will receive students on a strictly non-sectarian basis. No religious tests will be applied. Subject to the receipt of enrolments, it is anticipated that the school could open in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Interested persons are invited to write to the Acting Registrar, Mr C. G. Kempton . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to note that Mr Kempton is one of the leading lights of the Liberal Party in the city of Warrnambool. </PARA>
<PARA> In Warrnambool, a city of 22,500 or 22,600 people, there are already five secondary schools. In my view, they are quite reasonable-in fact, quite good-schools. Two or three of them are quite modern with up to date standards in buildings. One or two are some years older but on my inspection of them they could all be deemed only as very reasonable types of schools. There are five secondary schools to cope with a city with a population of 22,500 people, plus those students who are drawn in on some 40 or 48 buses from surrounding districts. On top of that, there are secondary schools at Mortlake, Terang, Timboon and Cobden-all towns within a 40 mile radius of the city of Warrnambool. </PARA>
<PARA> All those schools in that region have, to the best of my knowledge, basically stable or declining student numbers. Yet one of the sponsors of the proposed grammar school in Warrnambool is quoted in the Warrnambool Standard on 24 June as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> We have no desire to encroach on the territory of existing schools. </PARA>
<PARA>He is reported to have gone on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> A programme of religious education will be part of the normal curriculum and clergy from various denominations will be invited to take part. </PARA>
<PARA>So, the holy rollers are in on the act. On reading the advertisement that appeared on 13 May, I was sufficiently perturbed about the development to write some few days later to the editor of the paper. In part, I said:</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, I find it hard to accept that there is a need for a new school in Warrnambool. If the goal be purely alternative education could not such a philosophy be introduced into the schools currently established in this city without the cost to the taxpayers for additional bricks and mortar, unless of course the proposed building is to be funded privately. </PARA>
<PARA> If not, this is a pertinent point when one considers the current shortage of funds for capital works in the education system right across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I then asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Would the sponsors of the proposed school consider the need for a feasibility study being conducted before the project goes ahead? And in the interests of public discussion, spell out the aims and objectives of the proposed school as well as the curriculum to be followed in the alternative education programme. </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, elicited no reply. There has been a great silence in the town. </PARA>
<PARA> A few days after that advertisement appeared in the Warrnambool paper, there was a news item in the same Warrnambool Standard dated 23 May 1981, under the heading 'New school at Timboon?' It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Independent Baptist church plans to build a private school in Timboon. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The application proposes that the building would be used five days a week as a school and for church purposes at the weekend. </PARA>
<PARA>They are getting a church thrown in buckshee, all at the taxpayer's expense while the State system is falling down around the ears of the Victorian Government. I mean that physically. The situation in the State of Victoria, as I said earlier, is something that every member of parliament should see just to get some concept of what is happening to our well known and renowned State education system. </PARA>
<PARA> To contrast what was going on and what was happening, about that time I received a visit from members of the South Warrnambool Primary School committee, who asked me to visit and make some assessment of their school. A couple of days later I visited the school. I started my remarks by saying that I had never taken much interest in education. For that reason, I guess I was surprised because when I stepped inside the South Warrnambool Primary School I was taken back 50 years in my life. The South Warrnambool Primary School is a monument to education in the 1930s. The school was of the same style as the one I walked out of in 1932 or 1933. It had the same blackboards, the same step in front of the blackboards. The desks had been updated marginally. Draughts came through the floors. The paintwork outside was peeling. The spouts were dripping water. The down pipes were broken. Because the school was built of local sandstone, which is prone to soak up water like a sponge, the building remained damp for days and weeks after heavy rain. Yet this Government is prepared to fund a grammar school in the same city within half a mile or a mile of the school I have just described. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know why the South Warrnambool Primary School has been allowed to deteriorate like it has. It may be due to two factors. Firstly, it has a student population of 45 to 50, which is less than 10 per cent of the number of children attending other primary schools in the same city. There is another factor that I have often wondered about. At every election the residents of South Warrnambool return a Labor majority at the polling booth, which is in fact at that school. Perhaps it is some sort of perverse Liberal retribution for the citizens of South Warrnambool voting Labor rather than Liberal; I do not know. But this situation is a shocking indictment of the education system. Mr Acting Deputy President, you are well aware that the city of Warrnambool has been dubbed the premier city. However, the South Warrnambool Primary School is a disgrace to Victoria, a disgrace to the Education Department and a disgrace to the premier city. I told the Mayor so and he agreed with me. But, be that as it may, why would this Federal Government want to fund an elitist grammar school in a city in which 45 to 50 children are being taught in what can only be described in the 1980s as a slum? Obviously there is one rule for the rich and another for the poor. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter cannot be allowed to rest at that point because, as I have already said, the pattern is exactly the same right across Victoria. Funding for maintenance in the state school sector in Victoria has declined year after year in region by region to the point where no funds at all are being made available for maintenance, for furniture or for general upkeep. There are no cyclic funds. No cyclic work is being done on the maintenance of hundreds of schools across Victoria. I repeat that this Government is pouring funds into elitist grammar schools. Three or four people who have a bit of a bitch about the state education system or who believe they are entitled to something better than the common herd can get together under the guise of perhaps some holy roller organisation and get funds at the drop of a hat to build new schools for a handful of kids while for the multitude of kids the Victorian education system is in total decline. </PARA>
<PARA> On 25 September my leader, Senator Button, the honourable member for Ballarat, Mr John Mildren, and I attended in the city of Ballarat a conference sponsored by the Ballarat regional office of the Department of Education. Out of desperation, that Ballarat regional office called together every member of parliament, both State and Federal, whose electorate in any way touched on the region, every shadow Minister, and Ministers for Education from both Victoria and the Federal sphere. The paper we received stated that:</PARA>
<PARA> Special problems affecting the Buildings Operations Program will be considered-in particular:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the continual decline in funds available for school building since 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) the alarming inadequacy of funding for essential maintenance and upgrade of school buildings. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) the apparent withdrawal of some critically necessary Federal funding from Government Primary and Post Primary School programs in order to service other programs. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) recommendations for future programs. </PARA>
<PARA>The Regional Director of Education of the Ballarat region, Mr Dobell, raised various points in the summation of his report. In paragraph 4.2, headed 'Enrolment declines', he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> These need to be kept in perspective. In Victoria, net enrolments in the State School System were:</PARA>
<PARA>Year  1976-624,107 pupils</PARA>
<PARA>  1977-626,104 pupils</PARA>
<PARA>  1978-623,609 pupils</PARA>
<PARA>  1979-615,000 pupils</PARA>
<PARA> The small decline evident in those four years does not justify massive cuts in school building budgets. Maintenance costs for example remain almost unchanged. Likewise, in Victoria, in those years, annually many new classrooms, and schools had to be built to provide for population mobility. </PARA>
<PARA>In paragraph 4.4 of that report headed 'Sharing of Education Resources'-the suggestion to share these resources was put forward in an endeavour to try to overcome the paucity of classrooms, the paucity of equipment and the paucity of furniture within the Government system-he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Possibly, as government funds are increasingly allocated to private schools, much more positive consideration will need to be given to the sharing of these latter resources with government school communities. </PARA>
<PARA>So here is the Regional Director of the Ballarat region so concerned about the way in which the education system has been stood on its head in Victoria that he is now almost pleading for the government system students to be allowed to share the resources, the far better resources, that are being funded within the non-government sector of education. In his conclusion, paragraph 5, he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The decision to invite to today's meeting Federal members of Parliament whose electorates include portions of the Central Highlands Region was reached after much thought and wide consultation with, e.g. P.R.C. members; local State members of Parliament, school councillors from primary, secondary, special and technical schools; many parents of pupils in government schools. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Minister for Education, Hon. Wal Fife, M.H.R., and the Shadow Minister, Mr John Dawkins, M.H.R. were also invited when it became clear that the consensus of opinion, amongst those consulted, was that the currently alarming inadequacy of funding for government school building programs and site extensions was primarily due to the apparent diversion of funding, by the Federal Government, away from the State primary and post primary schools to other programs. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of today's meeting of parliamentarians and P.R.C. members is not in any way aligned with party politics. However, one of the R.D.E.'s key responsibilities is in the area of school buildings maintenance and upgrade. The continual decline in the funds available over the past five or six years for government school buildings, especially for maintenance works, can only be described as positively alarming. My purpose is to try to find ways of correcting this worrying situation. I am not in the least interested in political point scoring. But I am concerned about the welfare of our school system. It is essential that parliamentarians of all parties in both State and Federal spheres are shown unmistakably why government school building programs-and especially cyclic maintenance programs-have been virtually at a standstill in the Central Highlands Region, and elsewhere in Victoria, over the past twelve months. During most of that time regions have been largely constrained to initiate only critically urgent minor works necessitated by possible dangers to the health or safety of pupils and Staff. </PARA>
<PARA>At that very same meeting those of us who attended were shown films and slides of some 17 schools in the Ballarat region which could be described as being in exactly the same situation as the South Warrnambool State School I spoke of earlier-peeling paint, cracked boards, broken windows, leaking spouts, downpipes, rotting boards and filthy urinals because there was no way that people could keep them clean due to lack of maintenance over the year. There was a general state of decay in that region, as in other regions throughout Victoria so far as the State education system is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view this situation will not be alleviated while this Government continues to pour funds into elitist grammar schools which, as I said earlier, seem to be able to be obtained by elitist groups at the drop of a hat, particularly if they belong to some latter-day Christian minority group-holy rollers of some sort or other. I guess that most honourable senators today received in their mail an epistle from some gentleman from King River or Myrtleford or somewhere, who proposes capital punishment for every man and his dog. Is this sort of person going to be able to obtain funding from this Government to poke his brand of religion or Christianity, or whatever he likes to call it, down the throats of good Australians kids? God forbid that this can happen in a country that has been proud of its egalitarianism over the years and its secular approach to education. Shame on the day that a person such as that or any person like him, can get funds. In my view, it would be like funding Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin to fund people like this who want to poke some religious dogma down the throats of innocent kids and have them all marching off to war or whatever, clamouring for capital punishment, for the hanging of some poor innocent citizen who, through some misdemeanour, commits some crime against their ancient Judaean law of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. No, I have spoken long enough. I can only say that I am thoroughly ashamed. It is a great disgrace that that Government is prepared to pour out taxpayers' funds, as I have said so many times in the last half hour, for elitist groups in our community while all around us, certainly in my State, the education system is almost dead for the want of maintenance funding. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of the hour I direct my remarks only to the Non-government Schools (Loans Guarantee) Amendment Bill. This Bill will allow for a far more diversified education system but it really has very little relevance to the large non-government school system. It really provides loans to schools that cannot initially come up with the collateral to get a bank or other loan to build. The problem that governments face with this sort of funding is where to draw the line and the sort of criteria that they should be using when they allocate funds. Should there be no restriction to the variety of schools? If there is to be that sort of restriction, where does a government set the line of demarcation? In many other areas of policy governments have to come up with demarcation lines. When it comes to funding hospitals, many private hospitals would not get government funds. I daresay that the Government would take the attitude that not all hospitals that people would like to be set up would be allowed to be set up. In other words, if any of my colleagues here were to set up a naturopath hospital with herbal cures and everything else there would be very little chance of government funding. Similarly, if someone wanted to set up a private army in Australia I am sure that the Government would not say: 'It is part of the freedom of Australian citizens to set up their own private army and have government funding for it'. Unless they get funds from the Australian Film Commission I really cannot see how anyone could do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One disturbing trend that could relate to this Bill is the development of the various fundamentalist schools around Australia. It is not just sectarianism to say that many people in the community are concerned about the development of the fundamentalist schools. The Uniting Church in Australia, the Catholic Church and, in particular, many of the State school teachers have serious doubts about whether the Commonwealth Government or the State governments should be funding these types of schools. I really share their doubts. The Uniting Church has attacked the teaching methods used in many of these new fundamentalist Christian schools. In an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 15 October a Uniting Church report made the following points:</PARA>
<PARA> The report singles out the Accelerated Christian Education schools for its strongest comments. The group has 80 schools in Australia, 15 in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> The children in these schools spend up to four hours a day working in small cubicles on self-instructional material, which weave biblical texts into the lesson. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> If a child working in a cubicle wants help the child must hoist one of two flags-the 'Christian flag' brings the help of a qualified teacher, the Australian flag brings the help of a teachers' aide. </PARA>
<PARA>The article then deals with Accelerated Christian Education. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> ACE operates almost like a franchised American takeaway food chain. A slick audio-visual display sells the 'product'. </PARA>
<PARA>So we have Kentucky-fried education in parts of Australia. Mr Michael Norman, who led an investigation into the dramatic increase in small alternative schools since the mid-1970s, made the following point:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the teaching system is designed to fight the liberalism, modernism and secular humanism of the education systems in Western society. </PARA>
<PARA> It is done by feeding graded students, isolated in closed carrels, teaching material infused with fundamentalist religious ideas. </PARA>
<PARA>There has been some criticism from the various education departments throughout Australia about the methods being employed. For instance, the National Times states:</PARA>
<PARA> Registrar of the Victorian Council of Public Education, Mal Wilkinson, pointed out that Canaan College's curriculum was not considered broad enough, and that other factors about the running of the school had influenced the Council. </PARA>
<PARA>This related to registration or deregistration. I wish now to make some general comments on these schools and to state why I am rather disturbed by them. The first thing is that there is no interaction at all between teachers and students. There is not much point really, I believe, in having a teacher in the room if the teacher is there only to be called on for assistance occasionally. We have these large corrals, quite often with some sort of audio system. The students put on headphones and develop under these sorts of American-based programs. There is no interaction at all between the child and the teacher. I think that is a very disturbing trend in education. </PARA>
<PARA> But an even greater problem as far as I am concerned is that there is no social interaction in the classroom. One child is isolated from another child. Anyone who has taught in schools would realise that the teaching process and the education process are far more than just the teacher giving students work and that sort of interaction. It is most vital in the development of any child to learn how to relate to other children in the school. That is where in the main they develop their social skills. If that is taken away and children are put in isolation doing what is called self-development courses-perhaps of a biblical nature-we will get very isolated children growing up. This will cause great social problems in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect that disturbs me is that we have an Australian culture of which we should be proud. We talk about broadening it and including other matters. These courses are American designed wholly and solely. As with television and anything else, the children develop a sort of Americanised mentality. Whilst these schools are very popular, parent disillusionment tends to set in after two, three or four years. Many of the students are taken out of these fundamentalist Christian schools and put back into the State school system. This is where I have heard the most criticism. Many of the teachers who actually have to take over the teaching of these children find that their development is retarded by two or three year levels. They find that if they get 16-year-old students who have been in these schools for three, four or five years in actual fact they are equal to about second form or first form level in regard to education. </PARA>
<PARA> The final aspect that worries me is that I think many of the schools adopt methods very close to brain washing. For instance, at the Hare Krishna school in southern Queensland we have the following remark:</PARA>
<PARA> The Headmaster, Mr Pariksit Das, admits that the sole reason for the existence of the school is to 'brainwash' the 18 students aged from five to 12. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Of course we brainwash them', he said. 'We take their brains and wash them clean with the love of God.'</PARA>
<PARA>I will not comment on that last part but I am wondering where the Government is going to draw a line in funding these sorts of schools. The Non-government Schools (Loan Guarantee) Amendment Bill makes it much easier for these types of schools to start. It is true that State inspectors in each of the education systems have the right to deregister these types of schools or to put some sort of controls on them. But it must be understood that it is very difficult for these school inspectors to make a judgment about these schools. There is a good deal of social and other pressure on them not to take any action. There is a good deal of pressure on State education departments not to close any of the schools because of the likely voter backlash that eventually may effect the government in power, be it Labor or Liberal. </PARA>
<PARA> I am wondering what attitude the Government has and how far it is willing to take this funding. If the Communist Party of Australia decided to set up a school, would the Government fund that school? If the anarchists set up a school would the Government really want to fund that sort of school? The difficulty is-I do not pretend that a Labor government could confront it a lot better than a Liberal government-where one draws the line on these schools. I am not really trying to argue today just in favour of established religion. I am trying to cut out any of the minority religious groups. But I think the Government should try to confront the problem. The legislation before the Senate at the moment will only encourage proliferation of what I call these ratbag schools for their abysmal educational methods. I think we should have a look at that. It is not just a State responsibility to assess whether these schools are competent because Commonwealth funds are involved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has been debating by way of cognate debate five education Bills. One of those Bill seeks to provide as a response to the triennial report of the Tertiary Education Commission funds for universities, colleges and technical colleges. Another, in response to the Schools Commission, provides funds for schools. Two other Bills relate to fees in respect of the Australian National University and the Canberra College of Advanced Education. One other Bill relates to funds by way of loan guarantee to new schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has taken a general line. It has said, in effect-I do not think I am being uncharitable-that there has been a shrinking of funds to the institutions, that access to the institutions has shrunk and fewer people can get into them. In fact, Opposition members have repeated that only the affluent can now get into these institutions, that there is a fall-off in the numbers in these institutions and that elitism is setting in. They have gone on to criticise the loan guarantees. They have criticised the funding of non-government schools, claiming that that funding is for elitist schools. They have singled out the Non-government Schools (Loans Guarantee) Amendment Bill and they have singled out the proposed rationalisation. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all I will deal with the concept that there has been a contraction in funding of education because that is the first plank. In the 1981 calendar year, $2,827m was allocated for educational purposes. In constant money terms, with adjustments for inflation, $2,876m will be allocated for educational purposes in the 1982 calendar year. That is a significant gain of some $49m in real terms. So, in fact, the total money being spent on education has increased. But, lest one feel that the amount we are talking about is miserly, I point out, that this Government is allocating, in these five Bills, about $500 for each taxpayer in Australia. I do not think that any one taxpayer would think that miserly. That is the first dolly over. Rather than there being a shrinking of money, in real terms there has been an expansion. </PARA>
<PARA> Next I deal with the number of student enrolments. The situation is very interesting because the fact is that between 1980 and 1981 the number of students in universities and colleges of advanced education increased by 7,000. Where is the contraction in that figure? Seven thousand is a significant increase when one is looking at a movement towards a static and useful population. One has only to look at the enrolment projections of the Tertiary Education Commission to see whether there will be contractions or not. In 1979, 160,000 students, in round numbers, were enrolled at universities. In 1980, 162,500 were enrolled. The 1981 preliminary figures showed that 165,900 were enrolled. For the period 1982 to 1984 up to 166,000 students will be enrolled. So the Tertiary Education Commission says, in fact, that there will be an expansion. In fact, in 1979, 160,126 students were enrolled at colleges of advanced education. It is envisaged that in the period 1980 to 1984 between 168,000 and 172,000 students will be enrolled at colleges of advanced education. That is a very significant increase. Of course, in 1978, 620,514 students were enrolled at colleges of technical and further education. In 1980, 701,820 students were enrolled at TAFE colleges. So the second concept disappears completely. Rather than there being a shrinking either in the money spent on education or in the students enrolled, there has been an expansion. </PARA>
<PARA> A quaint argument being put tonight is that the so-called shrinking is due to the fact that there is an application of fees. There has been an attempt to compare Australia with overseas countries. First of all, that attempt is not a good one. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development figures for full time students aged 16 to 18 years show Australian figures are higher than those of the United Kingdom and West Germany. So that is another dolly over. More real money is spent on education and there has been a gain in student numbers. In fact in comparison with the rest of the world we have quite a respectable situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I look now at the comments that have been made that we are dealing only for the affluent. They are obviously wrong. There have been comments that we are denying access. They are obviously wrong. I open the papers each day and see universities and colleges advertising places for students. Invitations are being advertised for non-fee bearing courses day after day for people, including mature aged people. So, obviously, access is being invited in a much wider way. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the situations that has been a most unhappy one tonight, I think the most misrepresented and the unhappiest of the lot, has been the attempt to misrepresent entirely the state of affairs in state schools and in non-state schools, and an insinuation that non-government schools are elitist schools while state schools are poor schools. The important thing for us to remember is that we do have a Schools Commission-a body that makes the classifications as to which are the affluent schools and which are not. Let us examine the Schools Commission. First of all the Schools Commission says that although all government schools in the Australian system have well passed the targets set by Professor Karmel-I invite honourable senators to listen to this statement-eighty per cent of non-government schools continue to operate with resources some 30 per cent below the average resources of government schools. Of those schools that the Opposition senators are attacking, 80 per cent of them are 30 per cent below the resources of government schools, and those figures are cited by the Schools Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Again for those who are saying there ought not to be money for those schools, let us see what the Schools Commission says. It says, for example, that in 1979-80 money spent by State and Commonwealth governments to educate a student in a government school averaged $1790 a student and in a non-government school $770. The parents are equal taxpayers, and the parents and the children equal Australians. Where now is the justice that the Opposition is talking about? We must bear in mind that the classifications of these schools are made by an objective Schools Commission; the whole basis for the money being passed out is made by such a group. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we come to an interesting situation, an attack upon freedom of choice in the development of new schools. First of all, let me make this clear. No school can attract Commonwealth money until it passes the registration provisions of the State Government. In other words, the State Government, with its education standards set up, has first of all to certify that a school will carry out the curricula and the standards of education that it expects. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable senator wants to attack the individual States, let him do so. The second situation is this: No money can be passed by way of funds for building new schools unless the planning and finance committees of the various States look at the application and its validity and make a recommendation. Those committees comprise ordinary people drawn from the States and the communities. Ordinary people look at these things. They are not affluent people; they are not wealthy people at all. The Opposition attacks these planning and finance people by saying that they are making prejudiced judgments. Before money can go to one of these schools the State has to say: 'This school is a proper school within our concept of a school'. The planning and finance committee has to look at a school and say: 'This school is eligible for assistance'. It is a sad day in Australia when the Opposition seeks to deny the right of freedom of choice. It is not for any honourable senator here to sneer at any religion. That any honourable senator should sneer at any sect or religion because he or she does not like it is in fact a denial of the very principle for which this chamber stands. That is the very reason that it is repugnant to me to hear honourable senators saying such a thing. Voltaire said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the reason for the existence of the Senate. The situation is that we have established that there is more real money for education, more students coming into the education stream and a widening of the system altogether. It has been established that the Schools Commission has said that the state school system is making improvements much faster than non-government schools, that a body of people, not the Government, makes the recommendations as to the amount of money that shall go to individual schools, and that the States and the planning and finance committees make the recommendations in these things. These are the things that the Opposition has sneered at tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> I make it perfectly clear that, although the Government recognises the basic right of all parents to freedom of choice in education, it has no desire to encourage the growth of small alternative schools without the consideration of their educational philosophies and practices. At the request of the Australian Education Council, the Commonwealth has initiated a study of school registration procedures and issues for discussion with State officials and with non-government school authorities. I suppose the Opposition will widen its criticism to attack the Australian Education Council which sets the standards. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the criticism of the proposal to rationalise colleges, the fact is that it has been conveniently overlooked that the recommendation for rationalisation came from the Tertiary Education Commission. The recommendation that some 30 colleges be brought together came from the Tertiary Education Commission which saw the desirability that single purpose teaching institutions should not persist and that there should be an improvement not only in the administration but also in the general education of these colleges by their rationalisation and co-ordination. Those who sneer at this might well remember that the report of the Murray committee said very strongly in this regard that there was an irrefutable need for the development of a national policy for Australian universities. It said that there must be collaboration, co-operation and co-ordination between universities, the Commonwealth Government and the State governments if unnecessary duplication and wastage of scarce resources are to be avoided. The report continued in that vein. In other words, the Murray committee has laid down these principles. </PARA>
<PARA> That, in a nutshell, is the case. Senator Button referred to Queensland. He said that the Queensland Government had not agreed to the amalgamation of the James Cook University and the Townsville College of Advanced Education. I am advised that the Queensland Government has agreed to that amalgamation and that only seven of the 30 colleges of advanced education are outstanding at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will not accept the proposed amendments. The amendment proposed to the States Grants (Tertiary Assistance) Bill 1981 is in defiance of the concept of the Tertiary Education Commission. For example, I cannot believe that anyone would come forward with a straight face, having attacked the independent schools, and argue that the advancement of one sector of the Australian school system should not be at the disadvantage of another sector, whether public or private, as this would revive tensions. That came after a large part of tonight was spent attacking the private sector of education and the money spent on that. The disadvantaged side of education is the private sector. It does nobody any good to extend the propaganda that the independent schools are the elite and the Government schools are not. An amount of $1,790 of taxpayers money is spent a head on students at government schools and $770 a head is spent on non-government school students. That amount of money is decided on by an objective body, the Schools Commission, which was set up by the Whitlam Government. In the face of this and in the knowledge that we are bringing forward Bills expending enormous sums of money on education in Australia-an amount larger than the year before and widening the number of students coming into the system-I commend the Bills to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take a little of the time of the Senate, even at this stage of the night, to raise on the adjournment the matter of compensation for some Australians who were held in concentration camps during world War II. The Senate may be aware that some prisoners of war were held not in prisoner of war camps, as apparently was the legal requirement in war, but actually in concentration camps. This matter has not been finally settled. The Australians concerned have not been compensated for that action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer in particular to Walter Wise, an Australian Army private who was among a number of Australian, New Zealand and British servicemen who found themselves in Theresienstadt concentration camp in Czechoslovakia during the latter part of the Second World War. When he and others were taken there by the Gestapo in late 1944 they were taken underground to a cell which had just been vacated. The occupants had been shot to make room for the new prisoners. Walter wise was one of 88 prisoners held in a cell where the blood was still wet on the walls and floor. Apparently they took turns in standing and sleeping on the floor. There was no toilet and only one tap. During the day they were put to work moving earth with their bare hands. They were also made to clean out the cells of the dead Jews, collecting bodies on what was known as the morgue cart. They were punished for moving too slowly, grinning, failing to bow their heads when being spoken to and being caught asleep or unwashed. For those 'sins' they were placed on a low bench head down with someone sitting on the neck and another on the legs, and their bare buttocks were beaten with a stick with a metal spike on the end. This punishment was inflicted until the flesh was pulp and the prisoner passed out. It was in those conditions that Walter Wise and his mates spent seven months until 1 May 1945. </PARA>
<PARA> Walter Wise is now 65 and lives comfortably in Hobart, but those days in Theresienstadt have left their mark. They have had a dreadful psychological impact on him and others like him. Yet neither Walter Wise nor the other Australians who were held in German concentration camps have ever received one cent in compensation. They had to battle to get the Australian Government even to recognise that they spent time in those camps. Now any action seems to have stopped there. I do not like raising matters from so long ago or from war time, but the compensation should be provided. There is also the danger that the Federal Republic of Germany will call an end to compensating the victims of war crimes, but the Australian Government does not seem in the least concerned about that. It is only in recent years that this--</PARA>

Since then some action has slowly started to be taken. There has been lots of correspondence involving the Ombudsman and the Department of Foreign Affairs. The British victims of this illegal action were recognised by the Federal Republic of Germany in the 1960s when an Anglo-German agreement set up a fund. That is 20 years ago and the Australian vicitims of this breach of international law are still waiting, still hoping and still suffering from the emotional scars inflicted by the regime of Nazi Germany. What do they have to do to draw attention to the shabby treatment they have received? Is it not enough to make direct approaches to the relevant government departments and Opposition shadow Ministers and tell their stories of horror and terror through the news media? How can they make their cries heard?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The most recent event was in May 1980. The Department of Foreign Affairs informed Mr Wise that discussions were taking place with New Zealand about a joint approach to the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany. New Zealand indicated its willingness to make this approach. I want to know whether a final agreement was ever reached. </PARA>
<PARA> The present honourable member for Denison said at the time that he supported this joint approach, but did he ever take this up? Was he only grandstanding, seeking publicity? In June last year the then Minister for Foreign Affairs advised our former colleague, Ken Wriedt, that the Australian Government would definitely seek compensation for these ex-servicemen, but there the matter ended. Perhaps the only way to solve this problem is for an inquiry to be held into all Australian prisoners of war who, I believe, received only pitiful compensation soon after the War. If the Government cannot take action without some strong recommendations from such an inquiry, we had better have one fast because time is running out. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short letter from the Acting Deputy Ombudsman dated 23 May 1980 to Mr Wise which is the last correspondence about this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Since the Australian Legal Aid Office was established it has been a major concern that persons who have applied for assistance from, or to whom legal assistance is provided by, the Office should have the same privileges arising from the relationship between solicitor and client as they would have if dealing with private solicitors. Successive Attorneys-General have taken the view that, in ordinary circumstances, an applicant for legal aid has the right to have kept confidential not only the grant or refusal of aid but also the very fact that an application has been made.

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Consideration is being given to declaring certain areas within the Coral Sea Islands Territory as National Nature Reserves but no decision has yet been taken. One such area is the Coringa Herald Group, including North and South Magdelaine Cays and Chilcott and South-West Islets.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) I am aware that the reefs, sandy islets and cays within the area in which the Coral Sea Islands Territory Act applies are extremely fragile and that they provide important habitat for many types of seabirds and turtles that nest in the area. Many of the small cays are completely unvegetated and shift with prevailing winds. Other islets support trees, grasses and creepers. I am fully aware that severe cyclones could result in loss of protective covering on those islets.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Associated with ongoing research into structural change in rural industry, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics published in the May 1981 issue of the Quarterly Review of the Rural Economy an article dealing with the beef industry in the 1970s. In that particular article, the observation was made that there was a decline of almost 29 per cent in the number of beef-producing properties over the five years 1974-75 to 1978-79. The source of data for this particular study was the Australian Bureau of Statistics.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In that same period, there was a reduction of around 34,000 in the number of beef holdings with fewer than 200 head. The degree to which the operators of these properties were dependent on beef cattle, and the activities, rural or otherwise, to which they turned after leaving the industry, will only become apparent as further rural industry statistics become available.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In November and December 1980 the BAE conducted a telephone survey of producers in parts of Queensland and New South Wales considered to be drought-affected. The results of this survey were also published in the May issue of the BAE's Quarterly Review of the Rural Economy. In New South Wales, 34 per cent of beef producers contacted were reported as experiencing drought conditions sufficiently severe to make them contemplate the sale of above average numbers of cattle from their properties before June 1981. In Queensland, 25 per cent of producers contacted anticipated selling extra cattle because of drought. Seasonal conditions improved from May 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1980-81 total cattle slaughter in Australia was approximately 8.5 million head. Although this is around 4 per cent below the 1979-80 level it is likely that the decrease would have been substantially larger without the forced turn-off of cattle as a result of the drought.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 13 October 1981 (Hansard, page 1093) Senator Jones asked me a question without notice in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry in the Senate. The honourable senator's question was as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Does the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry recall that on 15 September in the other place during discussion on Estimates Committee D the Minister for Primary Industry, in reply to a question from the honourable member for Moore about the cost to taxpayers, consumers and exporters of maintaining a dual State-Commonwealth meat inspection system, quoted a figure of $5m.</PARA>
<PARA> How does the Minister reconcile the fact that on the following day, as recorded in the Senate Hansard, in reply to the same question as put in a question upon notice by me, he claimed that the estimated cost was only $1.25m.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The best estimate of the direct additional cost to the meat industry of the present dual State-Commonwealth meat inspection system is $1.25m.</PARA>
<PARA> This estimate was provided by the High Level Working Group on Meat Inspection in its report to the Standing Committee on Agriculture at the Darwin meeting on 29 July 1981. It represents the calculated savings that adoption of either of the two proposed options under discussion at that time may have produced had they been agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA> Upper estimates of costs to the Australian community have been put at $5m but would include all the components of meat inspection, charges and related animal health administration in Commonwealth and State governments. Many of these costs are inextricable from government administrations in the federal system but represent costs that could be attributed in some way to the dual system.</PARA>
